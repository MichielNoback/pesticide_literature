40160003	Harnessing CNC-Carrier Nanomaterials for Enhanced Zn<sup>2+</sup>-Mediated Inhibition of Oomycete Asexual Reproduction.	Oomycetes are devastating plant pathogens causing major crop losses, with spores as key infection sources. Inhibiting asexual reproduction, especially sporangium formation and spore release, is crucial for disease prevention. Zn<sup>2+</sup> has shown potential in inhibiting oomycete reproduction, but excessive concentrations can cause cytotoxicity and environmental risks. To address this, we used polydopamine (PDA) to complex Zn<sup>2+</sup> and form a PDA@Zn<sup>2+</sup> coating on cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) through hydrogen bonding. This ionic nanopesticide (CNC@PDA@Zn<sup>2+</sup>) enhances effectiveness against oomycetes while reducing dosage and improving biosafety. Bioexperimental results indicate that CNC@PDA@Zn<sup>2+</sup> significantly inhibits sporangium formation and spore release from <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> (<i>P. capsici</i>) by suppressing the expression of key sporulation genes (<i>PcATP4</i>, <i>cdc,</i> and <i>G-protein</i>), disrupting spore cell membranes, and altering organelle structures. <i>In vivo</i>, it reduces <i>P. capsici</i> infection on pepper leaves, even in the presence of mycelium. This study highlights CNC@PDA@Zn<sup>2+</sup> as a promising biobased nanomaterial for sustainable crop protection.	1	pesticide	harnessing cnc-carrier nanomaterials for enhanced zn<sup>2+</sup>-mediated inhibition of oomycete asexual reproduction.	oomycetes are devastating plant pathogens causing major crop losses, with spores as key infection sources. inhibiting asexual reproduction, especially sporangium formation and spore release, is crucial for disease prevention. zn<sup>2+</sup> has shown potential in inhibiting oomycete reproduction, but excessive concentrations can cause cytotoxicity and environmental risks. to address this, we used polydopamine (pda) to complex zn<sup>2+</sup> and form a pda@zn<sup>2+</sup> coating on cellulose nanocrystals (cncs) through hydrogen bonding. this ionic nanopesticide (cnc@pda@zn<sup>2+</sup>) enhances effectiveness against oomycetes while reducing dosage and improving biosafety. bioexperimental results indicate that cnc@pda@zn<sup>2+</sup> significantly inhibits sporangium formation and spore release from <i>phytophthora capsici</i> (<i>p. capsici</i>) by suppressing the expression of key sporulation genes (<i>pcatp4</i>, <i>cdc,</i> and <i>g-protein</i>), disrupting spore cell membranes, and altering organelle structures. <i>in vivo</i>, it reduces <i>p. capsici</i> infection on pepper leaves, even in the presence of mycelium. this study highlights cnc@pda@zn<sup>2+</sup> as a promising biobased nanomaterial for sustainable crop protection.	0.0
40211589	Design, Synthesis, and Anti-Oomycete and Antifungal Activities of Novel Paeonol Derivatives Containing a Pyrazole Ring.	Paeonol is the main active ingredient in the Chinese medicinal herb peony root bark. To discover biorational natural product-based fungicides, 25 paeonol derivatives (<b>5a</b>-<b>y</b>) containing a pyrazole ring were designed and synthesized by ingeniously introducing a pyrazole five-membered heterocyclic ring, and their structures were well characterized by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS), and m.p. The stereochemical configurations of six target compounds, <b>5c</b>, <b>5f</b>, <b>5g</b>, <b>5o</b>, <b>5s</b>, and <b>5v</b>, were unambiguously subjected to single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, we evaluated the bioactivities of these target compounds as anti-oomycete and antifungal agents against two serious agricultural diseases, <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> and <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. Among all tested compounds, (1) nine compounds <b>5b</b>-<b>d</b>, <b>5f</b>, <b>5g</b>, <b>5r</b>, <b>5s</b>, <b>5u</b>, <b>5w</b> displayed promising anti-oomycete against <i>P. capsici</i>, with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 22.1 to 34.5 mg/L, and the protective effect of the target compounds against <i>P. capsici</i> <i>in vivo</i> further confirmed the above results. (2) Six compounds <b>5g</b>, <b>5k</b>, <b>5m</b>, <b>5t</b>, <b>5w</b>, <b>5x</b> displayed promising antifungal against <i>F. graminearum</i>, with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 38.2 to 86.0 mg/L. Moreover, some interesting results of structure-activity relationships were also observed. The results of this study pave the way for further design, synthesis, and development of paeonol derivatives as potential botanical anti-oomycete and antifungal agents in crop protection.	1	pesticide	design, synthesis, and anti-oomycete and antifungal activities of novel paeonol derivatives containing a pyrazole ring.	paeonol is the main active ingredient in the chinese medicinal herb peony root bark. to discover biorational natural product-based fungicides, 25 paeonol derivatives (<b>5a</b>-<b>y</b>) containing a pyrazole ring were designed and synthesized by ingeniously introducing a pyrazole five-membered heterocyclic ring, and their structures were well characterized by <sup>1</sup>h nmr, <sup>13</sup>c nmr, high-resolution mass spectrometer (hrms), and m.p. the stereochemical configurations of six target compounds, <b>5c</b>, <b>5f</b>, <b>5g</b>, <b>5o</b>, <b>5s</b>, and <b>5v</b>, were unambiguously subjected to single-crystal x-ray diffraction. furthermore, we evaluated the bioactivities of these target compounds as anti-oomycete and antifungal agents against two serious agricultural diseases, <i>phytophthora capsici</i> and <i>fusarium graminearum</i>. among all tested compounds, (1) nine compounds <b>5b</b>-<b>d</b>, <b>5f</b>, <b>5g</b>, <b>5r</b>, <b>5s</b>, <b>5u</b>, <b>5w</b> displayed promising anti-oomycete against <i>p. capsici</i>, with ec<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 22.1 to 34.5 mg/l, and the protective effect of the target compounds against <i>p. capsici</i> <i>in vivo</i> further confirmed the above results.

40138468	Host Defense Peptide-Mimicking Poly(2-oxazoline)s Displaying Potent Activities toward Phytopathogens to Alleviate Antimicrobial Resistance in Agriculture.	Given the limited types of agricultural bactericides and the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance, bacterial plant diseases pose a serious threat to agricultural production, which calls for effective antimicrobial agents with a low propensity for resistance. Host defense peptides (HDPs) have drawn significant attention for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, we found that HPD-mimicking poly(2-oxazoline) Gly-POX<sub>20</sub> exhibits potent activity against bacterial phytopathogens, with superior antibacterial selectivity and proteolytic stability compared to the natural HDP melittin. Compared to commonly used agricultural bactericides, Gly-POX<sub>20</sub> displays more efficient antibiofilm activity and a lower propensity for resistance than does the antibiotic streptomycin, likely due to its antibacterial mechanism, which involves DNA interaction and generating lethal doses of ROS. <i>In vivo</i> studies reveal that Gly-POX<sub>20</sub> is effective in preventing and treating phytopathogens without observable damage to plant tissues, suggesting that poly(2-oxazoline) could be a promising bactericide for agricultural applications.	1	pesticide	host defense peptide-mimicking poly(2-oxazoline)s displaying potent activities toward phytopathogens to alleviate antimicrobial resistance in agriculture.	given the limited types of agricultural bactericides and the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance, bacterial plant diseases pose a serious threat to agricultural production, which calls for effective antimicrobial agents with a low propensity for resistance. host defense peptides (hdps) have drawn significant attention for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, we found that hpd-mimicking poly(2-oxazoline) gly-pox<sub>20</sub> exhibits potent activity against bacterial phytopathogens, with superior antibacterial selectivity and proteolytic stability compared to the natural hdp melittin. compared to commonly used agricultural bactericides, gly-pox<sub>20</sub> displays more efficient antibiofilm activity and a lower propensity for resistance than does the antibiotic streptomycin, likely due to its antibacterial mechanism, which involves dna interaction and generating lethal doses of ros. <i>in vivo</i> studies reveal that gly-pox<sub>20</sub> is effective in preventing and treating phytopathogens without observable damage to plant tissues, suggesting that poly(2-oxazoline) could be a promising bactericide for agricultural applications.	0.0
