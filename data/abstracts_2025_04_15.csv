40229925	Arteriovenous Thrombosis among Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infected Patients: An Observational Study at a University Hospital.	The global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 since its emergence in 2019 has led to widespread challenges in healthcare, prompting the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic.
40229924	A Prospective Clinical Audit into the Management of Postoperative Pain in the Postanesthesia Care Unit of a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital in Coastal Karnataka, India.	Clinical audit forms part of clinical governance, which aims to ensure that patients receive the best quality of care. Optimizing pain management in recovery involves measuring a range of processes and outcome indicators. Reducing acute pain improves patient outcomes and reduces chronic postsurgical pain incidence.
40229923	Distribution of Alprazolam Into the Milk of Lactating Mares and Subsequent Absorption by Nursing Foals.	Alprazolam is used to facilitate mare-foal bonding in aggressive or anxious postpartum mares. In humans, alprazolam crosses the blood-milk barrier, but the amount transferred into milk is minor and compatible with breastfeeding as the relative infant dose is < 10%. Similar data are not available for horses. The aim of this study was to measure alprazolam in serum and milk of mares (milk: serum ratio) administered alprazolam, and to determine alprazolam serum concentrations in nursing foals to estimate the extent of absorption. This was a prospective observational study involving 7 healthy postpartum mares and foals. Mares received alprazolam (0.04 mg/kg PO, q12h) for 6 days. Venous blood and milk samples were collected on days 3,4,5 and 6, just before the next dose, and were used to calculate milk: serum ratios and estimate the extent of absorption of alprazolam by foals. A validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay was used to measure alprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. There were no significant differences in concentrations of alprazolam or α-hydroxyalprazolam in mare serum, milk, or foal serum over time, consistent with steady state and a lack of accumulation. Milk:serum ratios were similar to slightly higher than those reported in humans (median: 0.64; range: 0.42-3.0). Relative foal dose (RFD) based on 12 h concentrations was < 10% in all foals and in 96% of total samples. Foal serum concentrations of alprazolam were 6.6% ± 4.1% of those in mare serum at the same time points. This study shows that milk:serum ratios of alprazolam in mares are variable. Foal serum concentrations and RFD suggest that alprazolam is safe for use in mares with nursing foals.
40229921	Diagnostic Accuracy of Adenosine Deaminase Levels in Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte of Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis.	Tuberculosis (TB) is a well-known global health problem with one-fifth of the global burden in India. Although there are diagnostic and prognostic markers for TB, there is lack of specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic methods.
40229920	Diagnostic Accuracy of the Serum-free Androgen Index in Diagnosing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the free androgen index (FAI) in diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
40229919	An Anesthetic Management of Takayasu Arteritis with Aortic Regurgitation in a Parturient Posted for Cesarean Section.	Takayasu arteritis is an idiopathic, chronic, and inflammatory condition that mostly affects the aorta and its branches. Nearly 80% of occurrences involve females who are in their reproductive years. Although there is no effect on the disease's progression during pregnancy, these patients should be monitored for blood pressure (BP) changes and restricted intrauterine growth because they can develop complications such as hypertension, multiple organ dysfunction, and stenosis that reduces regional blood flow. Anesthetic implications of Takayasu arteritis include uncontrolled hypertension, maintenance of mean arterial pressure which is adequate to maintain end organ function, difficulty in monitoring of arterial pressure and tight maintenance of fluid regime.
40229917	Hydride-Richest Molecular Complex: Ligand-Length Facilitated Cu40H38 Nanoclusters Exhibiting High Catalytic Performance for Selective Hydrogenation.	Copper hydride clusters are extensively studied for their significant potential catalysis. Although clusters with a high hydride content are particularly intriguing, they present considerable synthetic challenges. Herein, we report two copper hydride clusters, Cu18H16 and Cu40H38, which exhibit similar layered structures and components, albeit differing in size. The larger-sized Cu40H38 with more hydrides was achieved through ligand-length modulation by replacing 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) in synthesis of Cu18H16 with 1,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane (dpppe). Cu40H38 is remarkable for i) the highest number of hydrides among known molecular compounds, ii) the highest number of unligated copper atoms and the highest metal-to-ligand ratio in copper hydride clusters. Moreover, catalytic studies on the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds demonstrate that Cu40H38 is a promising catalyst and provide clear structural evidence that a less sterically hindered cluster surface, with a high metal-to-ligand ratio, is beneficial for high-performance catalysis. The findings highlight the importance of surface composition and ligand coverage in catalytic efficiency and offer new avenues for designing high-performance copper hydride cluster catalysts.
40229916	Organic Cation Modulation in Hybrid Zirconium Halides for High-Performance Flexible X-ray Imaging.	Exploiting novel materials featuring high-quality zero-dimensional structure, remarkable lattice stability, and minimal defects represents an efficacious strategy for enhancing the detection performance of X-ray scintillators. Here, we design and synthesize two novel, lead-free, zirconium-based zero-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs), C14H40N4ZrCl8 and C6H16N2ZrCl6. Based on the steric hindrance effect of organic cations, the distance between [ZrCl6]2- polyhedra was designed and the electronic coupling interactions among polyhedra were adjusted, thus precisely engineering excellent zero-dimensional materials. Simultaneously, the stronger N-H+···Cl- (interstitial) bond is introduced to avoid structural instabilities and more defects due to the bigger organic cation in C14H40N4ZrCl8. As expected, C14H40N4ZrCl8 exhibits more remarkable luminescence behavior compared to C6H16N2ZrCl6 when excited by UV light and X-rays. The photophysics process involving self-trapped excitons and defects is elaborately expounded using first-principles calculations, luminescence properties, and stabilities. Finally, a flexible and large-area scintillation screen with a size of up to 200×100 mm2 based on C14H40N4ZrCl8 is fabricated and attains a high spatial resolution of 21.35 lp mm-1 and a lower limit of detection of 2.270 μGyair s-1, outperforming the resolution of most blue-emitting scintillation screens. These results imply that the zirconium-based OIMHs possess significant potential applications for medical diagnostics, security scanning, and non-destructive testing.
40229915	Study of Sleep Problem in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Its Impact on Disease Activity, Pain Perception, and Functional Disability.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disease, causes joint pain and impairment and affects sleep. Sleep disturbances in RA patients can exacerbate pain perception, disease activity, and functional impairment and reduce quality of life. Sleep problems in RA patients, especially in rural areas, have rarely been studied.
40229914	"The Calm between the Storms:" Perioperative Management of a Patient with Pheochromocytoma in Catecholamine Crisis.	Pheochromocytoma (PCC) is a catecholamine-secreting tumor that originates from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Anesthetic management of PCC can be challenging due to hemodynamic fluctuations. Thorough preoperative evaluation and optimization, meticulous intraoperative management and good communication between surgeon and anesthetist are crucial for patient safety. This is a case report of successful perioperative management of patient with PCC posted for laparoscopic adrenalectomy; where the patient developed catecholamine crisis in the immediate preoperative period, making the perioperative management even more challenging due to widely fluctuating hemodynamics.
40229913	Current and future habitat suitability of northern fur seals and overlap with the commercial walleye pollock fishery in the eastern Bering Sea.	Understanding the abiotic and biotic drivers of species distribution is critical for climate-informed ecosystem management. We aimed to understand habitat selection of northern fur seals in the eastern Bering Sea, a declining population that is also a key predator of walleye pollock, the target species for the largest U.S. commercial fishery.
40229912	Mpox-related stigma and healthcare-seeking behavior among men who have sex with men.	The 2022 global mpox outbreak highlighted significant public health challenges, with men who have sex with men (MSM) accounting for 86.7% of confirmed cases. As a high-risk group, MSM faced not only the direct health impacts of mpox but also an additional burden of stigma and discrimination, which severely hindered their willingness to seek care and access timely medical services. This article explores mpox-related stigma and discrimination and their profound impact on healthcare-seeking behaviors among MSM, drawing on evidence from global studies. We examine how stigma affects individual decision-making and has broader public health implications by exacerbating healthcare delays during the outbreak. In response, we propose actionable strategies to mitigate stigma, including providing accurate and responsible communication, strengthening community and social support network, building capacity for frontline workers, and engaging affected individuals for effective intervention. By integrating stigma-reduction measures into pandemic preparedness and response, public health systems can better support vulnerable populations, improve healthcare access, and ensure a more effective response to future outbreaks.
40229911	Our tools redefine what it means to be us: perceived robotic agency decreases the importance of agency in humanity.	Past work has primarily focused on how the perception of robotic agency influences human-robot interaction and the evaluation of robotic progress, while overlooking its impact on reconsidering what it means to be human. Drawing on social identity theory, we proposed that perceived robotic agency diminishes the importance of agency in humanity. We conducted three experiments (N = 920) to test this assumption. Experiments 1 and 2 manipulated perceived robotic agency. Experiments 2 and 3 separately measured and manipulated distinctiveness threat to investigate the underlying mechanism. Results revealed that high (vs. low) perceived robotic agency reduced ratings of the essentiality of agency in defining humanity (Experiments 1 and 2); distinctiveness threat accounted for this effect (Experiments 2 and 3). The findings contribute to a novel understanding of how ascriptions of humanity are evolving in the AI era.
40229910	Reaching the unreachable: a mixed-method evaluation of multidimensional healthcare model addressing the healthcare service gaps in hard-to-reach Northern riverine Bangladesh.	Hard-to-reach riverine communities of northern Bangladesh face unique challenges in healthcare services. Friendship, an international social purpose organization, implemented a 3-tier healthcare model addressing these unique challenges over the past 20 years. This study evaluated Friendship's 3-tier healthcare model in the northern riverine area, assessing service-seeking practices, experiences, stakeholders' perceptions, and cost benefits for beneficiaries.
40229908	Extracellular vesicle-derived miRNA-mediated cell-cell communication inference for single-cell transcriptomic data with miRTalk.	MicroRNAs are released from cells in extracellular vesicles (EVs), representing an essential mode of cell-cell communication (CCC) via a regulatory effect on gene expression. Single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies have ushered in an era of elucidating CCC at single-cell resolution. Herein, we present miRTalk, a pioneering approach for inferring CCC mediated by EV-derived miRNA-target interactions (MiTIs). The benchmarking against simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates the superior performance of miRTalk, and the application to four disease scenarios reveals the in-depth MiTI-mediated CCC mechanisms. Collectively, miRTalk can infer EV-derived MiTI-mediated CCC with scRNA-seq data, providing new insights into the intercellular dynamics of biological processes.
40229907	Resting-state blink rate does not increase following very-light-intensity exercise, but individual variation predicts executive function enhancement levels.	Acute physical exercise, even at a very-light-intensity, potentiates prefrontal cortex activation and improves executive function. The underlying circuit mechanisms in the brain remain poorly understood, though we speculate a potential involvement of arousal-related neuromodulatory systems. Recently, our rodent study demonstrated that exercise, even at light-intensity, activates the midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Resting-state spontaneous eye blink rate is linked to brain-arousal neural circuits, and potentially to those modulated by dopaminergic system. We hypothesized that neural substrates linked to resting-state eye blink rate contribute to the cognitive impact of acute very-light-intensity exercise.
40229905	Post-cleavage target residence determines asymmetry in non-homologous end joining of Cas12a-induced DNA double strand breaks.	After Cas12a cleaves its DNA target, it generates a DNA double strand break (DSB) with two compatible 5'-staggered ends. The Cas12a-gRNA complex remains at the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-proximal end (PPE) while releasing the PAM-distal end (PDE). The effects of this asymmetric retention on DSB repair are currently unknown.
40229904	IL1RAP is an immunotherapeutic target for normal karyotype triple-mutated acute myeloid leukemia.	Surface antigens of potential clinical significance remain under-characterized in AML. The European Leukemia Network classifies normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) mutated for NPM1 (NPM1c) as a distinct entity associated with favorable outcomes if not associated with FLT3-ITD mutation. A subset of NPM1c NK-AML shows additional mutations in 2 genes: FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) and DNMT3 A. These leukemias, also referred to as NK triple mutated AML (NKt-AML), are particularly difficult to eradicate with current treatment options. Therefore, novel therapies are necessary that use proteins specifically expressed at the surface.
40229903	Protein C in adult patients with sepsis: from pathophysiology to monitoring and supplementation.	Protein C (PC) plays a crucial role in modulating inflammation and coagulation in sepsis. Its anticoagulant and cytoprotective properties are critical in mitigating sepsis-induced coagulopathy, which is associated with high mortality rates. In sepsis, low levels of PC are associated with an elevated risk of multiple organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Routine monitoring of PC levels is not widely implemented but appears relevant in selected populations, such as patients with purpura fulminans, sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) or hyperinflammatory septic shock phenotypes. Treatment with PC has been limited to PC concentrate approved for paediatric use in congenital PC deficiencies and purpura fulminans, while the efficacy of PC supplementation in sepsis remains a subject of debate. Considering the physiological significance of PC and its role in sepsis pathophysiology, additional studies are necessary to fully elucidate its therapeutic efficacy in specific clinical settings.
40229902	Sevoflurane reduces cardiomyocyte injury in a hypoxia/reoxygenation model of cardiomyocytes through the linc01278/miR-134-5pt regulatory axis.	Ischemia-reperfusion leads to varying degrees of myocardial cell injury. Notably, long noncoding RNA was associated with the protective effect of sevoflurane (Sev) preconditioning against myocardial ischemic injury. Therefore, we further investigated the protective mechanism of Sev-mediated linc01278 against damaged cardiomyocytes by constructing a hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) model of cardiomyocytes.
40229901	Understanding local determinants of dengue: a geographically weighted panel regression approach in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.	Dengue remains a major public health concern in tropical regions, including Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Understanding its spatiotemporal patterns and determinants is crucial for effective prevention strategies. This study explores the spatiotemporal determinants of dengue incidence and evaluates the spatial variability of predictors using a geographically weighted panel regression (GWPR) approach.
40229900	Safety of Credelio Quattro™ (lotilaner, moxidectin, praziquantel, and pyrantel chewable tablets) in dogs infected with adult heartworms (Dirofilaria immitis).	Credelio Quattro (lotilaner, moxidectin, praziquantel, and pyrantel chewable tablets) is a novel endectocide for monthly oral administration in dogs. The safety of Credelio Quattro was investigated in dogs with pre-existing patent heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) infections. Heartworm preventive products are tested in heartworm-positive dogs as rapid microfilarial and adult worm death can lead to serious clinical reactions, including death.
40229899	Bi-allelic variants in BRF2 are associated with perinatal death and craniofacial anomalies.	Variants in genes encoding multiple subunits of the RNA Polymerase III complex which synthesizes rRNAs, tRNAs, and other small RNAs were previously associated with neurological disorders, such as syndromic hypomyelination leukodystrophies, pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and cerebellofaciodental syndrome. One new such candidate is BRF2, which encodes a TFIIB-like factor that recruits the RNA polymerase III complex to type 3 promoters to initiate transcription of U6, RnaseP, and 7SK RNAs.
40229898	IgA vasculitis associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.	IgA vasculitis is a predominantly pediatric autoimmune disease characterized by IgA deposit in small vessels. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare hematological malignancy classified within myelodysplastic syndromes. Here, we present a previously unrecognized case of CMML associated with IgA vasculitis. A 62-year-old woman presented with necrotic and infiltrated purpura and mild arthralgia, primarily affecting the knees and wrists, without gastrointestinal or kidney involvement. A comprehensive screening for other etiologies was unremarkable. Blood tests showed an increase of monocyte count and circulating monocyte phenotyping was consistent with CMML. Bone marrow analysis showed no blast cells or karyotypic abnormalities. Genetic testing identified an NRAS mutation. Autoantibody screening and viral serologies were negative. A skin biopsy revealed small-vessel vasculitis with IgA immune deposits. CMML can be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as polyarteritis nodosa and cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. However, this is the first report of IgA vasculitis occurring in the context of low risk CMML.
40229897	Profile of the PLAY spaces & environments for children's physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep (PLAYCE) cohort study, Western Australia.	Childhood is a critical period for the development of movement behaviours such as physical activity, sleep and sedentary behaviour. The PLAYCE Cohort was established to investigate how movement behaviours change over early to middle childhood, across key behaviour settings and relationships with health and development. An overview of the PLAYCE cohort, summary of key findings to date, and future research opportunities are presented.
40229894	Associations between life stress and athlete burnout: the chain mediation role of mindfulness and cognitive emotion regulation strategies.	Athlete burnout, characterized by emotional and physical exhaustion, reduced accomplishment, and devaluation of sport, is a growing concern in sports psychology. Life stress has been identified as a significant factor associated with athlete burnout, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study explores the relationship between life stress and athlete burnout, with a focus on the chain mediation roles of mindfulness and cognitive emotion regulation strategies.
40229893	Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes: an emerging therapeutic strategy for hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.	Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) severely threatens the success rates of liver surgery and transplantation. Its complex pathological process involves multiple factors such as oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and ferroptosis, creating an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are emerging as a next-generation acellular therapeutic approach. With their outstanding immune-regulatory capabilities, significant reparative functions, and good biocompatibility, they are leading innovations in the field of HIRI treatment. This article provides a systematic comparison of the therapeutic characteristics of MSC-derived exosomes(MSC-EXOs) from four different sources: adipose tissue, bone marrow, umbilical cord, and induced pluripotent stem cells. Although the clinical translation of MSC-EXOs still faces challenges such as variations in isolation methods, large-scale production, and safety assessments, their remarkable therapeutic effects and vast application potential signal the arrival of a new era of precision treatment for HIRI. This review not only provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation to promote the clinical application of MSC-EXOs but also opens up innovative research directions in the field of regenerative medicine.
40229892	Ischemic stroke as a presenting feature of neurosyphilis in an immunocompetent adult and attained complete recovery following treatment: a case report and review of the literature.	Neurosyphilis typically presents with nonspecific symptoms such as behavioral changes or cognitive impairment, rather than an initial stroke.
40229891	Core functions and forms in home-delivered meal programs: a stakeholder-driven approach to identifying essential practices.	The rapid growth of the aging population underscores the need for programs tailored to older adults' complex health needs. Home-delivered meal programs are critical, providing nutrition and socialization support to older adults with greatest economic and social need. However, variations in local implementation complicate our understanding of how specific program practices influence older adult outcomes. This present study applies the core functions and forms framework to identify and prioritize essential home-delivered meal practices-or forms-that can be replicated by other meal programs.
40229890	Fluid balance and outcome in cardiac arrest patients admitted to intensive care unit.	Although shock following cardiac arrest is common and contributes significantly to mortality, the influence of the modalities used to manage the hemodynamic situation, particularly with regard to fluid balance, remains unclear. We evaluated the association between positive fluid balance and outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
40229887	Reactive astrocyte-derived exosomes enhance intracranial lymphatic drainage in mice after intracranial hemorrhage.	After intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), the formation of primary hematoma foci leads to the development of secondary brain injury factors such as perihematomal edema (PHE) and accumulation of toxic metabolites, which severely affect the survival and prognosis of patients. The intracerebral lymphatic system, proposed by Jeffrey J. Iliff et al., plays an important role in central nervous system (CNS) fluid homeostasis and waste removal, while reactive astrocyte-derived exosomes have shown therapeutic potential in CNS disorders. Our study focuses on the effects of hemin-treated reactive astrocyte-derived exosomes on the functional integrity of the glymphatic system (GLS) after ICH and their potential mechanism of action in repairing brain injury.
40229886	Sports injury risk assessment based on a training and functional movement analysis of young elite equestrian athletes- an exploratory cross-sectional study.	Dressage and show jumping is a high-risk sport, especially for young and professional riders.
40229885	Zinc sulphate attenuates metabolic dysfunctions induced by olanzapine via the reduction of insulin resistance, hepatic oxidative stress, and inflammation in albino rats.	Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, is used to treat psychological diseases. However, it's use carries common side effects. Those include weight gain, dyslipidemia, elevated glucose levels, and disrupted oxidative balance. We aimed to test the effect of zinc coadministration to lessen metabolic disturbances, inflammation and oxidative stress in a rat model. Four treatment groups (n = 6) were involved in this investigation. Group 1 was the control group (received no intervention). Group 2 received olanzapine (10 mg/kg, p.o.; daily) for six weeks, whereas Groups 3 and 4 received 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of zinc sulphate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>,p.o.; daily) respectively, in addition to olanzapine (10 mg/kg p.o.; daily). Following treatment completion, group 2 showed increased levels of stress markers (GSSG, MDA, and NO) and impaired levels of antioxidant markers (CAT, SOD, and GSH). Further, a strong positive correlation between insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and IL-6, TNF-α, and MDA of liver. Insulin resistance is a possible manifestation of the oxidative stress burden and the widespread inflammatory environment. In groups 3 and 4, however, ZnSO<sub>4</sub> recovered each of these markers in a dose-dependent manner. Improvements were also noted in other homeostatic markers, such as taurine, coenzyme Q10, ascorbic acid, and vitamin E. Remarkably, in both combination groups, there was a significant improvement in all metabolic indicators of dyslipidemia (triglycerides, total cholesterol) and insulin resistance index. The biochemical study and the histological assessment of the liver slices agreed with the results. Thus, the results clearly suggest that Zinc supplementation can significantly improve oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolic perturbation (dyslipidemia and insulin resistance), and liver injury caused by olanzapine in Albino rats.
40229884	Systematic identification of disease-causing promoter and untranslated region variants in 8040 undiagnosed individuals with rare disease.	Both promoters and untranslated regions (UTRs) have critical regulatory roles, yet variants in these regions are largely excluded from clinical genetic testing due to difficulty in interpreting pathogenicity. The extent to which these regions may harbour diagnoses for individuals with rare disease is currently unknown.
40229881	Defining the LH surge in natural cycle frozen-thawed embryo transfer: the role of LH, estradiol, and progesterone.	Several replacement protocols for frozen-thawed ET (FET) exist, with no advantage of one protocol over the others. In the present retrospective and observational study we aim to evaluate the hormonal changes round the LH surge, for better determination of the LH surge and improving the NC FET outcome. We reviewed the computerized files of all consecutive women admitted to our IVF Institute, between January 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024, who underwent NC FET cycles in our IVF Institute. The elimination of bias in this selection, for the purposes of this study, was achieved by including only patients who had two consecutive hormonal blood tests and transvaginal ultrasound evaluations prior to ovulation, on two days (D- 2) before and one day before ovulation (D- 1). Data on patient demographics and infertility-treatment-related variables were collected from the files. We studied and compared several variable between patients who conceived and those who did not, including the % changes in LH (D- 1 minus D- 2/D- 2), in estradiol (D- 2 minus D- 1/D- 2) and % change in progesterone (D- 1 minus D- 2/D- 2) levels.
40229880	Physicians' views of the use of morphine in palliative care: a cross-sectional survey from a tertiary care centre in Northern Sri Lanka.	Palliative care is not readily available in many lower middle-income countries and Sri Lanka is not an exemption for this. Morphine is one of the key drug available for symptoms (pain and dyspnoea) alleviation among palliative care patients. However, due to various reasons, it was noted that morphine drug was underutilised in palliation. No studies have been done to identify reasons for underutilisation in Northern Sri Lanka. As such, this study attempts to identify factors that limit the usage of morphine in palliative care among physicians working at Teaching Hospital, Jaffna.

40229878	A psycho-behavioral perspective research for elderly leisure sports participation via big-data and comparative analyses.	The health of the elderly and the need for research to support them has never been more important. This study aims (a) to analyze the participation behavior of the elderly in leisure sports through big-data analysis and (b) to compare and analyze the motivations, limitations, and satisfaction of participation in leisure sports by age group.
40229876	Serious psychological distress among slum dwellers and unhoused people in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam: a pilot study.	Mental health is reported to be a significant issue among slum dwellers and unhoused (homeless) individuals worldwide, particularly those facing housing instability. Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city and industrial hub of Vietnam, has a substantial population experiencing housing instability, although its exact scale has rarely been accurately measured. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of serious psychological distress among slum dwellers and unhoused individuals in Ho Chi Minh City and to identify factors associated with serious psychological distress.
40229873	Exploring the influence of endometritis diagnostic criteria on uterine involution, milk yield and fertility in dairy cows.	We investigated the impact of different classification schemes for postpartum uterine disease on genital tract involution, milk yield, and reproductive performance in dairy cows. The reproductive tracts of 223 Polish Holstein cows were examined between 21 and 29 days postpartum (median 24 days). Transrectal ultrasonography was employed to assess reproductive tract dimensions, vaginoscopy was used for visual scoring of vaginal discharge, and endometrial cytology with the cytobrush was used to calculate the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). The health status of the cows was classified using two diagnostics models. Model 1 categorized cows as healthy (H; <5% PMN and absence of purulent vaginal discharge [PVD0]), subclinical endometritis (SE; ≥5% PMN and PVD0), and further subdivided PVD into three categories: flecks of pus in vaginal discharge (PVD1), mucopurulent discharge (PVD2), or purulent discharge including red-brownish watery fetid discharge (PVD3), irrespective of endometrial PMN%. Model 2 classified cows as healthy (H; <5% PMN and PVD0), subclinical endometritis (SE; ≥5% PMN and ≤ PVD1), and clinical endometritis (CE; ≥5% PMN and > PVD1).

40229870	Open-access healthcare debriefing videos need to incorporate more Safety-II learnings.	Patient safety science and debriefing approaches have historically tended to focus most heavily on Safety-I or "why things go wrong" and learning from unfavorable performance, root cause of adverse outcomes, and improvement opportunities learned from failures. Consequently, rich opportunities for analysis and learning from "why things go right," successful performance, and exploration of how systems succeed, adapt, and perform effectively regardless of outcome-Safety-II-are often underrepresented.
40229868	Promoting iron folic acid consumption using social norms as a mechanism of change in the Reduction in Anemia through Normative Innovations (RANI) project: a randomized controlled trial.	More than 60% of women of reproductive age in Odisha, India are anemic. The national long-term efforts in reducing anemia have focused mostly on the supply side, with a paucity of campaigns on the demand side. Social norms serve as significant determinants of human behavior, but there are few interventions that adopt a social-norms approach to reducing anemia. An intervention was implemented to change descriptive, injunctive, and collective social norms to improve iron folic acid consumption behaviors among women of reproductive age.
40229867	Planning intensive care unit admission after elective major abdominal surgery: good clinical practice document by SIAARTI-SIC-ANIARTI.	Postoperative complications (PCs) are a major cause of mortality following elective major abdominal surgery (EMAS). The increasing complexity of abdominal procedures, particularly in oncology, may significantly affect patient outcomes. However, this has also introduced a higher variability in postoperative management, and the use of tailored approaches to address critical issues such as hemodynamic stabilization, infection management, and respiratory failure. While elective admission to intensive care units (ICU) is a standard practice to manage high-risk surgical patients, ICU resource allocation is often influenced by local practices and bed availability.This document presents a framework for preoperative ICU admission planning after EMAS. It focuses on the identification of patient and surgical risk factors-using established scoring systems-and provides statements to determine ICU admission. The aim is to optimize resource allocation, reduce PCs, and prevent unplanned ICU admissions. This good clinical practice statement was developed through a multidisciplinary panel formed by selected members coming from SIAARTI (Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care), SIC (Italian Society of Surgery) and ANIARTI (National Association of Critical Area Nurses).The designed scientific board developed, through a systematic literature review and a consensus methodology, a roadmap for defining the priorities of perioperative care based on the complexity of the patient and the surgical procedure. Eventually, the panel worked out statements about six voted queries that could have supported the preoperative indication to postoperative ICU admission.Evaluation of patients' characteristics, comorbidities, and surgical factors are all essential to plan ICU admission for immediate postoperative patient care after EMAS.The presence and severity of comorbidities, assessed through various severity scores, play a crucial role in predicting PCs and guiding ICU admission decisions. Tools such as the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and Rockwood Frailty Index, along with surgical risk scores and intraoperative events, help define the need for intensive care. Preoperative frailty assessment-achieved using the Clinical Frailty Scale-is essential to anticipate postoperative care needs. Finally, during the postoperative phase, continuous monitoring and reassessment in the post-anesthesia care unit are key to determine whether ICU admission is required. Establishing high-dependency units and tailored care pathways based on individual patient needs and available resources will enhance patient outcomes and optimize postoperative care.
40229866	Primary Hepatoid Adenocarcinoma of the Lung: Clues for Cytological Diagnosis.	Hepatoid adenocarcinoma was described in the 1980s, but clear-cut criteria for diagnosis were not settled until the 1990s. Diagnosis was initially based on the increase of serum alpha-fetoprotein associated with the tumour, but with time, it was shown that some lesions with morphological and immunohistochemical features of hepatoid adenocarcinoma were not associated with alpha-fetoprotein elevation and this is no longer required for diagnosis. Recent systematic reviews have described less than 70 cases of primary hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the lung, and most of these cases were diagnosed by biopsy.
40229865	Comparative efficacy and acceptability of resilience-focused interventions for nurses: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

40229846	Novel CSF β-synuclein-specific assays signal early synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.	Beta-synuclein (β-syn), measured at N-terminal epitopes, is an emerging cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker for synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Targeting the mid-region or C-terminus of β-syn may enhance analytical specificity due to the distinct structures of these regions across the synuclein protein family, unlike targeting the N-terminus, which is conserved across the family. This study aimed to confirm that β-syn is a promising CSF biomarker in AD, using novel assays designed to target different regions of β-syn, to investigate whether these regions are differentially affected in AD.
40229844	KF1601, a dual inhibitor of BCR::ABL1 and FLT3, overcomes drug resistance in FLT3<sup>+</sup> blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia.	Blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (BP-CML) poses significant clinical challenges due to its drug resistance, resulting from BCR::ABL1-dependent mutations and BCR::ABL1-independent pathways. Previously, we reported that FLT3 pathway is activated in ~ 50% of BP-CML cases, indicating a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention via dual inhibition of BCR::ABL1 and FLT3. Here, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of KF1601, a dual inhibitor of BCR::ABL1 and FLT3, in overcoming drug resistance in BP-CML while also comparing its thrombo-inflammatory responses with those of ponatinib, known to have severe cardiovascular adverse events in human. Our findings revealed that KF1601 effectively inhibited of BCR::ABL1 signaling pathway, even in the presence of the T315I mutation. KF1601 achieved complete tumor regression in K562 xenograft mouse models, and prolonged survival significantly in orthotopic mouse models. Furthermore, KF1601 effectively inhibited the FLT3 signaling pathway in imatinib-resistant K562 cells expressing FLT3 and TAZ, suppressing cell proliferation through dual inhibition of BCR::ABL1 and FLT3. These findings were corroborated using drug-resistant BP-CML cells from patients. In assessing thrombo-inflammatory responses using a murine thrombosis model, ponatinib induced severe responses, leading to carotid artery occlusion and extensive vessel wall damage. In contrast, in mice treated with KF1601, carotid arteries remained unoccluded, with vessel walls preserved intact. In summary, KF1601 demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy in overcoming resistance mechanisms, including the BCR::ABL1<sup>T315I</sup> mutation, while also addressing FLT3 signaling implicated in BP-CML progression. Unlike existing therapies such as ponatinib, KF1601 offers a favorable safety profile, potentially minimizing the risk of life-threatening adverse effects.

40229831	Microvesicles carrying EV71 virions cross BBB through endocytic pathway to induce brain injury.	Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major etiologic pathogen for hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in young children. Severe cases of EV71 infection could lead to neurological complications and even death, while the mechanism inducing neurological complications remains poorly understood. In this study, we firstly proved that microvesicles (MVs) could carry EV71 virions and mediate a higher efficiency in infection. Utilizing an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model, we observed that MVs containing virions (MVsEV71) could cross the BBB with greater efficiency compared to EV71 alone. Through in vivo imaging, we confirmed the ability of MVs to cross the BBB. qPCR assays showed a higher copy number of EV71 in both blood and brain samples in the mice treated with MVsEV71 compared to those treated with free EV71. Also, our investigation unveiled that MVsEV71 infection of animals induced cerebral hemorrhage and more severe inflammatory infiltration in the brain compared to animals infected by EV71 in vivo. Furthermore, we found a reduction in the expression of junction proteins such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Moreover, the uptake of MVs by brain cells was examined using chemical inhibitor to block the endocytic pathway. Our experiments elucidated that the internalization of MVs occurred via a non-clathrin-dependent mechanism and a portion of the internalized MVs proceeded to enter lysosomes. In addition, we identified damaged mitochondria as the "cargo" of MVs, which facilitated MVsEV71 crossing the BBB and inducing cellular apoptosis. Meanwhile, MVsEV71 crossing the BBB further induced mitochondrial damaged and activated NOX4-derived ROS pathway in U251 cells. Taken together, these findings suggested that MVs transported EV71 virions across the BBB, while damaged mitochondria facilitated this process and aggravated the brain injury. Overall, these observations provide new insights into EV71-induced neurogenic complications and present a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of viral encephalitis.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of drop-in mental health services for young people with long-term health conditions and their families at six paediatric healthcare settings in England.
40229827	Cryotherapy for treatment of sporotrichosis-rapid cure with adjuvant cryotherapy: case report.	Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis caused by various sporothrix fungus species. This ubiquitous fungal infection is more commonly seen in field/farm workers in tropical and subtropical regions. This prevalence could largely be attributed to the climatic condition favorable for harboring fungi in these regions. Cutaneous infection often occurs via inoculation of fungus into the intact skin owing to traumatic skin injuries. Clinically apparent lesions can occur anywhere in exposed part of the body and mostly these occur over upper extremities, which are prone to trauma during field, farm, agricultural works, and pet handling. Other sites of involvement are lower extremities, face, eyes, and mucous membrane rarely. Onset of clinical feature is usually seen in 2-4 weeks after inoculation of the dimorphic fungus. Various cutaneous manifestations of sporotrichosis can occur ranging from those limited to skin with ulcero-nodular lesions along lymphatics to systemic dissemination to lungs and meninges rarely. Localized form of cutaneous sporotrichosis occur in those with high degree of immunity, whereas the systemic disseminated forms occur in immunocompromised individuals. Treatment of sporotrichosis is done with oral antifungal for months until clinical recovery and in recalcitrant cases with systemic dissemination-intravenous infusion of Amphotericin-B can be used. However, this prolonged dosing until clinical recovery can be hazardous to those with hepato-cardiac comorbidity and also in pregnant females. Given the systemic side-effects that can underlie the use of antifungals for prolonged duration, treatment should be sought towards adjuvant physical modality along with oral antifungal, which decreases the risks of systemic side effects.
40229824	Early weaning in pigeons (Columba Livia domestica): effects on squabs performance and reproductive performance of parents.

40229823	Estradiol-17ß, progesterone, and oviductal changes in muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata forma domestica) during reproductive phases.	The role of Muscovy ducks in industrial poultry production is gaining importance; however, their reproductive physiology remains poorly understood. This study examines changes in reproductive performance in female Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata forma domestica) by analyzing estradiol-17β and progesterone levels along with detailed anatomical examinations of the oviduct. Thirty-five young female ducks emerged together, each hatched after a synchronized incubation period of thirty-five days, were randomly divided into groups and housed in outdoor aviaries. Each aviary was equipped with a feeding trough, a water container, and a nesting box. The ducks were artificially hatched under controlled conditions. At the outset of the experiment, the ducks exhibited no laying activity. Within the investigation, the serum estradiol-17β and progesterone levels, along with the macroscopic and microscopic structure of the oviduct, were evaluated.

40229820	Anaesthetic practices at Gulu Regional Referral Hospital in Northern Uganda, who does what and where? A retrospective study.	Hospitals such as the Gulu Regional Referral Hospital (GRRH) in northern Uganda, like many other regions of sub-Saharan Africa, lack the anaesthetists needed to provide adequate analgesia during surgical procedures. The GRRH has not employed any anaesthesiologist for many years. Instead, anaesthesia is carried out by non-physician anaesthetic officers (AO) and other healthcare workers (HWs). In this setting, peripheral regional anaesthesia (pRA) is a safe and resource-efficient alternative that HWs and AOs could use. The study aimed to evaluate surgical procedures, anaesthetic practices, and staffing at Gulu Regional Referral Hospital in Northern Uganda. The objective was to identify the appropriate audience for pRA training and the corresponding training content.
40229819	Comparative evaluation of artificial intelligence models GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in clinical decision-making in sports surgery and physiotherapy: a cross-sectional study.

40229817	Surfactant proteins levels in asthmatic patients and their correlation with severity of asthma: a systematic review.	Surfactant decreases surface tension in the peripheral airways and plays a role in regulating the lung's immune responses. Several reports have documented changes in surfactant proteins levels, especially surfactant protein D (SP-D) and surfactant protein A (SP-A), suggesting their potential as biomarkers for asthma. However, the results of these studies are controversial. This systematic review was done to assess the levels of surfactant proteins in asthmatic patients compared to healthy individuals.
40229816	Mucosal immunotherapy targeting APC in lung disease.	Several studies have demonstrated that the pulmonary immune response is primarily facilitated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and that both professional and non-professional APCs contribute to overall pulmonary immunity. APCs play unique roles and mechanisms in pathogen elimination and immunomodulation. Mucosal immunity exhibits potential advantages over traditional parenteral immunity in that it stimulates immune defenses in mucosal and systemic tissues, which is important for reducing the burden of lung disease. However, obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the crosstalk between mucosal immunity and APC in the context of various lung diseases remains challenging. This mini-review aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of novel mucosal immunity, targeting APC action during lung infections, allergies, and malignant tumorigenesis. This minreview provides important insights into more effective therapeutic approaches for various lung diseases.

This study aimed to investigate the optimal protocol for endometrial preparation in FET cycles for patients at high risk of OHSS.
40229811	Development of Cre-dependent retrograde trans-multisynaptic tracer based on pseudorabies virus bartha strain.	Mapping the neural circuit of a specific neuronal subclass is central to understanding the working mechanism of the brain. Currently, numerous types of transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase have been engineered and widely used in neuroscience. To map the multilevel inputs into the neural circuit of a specific neuronal subpopulation, a Cre-dependent retrograde trans-multisynaptic tracer must be developed. The vaccine strain of Pseudorabies virus (PRV, Bartha strain) can infect neurons and spread in a retrograde manner in the neural circuit. In this study, we engineered the genome of PRV Bartha strain to prepare two new tracers, PRV676 and PRV829, by replacing the TK gene of PRV with the Cre-dependent expression cassette of the fluorescent protein gene and the TK gene. These two tracers can separately and Cre-dependently express EGFP and mRuby3 and produce progeny viruses in vitro and in vivo, which can help to map the multilevel inputs of a specific neuronal subpopulation expressing Cre. Collectively, our work provides two new tools for neuroscience research.

40229808	Unsilencing a cryptic xylose metabolic pathway in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 for efficient lipid production from lignocellulosic biomass.	Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 is an oleaginous bacterium that has attracted considerable attention due to its capacity to use different carbon sources to accumulate significant levels of triacylglycerols that might be converted into biofuels. However, this strain cannot transform xylose into lipids reducing its potential when growing on saccharified lignocellulosic biomass. In this work, we demonstrate that wild type R. jostii RHA1 can be evolved by adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to metabolize xylose without engineering heterologous metabolic pathways in the host. We have generated a phenotypically adapted ALE-xyl strain able to use xylose as the sole carbon and energy source more efficiently that an engineered recombinant strain harbouring heterologous xylA and xylB genes encoding a xylose isomerase metabolic pathway. The R. jostii RHA1 ALE-xyl strain accumulates lipids very efficiently using xylose as substrate, but even more importantly it can consume glucose and xylose at the same time. Transcriptomic analyses of ALE-xyl strain growing with glucose or xylose revealed the existence of a silent pentose metabolizing operon that is overexpressed in the presence of xylose. The detection of a xylose reductase activity together with the presence of xylitol in the cytoplasm of ALE-xyl strain suggests that xylose is consumed by a reductase pathway. This study demonstrates that, in cases where a clear phenotypic selection method is available, ALE can be used to improve very efficiently industrial microbial strains without using genetic engineering tools. Strategies focused to exploit the silent phenotypic flexibility of microorganisms to metabolize different carbon sources are powerful tools for the production of microbial value-added products using saccharified lignocellulosic wastes.
40229806	Genomic characterization of plasmids of mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli isolated from cohabiting rats, dairy cattle and pigs.	Antimicrobial resistance has become a significant global issue impacting humans, animals, and the environment. Currently, the focus of concern has shifted to the environment, which can act as a reservoir and significantly contribute to the spread of resistance genes. This study aimed to elucidate the potential transmission of mcr-1, which confers colistin resistance, among Escherichia coli isolates from pigs, dairy cattle, and co-habiting rodents. In March 2018, 30 fecal samples were collected from three pig farms and one mixed cattle farm, and 31 cecal contents from rats (Rattus norvegicus) captured from the same four animal farms were analyzed.

40229804	Factors influencing high-risk fertility practices among women of childbearing age in Tanzania: using DHS 2022.	Women's high-risk fertility behavior, marked by short birth intervals, higher birth order, and early maternal age at childbirth, has been scientifically proven to have detrimental health effects on both the mother and child. Despite the recognized consequences, there is a limited body of research examining the factors that contribute to high-risk fertility behavior in Tanzania. Hence, this study seeks to identify the prevalence of high-risk fertility behavior and associated factors among women of reproductive age within the Tanzanian context.
40229803	A comparative study of sonographic and clinical parameters in patient with upper trapezius muscle trigger point following dry needling and intramuscular electrical stimulation: a randomized control trial.	The most common cause of muscle pain is myofascial pain syndrome. Myofascial pain syndrome caused by sensitive areas called trigger points (TrP). Some physiotherapy modalities have acceptable effects for this disorder, but it is necessary to check the effects of placebo, appropriate dose, and long-term effects for each intervention. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of intramuscular electrical stimulation (IMES) compared to dry needling (DN) on sonographic and clinical parameters in upper trapezius muscle TrP.
40229802	What do readers need? Qualitative requirements of medical discharge summaries from the recipients' perspective.	Discharge summaries (DSs) are the primary communication tools in clinical medicine. The transfer of information and plans is essential to ensure consistent patient safety and continuity of care. Therefore, DSs play a key role in population health. However, the overall quality of DSs is considered deficient, and there is a notable lack of scientific knowledge and research in this field, particularly regarding the needs of physicians as the primary recipients of DSs and key providers of ongoing patient care. The purpose of this study was to explore their requirements concerning the content, structure, and processing of DSs.
40229801	Epigenetic timing effects on child developmental outcomes: a longitudinal meta-regression of findings from the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics Consortium.	DNA methylation (DNAm) is a developmentally dynamic epigenetic process; yet, most epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have examined DNAm at only one timepoint or without systematic comparisons between timepoints. Thus, it is unclear whether DNAm alterations during certain developmental periods are more informative than others for health outcomes, how persistent epigenetic signals are across time, and whether epigenetic timing effects differ by outcome.
40229800	Spectral CT findings of bladder urothelial carcinoma with gastric metastasis: a case report.	Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and urothelial carcinoma is the most common form of bladder cancer. Gastric metastasis of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is a rare condition. Cystoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis of bladder cancer; however, it is an invasive procedure that may affect the patient's prognosis and does not allow for the observation of cancer infiltration and metastasis. Therefore, non-invasive imaging is increasingly becoming the most appropriate method for the diagnosis and follow-up of urothelial carcinoma.

40229794	Classification of schizophrenia spectrum disorder using machine learning and functional connectivity: reconsidering the clinical application.	Early identification of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD) is crucial for effective intervention and prognosis improvement. Previous neuroimaging-based classifications have primarily focused on chronic, medicated SSD cohorts. However, the question remains whether brain metrics identified in these populations can serve as trait biomarkers for early-stage SSD. This study investigates whether functional connectivity features identified in chronic, medicated SSD patients could be generalized to early-stage SSD.
40229793	Variation in the extent to which patient information leaflets describe potential benefits and harms of trial interventions: a commentary.	Clinical trial participants must understand the possible risks and benefits of trial interventions before providing their informed consent to participate. The aim of this commentary is twofold: to summarize the discrepancies in the extent to which patient information leaflets (PILs) list potential benefits and harms of trial interventions; and to highlight subsequent ethical issues that may result from failure to disclose potential benefits or harms . A review of 247 patient information leaflets (PILs) found that the extent to which potential benefits and harms are described varies, with 28 (11%) not describing potential benefits and 23 (9%) not describing potential harms. We argue that there is no principled difference between potential benefits and potential harms (what is helpful for one person could harm another), and the need to disclose potential benefits may be less accepted than the need to disclose all potential harms. Additionally, while it is recognized that failure to mention potential harms may violate the ethical principle of autonomy, it is less well-established that other ethical principles, (the need to avoid harm (non-maleficence) , to help patients (beneficence), and to promote justice) may also be at risk when all potential harms and benefits are not  disclosed within PILs. We suggest that the way potential benefits and harms are described within PILs be harmonized according to recently established principles.

Even though global neonatal mortality has shown a remarkable reduction, it still constitutes 42% of the global under-five mortality. Nearly three-fourths of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Antenatal Care (ANC) and health facility delivery are the best-recommended strategies to prevent neonatal mortality. Previously published studies showed a significant association between ANC and health facility delivery with neonatal mortality. However, none of them examined the actual causal impact of health facility delivery and ANC on neonatal mortality in SSA using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis. Therefore, our study examined the causal effect of ANC and health facility delivery on neonatal mortality in SSA using the Propensity Score Matched (PSM) analysis approach. This study adds new knowledge to the existing literature by evaluating the actual effect of health facility delivery and antenatal care on neonatal mortality by controlling confounding via matching. Which in turn enable decision makers in evaluating the effectiveness of these services in reducing neonatal mortality in SSA.
40229786	Aripiprazole alleviates the high prolactin levels induced by amisulpride via distinct molecular mechanisms: a network pharmacology and molecular docking study.

40229782	Getting used to it? Stress of repeated management procedures in semi-domesticated reindeer.	Extensive animal production systems, such as reindeer husbandry may represent a system to further study the context dependence of stress responses and the potential implications for animal welfare as research on food animal stress and welfare has so far primarily focused on animals in intensive animal production systems while animals from extensive production systems, such as reindeer, are yet underrepresented. We investigated short- and longer-term stress responses to repeated herding, handling and restraint and its potential effect on animal welfare in semi-domesticated adult female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). We also assessed seasonal differences and the potential effect of the additional stressor of calf removal using serum concentrations of glucocorticoids (cortisol, cortisone and corticosterone), their precursors (11-desoxcortisol, 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone and deoxycorticosterone) and catecholamine metabolites (metanephrine and normetanephrine) in combination with the immunological stress proxy leukocyte coping capacity (LCC) and rectal temperature. Additionally, we assessed the interconnections among different stress indices and their suitability as stress indicators to evaluate handling-induced stress in reindeer, where rectal temperature, other than serum cortisol levels, emerged as a robust and integrative stress parameter.

This study aims to conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the correlation between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and the risk of developing GDM and delve into their dose-response relationship.
40229774	Towards interpretable sleep stage classification with a multi-stream fusion network.	Sleep stage classification is a significant measure in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Many researchers have investigated automatic sleep stage classification methods and achieved promising results. However, these methods ignored the heterogeneous information fusion of the spatial-temporal and spectral-temporal features among multiple-channel sleep monitoring signals. In this study, we propose an interpretable multi-stream fusion network, named MSF-SleepNet, for sleep stage classification. Specifically, we employ Chebyshev graph convolution and temporal convolution to obtain the spatial-temporal features from body-topological information of sleep monitoring signals. Meanwhile, we utilize a short time Fourier transform and gated recurrent unit to learn the spectral-temporal features from sleep monitoring signals. After fusing the spatial-temporal and spectral-temporal features, we use a contrastive learning scheme to enhance the differences in feature patterns of sleep monitoring signals across various sleep stages. Finally, LIME is employed to improve the interpretability of MSF-SleepNet. Experimental results on ISRUC-S1 and ISRUC-S3 datasets show that MSF-SleepNet achieves competitive results and is superior to its state-of-the-art counterparts on most of performance metrics.

40229767	Erythrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles transcytose across the blood-brain barrier to induce Parkinson's disease-like neurodegeneration.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative illness characterized by motor and non-motor features. Hallmarks of the disease include an extensive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, evidence of neuroinflammation, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins leading to the formation of Lewy bodies. While PD etiology is complex and identifying a single disease trigger has been a challenge, accumulating evidence indicates that non-neuronal and peripheral factors may likely contribute to disease onset and progression. The brain is shielded from peripheral factors by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which tightly controls the entry of systemic molecules and cells from the blood to the brain. The BBB integrates molecular signals originating from the luminal (blood) and abluminal (brain) sides of the endothelial wall, regulating these exchanges. Of particular interest are erythrocytes, which are not only the most abundant cell type in the blood, but they also secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that display disease-specific signatures over the course of PD. Erythrocyte-derived EVs (EEVs) could provide a route by which pathological molecular signals travel from the periphery to the central nervous system. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate, in a human-based platform, mechanisms of EEV transport from the blood to the brain under physiological conditions. The secondary objective was to determine the ability of EEVs, generated by erythrocytes of healthy donors or patients, to induce PD-like features. We leveraged two in vitro models of the BBB, the transwell chambers and a microfluidic BBB chip generated using human induced pluripotent stem cells. Our findings suggest that EEVs transcytose from the vascular to the brain compartment of the human BBB model via a caveolin-dependant mechanism. Furthermore, EEVs derived from individuals with PD altered BBB integrity compared to healthy EEV controls, and clinical severity aggravated the loss of barrier integrity and increased EEV extravasation into the brain compartment. PD-derived EEVs reduced ZO-1 and Claudin 5 tight junction levels in BMEC-like cells and induced the selective atrophy of dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, non-dopaminergic neurons were not affected by treatment with PD EEVs. In summary, our data suggest that EEV interactions at the human BBB can be studied using a highly translational human-based brain chip model, and EEV toxicity at the neurovascular unit is exacerbated by disease severity.

40229748	Identification of m6 A-regulated ferroptosis biomarkers for prognosis in laryngeal cancer.	Laryngeal cancer (LC) is a malignant tumor that occurs in the larynx. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, a pivotal and prevalent epigenetic modification in eukaryotic mRNA, intricately intertwines with ferroptosis, and together, they play a crucial role in the development of LC. Accordingly, further research on related molecular mechanisms and pathology of LC is necessary. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis and correlation analysis were used to identify differentially expressed m6A-related ferroptosis genes in LC. The TCGA-HNSC and GSE65858 datasets were obtained from public databases. The TCGA-HNSC dataset consisted of 110 primary tumor oropharynx samples and 12 control oropharynx samples, while the GSE65858 dataset contained forty-eight primary tumor oropharynx samples. Univariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were utilized for feature selection and risk model construction in the TCGA-HNSC dataset. The risk model was validated in the GSE65858 dataset. Then, a nomogram was built based on the independent prognostic factor identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regression in the TCGA-HNSC dataset. Mutation analysis, immune-related analysis, and drug sensitivity prediction were applied to analyze the utility of the risk model in the TCGA-HNSC dataset. Additionally, qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to detect the TFRC, RGS4, and FTH1 expression. Three biomarkers were identified to build a risk model using the univariate Cox and LASSO regression algorithms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis verified the accuracy of the risk model. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumors using the Expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm showed a positive relationship between risk score and TIDE or ESTIMATE score. Furthermore, drug sensitivity prediction found that 19 chemotherapy drugs were strongly correlated with a risk score. TFRC, RGS4, and FTH1 exhibited high expression levels in 30 laryngeal carcinoma tissues and cell lines. Notably, TFRC and FTH1 expression levels were significantly associated with patient prognosis. In Conclusion, TFRC, RGS4, and FTH1, were identified as m6A-regulated ferroptosis biomarkers in LC, providing insights into LC treatment and prognosis.

40229746	Polygonum multiflorum Stilbene Glycoside Oligomers induce the ferroptosis of triple negative breast cancer cells.	The quality control testing component and main active ingredient of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (P. multiflorum), known as trans-2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene 2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (TSG), exhibits diverse biological activities. In this study, we report, for the first time, the potent ability of TSG to induce ferroptosis in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and to inhibit the proliferation of TNBC cells. Treatment with TSG triggers the production of lipid peroxides, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TNBC cells, indicating the induction of ferroptosis. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed the inhibitory effects of TSG on TNBC cell proliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of other stilbene glycoside oligomers, alongside TSG, on TNBC cell lines. These compounds also demonstrated the ability to induce ferroptosis and suppress TNBC cells' proliferation and metastasis. These findings suggest that the induction of ferroptosis by TSG and related compounds could potentially serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment.

40229719	PACAP38-induced migraine attacks are independent of CGRP signaling: a randomized controlled trial.	Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38) are key pathogenic drivers of migraine. While CGRP has become the target of several mechanism-based therapies, less is known about PACAP38 signaling in migraine pathogenesis. Previous studies suggest that PACAP38 can modulate CGRP release, but it might also induce migraine attacks via CGRP-independent mechanisms. Whether PACAP38 signaling is independent of and parallel to CGRP signaling has implications for future therapeutic strategies. Here, we aimed to ascertain whether PACAP-38 can mediate migraine attacks independently of CGRP signaling by assessing the ability of eptinezumab to prevent PACAP38-induced migraine attacks.

40229714	Molecular basis identification and hypnotic drug interactions for cognitive impairment related to sleep deprivation.	Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to cognitive impairment which makes it difficult to think, focus, and make comprehensive decisions. This in turn leads to the progression and increased risk of several diseases. This study aimed to explore potential drug targets and biomarkers underlying the increased disease risk due to sleep deprivation, including stress responses, immune dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation. Four datasets namely GSE40562, GSE98566, GSE98582 for sleep deprivation, and GSE26576 normal brain cells were utilized to understand the molecular basis and potential drug targets associated with sleep deprivation. The GEO2R tool, Robust rank aggregations, and Venny were used to retrieve the common DEGs. Functional gene and pathway analyses were carried out via GO and the KEGG analyses. The STRING and CytoHuba plugins were utilized to identify the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as well as the hub genes in the main PPI subnetworks following the drug interaction of the hub genes and GEPIA-based survival analysis of the DEGs. A total of 160 common DEGs were retrieved from all four datasets. Among them, 65 were down-regulated and 95 were up-regulated. TOP2A, AURKB, NEFL, CDC42, ASPM, GAP43, PVALB, NUF2, CALM1, TPR, KIF5B, KIF15, TROAP, NDC80, PBK, MKI67, SST, AHSP, ALAS2, and NEFH were retrieved as hub genes. While based on drug interaction, survival analysis and gene expression profile eight hub gene named TOP2A, AURKB, PVALB, CALM1, KIF5B, PBK, MKI67, and SST were found to be potential drug candidates and significantly correlated with infiltration levels of CD8 + T cells, B cells, macrophages, CD4 + T cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. These genes might play a role in sleep disorders via various pathways associated with neurodegeneration and diseases, potentially serving as biomarkers to support treatment and diagnosis.

40229706	Location-specific pathology analysis of monopodial airways in a rabbit model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia: a proof of principle study.	The airways of the mammalian lung form a tree-like structure, starting from the trachea and branching out to the terminal bronchioles. This tree is composed of heterogeneous sub-structures or compartments, varying in morphological characteristics such as composition of airway epithelium, presence of cartilage plates, and number of smooth muscle cell layers or lumen diameter. These compartments may vary in their reaction to different pathological stimuli. Thus, when studying a particular lung disease, the compartments need to be investigated individually and not as part of a more global portmanteau compartment. In the symmetrically branching primate lungs, dividing the airway tree into generations is a common method to create morphologically homogeneous groups of airway segments. In common lab animals however, an asymmetrical branching pattern is present, where conventional branching-based grouping methods are unable to create meaningful results.
40229705	Mitochondrial proteins and congenital birth defect risk: a mendelian randomization study.

Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to investigate causal relationships. This study aimed to investigate the causal effect of mitochondrial proteins on risk of common congenital defects including orofacial clefts, congenital heart defects, external ear malformations, urinary system malformations, nervous system malformations, and limb malformations.
40229704	Growth resilience to weather variation in commercial free-ranging chickens in Ethiopia.	The poultry industry in sub-Saharan Africa is a rapidly developing sector mostly based on smallholder farming. Increased demand for poultry-derived products, driven by the growing economy and population, has intensified importations of highly productive exotic breeds and crossbreeding with local ecotypes. However, commercial chickens with exotic genes often struggle to adapt to the local climate under smallholder farmers management. Understanding the chicken response to weather changes is crucial for developing selection schemes that ensure proper adaptation. In the present study, we derived individual phenotypes for growth resilience of commercial free-ranging chickens to changing weather conditions in Ethiopia. In addition, we performed genomic association analyses to assess the genetic background of these phenotypes and identify potential candidate genes of interest.

40229691	Determinants of attendance in antenatal care clinics in rural settings in Mali and Burkina Faso: a cross-sectional study.	Since 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a minimum of eight antenatal care (ANC) contacts during pregnancy, replacing the previous recommendation of four focused ANC visits. In Mali and Burkina Faso, the four ANC visits are still recommended and their coverage remains low or insufficient. To anticipate possible obstacles to the implementation of the new recommendations, this study aimed to identify the individual determinants of ANC attendance in two study districts, with a representative sample of women recruited from the community.
40229690	Climatic variations and Yersinia pestis host-vector abundance: a case study in Ankazobe district to understand plague epidemiology in Madagascar.	Plague, a disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis remains a major public health concern in Madagascar despite numerous multidisciplinary studies. The persistence of human plague infections is thought to be linked to fluctuations in mammalian host and flea populations, which are affected by climatic and environmental variations. This study explored local macro- and microclimatic variations along with mammal and flea population dynamics across different microhabitat types within plague endemic rural and forested habitats of Madagascar. Understanding these variables and their interdependent relationships may help us better understand the complexities of Y. pestis transmission in the Madagascan Highlands.
40229689	Assessing antibiotic residue presence in Turkey meat: insights from a four-box method analysis.	Contemporary poultry farming involves extensive antibiotic use, which could potentially pose health risks to consumers through antibiotic residues in animal-derived food products, especially meat. Recent decisions, particularly the ban on nearly all antibiotic feed additives utilized as growth promoters, have resulted in a decrease in their usage. Nonetheless, their essential role in therapy and their economic value are indisputable. This study evaluated the presence of antibiotic residues in marketed turkey meat using the four-box method. The analyses indicated that, of the 400 samples examined, the overall prevalence of contamination was 65.75%. Among the different types of antibiotics identified in the samples, β-lactam/tetracycline residues were the highest, with a prevalence of 41.44%. The analysis of different sample types revealed significant contamination rates in turkey organs, particularly the liver, with a contamination prevalence of approximately 83.75%, and the wing muscle, 78.75%. Two antibiotic families, β-lactam and tetracycline, were identified in the wing muscle and liver at frequencies of 44.44% and 43.28%, respectively. Regarding cross-contamination, positive samples exhibited contamination concurrently by a specific type of residue, with a notable rate of 58.19%. All analyzed organs exhibited contamination by multiple residue types, with varying contaminants present in different organs. The findings indicated varying detection rates of antibiotic residues in consumed turkey meat. These highlight the excessive use of antibiotics in the poultry industry, increasing consumer exposure to these residues'associated risks. Therefore, it is essential to implement stricter measures and monitoring systems regarding the use of antibiotics in poultry farming.

40229683	Migraine with and without aura-two distinct entities? A narrative review.	Migraine is a primary headache disorder, with a prevalence estimated at approximately 15% globally. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD3), there are three significant types of migraine: migraine without aura (MO), migraine with aura (MA), and chronic migraine (CM), the former being the most common. Migraine diagnosis is based on official criteria specific to each type. Although a lot is already known about the origin of migraine aura, its pathophysiology is still an object of research.Long-term discussions have been held about MO and MA, with some evidence for the same underlying pathogenesis of both and other arguments against it. In this narrative review, we decided to analyse multiple factors from the perspective of similarities and differences between these two types of migraine. The aim was to understand better the bases underlying both types of migraine.Aspects such as genetics, molecular bases, relation with hormones, epidemiological and clinical features, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, treatment response, and migraine complications are covered to find similarities and differences between MO and MA. Although epidemiology shares similarities for both types, there are slight alterations in sex and age distribution. Genetics and pathogenesis showed some crucial differences. Conditions, such as vestibular symptoms and depression, were found to correlate similarly with both types of migraine. For some features, including increased cardiovascular risk, the tendency appeared to be the same; however, migraine types differ in the strength of correlation. Finally, in cases such as hormones, the influence has shown opposite directions. Therefore, although migraine with and without aura are considered two types of the same disease, more research should focus on their differences, thus finally enabling better specific treatment options for both types of migraine.
40229682	ALE reveals a surprising link between [Fe-S] cluster formation, tryptophan biosynthesis and the potential regulatory protein TrpP in Corynebacterium glutamicum.	The establishment of synthetic microbial communities comprising complementary auxotrophic strains requires efficient transport processes for common goods. With external supplementation of the required metabolite, most auxotrophic strains reach wild-type level growth. One exception was the L-trypton auxotrophic strain phaCorynebacterium glutamicum ΔTRP ΔtrpP, which grew 35% slower than the wild type in supplemented defined media. C. glutamicum ΔTRP ΔtrpP lacks the whole L-tryptophan biosynthesis cluster (TRP, cg3359-cg3364) as well as the putative L-tryptophan transporter TrpP (Cg3357). We wanted to explore the role of TrpP in L-tryptophan transport, metabolism or regulation and to elucidate the cause of growth limitation despite supplementation.
40229681	DCATNet: polyp segmentation with deformable convolution and contextual-aware attention network.	Polyp segmentation is crucial in computer-aided diagnosis but remains challenging due to the complexity of medical images and anatomical variations. Current state-of-the-art methods struggle with accurate polyp segmentation due to the variability in size, shape, and texture. These factors make boundary detection challenging, often resulting in incomplete or inaccurate segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose DCATNet, a novel deep learning architecture specifically designed for polyp segmentation. DCATNet is a U-shaped network that combines ResNetV2-50 as an encoder for capturing local features and a Transformer for modeling long-range dependencies. It integrates three key components: the Geometry Attention Module (GAM), the Contextual Attention Gate (CAG), and the Multi-scale Feature Extraction (MSFE) block. We evaluated DCATNet on five public datasets. On Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB, the model achieved mean dice scores of 0.9351 and 0.9444, respectively, outperforming previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Cross-validation further demonstrated its superior generalization capability. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each component in DCATNet. Integrating GAM, CAG, and MSFE effectively improves feature representation and fusion, leading to precise and reliable segmentation results. These findings underscore DCATNet's potential for clinical application and can be used for a wide range of medical image segmentation tasks.
40229679	Correlation of rice yield based on RILs population QTL analysis.	Rice production has been a primary concern in crop quality breeding. In this study, India japonica variety M494 and indica variety Z9B were used as parents. Hybridization and selfing were conducted to obtain recombinant inbred lines (RILs) as the experimental material. The F<sub>3</sub> and F<sub>7</sub> populations were analyzed to determine six yield-related traits, including panicle length, effective panicle number, number of grains per panicle, seed setting rate, yield per plant, and grain density. QTL mapping of rice yield-related traits and tillering angle was performed using the SSR molecular marker linkage map, resulting in the identification of 19 QTLs controlling panicle length, grain number per panicle, effective panicle number, seed setting rate, grain density.Additionally, multiple regression analysis and path analysis were employed to investigate the relationship between different agronomic traits and rice yield in the F<sub>7</sub> population. An optimal regression equation, Y<sub>YPP</sub> = -24.515 + 0.694X<sub>PL</sub> + 1.273X<sub>PN</sub> + 0.007X<sub>PPG</sub> + 18.981X<sub>SSR</sub> was derived, and it was concluded that SSR was the trait with the greatest impact on YPP, followed by PL.
40229678	Sexually dimorphic gene expression responses of bovine embryos to the maternal microenvironment on day 13 of gestation.	Various studies have highlighted significant differences in developmental kinetics and sensitivity to developmental conditions between male and female bovine embryos. These differences are thought to be caused in part by the sexually dimorphic expression of genes located on the sex or autosomal chromosomes. However, little is known about the dimorphic gene expression patterns of bovine embryos at the initiation of elongation, which is one of the critical stages of development. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is little or no data available on the sexually dimorphic gene expression patterns in bovine embryos in relation to maternal environmental conditions during the initiation of elongation. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the sexually dimorphic gene expression responses of embryos to the maternal environment at the initiation of elongation in embryos developed in lactating dairy cows and nonlactating nulliparous heifers.
40229677	Improving data interpretability with new differential sample variance gene set tests.	Gene set analysis methods have played a major role in generating biological interpretations of omics data such as gene expression datasets. However, most methods focus on detecting homogenous pattern changes in mean expression while methods detecting pattern changes in variance remain poorly explored. While a few studies attempted to use gene-level variance analysis, such approach remains under-utilized. When comparing two phenotypes, gene sets with distinct changes in subgroups under one phenotype are overlooked by available methods although they reflect meaningful biological differences between two phenotypes. Multivariate sample-level variance analysis methods are needed to detect such pattern changes.

40229664	Kinetically Frozen Rheology of Agar-agar Hydrogels Upon a Change of Anions in the Hofmeister Series.	Hydrogels are materials in which water is present as the major component in a network of macromolecules, inorganic colloids or low molecular weight organogelators. To tune their viscoelastic properties, they can be crosslinked, making use of their chemical moieties, but most often with cytotoxicity issues. Another approach consists in modifying the intermolecular interactions of the gelator or its interactions with water. In this framework, playing with the nature of the used electrolyte becomes a popular approach. Even if many reports describe the influence of anions or cations in the Hofmeister series on the mechanical properties of hydrogels, very few investigate the possibility of modifying those properties in a reversible manner between two states characteristic of each electrolyte. Herein, it is shown that agar-agar hydrogels prepared in the presence of high ionic strength NaCl or NaSCN display strongly different mechanical properties and that a change in the nature of the electrolyte in the presence of the gel does not significantly change its storage and loss moduli. This lack of reversibility in the time scale of one day or more is shown to be related to the high inaccessibility of the water and ions present in the porous volume after the gel formation.
40229663	Establishing normative pinch and grip strengths across adult age groups in Singapore.	Pinch and grip strengths are vital indicators of upper limb function, musculoskeletal health, and general health.

This cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the normative values for lateral pinch strength (LPS) and hand grip strength (HGS) in healthy adult Singaporeans.
40229662	Vernacular and discursive harm reduction: an ethnography of an online drug community.	In the context of online drug communities, the ethos of harm reduction comprises a set of ethical and practical principles that enable drug enthusiasts to shift stigma by normalizing certain behaviors to the detriment of others. The HR ethos is the dominant discourse in drug forums, which may give the impression that it is a natural expression of the online sociability of drug enthusiasts. However, according to the interactionist theory of deviance, there is a process behind the demarcation between deviance and normality; this would suggest that before becoming the dominant discourse, the HR ethos has had to assert itself in drug forums in the face of other attitudes. The study aimed to follow the progression of the HR ethos in an online drug community, in order to identify the process that led to both its generalization by the community's members and their labelling of deviant behavior within the community.
40229661	Estimating mutation rate and characterising single nucleotide de novo mutations in pigs.	Direct estimates of mutation rates in humans have changed our understanding of evolutionary timing and de novo mutations (DNM) have been associated with several developmental disorders in humans. Livestock species, including pigs, can contribute to the study of DNM because of their ideal population structure and routine phenotype collection. In principle, there is the potential for livestock populations to quickly accumulate new genetic variants because of short generation intervals and high selection intensity. However, the impact of DNM on the fitness of individuals is not known and with current genomic selection programs they cannot contribute to estimated breeding values. The aims of our project were to detect and validate single nucleotide DNM in two commercial pig breeding lines, estimate the single nucleotide mutation rate, and characterise DNM.
40229660	Empirical assessment of functional somatic disorder (FSD): frequency, applicability, and diagnostic refinement in a population-based sample.	Persistent and troublesome physical symptoms are common and can, regardless of their cause, greatly impair patients' quality of life. Reflecting complex brain-body interactions, they are observed across all healthcare specialties, commonly overlap across them, and receive inconsistent diagnoses. In response, the international research network EURONET-SOMA has proposed a diagnostic classification for persistent and troublesome symptoms entitled "functional somatic disorder (FSD)". Focusing on symptom patterns across organ systems, the FSD approach aims to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare access for patients. However, further research is needed to validate its effectiveness and clinical utility. This study assessed the frequency and applicability of the FSD proposal within a population-based sample.
40229659	Parenting behaviors and deviant peer affiliation among Chinese adolescents: the mediating role of psychological reactance and the moderating role of gender.	Given the negative impact of deviant peer affiliation on adolescent behavioral development, understanding its underlying mechanisms is essential. Drawing on social development model, psychological reactance theory and adolescent-limited delinquency theory, this study examined the relationship between parenting behaviors and adolescents' deviant peer affiliation, as well as the mediating role of reactance and the moderating role of gender. The research involved 1,822 high school students (M<sub>age</sub> = 15.28 years, SD<sub>age</sub> = 2.40) from two provinces in China. All students completed a face-to-face questionnaire administered in a computer room at their respective school. This study found that parental emotional warmth was negatively correlated with adolescent deviant peer affiliation. On the contrary, parental rejection and overprotection were positively correlated with adolescent deviant peer affiliation. Furthermore, the findings indicated that reactance significantly mediated the relationship between parental emotional warmth, rejection, overprotection, and deviant peer affiliation, with reactance fully mediating the relationship between parental overprotection and deviant peer affiliation. Finally, the gender of the adolescent was found to significantly moderate the relationship between parental rejection (β = -0.10, p =.04), emotional warmth (β = 0.16, p =.003) and deviant peer affiliation, although no moderation was observed regarding parental overprotection. These results suggest that various parenting behaviors employ complex mechanisms to influence adolescents' deviant peer affiliation, with reactance and gender differences playing pivotal roles. This study offers new insights into the mechanisms underlying adolescent deviant peer affiliation and underscores the importance of reducing deviant peer affiliation through interventions targeting reactance and parenting behaviors.
40229657	Characterization of Chiral Thiophene Multilayer 3D Polymers with AIE Properties for Environmental Monitoring of Chromium Ions.	This study reports the synthesis and characterization of novel thiophene-based multilayer 3D chiral polymers incorporating methoxy and octyloxy functional groups. These polymers exhibit unique fluorescence properties, including a pronounced aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon at a lower excitation wavelength than previously reported thiophene systems. Additionally, the polymers demonstrate remarkable sensitivity in detecting hexavalent chromium ions (Cr<sup>6+</sup>), a significant environmental pollutant. The interaction between the chiral polymers and Cr<sup>6+</sup> ions leads to measurable changes in fluorescence, highlighting their potential for applications in environmental monitoring and biosensing. Importantly, these polymers are effective in actual environmental water, where they maintain their selectivity for Cr<sup>6+</sup> ions despite the presence of competing metal ions. This enhanced selectivity further underscores their suitability for real-world applications. This work contributes to the field of chiral polymers and emphasizes their versatility in advanced sensing applications.

40229653	Hematopoietic stem cell state and fate in trained immunity.	Trained immunity serves as a de facto memory for innate immune responses, resulting in long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. It enhances resistance to pathogens and augments immunosurveillance under physiological conditions. Given that innate immune cells typically have a short lifespan and do not divide, persistent innate immune memory may be mediated by epigenetic and metabolic changes in long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. HSCs fine-tune their state and fate in various training conditions, thereby generating functionally adapted progeny cells that orchestrate innate immune plasticity. Notably, both beneficial and maladaptive trained immunity processes can comprehensively influence HSC state and fate, leading to divergent hematopoiesis and immune outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize recent advances regarding HSC state and fate in the context of trained immunity. By elucidating the stem cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory network, we aim to refine current models of innate immune memory and provide actionable insights for developing targeted therapies against infectious diseases and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for engineering precision-trained immunity through HSC-targeted interventions.

40229646	Targeting kinases that regulate programmed cell death: a new therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.	Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors among women and ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in females, primarily due to delays in diagnosis and shortcomings in treatment strategies. Consequently, there is a pressing need to identify reliable therapeutic targets and strategies. In recent years, the identification of effective biomarkers-particularly novel molecular therapeutic targets-has become a focal point in breast cancer research, aimed at predicting disease aggressiveness and monitoring treatment responses. Simultaneously, advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular programmed death have opened new avenues for targeting kinase-regulated programmed cell death as a viable therapeutic strategy. This review summarizes the latest research progress regarding kinase-regulated programmed death (including apoptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, and ferroptosis) in breast cancer treatment. It covers the key kinases involved in this mechanism, their roles in the onset and progression of breast cancer, and strategies for modulating these kinases through pharmacological interventions.
40229645	Effects of different grain types on nutrient apparent digestibility, glycemic responses, and fecal VFA content in weaned foals.	China's equine industry has shifted from traditional rough grazing to modern intensive farming, expanding the roles of horses into eventing, leisure, tourism, and meat and dairy production. Concurrently, equine nutrition has evolved from a forage-based diet to a more diverse regimen incorporating grain supplements to meet the heightened energy demands of intensive farming. However, nutrient digestibility and glycemic response vary considerably based on grain type, starch content, composition, and structural properties. Optimal grain selection is therefore essential for energy supplementation across developmental stages to sustain growth and performance. This study examines the impact of diets incorporating steam-flaked grains (corn, oats, and barley) on apparent nutrient digestibility, glycemic response, and fecal volatile fatty acid (VFA) composition in the weaned Kazakh foals.

40229641	Topology-Enhanced Machine Learning Model (Top-ML) for Anticancer Peptide Prediction.	Recently, therapeutic peptides have demonstrated great promise for cancer treatment. To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential candidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become a bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its sequence "connection" information characterized by spectral descriptors. Our Top-ML model, employing an Extra-Trees classifier, has been validated on the AntiCP 2.0 and mACPpred 2.0 benchmark data sets, achieving state-of-the-art performance or results comparable to existing deep learning models, while providing greater interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to accelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.
40229640	The impact of online situational interventions on hostile attribution bias and emotion regulation difficulties: an empirical study from the perspective of crime prevention.	Adolescent aggression leading to crime is a growing global issue, and understanding its antecedents is crucial. Previous studies have shown that hostile attribution bias and difficulties in emotion regulation are significant psychological factors influencing aggression. However, traditional interventions are limited by time and space constraints. Online contextual interventions offer flexibility but have remained underutilized in this field. This study examines the predictive role of hostile attribution bias and difficulties in emotion regulation in adolescent aggression and explores the impact of online interventions on reducing these biases, assessing their potential for preventing adolescent crime.

40229638	An exploration of the perspectives of Dutch adults experiencing a genetic condition on human germline gene editing.	Views of people with a genetic condition are crucial in deliberations on human germline gene editing (HGGE), but their perspectives are at risk to be devalued due to epistemic injustice and insufficient attention for the possible sensitivities surrounding HGGE. This study set out to explore the perspectives of people dealing with a genetic condition regarding HGGE, and the possible sensitivities surrounding this topic. We conducted a 2-phase qualitative interview (N = 29) and focus group study (N = 9) on the perspectives of people with or carrying a genetic condition and family members regarding HGGE. Insights from the interviews were used in the organization of the focus groups. We included 38 persons who have experiences with 18 different genetic conditions. Three main themes were identified: personal deliberation on HGGE, HGGE in the context of reproductive decision making and the impact of HGGE on society. Participants stated discussing the topic was controversial, complicated and overwhelming. An informal setting with peer support helped them to process their thoughts and feelings. This study found three main conclusions. First, the perspectives on HGGE are highly influenced by the perception of a genetic condition as a burden or as part of an identity. Secondly, in the deliberation on HGGE, many participants experienced a conflict between accepting a genetic condition and taking action to mitigate potential harm. Thirdly, the subject and object of the deliberation on HGGE mattered: for whom and what for? Moreover, this study has yielded pragmatic recommendations to accommodate sensitivities around discussing HGGE.
40229637	Patterns and Correlates of Utilization of Mental Health Services, Distress, and Flourishing Among Academic Medical Trainees and Faculty Throughout the COVID Pandemic and Beyond.

40229636	Quantitative T1 is sensitive to cortical remyelination in multiple sclerosis: A postmortem MRI study.	Remyelination of cortical lesions in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) has been shown to be extensive. In this work, we aimed to assess whether postmortem quantitative MRI (qMRI) can help detect those areas. We imaged six fixed whole brains of deceased pwMS by 3T-MRI using magnetization transfer ratio (MTR, 570 μm isotropic), myelin water fraction (MWF, 1000 μm isotropic), quantitative T1 (qT1, 670 μm isotropic), quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM, 330 μm isotropic) and radial diffusivity (RD, 1300 or 1400 μm isotropic) maps. Immunohistochemistry for myelin proteins was performed in 129 tissue blocks including the cortex and enabled the detection of cortical demyelination (DM), cortical remyelination (RM), and normal-appearing cortex (NAC). We identified 25 DM, 25 RM, and for each of these areas, a corresponding NAC near the lesion. Wilcoxon paired tests showed that: (a) qT1 and RD were higher and QSM lower in DM versus NAC (all p < 0.001), whereas RD was higher and QSM lower in RM versus NAC (p = 0.048 and p < 0.01 respectively); (b) mean qT1 in RM did not differ from mean qT1 in NAC (p = 0.074); (c) MWF and MTR were not different between DM and RM. We compared the delta between DM versus NAC (∆DM) and the delta between RM versus NAC (∆RM) using a Mann-Whitney test, in which RM showed a partial recovery of qT1 only (∆qT1 DM > ∆qT1 RM, p = 0.045). Mixed-effect models confirmed the findings obtained using univariate analyses. qT1 and QSM, but not RD, correlated with MBP intensity (r = -0.28, p < 0.01 and r = 0.29, p < 0.01 respectively). A Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple testing. Our data show that qT1 is altered in demyelinated but not in remyelinated cortical areas, while QSM and RD are affected by any cortical abnormalities. Accordingly, qT1 might be considered a potential imaging biomarker of cortical RM.

40229632	Bridging the Global Divide: Advancing Traumatic Brain Injury Research Through Globally Representative Data.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant global health issue, yet its impact is disproportionately borne by low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where higher exposure to risk factors and limited health care resources exacerbate the burden. Despite this, the majority of TBI research is derived from data sets curated in high-income countries (HICs), where research infrastructure and resources are more extensive. As a result, clinical guidelines for TBI management are primarily shaped by data from HICs, with little consideration for the distinct factors and health care challenges in resource-limited settings. This gap hinders the development of effective TBI management guidelines for LMICs, where unique circumstances and challenges such as injury mechanisms, prehospital care, comorbidities, and hospital resources must be considered. Nonetheless, HICs have the resources and infrastructure to collect data on variables that may not be as urgent in their own settings but are critical for understanding challenges in LMICs. Integrating these globally applicable variables into data sets from HICs is essential for facilitating more relevant cross-contextual comparisons and improving care in LMICs. Bridging this gap requires equitable collaboration with LMIC researchers to ensure their perspectives are prioritized and that research efforts contribute to the development of truly representative data sets. By fostering such collaborations, the global community can work toward evidence-based guidelines that reflect the diverse realities of TBI care, ultimately improving outcomes for patients worldwide.
40229631	Synthesis, Spectroscopic, DFT Calculation and Molecular Docking Studies of Indole Derivative.	In the present work, computational and experimental work were carried out to explore the spectroscopic properties of indole derivative namely, Ethyl-5chloro-3-phenyl-1 h-indol-2carboxylate [5-CPIC] for optoelectronics applications. Redshift with increasing solvent polarity was observed indicating π → π* transition due to intramolecular charge transfer interactions. The theoretical ground and excited state dipole moments were calculated using Gaussian 16W software with basis set B3LYP/6-31 + G (d, p). The dipole moments of the derivative in-ground and excited state were determined experimentally. The excited state dipole moment is higher than the ground state, showing that excited state is more polar in nature. Specific and non-specific solute and solvent interactions were analysed using Kamlet and Catalan parameters. HOMO-LUMO energies of the molecule are determined using DFT. Chemical hardness, chemical softness and ionization potential are determined on basis of global descriptors. Molecular electrostatic potential maps are used to analyse electrophilic and nucleophilic sites. Further, Polarizability and hyperpolarizability were used to calculate Non-linear optical (NLO) properties. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis shows proton transfer chosen in the donor-acceptor and demonstrate high energy equilibrium for the molecule. To observe biophysical properties of the molecule, molecular docking studies performed with Cyclooxygenase-2(PDB ID-Cox-2). The physicochemical characteristics like drug-likeness and bioactivity scores of the molecule were calculated. The spectroscopic properties of the molecule studies suggest their potential use as an auspicious contender for organic light-emitting diode solar cells and sensor applications.
40229630	Fluorescence Behavior of Europium (III) Chelate Compound in Silica Nanoparticles in the Presence and Absence of Au Nanoparticles.	The fluorescence behavior of {2,2',2″,2‴-{4'-{[(4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]biphenyl-4-yl}-2,2':6',2″-terpyridine-6,6″-diyl}bis(methylenenitrilo)}tetrakis(acetate)-Eu<sup>3+</sup> (DTBTA-Eu (III)) in silica nanoparticles (NPs) and capsules was investigated in relation to the following four locations of DTBTA-Eu (III): inside the SiO<sub>2</sub> layers of the AuNP core covered with the shell of SiO<sub>2</sub> (@SiO<sub>2</sub>) [hereafter, AuNP@SiO<sub>2</sub>-DTBTA-Eu (III)/SiO<sub>2</sub>], which was not in contact with the surfaces of AuNPs; inside the SiO<sub>2</sub> layers of @SiO<sub>2</sub> formed by dissolving AuNPs [hereafter, @SiO<sub>2</sub>-DTBTA-Eu(III)/SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs]; inside SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs [hereafter, DTBTA-Eu(III)/SiO<sub>2</sub>]; and outside the surfaces of SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs [hereafter, SiO<sub>2</sub> -NP-DTBTA-Eu (III)] in which DTATB-Eu (III) was bound to the outer surfaces of and inside SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs via 3-aminoorthosilicate (APS). [AuNP@SiO<sub>2</sub>-DTBTA-Eu (III)/SiO<sub>2</sub>, @SiO<sub>2</sub>-DTBTA-Eu (III)/SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs, DTBTA-Eu (III)/SiO<sub>2</sub>, and SiO<sub>2</sub>-NP-DTBTA-Eu (III)] were prepared by a sol-gel method. Their fluorescence indicated three typical narrow high-intensity peaks of Eu<sup>3+</sup> at 585, 595, and 614 nm. Both the increase and decrease in fluorescence intensity were observed in the presence of Au NPs in the outer surfaces of (AuNP@SiO<sub>2</sub>)-DTBTA-Eu (III) compared with free DTBTA-Eu (III) molecules. At high concentrations of AuNPs, the fluorescence intensity decreased because of a large absorbance from 300 to 600 nm. The lifetime of fluorescence increased in the presence of AuNPs and decreased in the absence of AuNPs. We also investigated the relationship between the addition of SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs and AuNPs to DTBTA-Eu (III) molecules in an aqueous solution and the behavior of lifetime.
40229629	Thematic Analysis of Barriers to Completion of a Healthcare Proxy at a Comprehensive Cancer Center.	Advance care planning is an important component of comprehensive oncology care. Advance directives serve to extend patient autonomy and empower patients to have their preferences and values honored when they cannot speak for themselves. This is a critical component when patients are facing cancer treatment that may challenge their ability to fully participate in their care. A review of institutional practices and procedures identified an opportunity to improve the process for obtaining healthcare proxy documentation, a critical but approachable component of advance care planning. A multi-level assessment was performed utilizing focus groups consisting of patients and community members, medical professionals, and hospital administrators. Areas of concern, misconceptions, and process weaknesses were identified by qualitative thematic analysis. This analysis was utilized to identify institution-specific barriers to completion of a health care proxy. They can then be tailored to develop staff specific education to overcome these barriers, in cooperation with ongoing patient education efforts. The analysis also identified process and workflow barriers to completion, implementation, and access; the result is the identification of multiple opportunities for quality improvement within the cancer care setting. Ultimately, multi-level intervention to improve knowledge and comfort with health care proxies and advance care planning will enhance patient care.
40229626	Emerging cardiovascular risk factors in childhood and adolescence: a narrative review.	It is widely recognized that four key health behaviors-regular physical activity, maintaining a normal BMI, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking-offer significant protection against cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents. However, changes in the lifestyle of families have contributed to the emergence of new behaviors that may impact the health of children and adolescents. This narrative review aims to identify existing evidence on the effect of these arising habits on the cardiovascular health of children and adolescents, mainly on blood pressure and endothelial function. A thorough search was conducted across various databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Science Direct and EBSCO.
40229625	Comprehensive Plasma Proteomic Profiling Reveals Differentially Regulated Signaling Pathways Underlying Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Between Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Aortic Stenosis.	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic myocardial disease, characterized by asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) due to sarcomeric mutations. Aortic stenosis (AS) results in concentric LVH, due to pressure overload. The aim of this study was to identify signaling pathways differentially regulated in HCM compared to AS, using plasma proteomic profiling. 76 HCM cases and 36 AS controls were matched by age and sex. A machine-learning (ML) model to predict HCM was built in the training set (70% cohort) and examined in the test set (30% cohort). Pathway analysis of proteins differentially expressed between HCM and AS was performed. The ML model accurately distinguished HCM from AS, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.79-1.00). Pathway analysis revealed differential regulation of Ras-MAPK, inflammatory and metabolic pathways. In conclusion, this study identified distinctive proteomic profiles and signaling pathways underlying LVH in HCM compared to AS.
40229624	Connecting the Dots: Stress Granule and Cardiovascular Diseases.	Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less cytoplasmic assemblies composed of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that transiently form to cope with various cellular stressors by halting mRNA translation and, consequently, protein synthesis. SG formation plays a crucial role in regulating multiple cellular processes, including cellular senescence, inflammatory responses, and adaptation to oxidative stress under both physiological and pathological conditions. Dysregulation of SG assembly and disassembly has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, viral and bacterial infections, and degenerative diseases. In this review, we survey the key aspects of SGs biogenesis and biological functions, with a particular focus on their causal involvement in CVDs. Furthermore, we summarized several SG-modulating compounds and discussed the therapeutic potential of small molecules targeting SG-related diseases in clinical settings.

40229621	Futility Interim Analyses - A Plea for Simplicity.	Futility interim analyses remain a topic of anxiety for most clinical drug development teams. While they can significantly reduce the risk involved in the development of innovative therapies and do so at a minimal cost, they are not used frequently enough. Development teams often shy away due to the fear of terminating a potentially successful therapy by mistake. We believe these risks are overestimated and hence necessitate a simple and effective communication to be better understood. The planning of futilities often evolves into complex statistical modeling exercises where various scenarios are simulated and multiple risk metrics are calculated. To assist teams in such discussions we propose a straightforward strategy for establishing a range for the futility threshold and an intuitive futility risk measure to evaluate the associated risks.
40229620	How long for gastrointestinal recovery following small bowel, right, or left colonic resection with anastomosis in a full fast-track recovery protocol?	Patients undergoing bowel resection with anastomosis experience postoperative impaired gastrointestinal motility, sometimes leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, delayed passage of flatus and stools, and inability to tolerate solid food. We determined the times for recovery of gastrointestinal motility (in minutes) following intestinal resection with anastomosis.
40229619	Cost-effectiveness and clinical impact of robotic-assisted hepatectomy.	Robotic-assisted hepatectomy has gained traction in hepatobiliary surgery, but its cost-effectiveness compared to traditional surgical approaches remains unclear. This study investigates clinical outcomes and financial implications of robotic-assisted liver surgery in a high-volume center, comparing it with open and laparoscopic methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients undergoing hepatectomy at Lille University Hospital in 2018 and 2021, performed by the institution's first experienced robotic hepatobiliary surgeon. Data on patient demographics, intraoperative details, postoperative outcomes, and costs were analyzed. Costs included hospital stays, surgical materials, and complications, derived from national cost studies. A total of 111 patients were included, with a rise in minimally invasive procedures from 47.5% in 2018 to 75% in 2021. Robotic-assisted hepatectomy was associated with reduced hospital stays, lower complication rates, and fewer severe morbidities compared to laparotomy. The average cost per procedure (all surgical approaches combined) decreased from €12,169 in 2018 to €8,513 in 2021, with robotic surgery offering a significant financial advantage. The total savings for the 71 patients in the 2021 cohort was €259,576, driven primarily by reduced hospitalization times and fewer complications. Robotic-assisted hepatectomy is clinically safe and cost-effective, offering substantial financial savings over traditional surgery. The reduction in postoperative complications and hospital stay durations, particularly for complex cases, highlights the advantages of robotic surgery in hepatobiliary procedures. As surgical expertise increases, robotic surgery represents a sustainable and efficient alternative in liver resection.
40229618	T<sub>peak</sub>-T<sub>end</sub> interval predicts arrhythmia recurrence in idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and early repolarization syndrome.	In about 8% of survivors of sudden cardiac death, no structural or electrical heart disease can be identified. Some of these patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) present ECG markers of early repolarization (Early Repolarization Syndrome, ERS). The T<sub>peak</sub>-T<sub>end</sub> interval has been linked to increased arrhythmic risk in different clinical settings, such as Brugada syndrome or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As there is limited data about the relationship of T<sub>peak</sub>-T<sub>end</sub> and arrhythmogenesis in IVF, respectively, its significance in risk stratification in ERS, the aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between sustained ventricular arrhythmia (VA) recurrences in these patients and the T<sub>peak</sub>-T<sub>end</sub> interval.

40229616	Rejecting an irrelevant singleton in the absence of a competing target.	Theories of visual distraction handling commonly propose that mechanisms of distractor rejection are engaged because irrelevant, salient objects tend to dominate the attentional competition with the target. Consequently, the resulting misallocation of attention is thought to trigger distractor suppression, ultimately reducing unwanted attentional capture. Using a modified version of the classic additional-singleton paradigm based on four consecutive displays in each trial, where the target and the distractor competed for attention only in the last one, we demonstrated that the attentional capture elicited by a color singleton was strongly attenuated when the singleton repeatedly appeared within the same trial, even in the absence of a competing target. Importantly, this capture attenuation was not associated with target impairment when the target appeared at the singleton location, suggesting that the within-trial rejection was likely controlled by an expectation-based mechanism rather than a suppressive one. Our findings point to the existence of distinct within-trial and across-trials rejection mechanisms, potentially operating on different timescales and involving suppressive and nonsuppressive processes.

It is thought that determining the impact and importance of technostress on nursing practices and roles that may be caused by robotic surgery technology, which has been widely used, will lead to the development of strategies to prevent or reduce technostress by understanding the challenges and opportunities involved in using new technology. This study was conducted in the operating theatre of a university hospital in Istanbul between May and September 2022. The sample of the study consisted of 11 operating room nurses with at least 6 months of robotic surgery nursing experience who agreed to participate in the study on the dates of the study. The data of the study were collected with a 'Personal Information Form' consisting of 14 questions and a 'Semi-Structured Interview Form' consisting of 6 questions, which were created in line with the literature and audio-recorded by in-depth interview technique. The majority of the robotic surgery nurses who participated in the study were female and received training on robotic surgery nursing. As a result of the analysis, the themes of the effect of technology on the practices of robotic surgery nurses, education and skill development, work stress and management, team dynamics and cooperation, thoughts about the future of robotic surgery, and suggestions for robotic surgery were obtained. The results of this study revealed that robotic surgery nurses working in high-tech environments are at high risk for technological stress.
40229608	Exploring endothelial dysfunction in major rheumatic diseases: current trends and future directions.	The relationship between rheumatic diseases (RDs) and endothelial dysfunction (ED) is intricate and multifaceted, with chronic inflammation and immune system dysregulation playing key roles. RDs, including Osteoarthritis (OA), Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE), Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), Sjogren's syndrome (SS), Systemic sclerosis (SSc), Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) are characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, leading to ED. ED is marked by reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, increased oxidative stress, and heightened pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic activities, which are crucial in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and systemic inflammation. This association persists even in RD patients without conventional cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting a direct impact of RD-related inflammation on endothelial function. Studies also show that ED significantly contributes to atherosclerosis, thereby elevating cardiovascular risk in RD patients. This review synthesizes the molecular mechanisms connecting major RDs and ED, highlighting potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Ultimately, the review aims to enhance understanding of the complex interactions leading to ED in rheumatic patients and inform strategies to mitigate cardiovascular risks and improve patient outcomes.

40229603	Research dynamics and drug treatment of renal fibrosis from a mitochondrial perspective: a historical text data analysis based on bibliometrics.	Renal fibrosis (RF) represents a significant public health challenge, necessitating the urgent identification of effective and safe therapeutic agents. Mitochondrial-targeted strategies have demonstrated considerable promise in restoring renal function and mitigating fibrosis. This study aims to examine the evolution of research and therapeutic interventions for RF from a mitochondrial perspective through bibliometric analysis. Literature retrieval was primarily conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection. Visual analysis was performed utilizing the Bibliometrix package (R- 4.4.2), CiteSpace 6.3.R1, and VOSviewer 1.6.19. A total of 819 documents were included for analysis. Significant contributions were made by researchers from China and the USA, with Nanjing Medical University leading in publication volume. Zhang Aihua and Huang Songming emerge as key scholars in the field, while the International Journal of Molecular Sciences is the journal with the highest publication output. Key research themes include oxidative stress, expression, injury, activation, mechanisms, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial-targeted approaches for treating RF can be categorized into six main strategies: mitochondrial biogenesis regulators, mitochondrial dynamics modulators, mitophagy inducers, oxidative stress regulators, NLRP3 inhibitors, and other mitochondrial-targeted therapeutic approaches. This study comprehensively examines the current state of RF research from a mitochondrial standpoint, summarizing key drugs and potential mechanisms of mitochondrial regulation. The findings aim to enhance scholarly understanding of the ongoing research trends and provide valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic agents.
40229602	Polydatin protects against leukemia by inducing apoptosis and activating autophagy via p38-MAPK pathway.	The clinical treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains suboptimal, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Polydatin, a major active component of the Chinese herb Polygonum cuspidatum, exhibits multiple antitumor properties. However, its potential anti-AML effects and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, MOLM-13 cells, a representative cell line for AML, were treated with polydatin, and its effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry. The expression levels of key apoptotic and autophagic markers, including death receptors (DR4 and DR5), tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), Bcl-2, Bax, LC3, Beclin1, and P62, were analyzed by western blotting. Furthermore, autophagy levels were evaluated using GFP-LC3 fluorescence and monodansylcadaverine staining. To elucidate the relationship between polydatin and autophagy, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and the p38-MAPK activator SB203580 were employed. Polydatin significantly inhibited AML cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and autophagic flux, caused cell cycle arrest in the S phase, reduced Δψm, and promoted ROS generation. Following polydatin treatment, the protein expression levels of DR4, TRAIL, Bax, LC3, and Beclin1 were significantly increased, while DR5, Bcl-2, and P62 were markedly reduced. Additionally, SB203580 promoted polydatin's effects on cell proliferation inhibition, ROS generation, and autophagic flux, whereas 3-MA reversed these effects. These findings demonstrate that polydatin exerts anti-leukemic effects by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis through the activation of autophagy via the p38-MAPK pathway in MOLM-13 AML cells. This suggests that polydatin could serve as a potential therapeutic agent for AML.
40229601	Wheat tandem kinase RWT4 directly binds a fungal effector to activate defense.	Plants have intricate innate immune receptors that detect pathogens. Research has intensely focused on two receptor classes recognizing external and internal threats. Recent research has identified a class of disease-resistance proteins called tandem kinase proteins (TKPs). We investigated RWT4, a wheat TKP that confers resistance to the devastating fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. We established a rice protoplast system, revealing RWT4 specifically recognizes the AvrPWT4 effector, leading to the transcription of defense genes and inducing cell death. RWT4 possesses both kinase and pseudokinase domains, with its kinase activity essential for defense. RWT4 directly interacts with and transphosphorylates AvrPWT4. Biolayer interferometry revealed both RWT4 kinase and pseudokinase regions bind the effector. Sequence similarity and structural modeling revealed a partial kinase duplication in RWT4's kinase region as critical for effector interaction and defense activation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TKPs can directly bind a recognized effector, leading to downstream defense activation.
40229600	Longitudinal single-cell multiomic atlas of high-risk neuroblastoma reveals chemotherapy-induced tumor microenvironment rewiring.	High-risk neuroblastoma, a leading cause of pediatric cancer mortality, exhibits substantial intratumoral heterogeneity, contributing to therapeutic resistance. To understand tumor microenvironment evolution during therapy, we longitudinally profiled 22 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma before and after induction chemotherapy using single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. This revealed profound shifts in tumor and immune cell subpopulations after therapy and identified enhancer-driven transcriptional regulators of neuroblastoma neoplastic states. Poor outcome correlated with proliferative and metabolically active neoplastic states, whereas more differentiated neuronal-like states predicted better prognosis. Proportions of mesenchymal neoplastic cells increased after therapy and a high proportion correlated with a poorer chemotherapy response. Macrophages significantly expanded towards pro-angiogenic, immunosuppressive and metabolic phenotypes. We identified paracrine signaling networks and validated the HB-EGF-ERBB4 axis between macrophage and neoplastic subsets, which promoted tumor growth through the induction of ERK signaling. These findings collectively reveal intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of therapy response in high-risk neuroblastoma.
40229599	Genome-wide analyses identify 25 infertility loci and relationships with reproductive traits across the allele frequency spectrum.	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) may help inform the etiology of infertility. Here, we perform GWAS meta-analyses across seven cohorts in up to 42,629 cases and 740,619 controls and identify 25 genetic risk loci for male and female infertility. We additionally identify up to 269 genetic loci associated with follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol and testosterone through sex-specific GWAS meta-analyses (n = 6,095-246,862). Exome sequencing analyses reveal that women carrying testosterone-lowering rare variants in some genes are at risk of infertility. However, we find no local or genome-wide genetic correlation between female infertility and reproductive hormones. While infertility is genetically correlated with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, we find limited genetic overlap between infertility and obesity. Finally, we show that the evolutionary persistence of infertility-risk alleles may be explained by directional selection. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive view of the genetic determinants of infertility across multiple diagnostic criteria.
40229598	Global trends and insights of telesurgery research: a bibliometric analysis of publications since the 21st century.	In recent years, telesurgery has shown a rapid development trend as an innovative surgical technique, and been applied to the clinical treatment of various tumor diseases. However, the current research on telesurgery is still relatively fragmented, lacking a systematic summary of its development and future directions. Addressing these limitations is crucial for advancing the application of this novel surgical technology.
40229597	Preoperative angio-CT colonography improves the quality of lymph node dissection during minimally invasive right hemicolectomy: a propensity score-matched study.

40229596	Use of an abdominal binder in colonoscopies performed by trainees in gastrointestinal endoscopy: a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial.	Colonoscopy is a widely used diagnostic and therapeutic tool for colonic diseases and serves as the preferred screening method for colorectal cancer (CRC). A common difficulty during colonoscopy is the looping of the colon, which can result in patient discomfort, prolonged cecal intubation time (CIT), and the need for auxiliary maneuvers. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using an abdominal binder during colonoscopy performed by trainees.

40229592	The NET-DNA-CCDC25 inhibitor di-Pal-MTO suppresses tumor progression and promotes the innate immune response.	The DNA component of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET-DNA) is associated with cancer metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. However, recent studies have suggested that NET-DNA contributes to the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and promotes the innate immune response to anticancer immunity. Therefore, exploring therapeutic approaches to inhibit NET-mediated tumor progression while maintaining antitumor immunity is essential. Our groups recently identified CCDC25 as a specific NET-DNA sensor on the cytoplasmic membrane of cancer cells that promotes cancer metastasis. In this study, we performed small-molecule compound screening and revealed that mitoxantrone (MTO) could block the interaction between NET-DNA and CCDC25. Molecular docking results indicated that MTO competed with NET-DNA by binding with the amino acid residues Tyr<sup>24</sup> (Y24), Glu<sup>25</sup> (E25), and Asp<sup>28</sup> (D28) of the crystal structure of CCDC25. More importantly, we conjugated MTO with palmitoleic acids such as di-Pal-MTO to increase its residence time on the cytoplasmic membrane, which increased its inhibitory efficiency and decreased its cytotoxicity. In addition, di-Pal-MTO markedly inhibited the RAC1-CDC42 cascade to alleviate the NET-induced cytoskeleton arrangement and chemotactic migration of cancer cells. In multiple mouse models, di-Pal-MTO can suppress breast cancer metastasis and have synergistic effects with chemotherapeutics. Moreover, di-Pal-MTO promotes NET-DNA-dependent DC activation, leading to the subsequent expression of various chemokines that facilitate the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Overall, we successfully identified a small molecule inhibitor, di-Pal-MTO, with dual effects on tumor repression and the antitumor immune response, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy against breast cancer.
40229591	Trends of robotic total joint arthroplasty utilization in the United States from 2010 to 2022: a nationwide assessment.	The adoption of robotic assistance in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) is growing rapidly worldwide. This study aims to evaluate recent trends in the utilization of robotic-assisted TKA and THA across the United States spanning a 12-year period. This retrospective analysis utilized the PearlDiver All Payer Claims Database to identify patients who underwent primary, elective primary TKA or THA between 2010 and 2022. Procedures were categorized as conventional or robot assisted based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9), ICD-10, and Current Procedural Technology (CPT) codes. Patient demographics were captured including age, sex, and comorbidities. Annual usage trends for each modality were analyzed. Simple linear regressions were utilized to evaluate changes in the proportion of annual robot-assisted TJA performed over time relative to total procedures. P values < 0.05 were significant. Of the 2,294,076 total TKAs performed between 2010 and 2022, 1.58% were robotic assisted. Similarly, of the 1,235,577 total THAs performed, 1.26% utilized robotic assistance. Robotic TKA accounted for a steadily increasing percentage of total TKA procedures, significantly growing from 0.35% in 2010 to 3.45% in 2022, peaking at 4.39% in 2019 (P < 0.001). Similarly, robotic THA utilization showed significant growth, increasing from 0.26% in 2010 to 2.36% in 2022, peaking at 3.59% in 2019 (P < 0.001). The use of robotic-assisted TKA and THA has seen significant growth across the United States. Robotic TKA and THA have become increasingly utilized technologies, with steady growth in adoption since 2010.Level of evidence: III.

40229587	Hydroxyurea in the management of sickle cell disease-associated priapism: a scoping review.	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemolytic-hemoglobinopathy that affects the ability of erythrocytes to deliver oxygen in the body. Hydroxyurea is a pharmacologic agent that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD crises since 1998. It has also been proposed as a therapy for recurrent ischemic priapism (RIP), recurrent prolonged or unwanted erections in the absence of sexual stimulation, which occurs commonly in SCD. The premise behind hydroxyurea's therapeutic effect is that it improves vascular function and hemoglobin metabolism. Its potential role in RIP is to normalize the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, which is fundamental for the regulatory physiology of the erection response. Hydroxyurea has been investigated in diverse research studies, including a recent clinical trial, showing its potential benefit for treating RIP. In this article, we performed a scoping review of the effectiveness of hydroxyurea for the treatment of SCD-associated RIP.
40229585	Temperate forest plants are associated with heterogeneous semi-open canopy conditions shaped by large herbivores.	Temperate forest plant diversity is declining despite increasing conservation efforts. The closed forest paradigm, emphasizing dense, continuous canopy cover, dominates current forest management strategies. However, this approach may overlook the historical role of large herbivores in maintaining semi-open forest conditions. Here we analyse the light and herbivory preferences of 917 native temperate forest plant species across central and western Europe, comparing these preferences with light availability in untouched closed-canopy forests and pasture woodlands. Plant species are 0.1-10 Myr old, with phylogenetic conservatism in habitat affinities (niche optima); thus, their distribution reflects long-term environmental states. We found that most temperate forest plants favour heterogeneous, semi-open-canopy conditions associated with high large-herbivore impacts, rather than uniform closed-canopy environments. On the basis of Red List criteria, high-affinity forest plants associated with higher herbivory and lower herbaceous biomass face higher extinction risk, indicating that low large-herbivore densities drive extinctions in present-day forests. These results align with palaeoecological evidence and high biodiversity in modern open woodlands, suggesting that closed-canopy dominance is a recent consequence of human-driven herbivore loss. Recognizing the role of large herbivores in maintaining semi-open vegetation offers new insights for biodiversity conservation and challenges the suitability of closed-canopy models in forest management.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore how breast cancer shapes Latino couples' relationships throughout the cancer care continuum.
40229581	Temporal oscillation of phospholipids promotes metabolic efficiency.	Biological timing is a fundamental aspect of life, facilitating efficient resource use and adaptation to environmental changes. In this study, we unveil robust temporal oscillations in phospholipid abundance as a function of the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC). These fluctuations, occurring throughout the cell division cycle, demonstrate a systematic segregation of various phospholipid species over time. Such segregation corresponds logically with their physical properties, generating entropic forces for membrane dynamics and biogenesis. Within the YMC, the temporal oscillations in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine levels require biosynthesis from triacylglycerol as a crucial lipid reservoir, with phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine synthesized primarily de novo. The orchestrated regulation of gene expression in biosynthesis pathways ensures precise temporal control of phospholipid dynamics, ultimately promoting metabolic efficiency.

Indeed, sex and gender are emerging as crucial modifiers of diagnostic and therapeutic pathways in AD. This Review provides an overview of the interactions of sex and gender with important developments in AD and offers insights into priorities for future research to facilitate the development and implementation of personalized approaches in the shifting paradigm of AD care. In particular, this Review focuses on the influence of sex and gender on important advances in the treatment and diagnosis of AD, including disease-modifying therapies, fluid-based biomarkers, cognitive assessment tools and multidomain lifestyle interventional studies.
40229577	Polygenic overlap between subjective well-being and psychiatric disorders and cross-ancestry validation.	Subjective well-being (SWB) is important for understanding human behaviour and health. Although the connection between SWB and psychiatric disorders has been studied, common genetic mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the genetic relationship between SWB and psychiatric disorders. Bivariate causal mixture modelling (MiXeR), polygenic risk score (PRS) and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses showed substantial polygenic overlap and associations between SWB and the psychiatric disorders. Subsequent replication studies in East Asian populations confirmed the polygenic overlap between schizophrenia and SWB. The conditional and conjunctional false discovery rate analyses identified additional or shared genetic loci associated with SWB or psychiatric disorders. Functional annotation revealed enrichment of specific brain tissues and genes associated with SWB. The identified genetic loci showed cross-ancestry transferability between the European and Korean populations. Our findings provide valuable insights into the common genetic mechanisms underlying SWB and psychiatric disorders.
40229576	Political ideology and trust in scientists in the USA.	Trust in scientists is a key predictor of compliance with science-based solutions to societal challenges. Although liberals in the USA generally trust scientists more than conservatives do, it is not clear how these ideological differences vary across different scientific occupations and whether they can be mitigated. Here, in this Registered Report (including 7,800 US participants), we demonstrate that, even though the strength of the relationship between political ideology and trust varies across scientific occupations, liberals (compared with conservatives) show higher trust in most scientists. Moreover, following motivational accounts of scientist distrust, the study tested five theoretically grounded intervention strategies to improve conservatives' trust in scientists. None of the interventions were successful, suggesting that trust in scientists reflects relatively stable attitudes that require more elaborate and time-intensive interventions.
40229575	A meta-analysis of technology use and cognitive aging.	The first generation who engaged with digital technologies has reached the age where risks of dementia emerge. Has technological exposure helped or harmed cognition in digital pioneers? The digital dementia hypothesis predicts that a lifetime of technology exposure worsens cognitive abilities. An alternative hypothesis is that such exposures lead to technological reserve, wherein digital technologies promote behaviours that preserve cognition. We tested these hypotheses in a meta-analysis and systematic review of studies published in Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Science Direct, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest and Web of Science. Studies were included if they were observational or cohort studies focused on general digital technology use in older adults (over age 50) and included either a cognitive or dementia diagnosis outcome. We identified 136 papers that met inclusion criteria, of which 57 were compatible with odds ratio or hazard ratio meta-analysis. These studies included 411,430 adults (baseline age M = 68.7 years; 53.5% female) from cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies (range: 1-18 years, M = 6.2 years). Use of digital technologies was associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.35-0.52) and reduced time-dependent rates of cognitive decline (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.66-0.84). Effects remained significant when accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, health and cognitive reserve proxies. All studies were evaluated for quality on the basis of a standardized checklist; the primary outcomes replicated when limiting analyses to the highest-quality studies. Additional work is needed to test bidirectional causal interpretations, understand mechanisms that underpin technological reserve, and identify how types and timings of technology exposures influence cognitive health.
40229574	CAR T cell therapies in gastrointestinal cancers: current clinical trials and strategies to overcome challenges.	Despite multimodal treatment options, most gastrointestinal cancers are still associated with high mortality rates and poor responsiveness to immunotherapy. The unprecedented efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells in the treatment of haematological malignancies raised interest in translating CAR T cell therapies to the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. Treatment of solid cancers with canonical CAR T cells faces substantial challenges, including the dense architecture of the tumour tissue, the tolerogenic environment with low tumour-intrinsic immunogenicity, the rareness of targetable tumour-selective antigens, the antigenic heterogeneity of cancer cells, and the profound metabolic and immune cell disbalances. This Review provides an overview of CAR T cell trials in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers, discussing considerations relating to safety, efficacy, potential reasons for failure and options for improving CAR T cells for the future. In addition, lessons regarding how to improve efficacy are drawn from CAR T cells armed with adjuvants that sustain their activation within the hostile environment and activate resident immune cells. As the field is rapidly evolving, current treatment modalities and editing CAR T cell functionalities are being refined towards a potentially more successful CAR T cell therapy for gastrointestinal cancers.
40229573	Effect of dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on adiposity indices in children with overweight and obesity: an 8-week triple-blind randomized controlled trial.	We aimed to investigate the potential effects of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on adiposity indices in children with overweight and obesity. This study was a triple-blind, randomized controlled trial. Sixty girls and boys (aged 8-12 years) were randomly assigned to either DASH diet or control group, and the intervention duration was 8 weeks. Body weight (BW), height, waist circumference (WC), skinfold thickness (SFT), neck circumference (NC), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body round index (BRI), and weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) were assessed before and after the intervention. The primary analysis was conducted on a per-protocol basis, including only participants who completed at least two visits and adhered to the study protocol. This approach was chosen to ensure that the results reflect the actual effects of the intervention among compliant participants. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare after treatment adiposity indices between groups. Mean ± SD age and BMI of the participants was 11.8 ± 0.8 years (69% were girls) and 25.9 ± 3.52 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. A total of 58 patients (n = 29 in DASH group and n = 29 in control group) who completed at least two visits and adhered to the study protocol were included in the final per-protocol analysis. Two participants (one from each group) were lost to follow-up and excluded from the analysis due to incomplete data. After 8 weeks, the DASH group had a significantly lower BW (59.5 vs. 62.6 kg), WC (84.3 vs. 85.5 cm), NC (32.9 vs. 33.3 cm), SFT (3.57 vs. 3.57 cm), BMI (25.9 vs. 25.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), WHtR (0.55 vs. 0.56), BRI (4.57 vs. 4.75), and WWI (10.42 vs. 10.84 cm/√kg) compared with the controls (P for all < 0.01). The mean change percent of adiposity indices was higher in the control than the DASH group (P for all < 0.05); however, for the WWI, a significant reduction was observed in the DASH group.

40229568	Mesobuthus eupeus venom modulates colorectal carcinoma signaling pathways and induces apoptosis.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern, often challenging to treat effectively with conventional methods and burdened by adverse effects. Scorpion venoms offer a unique avenue for exploration, given their ability to disrupt the cell cycle, inhibit growth, and trigger apoptosis. This study delves into the impact of Mesobuthus eupeus (M. eupeus) scorpion venom on the proliferation and progression of colorectal cancer at the molecular level. The total protein concentration in the venom (607.5 µg/mL) also emphasized the rich composition and potential for therapeutic applications. The study reveals that M. eupeus venom effectively reduced the proliferation of DLD-1 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.32 and 7.61 µg/mL, respectively. The venom also impedes cell migration, diminishes colony formation, and triggers apoptosis in the cancer cells. The venom also induced early and late apoptosis in the two cancer cell lines. The human colorectal cancer and apoptotic pathways were clarified at the molecular level using pathway panels, which revealed that 16 genes involved in colorectal cancer increased while 23 decreased. In the HT-29 cell line, 57 genes increased, and 1 decreased following venom treatment. Besides, the mRNA expression of 19 genes involved in the apoptotic pathway was increased, while 22 were reduced in DLD-1 cells. This study underscores the potential of M. eupeus venom as a natural therapeutic approach in the quest for cancer treatments.

40229564	Self-healing crystals.	Self-healing is an intrinsically exciting concept as it applies to the process of recovery, a commonplace phenomenon found in living organisms. Self-healing of artificial materials is as beneficial to living creatures as it is to materials science, wherein the effect can considerably prolong lifetimes. Although self-healing sodium chloride crystals were discovered in the 1980s, the field entered a renaissance when healing was observed in the emerging materials class of molecular crystals in 2016. Self-healing properties in polymers, cementitious materials, and coatings have already found commercial applications. The reinvigorated interest in self-healing molecular crystals stems from their prospects as durable, lightweight and flexible emissive or electronic materials. Ideally being defectless and ordered media, organic crystals have unique optical, mechanical and electrical properties, and the possibility of self-healing substantially increases their viability for smart devices.
40229562	Effect of Simvastatin Combined with Photobiomodulation Therapy on Orthodontic Tooth Movement and the Expression of Metalloproteinases and Inhibitors - An Experimental Study.	Statins, such as simvastatin, are commonly used to treat hyperlipidemia and prevent cardiovascular diseases. However, simvastatin may suppress osteoclastogenesis, potentially reducing dental movement during orthodontic treatment. To mitigate this effect, low-level laser irradiation can be used for its photobiomodulatory properties. This study aims to assess the impact of combining simvastatin with photobiomodulation therapy on the regulation of bone metabolism. In this study, 56 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: G1 - no orthodontic movement or simvastatin (n = 8); G2 - orthodontic movement with simvastatin 2.5 mg/kg (n = 16); G3 - orthodontic movement with saline solution and low-level laser 808 nm 1 J/point (n = 16); and G4 - orthodontic movement with simvastatin and low-level laser 808 nm 1 J/point (n = 16). Simvastatin was administered for 14 days, and dental movement was initiated with mini implants for the length of 7 or 14 days. Photobiomodulation occurred every 48 h during the experiment. The animals were euthanized after 14 and 21 days for clinical, histological, and micro-computed tomography analysis, as well as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1) quantification. Statistical analysis was conducted using R software with a 5% significance level. Group G2 showed significantly less dental movement than G3 and G4 (p < 0.05). The BV/TV ratio was higher in G4 compared to G1 and G2. MMP2 levels were higher in G4 than G1 and G2 after 14 days, and in G3 compared to G2. After 21 days, MMP2 was higher in G2 and G3 than G1 and G4, and lower in G1 than G4 (p < 0.05). The results suggest that simvastatin reduces dental movement compared to laser-treated groups.
40229561	Leveraging genetics to understand ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in health and disease.	Endogenous, long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can resemble viral dsRNA and be recognized by cytosolic dsRNA sensors, triggering autoimmunity. Genetic studies of rare, inherited human diseases and experiments using mouse models have established the importance of adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing by the enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) as a critical safeguard against autoinflammatory responses to cellular dsRNA. More recently, human genetic studies have revealed that dsRNA editing and sensing mechanisms are involved in common inflammatory diseases, emphasizing the broader role of dsRNA in modulating immune responses and disease pathogenesis. These findings have highlighted the therapeutic potential of targeting dsRNA editing and sensing, as exemplified by the emergence of ADAR1 inhibition in cancer therapy.

40229557	Experimental study on deformation of sandy soil around bucket foundation under horizontal load.	The deformation features of sandy soil surrounding bucket foundation significantly affect their bearing behavior in terms of horizontal loading. To investigate the interplay system between bucket foundation and soil, this research integrates a model test system into particle imaging velocimetry, with the intention of exploring the deformation and bearing features of the soil surrounding one single bucket and a group of two buckets in horizontal loading. It indicates the following. (1) The soil displacement field (DF) surrounding the single bucket is divided into an active area, passive area, transition area, circular disturbance zone, and translational zone formed inside the bucket, accompanied by a soil arching effect. (2) The form of shear action is upward and downward pressure in front of the bucket wall, and the angle between the shear band and the bucket wall decreases gradually with the increase in the density of sands. (3) As the aspect ratios decrease, the shear action changes from upward and downward pressure in front of the bucket wall towards pressure on two sides of the bucket wall. (4) The group efficiency increases in approximately linear manner as the space-diameter ratio increases, and decreases gradually as the sand density increases.

40229551	Water and aquatic foods in revised principles of agroecology can accelerate food systems transformation.	The interaction between climate change and agricultural intensification contributes to biodiversity loss, while widespread degradation of land and water undermine food system productivity. Agroecological principles aim to guide food systems transformation but rarely refer to water or aquatic foods, which are critical elements of nutritious, sustainable and equitable food systems. Here we examine the principles and frameworks presented in agroecological literature and suggest rephrasing of six of the principles to incorporate water, aquatic foods and land- to seascapes. We recommend three cross-sectoral actions that leverage aquatic features in agroecosystems to facilitate more effective transition pathways towards sustainable food systems.
40229550	Deep learning for video-based assessment of endotracheal intubation skills.	Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is an emergency procedure performed in civilians and combat casualty care settings to establish an airway. It's crucial that healthcare personnel are proficient in these skills, which traditionally have been evaluated through direct feedback from experts. Unfortunately, this method can be inconsistent and subjective, requiring considerable time and resources.
40229549	Performance of typical structural components in basement-addition for existing building.	Basement-addition for existing building plays a crucial role in alleviating urban land shortage. However, the disturbance induced by basement-addition construction to the stability of the building foundation and superstructure has not been well understood. The objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of typical structural components involved in a basement-addition project. They include the columns in the superstructure, the strip foundation beneath the columns, and the piles used for reinforcing the strip foundation during excavation. A three-dimensional finite element model is established, using a basement-addition project of an existing building as a case example. The calculated results by the finite element model align well with the measured data, confirming the model's validity. Based on this, the stress and deformation characteristics associated with the selected structural components during basement-addition construction are investigated. The findings indicate that the stress and deformation characteristics of the structural components are highly sensitive to the depth of the foundation pit excavation, with these characteristics intensifying as excavation depth increases. The excavation of the initial soil layer has the most significant impact. Upon completion of the excavation, the maximum settlement values for the strip foundation (SF), column foot, and pile are -18.6 mm, -13.79 mm, and -16.1 mm, respectively. The underground diaphragm wall (UDW) exhibits maximum vertical and horizontal displacements of 7.6 mm and 18.1 mm, respectively. The pile primarily experiences compressive internal forces, with its axial force showing little sensitivity to excavation depth. The pile's maximum bending moment, shear force, and axial force are 21.2 kN·m, 34 kN, and -2,481 kN, respectively. The internal forces and deformations of structural components demonstrate distinct spatial distribution patterns, with values increasing closer to the foundation pit's center. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance monitoring of the displacement and internal forces of the central components of the foundation pit to prevent engineering accidents. These research findings will contribute positively to the design optimization and construction guidance of similar engineering structures.
40229548	Comparative study of XGBoost and logistic regression for predicting sarcopenia in postsurgical gastric cancer patients.	The use of machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly XGBoost and logistic regression, to predict sarcopenia among postsurgical gastric cancer patients has gained significant attention in recent research. Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, is a serious concern in these patients due to its association with poor postoperative outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality. In this study, machine learning was used to establish a risk prediction model for sarcopenia in patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy to facilitate early intervention and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Gastric cancer patients who underwent surgery at a tertiary comprehensive hospital in Nanjing (China) from January 2022 to December 2023 were retrospectively included in this study, and their clinical and follow-up data were collected. The XGBoost model and multivariate logistic regression analysis model were used to screen the factors related to postoperative outcomes, and the results of the two models were compared. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate the predictive value of the XGBoost model. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method was used to explain the XGBoost model and determine the impact of features on the prediction model. A total of 231 postoperative gastric cancer patients were included in this study, of whom 128 (55.4%) developed sarcopenia. The results of the univariate analysis and LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression were cross-validated, and 5 key study variables were ultimately determined: serum albumin, comorbid diabetes, operation style, nutritional score, and ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status score. The XGBoost model has slightly better AUC (0.987, 95% CI: 0.976-0.998) than the logistic regression model (0.918, 95% CI: 0.873-0.963) in the training set. The SHAP analysis showed that in the XGBoost model, diabetes, nutritional score, and serum albumin have a greater impact on the sarcopenia risk prediction after gastric cancer surgery, especially the impact of diabetes and nutritional score is the most significant, followed by the ECOG performance status score, and operation style has the least impact. In summary, the machine learning-based sarcopenia prediction model constructed in this study provides a valuable decision support tool for clinical screening and intervention of sarcopenia.
40229547	Prenatal diagnosis of imprinted associated chromosome abnormalities identified by noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT).	To explore the clinical value of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) combined with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA)/copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq), methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the early screening of imprinted chromosome abnormalities. We retrospectively studied the prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy outcomes of 9 pregnant women with imprinted associated chromosome abnormalities via NIPT. All pregnant women received detailed genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. Karyotyping analysis, CNV-seq, CMA, FISH or MS-MLPA were performed on the amniotic fluid samples. We collected the intrauterine phenotypes via ultrasound and followed them up until the induction of labor or one year after birth. Six fetuses (6 out of 9) were diagnosed with regional abnormalities of Imprinting Disease. The most commonly diagnosed syndrome was 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome ( 3 out of 6), followed by mosaic trisomy 7 (2 out of 6) and Temple syndrome (1 out of 6). The other three fetuses (3 out of 9) were diagnosed with absence of heterozygosity (AOH). After genetic counselling, 4 pregnant women (4 out of 9) chose induced labor, 3 pregnant women (3 out of 9) chose spontaneous labor, and 2 pregnant women (2 out of 9) chose cesarean section. The widespread use of NIPT in prenatal screening provides more opportunities to detect rare chromosome aneuploidies (RCAs) and microdeletion/microduplication syndromes (MMSs) in mid-pregnancy. The combination of NIPT and other prenatal diagnostic technologies can help increase the possibility of detecting imprinting-related diseases with no phenotype or a late phenotype in utero.

40229543	Unassisted self-healing photocatalysts based on Le Chatelier's principle.	Self-healing is a fundamental ability inherent in humans, plants, and other living organisms. To date, a variety of materials with self-healing properties have been developed. However, these materials usually require external inputs such as electric potentials or healing agents to initiate or promote self-healing reactions. Herein, we present a novel self-healing mechanism that operates without any external input, utilizing the dynamic equilibrium between the solid-state and dissolved materials. We employed organic-inorganic perovskites to validate our strategy. Single-particle spectroscopy and imaging demonstrated the spontaneous self-healing of perovskites after photodamage under dynamic equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, we found that perovskites can generate hydrogen in both healed and damaged states. Remarkably, the perovskites exhibited hydrogen generation over four cycles of photodamage and self-healing. The proposed concept and experimental results provide valuable insights for the development of energy conversion and storage systems with improved long-term durability.
40229541	Gamma-hydroxybutyrate to promote slow-wave sleep in major depressive disorder: a randomized crossover trial.	In major depressive disorder (MDD), main clinical features include insomnia and increased daytime sleepiness. However, specific treatment options to promote sleep in MDD are limited. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB, administered as sodium oxybate) is a GHB/GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist used clinically in narcolepsy, where it promotes restorative slow-wave sleep (SWS) while reducing next-day sleepiness. Hence, we performed a randomized, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial to investigate the sleep-promoting properties of GHB in individuals with MDD. Outpatients aged 20-65 years fulfilling the DSM-5 criteria for MDD were enrolled. A single nocturnal dose of GHB (50 mg/kg) was compared with a single evening dose of the clinical competitor trazodone (1.5 mg/kg) and placebo. Of 29 randomized patients, 23 received at least one intervention and were included in the analysis. Primary outcomes were nocturnal slow wave sleep ([SWS] assessed by polysomnography), next-day vigilance (median response time and number of lapses on the psychomotor vigilance test [PVT]), next-day working memory (median speed and accuracy on an N-back task), and next-day plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. GHB robustly prolonged SWS compared to both trazodone and placebo. GHB also prolonged total sleep time and enhanced sleep efficiency, while reducing sleep stages N1, N2, and wake-after-sleep-onset. While the median response time on the next-day PVT was unaffected, GHB reduced the number of lapses compared to trazodone and placebo. No effects on next-day working memory performance and BDNF levels were observed. No serious adverse events occurred. Overall, a single nocturnal dose of GHB effectively promotes SWS and shows more favorable effects on next-day vigilance than trazodone and placebo. Future studies should investigate GHB in clinical settings, including repeated administration.
40229540	Behavioural effects of oral cannabidiol (CBD) treatment in the superoxide dismutase 1 G93 A (SOD1<sup>G93 A</sup>) mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting voluntary muscle movement as well as cognitive and other behavioural domains at later disease stages. No effective treatment for ALS is currently available. Elevated neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and alterations to the endocannabinoid system are evident in ALS. The phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Thus, we evaluated the remedial effects of chronic oral cannabidiol (CBD) treatment on ALS-relevant behavioural domains in the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mouse model of ALS that carries a G93A mutation (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>).

40229536	How we treat mantle cell lymphoma with cellular therapy in 2025: the European and American perspectives.	Cellular therapies have been cornerstones of the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) for decades and have helped to improve the outcome of this formerly very unfavourable B-cell lymphoma considerably. Current established roles of cellular therapies include autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as part of first-line therapy, chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T-cells (CART) for relapsed/refractory MCL, and allogeneic HCT for settings in which CARTs have failed or are unavailable. Therapeutic innovations have recently entered the MCL treatment landscape and are moving upstream in treatment algorithms, challenging the existing management principles. The purpose of this paper is to give some guidance regarding how to best use cellular therapies in this increasingly complex environment. Due to differences in CART labels, available non-cellular treatment options, and philosophy between the American and the European health systems, we found it reasonable to contrast the American and European perspectives on defined standard scenarios, which are often overlapping but show discrepancies in some important aspects.
40229535	Teduglutide for treatment-refractory severe intestinal acute graft-versus-host disease - a multicenter survey.	Intestinal glucocorticoid-refractory (SR) acute (a) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) causes high non-relapse mortality (NRM) in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Recent preclinical data indicate that acute GVHD causes a loss of intestinal neuroendocrine L-cells leading to reduced levels of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). GLP-2 substitution improved GVHD severity and increased Paneth cells and intestinal stem cells in mice. This motivated us to treat patients with refractory intestinal aGHVD using the GLP-2-analogon teduglutide. In this retrospective multicenter survey, 17 patients received teduglutide as salvage-therapy for SR-intestinal aGVHD. The best response (CR or PR) at any time point during and after treatment was 64.7% (11/17) including 41.2% (7/17) CR and 23.5% (4/17) PR. At a median follow-up of 28 weeks after teduglutide 10/17 patients are alive. Most patients experienced an increase of the albumin serum level within 2 months after the first teduglutide dose, including patients who clinically did not respond to teduglutide treatment. No specific teduglutide-related toxicity was observed. Our retrospective analysis suggests that teduglutide is safe and has activity in a fraction of patients with intestinal SR-aGVHD, which needs validation in a prospective trial.
40229534	Distributional dual-process model predicts strategic shifts in decision-making under uncertainty.	In an uncertain world, human decision-making often involves adaptively leveraging different strategies to maximize gains. These strategic shifts, however, are overlooked by many traditional reinforcement learning models. Here, we incorporate parallel evaluation systems into distribution-based modeling and propose an entropy-weighted dual-process model that leverages Dirichlet and multivariate Gaussian distributions to represent frequency and value-based decision-making strategies, respectively. Model simulations and empirical tests demonstrated that our model outperformed traditional RL models by uniquely capturing participants' strategic change from value-based to frequency-based learning in response to heightened uncertainty. As reward variance increased, participants switched from focusing on actual rewards to using reward frequency as a proxy for value, thereby showing greater preference for more frequently rewarded but less valuable options. These findings suggest that increased uncertainty encourages the compensatory use of diverse evaluation methods, and our dual-process model provides a promising framework for studying multi-system decision-making in complex, multivariable contexts.

40229531	Electrochemical detection of S. typhimurium based on peroxidase-like activity of gold nanoparticle-doped CuZr-MOF nanozyme.	An electrochemical biosensor using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-doped bimetallic-organic framework (BMOF) with enhanced peroxidase-like activity was constructed to detect Salmonella Typhimurium (S. typhimurium). The BMOF of CuZr-MOF was synthesized via a two-step method and used as carrier to in situ immobilize AuNPs. Due to the stability of Zr-MOF, the good electrocatalytic ability of Cu (II), and the synergetic effects of AuNPs, Cu (II) and Zr (IV), the prepared AuNPs@CuZr-MOF nanozyme showed improved stability and catalytic activity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation. The oxidation reaction was found to be a surface-controlled process of electron transfer and a pH-dependent electron transfer process of oxidation reaction involving two electrons. Further, AuNPs@CuZr-MOF was biofunctionalized with signal DNA probe, forming sDNA-AuNPs@CuZr-MOF nanotags. The biosensing platform was constructed on a glassy carbon electrode modified sequentially with electrodeposited AuNPs, capture DNA probe (cDNA), and BSA. Finally, a sandwich-type detection structure was formed by hybridization reactions between cDNA and target invA gene of S. typhimurium, as well as between invA gene and the sDNA of sDNA@AuNPs@CuZr-MOF nanotags. Under optimized experimental conditions, the biosensor achieved a linear range of 1 × 10<sup>-16</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>-8</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup> for the target invA gene with a detection limit (LOD) of 6.2 × 10<sup>-17</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup> using differential pulse voltammetry measurement (DPV). It was successfully applied to the direct and quantitative detection of invA gene segments in total DNA extracts of S. typhimurium, showing a linear range from 3.5 to 3.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU mL<sup>-1</sup> and a LOD of 0.82 CFU mL<sup>-1</sup>. The fabricated biosensor exhibited good selectivity, reproducibility, and storage stability, enabling its use for the detection of invA gene segments in contaminated milk, with recoveries between 95.9% and 103.1%.
40229530	Exploring the relationship of platelet aggregation function with efficacy and safety outcomes following the administration of prasugrel and clopidogrel in patients with thrombotic stroke: a post hoc analysis of PRASTRO pooled studies.	The P2Y12 receptor inhibitor prasugrel was approved for thrombotic stroke in Japan following the phase 3 clinical trials PRASTRO-I, -II, and -III. However, correlations between elevated platelet reaction unit (PRU) and ischemic event risk remain unclear. This post hoc integrated analysis of PRASTRO-I, -II, and -III assessed the relationships of PRU with efficacy and safety outcomes, and risk factors for high PRU (HPR). Patients from PRASTRO-I, -II, and -III receiving prasugrel or clopidogrel and with PRU values at 4 and 24 weeks after treatment initiation were included. The primary endpoint was PRU at 4 weeks; secondary endpoints included cumulative incidence of ischemic and bleeding events from study drug initiation to 48 weeks. Exploratory univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify HPR risk factors. Of 2688 patients analyzed, 2595 and 2434 had PRU values available at 4 and 24 weeks, respectively. Mean PRU was numerically lower with prasugrel than clopidogrel at 4 weeks (151.3 vs. 195.4) and 24 weeks (143.8 vs. 188.0). CYP2C19 polymorphisms affected PRU at 4 and 24 weeks with clopidogrel but not with prasugrel. PRU at 4 weeks did not predict ischemic and bleeding event incidence up to 48 weeks. The CYP2C19 poor metabolizer phenotype was the strongest HPR risk factor. PRU values at 4 and 24 weeks were numerically lower with prasugrel and unaffected by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship of PRU with ischemic and bleeding events.

40229528	Association between time to geriatric ward admission and change in functional status in older adults after an emergency department visit: a prospective cohort study.	The impact of total time from emergency department (ED) admission to geriatric ward admission in older patients remains unknown. The objective of the study was to assess the association between time to geriatric ward admission on 6-month mortality and functional decline in older adults. A prospective, single-center cohort study was conducted including patients 75 years or older admitted to an acute-care geriatric unit following an ED visit in 2023 with a 6-month follow-up. Functional decline was defined as a decrease of at least 1 point in the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale between admission and 6 months. The primary end point was a composite of 6-month mortality and functional decline. Association between quartiles of time to geriatric ward admission and the primary end point was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Among the 360 included patients (median age 86, median time to geriatric ward admission 32.2 h), 198 (55%) experienced the composite outcome (31% death and 24% functional decline): 42%, 47%, 60%, and 71% in the first to last quartile, respectively. Compared to the first quartile, there was an independent association between time to geriatric ward admission and the primary outcome with an adjusted odds ratios of 1.4 (95% CI 0.8-2.7), 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.3), and 3.4 (95% CI 1.8-6.6) for the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively. Prolonged time to geriatric ward admission following ED consultation is associated with a higher risk of 6-month mortality and functional decline in older adults.Trial registration 2023-A02753-42 (CPP Sud-Est V approval).
40229527	Use of herbal products by diabetic patients in coping with health problems: a cross-sectional study from Turkey.	This study aimed to determine the herbal products used by type 2 diabetes patients for health problems, the purpose of use, and related factors. This cross-sectional study employed a face-to-face interview with patients who had applied to the diabetes outpatient clinic between June-October 2022. The questionnaire included questions about personal characteristics, data related to disease and treatment, the herbal products used, and their intended use. The mean age of the 280 patients was 58.18 ± 9.4 years, with 63.9% female. A total It 30.4% patients reported the use of herbal products. Those with a high school education or above used it significantly more than those with less education (p = 0.014). No significant relationship was found between herbal product use and diabetes duration, insulin use and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Patients with nephropathy used herbal products at a significantly lower rate compared to those without nephropathy (p = 0.045). The main reasons for using herbal products were determined as regulating blood sugar (58.8%), losing weight (17.6%), lowering cholesterol (14.1%) and lowering blood pressure (9.4%) and other reasons. Most frequently used herbs were olive leaf, cinnamon, black seed for regulate blood sugar; walnut juice, lemon for hyperlipidemia; garlic, lemon for hypertension, lemon, green tea for weight problem. Approximately one-third of type 2 diabetic patients used herbal products for managing blood glucose, weight, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Education level and the presence of nephropathy were significant factors influencing herbal product use.

40229525	SPARC: a key mediator of apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and its role in hypertension mechanism.	Hypertensionis a leading global health issue associated with high mortality and severe complications. Understanding its molecular mechanisms is essential for identifying novel therapeutic targets. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is associated with cell migration, disease pathophysiology, and inflammation; however, its role in hypertension remains under investigation. This study investigates the role of SPARC in hypertension, focusing on its impact on endothelial dysfunction.Using the GSE75815 dataset from the GEO database, we identified 71 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with hypertension. Pathway analyses and protein-protein interaction networks constructed through the STRING database highlighted six hub genes, with further evaluation based on Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) scores. Immune cell profiling via ImmuCellAI revealed an increase in naive B cells, positively correlating with hub gene expression.Experimental validation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with angiotensin II demonstrated that SPARC downregulation reduced apoptosis and BAX expression. Silencing SPARC enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and nitric oxide production, counteracting angiotensin II-induced damage. Notably, angiotensin II upregulated SPARC secretion, suggesting its critical role in mediating endothelial dysfunction.These findings establish SPARC as a key contributor to the molecular pathways underlying hypertension. Targeting SPARC may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and improve outcomes for hypertensive patients.Our findings highlight SPARC as a key player in the molecular pathways of hypertension. Modulating SPARC expression may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract endothelial dysfunction and improve outcomes in hypertensive patients.
40229524	Rhizosphere Bacterial Communities Alter in Process to Mycorrhizal Developments of a Mixotrophic Pyrola japonica.	Rhizosphere bacteria work in synergy with mycorrhizal fungi to promote plant growth. The community structure of rhizosphere bacteria may be influenced by continuous changes in fungal associations with host plants. Asiatic herbaceous plant Pyrola japonica (Ericaceae) forms arbutoid mycorrhizas without fungal mantles, with its mycorrhizal development being visually distinguishable at the cellular level. This study aimed to investigate roles of rhizosphere bacteria and their community shifts along with mycorrhizal developments. We examined bacterial communities at three different developmental stages of mycorrhizal roots-limited, full, and digested-via a partial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Both α- and β-diversities in the full condition were significantly lower than those in the limited and digested conditions. Significant clusters of bacterial compositions were found among all treatments. In terms of ecological processes of community assembly, communities in limited conditions and bulk soil were influenced by both deterministic and stochastic processes, whereas those in full and digested conditions were regulated only by stochastic ways. Furthermore, the order Rhizobiales and Actinomycetales known as mycorrhizal helper bacteria were characterized in the full and digested conditions through phylogenetic analysis and detection of indicator taxa. These results suggest that mycorrhizal fungi may play ecologically important roles not only as temporal drivers initiating the formation rhizosphere bacterial communities but also as key founders exerting continuous influences to establish priority effects. Moreover, the rhizosphere bacterial community remains after mycorrhizal degeneration and their historical continuity may contribute to maintaining plant-mycorrhizal fungi-bacterial associations.
40229523	Perceptual discrimination learning in children with and without autism: The effect of feedback, modality, and progressive-learning.	Research suggests autistic children learn and generalize visual family-resemblance categories atypically (e.g., Church, et al., 2010, 2015), particularly when learning incidentally from exposure. This may reflect differences in perceptual learning (Mercado et al., 2020). However, it is unknown whether perceptual discrimination learning is also atypical and if differences extend to other modalities. To address this, autistic children with normal language abilities and IQ and typically developing (TD) matched comparison children completed auditory and visual discrimination tasks, after either incidental exposure to or direct training with stimuli presented in either progressive (easy-to-hard) or random orders of difficulty. In the visual task, both autistic and TD children only performed well after progressive training, suggesting limited perceptual learning from incidental visual exposure. In the auditory task, autistic children showed a progressive learning advantage after both exposure and training, but TD children only showed this advantage after training. They also had significantly better auditory discrimination than TD children after progressive training. These findings suggest typical visual discrimination learning after progressive training and enhanced auditory discrimination learning after progressive training and exposure. This enhanced auditory perceptual learning may help explain why these autistic children are socially impaired while retaining the capacity to learn language.
40229522	Bears don't always mess with beers: Limits on generalization of statistical learning in speech.	Perception changes rapidly and implicitly as a function of passive exposure to speech that samples different acoustic distributions. Past research has shown that this statistical learning generalizes across talkers and, to some extent, new items, but these studies involved listeners' active engagement in processing statistics-bearing stimuli. In this study, we manipulated the relationship between voice onset time (VOT) and fundamental frequency (F0) to establish distributional regularities either aligned with American English or reversed to create a subtle foreign accent. We then tested whether statistical learning across passive exposure to these distributions generalized to new items never experienced in the accent. Experiment 1 showed statistical learning across passive exposure but no generalization of learning when exposure and test items shared the same initial consonant but differed in vowels (bear/pear → beer/pier) or when they differed in initial consonant but shared distributional regularities across VOT and F0 dimensions (deer/tear → beer/pier). Experiment 2 showed generalization to stimuli that shared the statistics-bearing phoneme (bear/pear → beer/pier), but only when the response set included tokens from both exposure and generalization stimuli. Moreover, statistical learning transferred to influence the subtle acoustics of listeners' own speech productions but did not generalize to influence productions of stimuli not heard in the accent. In sum, passive exposure is thus sufficient to support statistical learning and its generalization, but task demands modulate this dynamic. Moreover, production does not simply mirror perception: generalization in perception was not accompanied by transfer to production.

Gallium 68 (<sup>68</sup>Ga)-labeled DOTA-conjugate ibandronic acid (DOTA-IBA) has been successfully synthesized and utilized for bone metastasis imaging. This study compares the diagnostic efficacy between <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-IBA and fluorine 18 (<sup>18</sup>F)-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in detecting bone metastases. This prospective study, conducted from October 2022 to September 2023, analyzed images from participants who underwent <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-IBA PET/CT and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT scans. Lesions were classified into five groups based on anatomical location (limbs, vertebrae, pelvis, ribs, and skull). Morphological bone changes were categorized as osteolytic, osteoblastic, or mixed. The semi-quantified radiotracer uptake, measured by the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>), was compared using a paired t-test. Detection rates between the two scans were analyzed using the McNemar test. A total of 46 participants (median age: 64 years [interquartile range: 53-68 years], 28 men) were evaluated. <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-IBA demonstrated higher diagnostic efficacy than <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in detecting bone metastases in the limbs (73.2% vs. 64.1%), vertebras (78.1% vs. 67.4%), ribs (86.6% vs. 62.2%), pelvis (78.6% vs. 68.9%), and skulls (80.0% vs. 38%). For osteoblastic lesions, the detection rate for <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-IBA and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG was 83.3% and 51.5% respectively (P < 0.001). The SUV<sub>max</sub> of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-IBA was 7.88 (95% CI 7.09-8.66), which was higher than that of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG at 3.96 (95% CI 3.57-4.35) (P < 0.001). In participants with prostate cancer, the detection rate of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-IBA and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG was 84.7% and 55.0% respectively (P < 0.001). The SUV<sub>max</sub> of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-IBA was 10.44 (95% CI 8.57-12.30), which was higher than that of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG 4.29 (95% CI 3.51-5.07) (P < 0.001). <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-IBA PET/CT demonstrates superior diagnostic performance over <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in detecting bone metastases, particularly in osteoblastic lesions and prostate cancer cases.
40229520	Preoperative Prediction of Non-functional Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumors and Posterior Pituitary Tumors Based on MRI Radiomic Features.	Compared to non-functional pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PitNETs), posterior pituitary tumors (PPTs) require more intraoperative protection of the pituitary stalk and hypothalamus, and their perioperative management is more complex than NF-PitNETs. However, they are difficult to be distinguished via magnetic resonance images (MRI) before operation. Based on clinical features and radiological signature extracted from MRI, this study aims to establish a model for distinguishing NF-PitNETs and PPTs. Preoperative MRI of 110 patients with NF-PitNETs and 55 patients with PPTs were retrospectively obtained. Patients were randomly assigned to the training (n = 110) and validation (n = 55) cohorts in a 2:1 ratio. The lest absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was applied to develop a radiomic signature. Afterwards, an individualized predictive model (nomogram) incorporating radiomic signatures and predictive clinical features was developed. The nomogram's performance was evaluated by calibration and decision curve analyses. Five features derived from contrast-enhanced images were selected using the LASSO algorithm. Based on the mentioned methods, the calculation formula of radiomic score was obtained. The constructed nomogram incorporating radiomic signature and predictive clinical features showed a good calibration and outperformed the clinical features for predicting NF-PitNETs and PPTs (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.937 vs. 0.595 in training cohort [p < 0.001]; 0.907 vs. 0.782 in validation cohort [p = 0.03]). The decision curve shows that the individualized predictive model adds more benefit than clinical feature when the threshold probability ranges from 10 to 100%. Individualized predictive model provides a novel noninvasive imaging biomarker and could be conveniently used to distinguish NF-PitNETs and PPTs, which provides a significant reference for preoperative preparation and intraoperative decision-making.
40229519	Research on intelligent energy management strategies for connected range-extended electric vehicles based on multi-source information.	Reliance solely on vehicle-specific information, while neglecting multi-source information such as traffic flow and traffic light status, results in difficulties in optimizing energy allocation based on complex road conditions. To achieve the application of multi-source traffic information and enhance the timeliness in multi-objective optimization (MOO) for connected automated range-extended electric vehicles (CAR-EEV), this paper proposes an intelligent energy management strategy (EMS) from a multi-objective perspective. Firstly, a joint simulation platform for traffic scenarios is established based on SUMO and MATLAB, and a data-driven model of CAR-EEV is constructed using collected data, serving as the data foundation and operational platform for subsequent research and development of EMSs. Then, leveraging an image-like representation of traffic flow information based on grid grayscale maps, multi-source traffic information is materialized into a two-dimensional matrix. The Euclidean distance between consecutive traffic scenario matrices is used as a basis for similarity to optimize speed and predict future vehicle speeds. Moreover, a multi-objective intelligent EMS based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed, utilizing the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to comprehensively consider vehicle dynamics, energy consumption economy, and the degradation of batteries. This establishes an end-to-end intelligent EMS framework for CAR-EEV and accelerates training convergence through prioritized experience replay. Finally, simulations and bench tests demonstrate that this intelligent EMS significantly improves vehicle dynamics and battery life, with notably enhancing real-time performance and effectiveness.
40229517	Ameliorating effect of the aldose reductase inhibitor 1-Acetyl-5-phenyl-1 H-pyrrol-3-ylacetate on galactose-induced cataract.	Diabetes mellitus, as a common chronic disease, easily leads to significant changes in the structure of the eye, among which diabetic cataract is particularly common. Although surgery is the main treatment for this complication, it may be accompanied by postoperative complications. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop specific drugs for diabetic cataract, aiming to fundamentally reduce its incidence and reduce the need for surgery. At present, the greatest challenge is to develop therapeutic agents with multiple synergistic effects based on the complex pathogenesis of cataract. 1-Acetyl-5-phenyl-1 H-pyrrol-3-ylacetate (APPA) is designed based on the pathological mechanism as a potential drug to alleviate the occurrence of diabetic cataract. Our observations suggest that APPA is more effective than bendazaclysine in alleviating high galactose-induced oxidative stress (The malondialdehyde content in the APPA group and bendazaclysine group was significantly reduced to 0.45-fold and 0.58-fold compared to the high galactose-induced group, respectively.) and apoptosis (The apoptosis rate in the APPA group and bendazaclysine group was significantly reduced to 0.28-fold and 0.35-fold compared to the high galactose-induced group, respectively.) in lens epithelial cells by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, and restoring mitochondrial homeostasis. Mechanistic studies have shown that APPA restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis is mediated through the SIRT1-PGC-1α pathway. In the galactose-induced cataract rat model, APPA is effective in alleviating the occurrence of galactose-induced cataract. In conclusion, APPA with multiple synergistic functions may be a potential drug to alleviate the occurrence of diabetic cataract, and it has a wider range of indications than benzydalysine.

40229514	Regulatory role of gut microbiota in immunotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.	The gut microbiota plays a role in triggering innate immunity and regulating the immune microenvironment (IME) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by acting on various signaling receptors and transcription factors through its metabolites and related molecules. Furthermore, there is an increasing recognition of the gut microbiota as a potential therapeutic target for HCC, given its ability to modulate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
40229513	Leveraging pretrained language models for seizure frequency extraction from epilepsy evaluation reports.	Seizure frequency is essential for evaluating epilepsy treatment, ensuring patient safety, and reducing risk for Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy. As this information is often described in clinical narratives, this study presents an approach to extracting structured seizure frequency details from such unstructured text. We investigated two tasks: (1) extracting phrases describing seizure frequency, and (2) extracting seizure frequency attributes. For both tasks, we fine-tuned three BERT-based models (bert-large-cased, biobert-large-cased, and Bio_ClinicalBERT), as well as three generative large language models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and Llama-2-70b-hf). The final structured output integrated the results from both tasks. GPT-4 attained the best performance across all tasks with precision, recall, and F1-score of 86.61%, 85.04%, and 85.79% respectively for frequency phrase extraction; 90.23%, 93.51%, and 91.84% for seizure frequency attribute extraction; and 86.64%, 85.06%, and 85.82% for the final structured output. These findings highlight the potential of fine-tuned generative models in extractive tasks from limited text strings.
40229512	Author correction to: "causal survival analysis under competing risks using longitudinal modified treatment policies".	The published version of the manuscript (D´iaz, Hoffman, Hejazi Lifetime Data Anal 30, 213-236, 2024) contained an error (We would like to thank Kara Rudolph for pointing out an issue that led to uncovering the error)) in the definition of the outcome that had cascading effects and created errors in the definition of multiple objects in the paper. We correct those errors here. For completeness, we reproduce the entire manuscript, underlining places where we made a correction.Longitudinal modified treatment policies (LMTP) have been recently developed as a novel method to define and estimate causal parameters that depend on the natural value of treatment. LMTPs represent an important advancement in causal inference for longitudinal studies as they allow the non-parametric definition and estimation of the joint effect of multiple categorical, ordinal, or continuous treatments measured at several time points. We extend the LMTP methodology to problems in which the outcome is a time-to-event variable subject to a competing event that precludes observation of the event of interest. We present identification results and non-parametric locally efficient estimators that use flexible data-adaptive regression techniques to alleviate model misspecification bias, while retaining important asymptotic properties such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msqrt><mi>n</mi></msqrt> </math> -consistency. We present an application to the estimation of the effect of the time-to-intubation on acute kidney injury amongst COVID- 19 hospitalized patients, where death by other causes is taken to be the competing event.

40229510	Post-translational acylation of proteins in cardiac hypertrophy.	Acylations are post-translational modifications in which functional groups are attached to amino acids on proteins. Most acylations (acetylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, lactylation, malonylation, propionylation and succinylation) involve lysine but cysteine (palmitoylation) and glycine (myristoylation) residues can also be altered. Acylations have important roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes, including cardiac hypertrophy and related cardiovascular diseases. These post-translational modifications influence chromatin architecture, transcriptional regulation and metabolic pathways, thereby affecting cardiomyocyte function and pathology. The dynamic interaction between these acylations and their regulatory enzymes, such as histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases and sirtuins, underscores the complexity of cellular homeostasis and pathological processes. Emerging evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting acylations to modulate enzyme activity and metabolite levels, offering promising avenues for novel treatments. In this Review, we explore the diverse mechanisms through which acylations contribute to cardiac hypertrophy, highlighting the complexity and potential therapeutic targets in this regulatory network.
40229509	Age-Varying Patterns of Cannabis Use, Related Risk Factors, and their Associations among Young Adults in the Context of Legalized Nonmedical Cannabis.	The current study examined age-varying patterns of cannabis use, cannabis-specific risk factors, and their associations across young adulthood. We used repeated cross-sectional data from young adults (N = 15,251; M<sub>age</sub> = 22.02 years, SD<sub>age</sub> = 2.22; 68% female) who enrolled in the annual, statewide Washington Young Adult Health Survey between 2015 and 2022. Logistic time-varying effect models showed that cannabis use increased from ages 18-22 and remained relatively stable through age 26. Most cannabis-specific risk factors increased gradually across young adulthood, although perceptions of cannabis use acceptability (injunctive norms) increased substantially through age 23 followed by decreases. Ease of obtaining cannabis, perceptions about others' use (descriptive norms), and low perceived physical harm were generally associated with any past-month cannabis use with stronger associations around age 18. Injunctive norms and low perceived psychological harm were consistently associated with past-month use across young adulthood. Ease of obtaining cannabis, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and low psychological harm were associated with frequent cannabis use across young adulthood with associations strongest prior to age 21. Low perceived physical harm was associated with frequent use across young adulthood with associations getting somewhat stronger across ages. Findings underscore the importance of focusing on cannabis-specific risk factors in preventive intervention efforts over the course of young adulthood, including focus on young adults in their mid- 20 s in the context of legalized cannabis.
40229508	Short-Term Impacts of a School-Based Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program for Latino Youth: a Cluster Randomized Trial.	This study evaluates El Camino, a goal-setting sexual health promotion program developed for Latino youth. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in grades 9-12 in 68 classrooms (n = 746 students) across 11 schools in Maryland with large populations of Latino students. A total of 208 students were lost to follow-up, leaving 538 students for an intention-to-treat analysis (El Camino, 34 clusters, n = 289; control, 34 clusters, n = 249). At baseline, most participants (72.1%) reported never having had vaginal sex and no sex in the last 3 months (84.4%). This study did not detect any significant intervention impacts on sexual behavior outcomes but found impacts on several proximal sexual health outcomes. At post-test, approximately 1-2 weeks after curriculum completion, scores were significantly higher among El Camino participants compared to control participants on measures of contraception knowledge (β = 0.5 (cluster robust SE 0.1)), condom knowledge (0.4 (0.1)), consent knowledge (0.3 (0.1)), and awareness of birth control methods (0.9 (0.1)), as well as confidence to discuss sex with a partner (0.3 (0.1)). A total of 84.7% of El Camino participants reported positive attitudes toward condom use compared to 67.1% of control participants (OR = 2.7, 95% CI [1.8, 4.0]); 83.1% reported intending to use condoms if sexually active compared to 72.6% of control participants (1.9, [1.2, 2.9]); 80.9% reported knowing where to get birth control compared to 48.9% of control participants (4.4, [2.8, 7.0]), and 83.3% reported being confident to state and ask for consent compared to 70.5% of control participants (2.1, [1.2, 3.7]). This study also found that intervention impacts varied by student gender and program implementation factors. Overall, El Camino appears to be effective in improving sexual health knowledge, self-efficacy, and intentions among Latino youth.Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT06485284. Date 7-3 - 24.
40229507	Analytical subcellular fractionation of microglial BV-2 cells with peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect.	Peroxisomes have gained increasing attention and are now considered vital players in normal physiological functions. To gain further insight into how peroxisomal defects influence cellular functions, we developed BV-2 microglial models featuring CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited mutations in peroxisomal Acox1 or Abcd1 and Abcd2 genes. The Acox1<sup>-/-</sup> BV-2 cell line we generated lacks acyl-CoA oxidase 1, the key enzyme that initiates peroxisomal β-oxidation. In contrast, the double mutant Abcd1/d2<sup>-/-</sup> BV-2 cell line carries mutations in the genes encoding the membranous ABC transporters ABCD1 and ABCD2, which are responsible for transporting fatty acyl-thioesters inside peroxisome. Here, for the first time, we used analytical fractionation to compare these three genotypes. Through flow cytometry, we observed an increase in cell granularity in these mutant cells, which could be associated with alterations in peroxisome distribution and mitochondrial dynamics. Additionally, the analysis of organelle markers in microglial cells, employing differential centrifugation, exhibited an enrichment of peroxisomes particularly in both L and P fractions of these BV-2 cell line models. The use of an isopycnic Nycodenz density gradient showed that peroxisomes sedimented with a median density of 1.18 g/ml. Notably, our results revealed no significant differences in the distribution profiles of organelles when comparing microglial BV-2 Wt cells with deficient Acox1<sup>‒/‒</sup> or Abcd1/d2<sup>-/‒</sup> BV-2 cells, which lack peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation. Our study is the first to report on the fractionation of brain-derived microglial cells, laying valuable groundwork for future proteomic and/or metabolomic analyses of peroxisome fractions.
40229506	Hippocampal output suppresses orbitofrontal cortex schema cell formation.	Both the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus (HC) are implicated in the formation of cognitive maps and their generalization into schemas. However, how these areas interact in supporting this function remains unclear, with some proposals supporting a serial model in which the OFC draws on task representations created by the HC to extract key behavioral features and others suggesting a parallel model in which both regions construct representations that highlight different types of information. In the present study, we tested between these two models by asking how schema correlates in rat OFC would be affected by inactivating the output of the HC, after learning and during transfer across problems. We found that the prevalence and content of schema correlates were unaffected by inactivating one major HC output area, the ventral subiculum, after learning, whereas inactivation during transfer accelerated their formation. These results favor the proposal that the OFC and HC operate in parallel to extract different features defining cognitive maps and schemas.
40229505	Spatially clustered neurons in the bat midbrain encode vocalization categories.	Rapid categorization of vocalizations enables adaptive behavior across species. While categorical perception is thought to arise in the neocortex, humans and animals could benefit from a functional organization tailored to ethologically relevant sound processing earlier in the auditory pathway. Here we developed two-photon calcium imaging in the awake echolocating bat (Eptesicus fuscus) to study the representation of vocalizations in the inferior colliculus, which is as few as two synapses from the inner ear. Echolocating bats rely on frequency-sweep-based vocalizations for social communication and navigation. Auditory playback experiments demonstrated that individual neurons responded selectively to social or navigation calls, enabling robust population-level decoding across categories. When social calls were morphed into navigation calls in equidistant step-wise increments, individual neurons showed switch-like properties and population-level response patterns sharply transitioned at the category boundary. Strikingly, category-selective neurons formed spatial clusters, independent of tonotopy within the dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus. These findings support a revised view of categorical processing in which specified channels for ethologically relevant sounds are spatially segregated early in the auditory hierarchy, enabling rapid subcortical organization into categorical primitives.
40229504	Evaluation of Process Parameters for Continuous Manufacturing of Quetiapine Fumarate Immediate Release Tablets Using Twin Screw Wet Granulation.	Granulation is one of the important unit operations in the manufacturing of solid dosage forms like tablets and capsules that regulate the quality of end products. It is a process of particle enlargement by agglomeration technique, which improves flow properties, compressibility, reduction of dust formation, drug content uniformity, dissolution rates, and overall product stability. Traditionally, it has been a batch process due to a better understanding of the process. However, there has been a shift towards continuous manufacturing using a Twin-screw granulator, which is more robust, scalable, and versatile for a wide range of applications.
40229503	Primary cilia prevent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway during mouse decidualization.	Primary cilia are antenna-like organelles that sense extracellular signals and function as signaling hubs essential for vertebrate development and homeostasis. Decidualization is crucial for pregnancy establishment and maintenance in both humans and mice. While primary cilia are present in endometrial stromal cells, their role in pregnancy remains unknown. Here, we identify TMEM67, a key component of the ciliary transition zone, as a critical regulator of mouse decidualization. Loss of primary cilia triggers RhoA-MLC2-dependent actomyosin contraction, which transmits mechanical forces to the nuclear lamina, leading to micronuclei formation. Within these micronuclei, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) can directly bind to cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in situ, initiating downstream signaling. This activation of the cGAS-STING pathway reduces CCL6 production and impairs decidualization. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization or RhoA-ROCK signaling alleviates mechanical forces surrounding stromal cells, restores ciliogenesis, maintains nuclear integrity, suppresses the cGAS-STING pathway activation, and ultimately rescues decidualization. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which primary cilia regulate the actin cytoskeleton to maintain nuclear integrity and prevent DNA leakage. This safeguards against aberrant activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which would otherwise trigger detrimental immune signaling and impair decidualization.

40229501	Urinary microbiomes in postmenopausal women with or without urinary symptoms of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: a cross-sectional study.	Some postmenopausal women suffer from genital and urinary symptoms, while others do not. Therefore, the hypoestrogenic status cannot entirely explain the occurrence of the genitourinary syndrome in menopause (GSM). Differences in the urinary microbiome might play a role in bladder function and vulnerability to urinary symptoms. This study aimed to compare characterization urinary microbiome in postmenopausal women who experienced GSM with urinary symptoms with that in those without urinary symptoms. Forty participants were screened for genital symptoms of GSM and then divided into the urinary symptoms group and the non-urinary symptoms group on the basis of a validated questionnaire. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to investigate microbial diversity. The alpha diversity was used to evaluate the species richness and evenness, while the beta diversity was used to estimate the differences in the urinary microbiome between the groups. Differential abundance analysis was used to investigate biomarkers in the groups by linear discriminant analysis effect size. The relationship between the urinary microbiome and urinary symptoms was assessed using Spearman's correlation analysis. The characteristics of the participants were not different between the groups. Gardnerella was found in 22.2% (4/18) and 11.1% (2/18) of participants in the urinary symptoms group and in the non-urinary symptoms group, respectively (p > 0.05). Alpha diversity was less in the urinary symptoms group than in the non-urinary symptoms group, but this was not significant. Beta diversity of the urinary microbiome was not significantly different between the two groups. A differential abundance analysis showed that the genus Prevotella was significantly dominant in postmenopausal women with GSM who reported urinary symptoms. Prevotella was marginally correlated with voiding symptoms (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.44; p = 0.01). The bladder or urinary microbiome is closely related to urinary symptoms of GSM. Species richness and diversity are not significantly different between postmenopausal women with GSM with and without urinary symptoms. Prevotella is dominant in symptomatic women and slightly correlated with voiding symptoms.
40229500	Exploring the molecular pathways of miRNAs in testicular cancer: from diagnosis to therapeutic innovations.	Cancer diagnostics highlight the critical requirement for sensitive and accurate tools with functional biomarkers for early tumor detection, diagnosis, and treatment. With a high burden of morbidity and mortality among young men worldwide and an increasing prevalence, Testicular cancer (TC) is a significant death-related cancer. Along with patient history, imaging, clinical presentation, and laboratory data, histological analysis of the testicular tissue following orchiectomy is crucial. Although some patients in advanced stages who belong to a poor risk group die from cancer, surgical treatments and chemotherapeutic treatment offer a high possibility of cure in the early stages. Testicular tumors lack useful indicators despite their traditional pathological classification, which highlights the need to find and use blood tumor markers in therapy. Regretfully, the sensitivity and specificity of the currently available biomarkers are restricted. Novel non-coding RNA molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs), have recently been discovered, offering a potential breakthrough as viable biomarkers and diagnostic tools. They act as fundamental gene regulators at the post-transcriptional level, controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This article aims to comprehensively explore the role of miRNAs in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of TC, with a focus on their regulatory mechanisms within key signaling pathways such as TGF-β, PTEN/AKT/mTOR, EGFR, JAK/STAT, and WNT/β-catenin. By investigating the potential of miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, this study seeks to address challenges such as treatment resistance and evaluate the clinical importance of miRNAs in improving patient outcomes. Additionally, the work aims to explore innovative approaches, including nanoparticle-based delivery systems, to enhance the efficacy of miRNA-based therapies. Ultimately, this research aims to provide insights into future directions for precision medicine in TC, bridging the gap between molecular discoveries and clinical applications.
40229499	Lipin1-dependent transcriptional inactivation of SREBPs contributes to selinexor sensitivity in multiple myeloma.	Selective nuclear export inhibitor selinexor (SEL) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). But its mechanisms of action as well as factors that influence therapeutic responses have not been fully characterized yet. In this study we employed catTFRE proteomics technique to profile changes in nuclear abundance of activated transcription factors (TFs)/co-factors (TCs) in myeloma cells following SEL treatment. We found that pharmacological inhibition of exportin-1 (XPO1) by SEL leads to a significant nuclear accumulation of Lipin1 in NCI-H929 cells. Nuclear-localized Lipin1 acted as a transcriptional cofactor that suppressed the transcriptional activity of SREBPs. By performing subcellular localization analysis, molecular docking, co-immunoprecipitation and other assays, we demonstrated that Lipin1 was subjected to XPO1-dependent nuclear export. We demonstrated that SEL downregulated the expression of key lipogenesis-related genes regulated by SREBPs including FASN, SCD, DHCR24 and FDPS, leading to reduced fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in MM cell lines and primary CD138<sup>+</sup> cells. Using shRNA-mediated knockdown assays, we elucidated the critical role of Lipin1 in mediating the inhibitory effects of SEL on the SREBPs pathway and its contribution to SEL sensitivity both in vitro and in murine xenograft models. In conclusion, we reveal a novel mechanism by which SEL downregulates cellular lipid biosynthesis, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of myeloma cells. This study highlights the critical role of Lipin1 in the anti-myeloma effects of SEL, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from SEL-based therapies.

40229496	Evaluating the potential of phytoextraction on waste-to-energy bottom ash-a review.	Waste-to-energy produces district heating and electricity and generates bottom ash. This ash contains valuable chemically bound metals and current methods for extracting them face significant challenges, prompting the need for alternative methods such as phytoextraction. This review evaluates the potential of using phytoextraction on sorted and aged bottom ash to recover metals and enhance the usability of the MIBA residue in new applications. The focus is on the minor elements Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni and Co. A list of suitable terrestrial plants is suggested based on their ability to grow in the Nordic climate and the presence of the metals of interest. A further evaluation using qualitative multicriteria analysis (MCA) based on selected criteria, i.e. biomass, extraction capacity, metal diversity, perennial or annual growth, and accumulation above ground or in roots was performed. More than 100 different plants were reviewed for their suitability for MIBA phytoextraction, with 13 plants identified as the most promising. Among the selected plants, Sesbania drummondii scored the highest, followed by Salix alba and Salix viminalis. All these plants are perennial and can extract multiple metals; Salix exhibits lower to moderate extraction efficiency but compensates for this with high biomass and rapid growth compared to other plants with higher extraction capacity. In conclusion, the study shows the potential use of phytoextraction as a method to treat MIBA. However, further cultivation experiments are necessary to evaluate its efficiency. This review provides valuable information for designing such research.
40229495	Anchoring catalytic wet air oxidation to biomass waste management with focus on distillery stillage.	Wet air oxidation is an advanced chemical reaction process involving the use of moisture and air and is applied to purposes such as to degrade existing and emerging pollutant, especially to waste types of too liquid for combustion process but too solid for biodigestion. The traditional wet air oxidation process operates on a temperature of 150-300 °C and a pressure of 0.5-20 bar whereas the supercritical oxidation applies a temperature > 374 °C and a pressure of > 2.2 bar. Wet air oxidation process technology is well matured; however, it is still a flashpoint to researchers, especially on economizing the system from applying catalysts and their supports. Wet air oxidation process catalysis is performed to improve reaction efficiency performing it at lower temperature and pressure. Such catalyzed processes are preferred based on the catalyst's selective activity and stability as well as recoverability while economizing the process energy requirement. Consequently, a catalyzed subcritical wet air oxidation is considered as an environmentally friendly and economically feasible alternative. In the past decades, plenty of studies have been done on wet air oxidation but are performed piece by piece, not comprehensively. Additionally, biologically coupled wet air oxidation of pollutants is not well revised. This paper uniquely elucidates the recent advancements in wet air oxidation and it is integral with other waste treatments to an environmentally friendly management. Structurally, this review presents the basics and state of the art of wet air oxidation, the chemical process, its catalytic and catalyst support progresses, and its application in waste and bioenergy with focus to stillage.
40229494	Mechanisms, challenges, and future perspectives of adsorptive desulfurization using zeolite-based adsorbents: a review.	This review is a comprehensive description of adsorptive desulfurization (ADS) by metal-modified zeolites, particularly the elimination of sulfur compounds from gasoline, diesel, kerosene, jet fuel, and heavy petroleum fuel. The seven largest zeolite structures (HEU, Composite, MWW, FAU, MFI, LTA, and BEA) were modified with metals such as copper, cerium, nickel, vanadium, zinc, and titanium and compared under different working conditions. It is determined by the results that CuCeY and modified CeY removed sulfur by 88.4% with an adsorption capacity of 4.49 mg S/g in model gasoline (thiophene, 500 ppm). CuHUSY and LaHUSY in model jet fuel (benzothiophene, 500 ppm) were removed by 83.9% and adsorbed by 7.16 mg S/g. For diesel fuel (dibenzothiophene, 500 ppm), LaNaY and CuNaY registered sulfur removal capacities of up to 99.9% and adsorption capacity of 24.6 mg S/g. Moreover, nickel, zinc, and tungsten-containing zeolites registered maximum removal capacities of up to 99% in heavy petroleum and model fuels like iso-octane and hexadecane, even under reduced contact times at room temperatures. In kerosene, Cu and TiO₂-modified clinoptilolite zeolites adsorbed 45-99.9% of sulfur based on the process conditions. This study also provides information on the regeneration of zeolites, the possibility of coupling modified zeolites with oxidants and solvents in the production of low-impact clean fuels, and mechanistic insights by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-second-order kinetics. This study's findings help develop greener ways for fuel production processes.
40229493	Tolerant species drive the response of autotrophic biofilms to non-point pollution by nitrogen and glyphosate.	Agricultural practices significantly influence riparian landscapes, increasing contaminant inputs into aquatic ecosystems, with profound effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. This study evaluated the structural and functional responses of autotrophic biofilms to nitrogen (10 µg/L as urea fertilizer), glyphosate (8.64 µg/L of active ingredient, Green II Herbicide Soluble Concentrate GREEN-GO®), and their combination in a 15-day laboratory microcosm experiment conducted during May and June 2021. The experiment used 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm frosted glass substrates, which were colonized in the laboratory with a natural algal community inoculated from the Chocancharava River, Córdoba, Argentina (33°03'14″ S, 64°22'23″ W). We assessed total biomass, chlorophyll a, algal community structure, and metabolic activity under four treatments: control, nitrogen, glyphosate, and nitrogen-glyphosate. Glyphosate significantly reduced taxa diversity and altered community structure, leading to a decline in diatoms and the dominance of Monoraphidium minutum, likely due to its tolerance mechanisms. Nutrient enrichment and glyphosate exposure simplified algal assemblages, favoring tolerant taxa. The density of Monoraphidium minutum significantly influenced net primary production, underscoring its functional role under stress conditions. These findings demonstrate how tolerant species drive biofilm responses to diffuse pollution, with implications for trophic connectivity and ecosystem functioning due to community simplification.
40229492	Improved performance of coconut fiber and quartzite waste cement composites using accelerated carbonation.	The use of vegetable fibers and mining waste has shown promising results for the production of cementitious composites with outstanding ecological parameters. However, the basic pH of the cement matrix promotes degradation of the fibers, which affects their mechanical properties. To overcome this incompatibility, accelerated carbonation is suggested, in which decreasing the pH of the cementitious matrix can also increase the durability of the composites. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of accelerated carbonation on the physical-mechanical properties of coconut fiber-cement. The composites were produced by extrusion using high early-strength cement, coconut fibers, chemical additives, and different percentages of quartzite (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%) as a substitute for limestone. In the second stage, composites made with 100% quartzite were subjected to accelerated carbonation for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. The effect of accelerated carbonation was evaluated via physical, mechanical, thermogravimetric, and microstructural tests. Accelerated carbonation resulted in a 6% reduction in apparent porosity after 12 h of exposure and an increase in the toughness of the composites from 2.18 to 3.69 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> after 12 h of carbonation (an increase of 69.3%). The results thus indicated that the complete replacement of limestone with quartzite waste and curing under accelerated carbonation have strong potential for the production of lighter, stronger, and more sustainable fiber-cements, for which the best carbonation time is 12 h.
40229491	Identification of serum metabolite biomarkers and metabolic reprogramming mechanisms to predict recurrence in cholangiocarcinoma.	Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has high recurrence rates that severely limit long-term survival. Effective tools for accurate recurrence monitoring and diagnosis remain lacking. Metabolic reprogramming, a key driver of CCA growth and recurrence, is underutilized in cancer screening and management. This study aimed to identify metabolite-based biomarkers to evaluate recurrence severity, enhance disease management, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CCA recurrence. A comprehensive, non-targeted serum metabolomics analysis using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was conducted. Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling was employed to develop a predictive framework based on metabolite biomarkers. The analysis revealed significant alterations in metabolomics and lipidomics across CCA recurrence subtypes. Notably, changes in metabolites such as amino acids, lipid-derived carnitines, and glycerophospholipids were associated with cancer progression through enhanced energy production and lipid remodeling. The SVM-constructed metabolite-based predictive model demonstrated predictive accuracy comparable to current clinical diagnostic standards. These findings provide novel insights into the metabolic mechanisms underlying CCA recurrence, addressing critical clinical challenges. By advancing early diagnostic approaches, particularly for preoperative detection, this study offers a reliable method for predicting recurrence in CCA patients. This enables effective treatment planning and supports the development of personalized therapeutic strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
40229490	Radiofrequency ablation of basivertebral and sinuvertebral nerves for chronic discogenic low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the basivertebral and sinuvertebral nerve is a relatively new intervention for patients with chronic discogenic low back pain. It aims to ablate the irritated nerve endings to improve pain control and disability. This meta-analysis includes prospective single and double-arm studies that determine if RFA is effective in improving chronic low back pain and disability for patients with degenerative spinal discs who have not yet required surgical decompression. The outcomes of interest were comprised of commonly used patient-reported outcomes, which included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores. Forest plots were generated to report associations as well as funnel plots to report the risk of publication bias. The meta-analysis included 429 patients from five eligible studies, comprising two randomized controlled trials and three prospective single-arm trials. A total of 280 patients underwent RFA whereas 149 served as controls. The baseline scores in the single-arm trials served as the outcomes of their control group. The RFA group (n = 280) had significantly lower ODI scores (mean difference = - 28.08; 95% CI: [- 43.53, - 12.63]) than the control group (n = 240). Similarly, the RFA group (n = 279) had significantly lower VAS scores (mean difference = - 3.16; 95% CI: [- 5.02, - 1.31]) than the control group (n = 238). Our study demonstrates RFA as a promising intervention for chronic discogenic low back pain, noting significant improvements in pain control and disability. Although not intended to substitute surgical decompression, it can serve as a better alternative to other non-operative therapies in patients who do not require surgical management. Clinical trial number: not applicable.

40229488	Assessment of leaf litter decomposition for biomonitoring in urban watercourses under contrasting thermal conditions.	Urbanization affects the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems, and its effect might depend on seasonal conditions. We aim to evaluate the applicability of in situ leaf litter decomposition experiments to assess the ecological integrity of urbanized streams in cool (autumn-winter) and warm (spring-summer) periods. Along these two periods, three reaches were selected in urban and three in reference segments in Pampean streams. In each reach at both periods, 25 bags of 450 μm (FM) and 25 bags of 20 mm (CM) mesh size were placed containing dry leaves of Populus nigra, and five bags of each type were periodically collected up to day 104. Decomposition rates were determined from mass loss by fitting to a negative exponential model against time (k<sub>d</sub>) and cumulate degree days (k<sub>dd</sub>). In both periods, k<sub>dd</sub> were lower in urban than in reference reaches (p<sub>condition</sub> = 0.020, df = 1, 137), but a larger difference occurred in the warm period. Even removing the effect of temperature, higher k<sub>dd</sub> were observed in warm than in cool waters (p<sub>period</sub> = 0.0004, df = 1, 137 for FM and p<sub>period</sub> = 0.002, df = 1, 129 for CM). During the warm period experiment, the k<sub>dd</sub> reduction due to urbanization was 2.5 times higher than during the cool period. Invertebrates colonizing litter bags differed between stream conditions and between seasons. Tolerant insect larvae were more abundant in the warm period; Gastropods, nematodes, and crabs during the cool period. In conclusion, our experimental methodology was effective to assess the effects of urbanization on stream ecological integrity. As we predicted, season stood out as an important factor in the assessment.
40229486	Identification and validation of LY6H and GRM3 as candidate biomarkers for Glioma-related epilepsy.	Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system, with epilepsy serving as a frequent clinical manifestation. Glioma-related epilepsy (GRE) significantly affects patients' quality of life and prognosis. In this study, we integrated bioinformatics and multiple machine learning methods to perform a proteomic analysis of brain tumor samples from patients with GRE and from those with gliomas none epilepsy (GNE). Our findings identified LY6H and GRM3 as potential signature proteins of GRE. Further investigation showed that LY6H and GRM3 expression levels were markedly reduced in GRE samples, with favorable diagnostic performance according to ROC curve analyses. Finally, we conducted an independent external validation using the Bluk-RNA dataset GSE199759, and the results corroborated our prior analyses. This work not only provides new biomarkers for the early detection of GRE but also offers valuable insights into its molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies.

40229483	A tutorial for estimating Bayesian hierarchical mixture models for visual working memory tasks: Introducing the Bayesian Measurement Modeling (bmm) package for R.	Mixture models for visual working memory tasks using continuous report recall are highly popular measurement models in visual working memory research. Yet, efficient and easy-to-implement hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedures that flexibly enable group or condition comparisons are scarce. Specifically, most software packages implementing mixture models have used maximum likelihood estimation for single-subject data. Such estimation procedures require a large number of trials per participant to obtain robust and reliable estimates. This problem can be solved with hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedures that provide robust and reliable estimates with lower trial numbers. In this tutorial, we illustrate how mixture models for visual working memory tasks can be specified and fit in the newly developed R package bmm. The benefit of this implementation over existing hierarchical Bayesian implementations is that bmm integrates hierarchical Bayesian estimation of the mixture models with an efficient linear model syntax that enables us to adapt the mixture model to practically any experimental design. Specifically, this implementation allows for varying model parameters over arbitrary groups or experimental conditions. Additionally, the hierarchical structure and the specification of informed priors can frequently improve subject-level parameter estimation and solve estimation problems. We illustrate these benefits in different examples and provide R code for easy adaptation to other use cases.
40229482	Pollution level of microplastics in sand beaches of four locations in the coast of El Salvador, Central America.	In recent years, plastic debris has been reported on El Salvador beaches, including those located in rural areas and close to protected natural or Ramsar areas. However, there is still no scientific data able to neither the main microplastic sources nor their abundances. Therefore, the aim of this work was to assess the concentrations and spatial distributions, physical and chemical characteristics, and possible sources of microplastic in four of the main beaches along El Salvador coast: Barra de Santiago, El Majahual, El Espino, and Chiquiríin. The Nemerow pollution index (NPI) was employed to categorize the overall pollution levels of each beach. The results state that plastic debris negatively affects El Salvador coast and contributes to pollution of the Pacific coast of Central America. With abundances ranging from 4.5 to 18.5 item/kg d.w. or 48 to 300 item/m<sup>2</sup>, the microplastic debris was mainly composed of fibers (85.9%) and fragments (8.4%). The Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) revealed that their main sources were colored synthetic organic materials and mainly composed of polypropylene (40%), polyethylene (20%), and polystyrene (20%). These materials are typically found in plastic bottles and their caps, single-use supermarket bags, food packaging, textiles, and drinking straws. Tourism and poor waste management practices are likely to be the main sources of microplastics, with rainwater and rivers as the primary transport mechanisms. Although the Nemerow pollution index (NPI) rated the pollution levels of the surveyed beaches as low, the ubiquitous presence of microplastics underscores an ongoing environmental problem that requires continuous monitoring and intervention.
40229481	Transformer-based deep learning for accurate detection of multiple base modifications using single molecule real-time sequencing.	We had previously reported a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach, called the holistic kinetic model (HK model 1), for detecting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by single molecule real-time sequencing (Pacific Biosciences). In this study, we constructed a hybrid model with CNN and transformer layers, named HK model 2. We improve the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 5mC detection from 0.91 for HK model 1 to 0.99 for HK model 2. We further demonstrate that HK model 2 can detect other types of base modifications, such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and N6-methyladenine (6mA). Using HK model 2 to analyze 5mC patterns of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) molecules, we demonstrate the enhanced detection of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, with an AUC of 0.97. Moreover, HK model 2-based detection of 6mA enables the detection of jagged ends of cfDNA and the delineation of cellular chromatin structures. HK model 2 is thus a versatile tool expanding the applications of single molecule real-time sequencing in liquid biopsies.

40229472	Recent advances in microfluidic-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing platforms for biomedical applications.	Photoelectrochemical (PEC) techniques seamlessly combine electrochemical and spectroscopic principles, offering a powerful platform for the detection of biomarkers and biological molecules in clinical and biomedical settings. This review provides a comprehensive overview of microfluidic PEC probes, emphasizing their potential for ultrasensitive detection through enhanced light absorption and charge transfer processes. Key advantages of microfluidic PEC include real-time monitoring of biological processes, non-invasive detection, and the possibility of multiplexing when integrated with various quantification modalities. However, the practical implementation of PEC faces challenges such as bulky setup, matrix interference, and stability of PEC-active materials. Also, this paper discusses the intricate mechanisms of PEC sensing, highlighting the roles of nanomaterials in enhancing microfluidic PEC systems. Additionally, the limitations inherent in PEC material selection, including stability and bandgap engineering, are critically discussed. Solutions such as doping and the development of composite materials are proposed to address these issues. Through presented examples of PEC applications in biomedical fields, this review elucidates the future potential of PEC-based methods as reliable and effective tools for diagnostic applications. Additionally, this review proposes the most effective probes for future investigations to develop commercial devices.

40229469	Identification of immune cells and circulating inflammatory factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorders by bidirectional Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis.	The roles of various immune cells and circulating inflammatory factors in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) remain controversial. Therefore we employed a two-sample and bidirectional Mendelian randomization and mediation method to explore the causal relationships between immune cells, circulating inflammatory factors, and NDDs. All data were originated from Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) datasets. We found a significant positive causal relationship between 13 immune cells and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including six CD8+ T cells, one CD3+ T cell, two CD20+ B cells, one CD38+  B cell, and two plasmacytoid DC. 9 inflammatory factors showed significant causal relationships with ASD: interleukins-7 (IL-7), interleukins-2 (IL-2), Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta levels( IL-2β) and interleukins-18 receptor 1 levels (IL-18-R1) were negatively associated. In contrast, five inflammatory factors were positively associated, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). 14 immune cells exhibited significant causal relationships with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). CD3 on naive CD8br and CD4 on activated Treg were positively associated, while four CD27-expressing B cells were positively associated with ASD. Four CD40-expressing monocytes were negatively associated with ADHD. 7 inflammatory factors had significant causal relationships with ADHD: Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 levels (FGF-23), CD40L receptor levels, Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor levels (GDNF), TNF-α were more important among these. Mediation analysis identified 12 mediating relationships, with three showing strong evidence: Natural killer cell receptor 2B4 levels (19.9%), FGF-23 (11%), and Eotaxin levels (- 5.95%). Strong causal relationships existed between immune cells, circulating inflammatory factors, and NDDs. Inflammatory factors mediated the pathways between immune cells and NDDs.
40229467	Automatic detection and annotation of eastern Caribbean sperm whale codas.	A key technology for sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) monitoring is the identification of sperm whale communication signals, known as codas. In this paper we present the first automatic coda detector and annotator. The main innovation in our detector is graph-based clustering, which utilizes the expected similarity between the clicks that make up the coda. Results show detection and accurate annotation at low signal-to-noise ratios, separation between codas and echolocation clicks, and discrimination between codas from simultaneously emitting whales. Using this automatic annotator, insights into the characterization of sperm whale communication are presented. The results include new types of coda signals, analysis of the distribution of coda types among different whales and for different years, and evidence for synchronization between communicating whales in terms of coda type and coda transmission time. These results indicate a high degree of complexity in the communication system of this cetacean species. Source code and data for our system is publicly available.

40229465	Representational shifts from feedforward to feedback rhythms index phenomenological integration in naturalistic vision.	How does the brain integrate complex and dynamic visual inputs into phenomenologically seamless percepts? Previous results demonstrate that when visual inputs are organized coherently across space and time, they are more strongly encoded in feedback-related alpha rhythms, and less strongly in feedforward-related gamma rhythms. Here, we tested whether this representational shift from feedforward to feedback rhythms is linked to the phenomenological experience of coherence. In an Electroencephalography (EEG) study, we manipulated the degree of spatiotemporal coherence by presenting two segments from the same video across visual hemifields, either synchronously or asynchronously (with a delay between segments). We asked participants whether they perceived the stimulus as coherent or incoherent. When stimuli were presented at the perceptual threshold (i.e., when the same stimulus was judged as coherent 50% of times), perception co-varied with stimulus coding across alpha and gamma rhythms: When stimuli were perceived as coherent, they were represented in alpha activity; when stimuli were perceived as incoherent, they were represented in gamma activity. Whether the same visual input is perceived as coherent or incoherent thus depends on representational shifts between feedback-related alpha and feedforward-related gamma rhythms.
40229463	Ketorolac use in the emergency department in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Acute pain is a frequent reason for pediatric patients visiting the emergency department (ED). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids are often used to manage pain in this setting. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of ketorolac, a NSAIDs, in managing acute pain in children in the ED, comparing its efficacy and potential advantages over other pain management options. The search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science, for English-language articles published from 1991 to February 2023. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the analgesic effect of ketorolac in commonly painful conditions such as migraine, traumatic and non-traumatic musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, and renal colic treated in the ED were included. Pediatric studies were specifically selected. A meta-analysis was subsequently conducted to compare efficacy of ketorolac with other analgesic medications. Eight RCTs have investigated the efficacy of ketorolac for acute pain in children in the ED, reflecting limited pediatric evidence. Ketorolac showed variable effectiveness for conditions such as migraine, musculoskeletal trauma, acute abdominal pain, renal colic, and vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease. The meta-analysis revealed no significant differences in analgesic performance between ketorolac and other drugs, including opioids and other NSAIDs. The risk of bias across the studies was evaluated. However, the evidence remains insufficient to confidently recommend a specific intervention, highlighting the need for further research to guide clinical decision-making.Conclusion: Despite its limitations, the systematic review highlights that ketorolac seems effective for managing acute pain in pediatric ED patients, but not superior to other analgesic drugs. It emphasizes the necessity for further research to define optimal dosing, administration methods, and its comparative effectiveness with other analgesics across various clinical scenarios.
40229462	Targeting the poliovirus receptor to activate T cells and induce myeloid-derived suppressor cells to differentiate to pro-inflammatory macrophages via the IFN-γ-p-STAT1-IRF8 axis in cancer therapy.	T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is one of the most important immune checkpoints expressed on lymphocytes, and poliovirus receptor (PVR, also CD155) serves as the most crucial ligand for TIGIT, harboring an important function in cancer cells and influencing the tumor microenvironment (TME). While it's well-established that TIGIT blockade could reverse immunosuppression, the question of whether direct inhibition of PVR yields comparable results remains to be fully elucidated. This study investigated the role of PVR within the TME on the LLC, CT26 and MC38 tumor models and found that direct blockade of PVR on tumor cells could trigger T cell activation, enhance the production of immunostimulatory cytokine IFN-γ, and drive the differentiation of intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into pro-inflammatory macrophages through the IFN-γ-p-STAT1-IRF8 axis. Furthermore, this study found that the anti-PVR nanobody monotherapy reduced tumor volume in the CT26 and MC38 tumor models. Combination of anti-PVR nanobody and anti-PD-1 antibody was effective in the LLC, CT26 and MC38 tumor models and had acceptable toxicity. These findings collectively suggest that PVR exhibits considerable promise as a therapeutic target in the development of immunotherapies aimed at augmenting the anti-tumor immune response.

40229460	An umbrella review of efficacy of digital health interventions for workers.	Efficacy of digital health (d-Health) interventions on workers' physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and physiological outcomes remains unclear. This umbrella review searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to October 25, 2024. We identified 24 systematic reviews (SRs) and selected 130 individual studies from these SRs for analysis. The AMSTAR 2 tool rated the quality of most SRs as critically low. Narrative syntheses suggested that d-Health interventions could potentially improve all outcomes compared with no intervention. However, whether d-Health interventions outperform non-d-Health interventions remains uncertain. Meta-analyses showed a significantly small effect of d-Health interventions on step counts, sedentary/sitting time, and weight compared with no intervention, while d-Health interventions slightly improved only moderate-to-vigorous PA compared with non-d-Health interventions. Subgroup analyses identified potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g., risk of bias, control conditions), which may vary between outcomes. Further high-quality studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of d-Health interventions.
40229459	Disruption of MRSA Biofilm and Virulence by Deep-Sea Probiotics: Impacts on Energy metabolism and Host Antimicrobial Peptides.	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant threat to public health due to its resistance to conventional antibiotics and its ability to form robust biofilms on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. In this study, we explore the novel mechanisms by which deep-sea-derived probiotics serve as an alternative strategy to combat MRSA infections. Three promising probiotic candidates, Lactococcus lactis (L25_4) and two strains of Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (L25_6 and L25_7), were isolated from ocean water collected at a depth of 312 m off the eastern coast of Taiwan. Each candidate strain demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity, significantly reducing MRSA biofilm formation when applied to pork skin. The strains also improved survival rates in a Galleria mellonella infection model (> 90% survival). Immunomodulatory effects were evident, with marked upregulation of Cecropin antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and downregulation of Gloverin AMP in the host. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) revealed that probiotic treatments compromised MRSA cell membrane integrity, consistent with transcriptomic analysis showing downregulation of genes related to protein translation, membrane structure, and transporter systems. Collectively, our comprehensive in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo, and transcriptomic analyses reveal the intricate mechanisms by which deep-sea probiotics modulate both host and MRSA gene expression, underscoring their potential as innovative tools for addressing antibiotic-resistant infections.
40229457	Bexarotene Promotes Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cell Differentiation to Mature Neurons with Decreased Proliferation.	Bexarotene is a retinoid X receptor (RXR) pharmacological agonist that has been demonstrated to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and promising therapeutic potential for neurological diseases. But it still remains unclear whether bexarotene participates in regulation of neuroblastoma. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were used as a model to investigate the neuronal differentiation impact of bexarotene. Bexarotene-cultured SH-SY5Y cells showed changes in cell morphology, adopting pyramidal shapes and extending neurites, increased expression of neuronal marker β-tubulin III and mature neurons marker neurofilament M and upregulation of neuronal differentiation markers including growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and synaptophysin (SYP). SH-SY5Y cells induced by bexarotene increased the expression of GABAergic marker glutamate decarboxylase (GAD1) and dopaminergic marker TH, but not glutamatergic marker glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) and cholinergic marker solute carrier family 18 member 1 (SLC18A1). Functional enrichment analysis of RNAseq data and subsequent cell experiments revealed that the PI3K-Akt axis is the dominant signaling pathway promoting the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells into mature and functional neurons in response to bexarotene. Additionally, we observed that SH-SY5Y cells show reduced proliferation rates accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) following 7-day exposure to bexarotene, suggesting bexarotene induces a quiescent state in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells can be induced to mature neurons with decreased proliferation induced by bexarotene via PI3K-Akt axis. It indicates bexarotene has the potential to treat neuroblastoma.
40229456	Remote Ischemic Postconditioning Improve Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Induced Cognitive Dysfunction through Suppressing Mitochondrial Apoptosis in Hippocampus via TK/BK/B2R-Mediated PI3K/AKT.	Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) is known to improve motor function recovery in animal models, but its efficacy in alleviating cognitive impairment caused by ischemic stroke remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the beneficial role of RIPostC in recovering cognitive impairment induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Building upon our previous research findings, we proved that the TK/BK/B2R pathway is crucial for understanding the crosstalk between cognitive impairment and RIPostC. Additionally, in vitro experiments were conducted using the oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/r) HT-22 cell model, which revealed that the mechanism by which RIPostC suppressed mitochondrial apoptosis was mainly through the activation of the B2R/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby protecting neurons in the ischemic hippocampus from ischemic damage. To investigate the effect of RIPostC on cognitive function recovery following ischemic stroke, we established a rat model using left middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion (MCAO/r). 48 h after MCAO/r, rats were subjected to 3 circles of RIPostC therapy daily for 12 consecutive days. HOE140 was used to antagonize the bradykinin 2 receptor (B2R). Cognitive function was assessed using a modified neurological severity score, the Morris water maze, and the novel object recognition test. Local infarct volume in the hippocampus was measured through MRI scanning. The apoptosis rate of hippocampal neurons was quantified using TUNEL staining. Protein expression levels of kallikrein (TK) and mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins, Cyt c, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9, were detected in ischemic hippocampal tissue using Western blot (WB). The expression of bradykinin (BK) in serum and the ischemic penumbra was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay. In the cell experiments, the HT-22 cell line and OGD/r model were used to simulate in vitro hippocampal ischemia. WB was performed to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and PI3K/AKT pathway proteins. The apoptosis rate of HT-22 cells was detected using Annexin-V/PI flow cytometry and a cell viability kit. JC-1 staining and reactive oxygen species staining were used to evaluate mitochondrial condition. The PI3K/AKT pathway was inhibited using LY294002. RIPostC significantly upregulated the concentrations of TK and BK in the ischemic hippocampus. Behavioral function tests demonstrated that daily RIPostC therapy for 12 days significantly promoted cognitive function recovery in MCAO/r rats. Through MRI analysis, we found that RIPostC therapy effectively reduced the infarct volume in the hippocampus. Additionally, TUNEL staining and WB results of apoptosis-related proteins showed that RIPostC therapy significantly reduced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. However, the therapeutic effect of RIPostC was reversed by the B2R antagonist HOE14, indicating that the TK/BK/B2R pathway mediated the neuroprotective effect of RIPostC. Cell experiments further confirmed that BK/B2R significantly attenuated mitochondrial apoptosis induced by ischemia-hypoxia injury in HT-22 cells. In vivo and in vitro results from WB demonstrated that the BK/B2R pathway activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Finally, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reversed the anti-apoptotic effect induced by BK/B2R. RIPostC therapy effectively inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and significantly alleviated cognitive dysfunction associated with CIRI by regulating the TK/BK/B2R-medated PI3K/AKT pathway. In conclusion, RIPostC represents a promising therapeutic strategy for combating cognitive dysfunction by inhibiting cell apoptosis in hippocampus. Moreover, our results suggest that RIPostC may have a broader protective effect against apoptosis in other ischemia-reperfusion-related diseases.
40229455	Diosmetin Attenuates Painful Symptoms Caused by Antineoplastics Paclitaxel and Anastrozole in Mice.	Cancer patients often experience painful symptoms as an adverse effect resulting from various factors, including antineoplastic therapy. Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat solid tumours and, unfortunately, causes acute and chronic peripheral neuropathic pain in patients. Anastrozole is an antineoplastic used to treat hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and causes musculoskeletal pain symptoms. The therapies used to control these pain symptoms have limited efficacy and cause adverse effects, highlighting the importance of finding new treatments. Diosmetin is a flavonoid that has shown efficacy in neuropathic, nociplastic, and inflammatory pain models. Therefore, we verified the antinociceptive effects of diosmetin on nociceptive parameters induced by paclitaxel and anastrozole. We investigated the effects of diosmetin (0.015, 0.15 and 1.5 mg/kg; oral route (p.o.)) on nociceptive parameters (mechanical and cold allodynia and pain affective‑motivational behaviour) induced by a single and repeated paclitaxel (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) administrations, as well as on the pain-like symptoms (mechanical allodynia, muscle strength, and pain affective‑motivational behaviour) of a single administration of anastrozole (0.2 mg/kg, p.o.) and the combination of both antineoplastics in mice. Diosmetin reduced the nociceptive parameters induced by paclitaxel and anastrozole. In addition, we observed that anastrozole exacerbated the mechanical allodynia induced by paclitaxel, an effect that was also reversed by diosmetin. These results suggest that diosmetin may be an effective therapeutic alternative for the treatment of painful symptoms caused by antineoplastic drugs, such as paclitaxel and anastrozole.

Despite the growing body of evidence supporting the use Rezūm in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and large prostates, comparative studies with the current gold standard in this clinical setting are lacking.
40229453	Divergent neurodegeneration associations with choroid plexus volume and degree of calcification in cognitively normal APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers.	Choroid plexus (CP), best known for producing CSF, also regulate inflammation and clear metabolic waste to maintain brain homeostasis. CP dysfunction is implicated in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), with MRI studies showing CP enlargement in AD. The basis for CP enlargement is unknown. We hypothesized that calcium deposition within CP, which increases with aging and in certain neurodegenerative conditions, might underlie pathologic CP enlargement and be linked to neurodegeneration. In 166 cognitively normal participants, we used multimodal imaging to examine CP structure (MRI-measured overall volume, CT-measured calcium volume), PET-measured Aβ, age, and APOE genotype as predictors of neurodegeneration, indexed as hippocampal volume. CP enlargement was associated with reduced hippocampal volume, particularly in APOE4 carriers. CP calcium was not independently associated with hippocampal volume. However, a significant interaction revealed APOE4 genotype-specific associations between CP calcium and neurodegeneration, with APOE4 carriers showing greater hippocampal volumes in association with greater CP calcium-opposite to our hypothesis. Results suggest that a factor other than calcium drives pathologic CP enlargement associated with neurodegeneration, with this factor especially important in APOE4 carriers. Candidate factors include lipids and inflammatory cells, which are known to accumulate in CP and be regulated by APOE. Our findings highlight CP as a critical locus for studying AD pathogenesis and the mechanisms by which APOE4 promotes AD.
40229450	Predicting survival in prospective clinical trials using weakly-supervised QSP.	Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models of cancer immunity provide mechanistic insights into cellular dynamics and drug effects that are difficult to study clinically. However, their inability to predict patient survival mechanistically limits their utility in anti-cancer drug development. To overcome this, we link virtual patients from a QSP model to real clinical trial patients. Using data from atezolizumab trials in non-small cell lung cancer, we show that tumor-based linkage effectively captures survival outcomes. By treating linked survival and censoring as weak supervision labels, we trained survival models using only QSP model covariates, without clinical covariates. Our approach also predicts survival for treatments not included in training data. Specifically, we accurately estimated survival hazard ratios (HR) for chemotherapy monotherapy and atezolizumab plus chemotherapy combination. The predicted HR of 0.70 (95% prediction interval [PI] 0.55-0.86) closely matches the observed HR of 0.79 (95% PI 0.64-0.98) from the IMpower130 trial.
40229449	Virtual urgent care in an integrated value based healthcare system.	Virtual urgent care (VUC) is not well understood when delivered through an integrated value-based healthcare system. The Southern California Permanente Medical Group operates Get Care Now (GCN), a VUC program complementing its urgent care clinics (UCC). Quality and patient experience dimensions are included in this study, comparing GCN and UCC patients. Females and Hispanics/Latinos were predominant in both groups and proportions of patients with chronic conditions were nearly identical within the leading 30-49 age band. Wait times for GCN were 21.19 min lower than for UCC, and positive patient survey results align with GCN's average Net Promoter Score of 87. 3-day return rates to the ED (2.53% GCN vs. 3.26% UCC) and to UCC (5.44% GCN vs. 2.42% UCC) were comparable between GCN and UCC utilizers. Findings demonstrate that 24/7 VUC sustainably supports meeting patient demand for urgent care services in an integrated value-based system.
40229448	Protein-responsive gut hormone tachykinin directs food choice and impacts lifespan.	Animals select food based on hungers that reflect dynamic macronutrient needs, but the hormonal mechanisms underlying nutrient-specific appetite regulation remain poorly defined. Here, we identify tachykinin (Tk) as a protein-responsive gut hormone in Drosophila and female mice, regulated by conserved environmental and nutrient-sensing mechanisms. Protein intake activates Tk-expressing enteroendocrine cells (EECs), driving the release of gut Tk through mechanisms involving target of rapamycin (TOR) and transient receptor potential A1 (TrpA1). In flies, we delineate a pathway by which gut Tk controls selective appetite and sleep after protein ingestion, mediated by glucagon-like adipokinetic hormone (AKH) signalling to neurons and adipose tissue. This mechanism suppresses protein appetite, promotes sugar hunger and modulates wakefulness to align behaviour with nutritional needs. Inhibiting protein-responsive gut Tk prolongs lifespan through AKH, revealing a role for nutrient-dependent gut hormone signalling in longevity. Our results provide a framework for understanding EEC-derived nutrient-specific satiety signals and the role of gut hormones in regulating food choice, sleep and lifespan.

40229446	Evaluation of disaster risk perception and influencing factors among hospital personnel using structural equation modeling.	Disaster-risk perception (DRP) plays a critical role in disaster risk management (DRM) by enhancing community preparedness through protective actions and intervention measures before, during, and after disasters. This study investigated variations in DRP among hospital employees based on socio-demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 2145 hospital employees (933 males and 1212 females) aged 20 to 65 from multiple hospitals in Tehran, Iran. DRP was assessed using six factors: exposure, knowledge, familiarity, preventability, worry, and dread. Data were collected via a valid and reliable questionnaire, and the overall DRP score was calculated using an index-based approach. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), incorporating confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and path analysis, was employed to evaluate relationships among the DRP factors. The mean DRP score for hospital employees was 2.878 ± 1.0236, with "familiarity" receiving the highest score (3.101 ± 0.9793) and "dread" the lowest (2.457 ± 0.9506). DRP significantly differed by gender, age, education level, and occupation (p < 0.01). Females, employees aged 40-49, and those with MSc. or Ph.D. degrees demonstrated higher DRP scores. Managers exhibited the highest DRP, while cleaning workers had the lowest. SEM analysis revealed significant relationships among DRP factors, including a positive association between exposure and knowledge (β = 0.61, p = 0.000) and a negative association between preventability and dread (β= -0.35, p = 0.000). These findings highlight the importance of designing targeted disaster training programs that address socio-demographic differences. Enhancing preparedness among healthcare workers through tailored education and interventions is essential for strengthening DRM. Future research should explore the weighting of DRP factors to refine disaster preparedness strategies further.
40229445	Intracranial response to positive end-expiratory pressure is influenced by lung recruitability and gas distribution during mechanical ventilation in acute brain injury patients: a proof-of-concept physiological study.	The effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics in patients with acute brain injury (ABI) remains controversial. PEEP can benefit oxygenation by promoting alveolar recruitment, but its influence on ICP is complex. The primary aims of this study were to investigate 1) how lung recruitability influences oxygenation and 2) how lung recruitability and regional gas distribution, measured via recruitment-to-inflation (RI) ratio and electrical impedance tomography (EIT), affect ICP in response to PEEP changes in critically ill patients in their early phase of ABI.

40229443	Mipep deficiency in adipocytes impairs mitochondrial protein maturation and leads to systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunctions.	Most mitochondrial proteins encoded in the nuclear genome are synthesized in the cytoplasm. These proteins subsequently undergo maturation through the cleavage of a signal sequence at the N-terminus by one or two mitochondrial signal peptidases, which is essential for their function within mitochondria. The present study demonstrates that adipocyte-specific knockout of one mitochondrial signal peptidase, mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIPEP), resulted in disordered mitochondrial proteostasis of MIPEP substrate proteins and their defective maturation. MIPEP deficiency in white and brown adipocytes suppressed the expression of adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial biogenesis genes. These alterations led to lipoatrophy in white adipose tissue and the whitening of brown adipose tissue. Additionally, it induced an atypical mitochondrial unfolded protein response and local inflammation in white and brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, it induced fatty liver and splenomegaly and caused systemic impairments in glucose metabolism and inflammation. These findings indicate that maturation defects of certain mitochondrial proteins and subsequent proteostasis disorders in white and brown adipocytes cause chronic and systemic inflammatory and metabolic dysfunctions.

40229437	OsPIP2;4 aquaporin water channel primarily expressed in roots of rice mediates both water and nonselective Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> conductance.	Aquaporin (AQP)-dependent water transport across membranes is indispensable in plants. Recent evidence shows that several AQPs, including plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), facilitate the electrogenic transport of ions as well as water transport and are referred to as ion-conducting aquaporins (icAQPs). The present study attempted to identify icAQPs that exhibit cation transport activity among PIPs from rice. Electrophysiological experiments on 11 OsPIPs using Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that OsPIP2;4 mediated the electrogenic transport of alkali monovalent cations with the selectivity sequence of Na<sup>+</sup> ≈ K<sup>+</sup> > Rb<sup>+</sup> > Cs<sup>+</sup> > Li<sup>+</sup>, suggesting non-selective cation conductance for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. Transcripts of OsPIP2;4 were abundant in the elongation and mature zones of roots with similar expression levels between the root stelar and remaining outer parts in the cultivar Nipponbare. Immunostaining using sections of the crown roots of Nipponbare plants revealed the expression of OsPIP2;4 in the exodermis and sclerenchyma of the surface region and in the endodermis and pericycle of the stelar region. The present results provide novel insights into OsPIP2;4-dependent non-selective Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> transport and its physiological roles in rice.
40229436	Targeting a key disulfide linkage to regulate RIG-I condensation and cytosolic RNA-sensing.	Maintaining innate immune homeostasis is critical for preventing infections and autoimmune diseases but effective interventions are lacking. Here we identified C864-C869-mediated intermolecular disulfide-linkage formation as a critical step for human RIG-I activation that can be bidirectionally regulated to control innate immune homeostasis. The viral-stimulated C864-C869 disulfide linkage mediates conjugation of an SDS-resistant RIG-I oligomer, which prevents RIG-I degradation by E3 ubiquitin-ligase MIB2 and is necessary for RIG-I to perform liquid-liquid phase separation to compartmentalize downstream signalsome, thereby stimulating type I interferon signalling. The corresponding C865S 'knock-in' caused an oligomerization defect and liquid-liquid phase separation in mouse RIG-I, which inhibited innate immunity, resulting in increased viral load and mortality in mice. Using unnatural amino acids to generate covalent C864-C869 linkage and the development of an interfering peptide to block C864-C869 residues, we bidirectionally regulated RIG-I activities in human diseases. These findings provide in-depth insights on mechanism of RIG-I activation, allowing for the development of methodologies that hold promising implications in clinics.
40229435	A hybrid learning network with progressive resizing and PCA for diagnosis of cervical cancer on WSI slides.	Current artificial intelligence (AI) trends are revolutionizing medical image processing, greatly improving cervical cancer diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can discover patterns and anomalies in medical images, whereas deep learning (DL) methods, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are extremely accurate at identifying malignant lesions. Deep models that have been pre-trained and tailored through transfer learning and fine-tuning become faster and more effective, even when data is scarce. This paper implements a state-of-the-art Hybrid Learning Network that combines the Progressive Resizing approach and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for enhanced cervical cancer diagnostics of whole slide images (WSI) slides. ResNet-152 and VGG-16, two fine-tuned DL models, are employed together with transfer learning to train on augmented and progressively resized training data with dimensions of 224 × 224, 512 × 512, and 1024 × 1024 pixels for enhanced feature extraction. Principal component analysis (PCA) is subsequently employed to process the combined features extracted from two DL models and reduce the dimensional space of the feature set. Furthermore, two ML methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models, are trained on this reduced feature set, and their predictions are integrated using a majority voting approach for evaluating the final classification results, thereby enhancing overall accuracy and reliability. The accuracy of the suggested framework on SIPaKMeD data is 99.29% for two-class classification and 98.47% for five-class classification. Furthermore, it achieves 100% accuracy for four-class categorization on the LBC dataset.

40229433	A comparative study to assess synchronisation methods for combined simultaneous EEG and TMS acquisition.	Electroencephalography (EEG) combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides valuable insights into cortical excitability and connectivity but faces challenges including data artefacts, limited spatial resolution, and the need for standardised synchronisation protocols. This study evaluates three TMS-EEG synchronisation paradigms using the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) to analyse time intervals and latency. Paradigm 1 employs a software-based approach with simultaneous pulses to both EEG and TMS devices. Paradigm 2, another software-based method, transmits a pulse to the TMS device first, followed by the EEG amplifier. Paradigm 3 uses a hardware-based approach where pulses generated by the TMS device are directly routed to the EEG amplifier. Synchronisation was assessed at frequencies of 1, 5, 10, and 20 Hz, with each frequency tested ten times using 100-pulse trains. Results demonstrate that Paradigm 3 provides superior performance, showing narrower distributions, lower time interval error (TIE) and latency values, and higher precision and accuracy. However, it requires a high sample rate from the EEG amplifier and limits additional device integration. Paradigms 1 and 2, while exhibiting greater variability and lower precision, allow for additional device integration and inter-pulse control via LSL. All paradigms achieved low latency and timing error values within acceptable limits for EEG applications, affirming their viability. The choice of synchronisation paradigm has a significant impact on performance, and the current lack of standardisation in TMS-EEG studies presents ongoing challenges. These findings underscore the necessity of selecting an appropriate synchronisation method based on specific study requirements and resources, potentially advancing standardised protocols for TMS and enhancing the reliability of TMS-EEG research.
40229432	Group A Streptococcal asparagine metabolism regulates bacterial virulence.	Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes various human diseases linked to virulome expression predominantly regulated by the two-component system (TCS), CovR/S. Here, we demonstrate that asparagine (Asn) presence in a minimal chemically defined medium increases virulence gene expression in a CovR-dependent fashion. It also decreases the transcription of asparagine synthetase (AsnA), the ABC transporter responsible for Asn uptake (GlnPQ), and that of the hemolysin toxins responsible for scavenging Asn from the host. Metabolomics data show that Asn availability increases intracellular ADP/ATP ratio, which enhances phosphatase activity in structurally related CovS sensors and is probably responsible for the Asn-mediated decrease in CovR phosphorylation. Mutants deficient in AsnA, GlnPQ, asparaginase, (AsnB) activities are attenuated in a mouse model of human GAS invasive soft tissue infection. The similarity between the mechanisms of Asn-mediated regulation of GAS virulence and tumor growth suggests that, as in cancer, components maintaining Asn homeostasis could be targeted for anti-GAS treatments.
40229431	Septo-optic dysplasia and gastroschisis: trends in birth prevalence and association with maternal age.	This study aims to describe the risk factors and trends in birth prevalence of septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) and gastroschisis between 1980 and 2023. This descriptive, population-based study of SOD and gastroschisis used Western Australian Register of Developmental Anomalies data from 1980 to 2023. Birth prevalence was calculated using Midwives Notification System data for all births after 20 weeks gestation. Relative risk (RR) for SOD and gastroschisis showed risk by maternal age. SOD and gastroschisis occurred in 99 and 391 cases respectively (no dual diagnoses), with a birth prevalence of 1.41 and 3.71 per 10,000 respectively (from 2010 to 2019), and have been stable since 2010. For the study period, younger maternal age (under 25 years old) increased the risk of SOD and gastroschisis (RR, 3.28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.13-5.00]; RR, 4.50 [95% CI 3.68-5.49] respectively). From 2010 to 2023, median maternal age increased for SOD and gastroschisis by 4.8 years (p = 0.044) to 27.0 and by 2.8 years (p < 0.001) to 25.5, respectively. Mothers living in areas of greater socioeconomic disadvantage had higher risk (RR, 1.81 [95% CI 1.14-2.88] in SOD and RR, 1.41 [95% CI 1.06-1.86] in gastroschisis), independent of maternal age. Premature birth was more common in children with SOD and gastroschisis.

40229422	Development of an AAV-RNAi strategy to silence the dominant variant GNAO1 c.607G>A linked to encephalopathy.	Heterozygous mutations in GNAO1 cause an ultra-rare neurodevelopmental disease called GNAO1 encephalopathy, characterized by infantile epilepsy and movement disorder. Here, we provide a functional characterization of the hotspot mutation GNAO1 c.607G>A (p.G203R) and conduct early-phase development of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy approach. The GNAO1 gene encodes the Gαo protein that is involved in neuronal signaling. We showed that the Gαo-G203R lost its ability to enhance forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis in HEK293T cells. In primary neuronal culture, Gαo-G203R had a dominant-negative effect on neuronal activity and GABA<sub>B</sub>-dependent synaptic release. To ablate the mutant protein, we used selective silencing of the pathogenic variant using effectors of RNA interference (RNAi). We selected the short hairpin RNA (sh1500) that suppressed the c.607G>A transcripts, resulting in a 3.8-fold increase in the ratio of wild-type to mutant GNAO1 transcripts in patient-specific neurons. We also detected off-target effects of sh1500 as well as transcriptome changes associated with AAV transduction and RNAi activation. We improved the AAV construct by using an artificial miRNA (miR1500) and the neuron-specific hSyn promoter. Systemic administration of AAV9-hSyn-miR1500 did not cause pathological changes in Gnao1-GGA mice with a "humanized" target sequence. Importantly, AAV9 transduced Gαo-positive neurons in the striatum, thalamus, substantia nigra, and cerebellum, which we defined as primary targets for gene therapy. Our findings pave the road toward the development of AAV-RNAi approaches for dominant-negative GNAO1 variants.

40229419	Estimation and validation of solubility of recombinant protein in E. coli strains via various advanced machine learning models.	This study presents a comprehensive approach to predicting solubility of recombinant protein in four E. coli samples by employing machine learning techniques and optimization algorithms. Various models, including AdaBoost, Decision Tree Regression (DT), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are applied to capture the intricate relationships between experimental factors and protein solubility. The integration of these models within an AdaBoost framework, coupled with advanced hyperparameter tuning via the Firefly Algorithm (FA), demonstrates a novel strategy for improving predictive accuracy and model robustness. Key preprocessing techniques such as Histogram-Based Outlier Detection (HBOD) and Z-score normalization are employed to ensure data integrity and consistency. The Firefly Algorithm (FA), utilizing 5-fold cross-validation as the fitness function, adeptly navigates complex hyperparameter spaces, enhancing model performance across diverse data partitions. The AdaBoost with Gaussian Process Regression (ADA-GPR) model established to be superior to alternatives including ADA-DT and ADA-KNN, demonstrating great performance through high R<sup>2</sup> test scores and low Mean Squared Error. With a standard deviation of 0.05188 across 5-fold cross-validation, ADA-GPR demonstrated exceptional consistency and robust generalization across diverse data partitions. Using hybrid optimization, this study sheds light on critical variables influencing protein solubility, providing a scalable and effective solution for modeling bioprocesses.
40229418	Integrating machine learning driven virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations to identify potential inhibitors targeting PARP1 against prostate cancer.	Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common types of malignancies in men, with a noteworthy increase in newly diagnosed cases in recent years. PARP1 is a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair, nuclear transport, ribosome synthesis, and epigenetic bookmarking. In this study, a library of 9000 phytochemicals was screened, with a focus on those with high drug efficacy and potential PARP1 inhibition. Different machine learning models were generated and assessed using various statistical measures. The RF model outperformed all other models in terms of accuracy (0.9489), specificity (0.9171), and area under the curve (AUC = 0.9846). Following this, a library of 9510 phytochemicals was screened, yielding 181 compounds predicted to be active. These compounds were subsequently assessed using Lipinski's Rule of Five, yielding 40 interesting candidates. Molecular docking experiments demonstrated that compound ZINC2356684563, ZINC2356558598, and ZINC14584870, had strong affinity for the PARP1 active site. Further molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA validated the stability of the ligand-protein complexes, with ZINC14584870 and ZINC43120769 demonstrating the most stable interaction, as seen by low RMSD and RMSF levels. Our findings emphasize the potential of these phytochemical inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents against PARP1 in prostate cancer treatment, paving the path for further experimental validation and clinical investigations. These results open new possibilities for developing treatments to benefit prostate cancer patients.
40229417	Factor of safety prediction for slope stability using PCA and BPNN in Guangdong's H mining area.	Evaluating slope failure is a primary concern in geotechnical engineering, and employing advanced machine learning techniques to design Factor of Safety (FOS) has become a critical focus. This study introduces a method that integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) to predict the FOS. Compared to existing machine learning design approaches, the PCA-BPNN method demonstrates superior accuracy, achieving an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.917, RMSE of 0.061, and MAE of 0.047 for the training set, and an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.879, RMSE of 0.071, and MAE of 0.057 for the testing set. This method is applied to assess the slope stability of the H mining area in Guangdong, China, resulting in a designed FOS of 1.409, which meets practical engineering requirements. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the PCA-BPNN method in enhancing slope stability assessments in geotechnical applications.
40229416	The impact of the integrated people-centered eye care model on myopia control among children and adolescents in China.	To evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated people-centered eye car"365 Eye Care," in controlling myopia among children and adolescents in northeast China. Additionally, the study aimed to explore the model's impact on different subgroups. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the changes in spherical equivalent(∆SE) within one year of 427 participants and 494 control participants who underwent the "365 Eye Care"project at He Eye Specialist Hospital from January 2021 to December 2023. The effectiveness of "365 Eye Care"on vision protection was analyzed. The difference between the two groups was further analyzed when the baseline SE was constant. The project included the analysis of the causes of myopia and the formulation of individualized myopia prevention and control plans, monthly vision examination and visual status monitoring, and assessing the eye environment (including diet, light, table and chair selection, etc.) The 1-year change in SE(∆SE) was - 0.46 ± 0.36 for the "365 eyecare" group and- 1.82 ± 1.14 for the control group (P < 0.001). The SE for pre-myopia, low myopia, and moderate myopia were significantly lower than the control group(P < 0.001), and the difference was - 1.25D, - 1.38D, - 0.81D, respectively. There was no difference between the two groups in high myopia. The results showed that the comprehensive eye care intervention helped slow down the progression of myopia, and the average effect level was 0.71. The integrated people-centered eye care model, "365 eyecare," holds promise for myopia control. And the earlier the children participated in the comprehensive intervention, the better the myopia prevention and control effect.
40229415	A novel peptide RR-171 derived from human umbilical cord serum induces apoptosis and pyroptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.	Human umbilical cord serum is full of molecules that play vital roles in foetal development. This study aimed to explore the effects of RR-171, a novel peptide derived from umbilical cord serum, on pancreatic cancer cells and to elucidate its mechanisms. The anti-pancreatic cancer properties of RR-171 were detected by a cell counting kit-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, LDH release and EdU incorporation assays. RNA sequencing and gene enrichment analysis were applied to identify the differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways. Western blotting analysis was used to detect the expression of proteins. A subcutaneous xenograft model was used to examine the effect of RR-171 on pancreatic cancer cells in vivo. The results demonstrated that RR-171 inhibited the viability, proliferation and colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that RR-171 inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, RR-171 significantly induced apoptosis and pyroptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Z-VAD-FMK partly reversed the proapoptotic effect of RR-171, and VX-765 partly reversed the pro-pyroptotic effect of RR-171. Finally, RR-171 inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in a subcutaneous xenograft mice model and suppressed the expression of Ki-67 and PCNA in tumors. In conclusion, RR-171 induces apoptosis and pyroptosis through multiple pathways and inhibits pancreatic cancer growth, suggesting that RR-171 might be a potential agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
40229414	An implantable hydrogel-based phononic crystal for continuous and wireless monitoring of internal tissue strains.	Conventional implantable electronic sensors for continuous monitoring of internal tissue strains are yet to match the biomechanics of tissues while maintaining biodegradability, biocompatibility and wireless monitoring capability. Here we present a two-dimensional phononic crystal composed of periodic air columns in soft hydrogel, which was named ultrasonic metagel, and we demonstrate its use as implantable sensor for continuous and wireless monitoring of internal tissue strains. The metagel's deformation shifts its ultrasonic bandgap, which can be wirelessly detected by an external ultrasonic probe. We demonstrate ex vivo the ability of the metagel sensor for monitoring tissue strains on porcine tendon, wounded tissue and heart. In live pigs, we further demonstrate the ability of the metagel to monitor tendon stretching, respiration and heartbeat, working stably during 30 days of implantation, and we loaded the metagel with growth factors to achieve different healing rates in subcutaneous wounds. The metagel results almost completely degraded 12 weeks after implantation. Our finding highlights the clinical potential of the ultrasonic sensor for tendon rehabilitation monitoring and drug delivery efficacy evaluation.

40229412	Grey wolf optimizer with self-repulsion strategy for feature selection.	Feature selection is one of the most critical steps in big data analysis. Accurately extracting correct features from massive data can effectively improve the accuracy of big data processing algorithms. However, traditional grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithms often suffer from slow convergence and a tendency to fall into local optima, limiting their effectiveness in high-dimensional feature selection tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm called grey wolf optimizer with self-repulsion strategy (GWO-SRS). In GWO-SRS, the hierarchical structure of the wolf pack is flattened to enable rapid transmission of commands from the alpha wolf to each member, thereby accelerating convergence. Additionally, two distinct learning strategies are employed: the self-repulsion learning strategy for the alpha wolf and the pack learning strategy based on the predatory behavior of the alpha wolf, facilitating rapid self-learning for both the alpha wolf and the pack. These improvements effectively mitigate the weaknesses of traditional GWO, such as premature convergence and limited exploration capability. Finally, we conduct a comparative experimental analysis on the UCI test dataset using five relevant feature selection algorithms. The results demonstrate that the average classification error of GWO-SRS is reduced by approximately 15% compared to related algorithms, while utilizing 20% fewer features. This work highlights the need to address the inherent limitations of GWO and provides a robust solution to complex feature selection problems.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is essential for assessing brain microstructure but requires long acquisition times, limiting clinical use. Recent deep learning (DL) approaches, such as SuperDTI or deepDTI, improve DTI metrics but demand large, high-quality datasets for training. We propose a self-supervised deep learning with fine-tuning (SSDLFT) framework to reduce training data requirements. SSDLFT involves self-supervised pretraining, which denoises data without clean labels, followed by fine-tuning with limited high-quality data. Experiments using Human Connectome Project data show that SSDLFT outperforms traditional methods and other DL approaches in qualitative and quantitative assessments of DWI reconstructions and tensor metrics. SSDLFT's ability to maintain high performance with fewer training subjects and DWIs presents a significant advancement, enhancing DTI's practical applications in clinical and research settings.
40229410	Extending atomic decomposition and many-body representation with a chemistry-motivated approach to machine learning potentials.	Most widely used machine learning potentials for condensed-phase applications rely on many-body permutationally invariant polynomial or atom-centered neural networks. However, these approaches face challenges in achieving chemical interpretability in atomistic energy decomposition and fully matching the computational efficiency of traditional force fields. Here we present a method that combines aspects of both approaches and balances accuracy and force-field-level speed. This method utilizes a monomer-centered representation, where the potential energy is decomposed into the sum of chemically meaningful monomeric energies. The structural descriptors of monomers are described by one-body and two-body effective interactions, enforced by appropriate sets of permutationally invariant polynomials as inputs to the feed-forward neural networks. Systematic assessments of models for gas-phase water trimer, liquid water, methane-water cluster and liquid carbon dioxide are performed. The improved accuracy, efficiency and flexibility of this method have promise for constructing accurate machine learning potentials and enabling large-scale quantum and classical simulations for complex molecular systems.

40229407	Glutamylation of centrosomes ensures their function by recruiting microtubule nucleation factors.	Centrosomes are tubulin-based organelles that undergo glutamylation, a post-translational modification that conjugates glutamic acid residues to tubulins. Although centrosomal glutamylation has been known for several decades, how this modification regulates centrosome structure and function remains unclear. To address this long-standing issue, we developed a method to spatiotemporally reduce centrosomal glutamylation by recruiting an engineered deglutamylase to centrosomes. We found that centrosome structure remains largely unaffected by centrosomal hypoglutamylation. Intriguingly, glutamylation physically recruits, via electrostatic forces, the NEDD1/CEP192/γ-tubulin complex to centrosomes, ensuring microtubule nucleation and proper trafficking of centriolar satellites. The consequent defect in centriolar satellite trafficking leads to reduced levels of the ciliogenesis factor Talpid3, suppressing ciliogenesis. Centrosome glutamylation also promotes proper mitotic spindle formation and mitosis. In summary, our study provides a new approach to spatiotemporally manipulate glutamylation at centrosomes, and offers novel insights into how centrosomes are organized and regulated by glutamylation.
40229406	Analysis of water resources carrying capacity and obstacle factors in Gansu section of the Wei River basin using combined weighting TOPSIS model.	Water resource carrying capacity is an important indicator for measuring sustainable development. Given the rapid economic and social development in China today, coordinating the sustainable development of water resources, socio-economy, and eco-environment has become an urgent problem to be solved. This study takes the Gansu section of Wei River mainstream basin (GWRB) as a case study and constructs a three-dimensional WRCC evaluation system and status standards. Based on this research framework, we analyzed the trends in WRCC changes of GWRB from 2008 to 2022. Additionally, we conducted an in-depth study of the internal relationships and influencing factors within the WRCC system. The results show that the combination weighting method of multi-weight models avoids the one-sidedness of single weighting, leading to a more realistic distribution of weights. The result status standard derived from the indicator status standard prevents a disconnect between the result and the status, making the evaluation more rational and accurate. The WRCC of the GWRB increased from 0.098 (overloaded) in 2008 to 0.621 (weakly bearable) in 2022. During this period, the eco-environmental system improved from critical to bearable, while the socio-economic system improved from overloaded to weakly bearable. Due to geographical and climatic limitations, the water resource system continued to bear significant pressure and remained in overloaded state for most of the time. The key factors limiting the further improvement of WRCC in the GWRB are per capita water resources, utilization rate of water resources, COD emission per 10,000 yuan of GDP, ecological water use rate, water consumption per 10,000 GDP and agricultural water use rate. To improve the WRCC, we propose a series of targeted recommendations based on the research findings. The proposed research framework can also serve as a reference for related studies in arid and semi-arid regions.
40229405	The effect of aromatherapy and music therapy on blood pressure and heart rate of nursing students before taking the exam.	Anxiety associated with taking exams jeopardizes students' mental and physical health. Complementary alternative methods, such as aromatherapy and music therapy, have shown promise in reducing negative emotions among students. However, few studies have examined the effects of these interventions. This study aimed to investigate the effects of aromatherapy and music therapy on nursing students' blood pressure (BP) and heart rate before taking an exam. This quasi-experimental, double-blinded study was conducted in 2023 at the Nursing College of Abadan University of Medical Sciences in Abadan, Iran. The research included a total of 169 nursing students, who were randomly assigned to three groups: an aromatherapy group (n = 60), a music therapy group (n = 56), and a control group (n = 53). Aromatherapy was administered by inhaling lavender and damask rose essences, while music therapy involved listening to Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata." The control group received a placebo intervention consisting of cotton soaked in 10 drops of water. Each intervention lasted twenty minutes and was conducted in separate rooms before an exam. Students' heart rates and BP (both systolic and diastolic) were recorded before and after the intervention. The study showed remarkable effects of aromatherapy and music therapy on blood pressure and pulse rate. While systolic blood pressure (SBP) was similar in all groups at the beginning of the study (p = 0.205), SBP decreased significantly after the intervention (p = 0.016), especially in the aromatherapy (p = 0.003) and music therapy (p < 0.001) groups. Both interventions also significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate (p < 0.001) compared to baseline. However, except for SBP (p = 0.021), ANCOVA tests did not reveal significant differences between the study groups for diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate (p > 0.05). The reduction in students' systolic BP before exams, observed with complementary therapies like music therapy and aromatherapy using lavender and damask rose extracts, suggests a decrease in stress-related physiological responses, However, the specific link to exam-related anxiety requires further clarification.
40229404	Association between in-hospital hemoglobin drop without overt bleeding and 1-year outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention in acute myocardial infarction patients.	Whether an in-hospital hemoglobin drop adversely affects the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains controversial. The present study aimed to investigate the impacts of in-hospital hemoglobin drop without overt bleeding on 1-year clinical outcomes of AMI patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 5,036 AMI patients who underwent PCI and presented with an in-hospital hemoglobin decline without overt bleeding were recruited in this study. Subsequently, these patients were stratified into three cohorts based on tertiles of hemoglobin drop values: < 0.8 g/dL (n = 1652), 0.8-1.49 g/dL (n = 1651) and ≥ 1.5 g/dL (n = 1733). The primary endpoint was defined as ischemic events at 1 year, composed of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Secondary endpoints were defined as 1-year all-cause death, Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) types 2, 3, or 5, and 3 or 5 bleeding. There were significant differences in 1-year incidence of ischemic events (1.88% vs. 3.27% vs. 3.46%; P = 0.0114), all-cause death (1.45% vs. 2.18% vs. 2.94%; P = 0.0128), as well as cardiac death (1.15% vs. 1.82% vs. 2.37%; P = 0.0282) and MI (0.30% vs. 1.15% vs. 0.92%; P = 0.0175) across tertiles of hemoglobin drop values. For each 1 g/dL drop in hemoglobin values, the adjusted risk for ischemic events and all-cause death increased by 2% and 3%, respectively. Among AMI patients undergoing PCI, an in-hospital decline in hemoglobin levels was associated with an increased risk of 1-year ischemic events and all-cause death, even in the absence of overt bleeding.
40229403	Analysis of risk factors of social frailty in older adults living with HIV/AIDS.	As a predictor of mortality, accidental disability, depressive symptoms, and other adverse outcomes in the older population, social frailty has yet to receive attention among older adults living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, this study, using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Random Forest (RF), aims to analyze the current status and risk factors of social frailty in older adults living with HIV/AIDS and provides a basis for its prevention and reversal. From January to December 2024, a total of 335 older adults living with HIV/AIDS (≥ 50 years old) receiving outpatient treatment at a tertiary hospital in Zunyi, Guizhou, China, were selected using convenience sampling. Data were collected through a general information questionnaire (demographic and clinical disease), the HALFT scale for social frailty, the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15), the Barthel Index (BI), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). Data processing and analysis were conducted using SPSS 29.0, Python 3.11, and R 4.3.1. Among the 335 older adults living with HIV/AIDS, 105 cases (31.34%) exhibited social frailty. LASSO regression was used for validation, and based on the lambda.min value (λ = 0.0127), 12 relevant variables with non-zero coefficients were selected from 26 variables. These 12 variables were then incorporated into the RF model, which identified that older adults living with HIV/AIDS with reduced activities of daily living (ADL), lack of exercise, cognitive impairment, depression, lower social support, older age, sleep disorders, low CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte counts, low per capita household income, complications, smoking history, and those enrolled in China's free antiretroviral therapy (ART) program faced a higher risk of social frailty. The top five risk factors in order of importance were ADL, exercise, cognitive impairment, depression, and social support. The incidence of social frailty is relatively high among older adults living with HIV/AIDS. The risk factors include ADL, exercise, cognitive impairment, depression, social support, age, sleep disorders, CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte count, per capita household income, complications, smoking history, and participation in China's free ART program. This highlights the importance of healthcare institutions and community healthcare workers addressing social frailty in older adults living with HIV/AIDS. Early identification of the risk factors can help prevent or reverse the onset and progression of social frailty, improving prognosis and quality of life. It also provides a theoretical foundation for developing targeted intervention measures.
40229402	Comparison of flow cytometry and heterotrophic plate count methods for dialysis water microbial monitoring.	Water is an essential component of renal replacement therapy by dialysis. Haemodialysis patients undergoing 4-hour dialysis sessions, thrice weekly, may be exposed to more than 360 L of dialysis fluid per week. Dialysis water and ultrapure dialysis fluids have been established as a prerequisite for online convective therapies (namely haemodiafiltration), to improve biocompatibility of the dialysis system and to reduce inflammation profile of the dialysis patients. The microbial quality of dialysis water should be monitored regularly to demonstrate the effectiveness of the disinfection protocol. Current water and dialysis fluids microbial quality assessment is typically done via heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) and endotoxins analysis. Plate counts methodology provides information on the microbial content of the water only after a considerable incubation time (typically 7 days). Flow cytometry (FCM), as a rapid alternative method, provides the possibility of real-time corrective actions and greater patient safety. In this study, we compared the outcomes of dialysis water microbial quality in an existing dialysis clinic, using two different measurement methods, HPC and FCM, to test the possible benefits of applying FCM as a valid alternative method for dialysis water microbial monitoring. We conclude that FCM offers higher sensitivity than HPC for microbial monitoring of dialysis water, potentially enabling earlier corrective actions. More extensive and larger studies are needed, namely, to evaluate the possible added value of FCM method in dialysis fluids monitoring. If the FCM method is confirmed, it will be necessary to establish maximum allowable levels and typical action levels for dialysis water and dialysis fluids quality when using FCM.
40229401	Population-level individualized prospective prediction of opioid overdose using machine learning.	The opioid overdose epidemic has rapidly expanded in North America, with rates accelerating during the COVID-19 pandemic. No existing study has demonstrated prospective opioid overdose at a population level. This study aimed to develop and validate a population-level individualized prospective prediction model of opioid overdose (OpOD) using machine learning (ML) and de-identified provincial administrative health data. The OpOD prediction model was based on a cohort of approximately 4 million people in 2017 to predict OpOD cases in 2018 and was subsequently tested on cohort data from 2018, 2019, and 2020 to predict OpOD cases in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The model's predictive performance, including balanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC), was evaluated, achieving a balanced accuracy of 83.7, 81.6, and 85.0% in each respective year. The leading predictors for OpOD, which were derived from health care utilization variables documented by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and physician billing claims, were treatment encounters for drug or alcohol use, depression, neurotic/anxiety/obsessive-compulsive disorder, and superficial skin injury. The main contribution of our study is to demonstrate that ML-based individualized OpOD prediction using existing population-level data can provide accurate prediction of future OpOD cases in the whole population and may have the potential to inform targeted interventions and policy planning.
40229400	Possible association between metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease predictors and hand grip strength.	Both Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) and sarcopenia are associated with numerous chronic diseases, and the link between the two broad-spectrum phenotypes has been extensively researched. We focused on the relationship between the hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and hand grip strength (HGS). The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2014-2019) were utilized to identify the association between estimated MASLD (eMASLD) and muscle strength. HSI determined eMASLD status, and HGS evaluated muscle strength. The HSI demonstrated a positive correlation with HGS. The alanine transaminase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ratio and diabetes among the five components of HSI exhibited significant relationships with HGS in men and women. The robust linearity between HSI and HGS was observed in multivariate models and stratified analyses, particularly in older non-diabetic men with a higher body mass index (BMI) and young women without diabetes. However, younger men and older women exhibited nonlinear associations influenced by the ALT/AST ratio, BMI, and diabetes. After adjusting HGS with BMI, a significant negative association between HSI and muscle strength was observed, particularly in women. The disruption in linearity was influenced by the ALT/AST ratio, particularly in men with diabetes. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between HSI and HGS. The relationship between the two broad-range phenotypes was observed, and liver profiles influenced the linearity.
40229399	Effect of high-altitude hypoxia on function and cytoarchitecture of rats' liver.	The liver is central to metabolic, detoxification, and homeostatic functions. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes causes detrimental effects on the liver, leading to injury. This study evaluated the effect of hypoxia-induced at high altitudes on liver function, oxidative stress, and histopathological changes in rats. This study used 24 male Wistar rats (aged 8-10 weeks). The hypoxia (hypobaric hypoxia) was inducted at a high altitude of 2,100 m above sea level. Normoxia is defined as 40 m above the sea level. The rats were randomly divided into two groups: a control group maintained at low altitudes and an experimental group exposed to high altitudes for eight weeks. Blood samples were collected from all rats through a cardiac puncture, and liver samples were taken through an abdominal approach. All samples were processed through standard methods and evaluated for liver function tests and histopathological assessment. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase levels significantly increased by 25% and 30%, respectively, in the high-altitude group compared to controls (p < 0.01), indicating mild hepatocellular damage. Oxidative stress assessment indicated a significant elevation in malondialdehyde by 42% in the liver homogenates of high-altitude rats compared to controls (p < 0.001). Moreover, Superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione content decreased by 18% and 22% in the high-altitude group (p < 0.01), confirming the increased oxidative stress. Histologically, minimal inflammatory infiltration was observed in the rat livers at high altitudes, with no signs of necrosis or severe structural changes. Subclinical liver dysfunction, as evidenced by altered serum enzyme levels and increased oxidative stress with mild histological changes, is induced by high-altitude hypoxia in rats. This study's results support that a hypobaric hypoxic environment physiologically stresses the liver. Further research into the long-term implications of hypobaric hypoxia and the adaptive responses of the liver is warranted.
40229398	Species- and context-dependent responses of green lacewings suggest a complex ecological role for methyl salicylate (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae).	Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are important semiochemicals in multitrophic plant-insect interactions, attracting natural enemies of phytophagous insects. Numerous studies have reported attraction of natural enemies to the HIPV methyl salicylate, including green lacewings. However, previous reports provide conflicting data, as some studies report significant attraction, whereas others found moderate or no attraction, even for the same taxa. In the current study, we conducted field experiments in Hungary with methyl salicylate and known attractants for Chrysoperla spp. and Chrysopa spp. lacewings. Both males and females of Chrysoperla carnea species complex were attracted to methyl salicylate, but to a much lesser extent compared to phenylacetaldehyde, a previously known floral attractant. When presented in combination, methyl salicylate showed a synergistic effect, confirming results of previous research performed in Hungary. On the other hand, methyl salicylate did not attract Chrysopa formosa. When tested in combination with known sex attractants for C. formosa males, it synergized male attraction to the aphid sex pheromone component (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactol; however, in combination with squalene, no synergistic effect was found. The results suggest that the responses of green lacewings to methyl salicylate are context-dependent, and the ecological role of the compound may be more complex than previously expected.

40229396	Incremental diagnostic value of coronary computed tomography angiography derived fractional flow reserve to detect ischemia.	Over the past decade, coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) has been the most robust non-invasive method for evaluating significant coronary stenosis. Thanks to new technologies, it is now possible to determine the fractional flow reserve (FFR) non-invasively using computed tomographic (CT) images. The aim of this work was to evaluate the incremental diagnostic value of CT-derived FFR for ischemia detection. In this retrospective monocentric study, we investigated 421 patients who underwent CCTA and subsequent ischemia testing between 04/2009 and 06/2020. Endpoint was ischemia on a coronary vessel level assessed by CMR (n = 20), SPECT (n = 225), invasive angiography (stenosis ≥ 90%; n = 80) or invasive FFR (positive if ≤ 0.8; n = 96). CT-FFR was derived from CCTA images by a machine learning (ML) based software prototype. Patients averaged 66.5 [58.2-73.6] years of age and 72.7% (n = 306) were male. Overall, 52.5% (n = 221) had hypertension and 67.9% (n = 286) had hypercholesteremia. Logistic regression analysis on a per vessel base showed that the diagnostic model with CT-FFR plus CCTA had significantly better-fit criteria than the diagnostic model with CCTA alone (log-likelihood χ<sup>2</sup> 230.21 vs. 192.17; p for difference < 0.001). In particular, the area under curve (AUC) by receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis for CT-FFR plus CCTA (0.87) demonstrated greater discrimination of hemodynamic ischemia compared to CCTA alone (0.83; p for difference < 0.0001). Combined CCTA and CT-FFR have improved diagnostic accuracy compared to CCTA alone in detecting ischemia on the coronary vessel level and thus could reduce the use of invasive coronary angiography in the future.
40229395	Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of blood flow restriction training on bone health in older adults.	While low-intensity blood flow restriction (LI-BFR) training has recently been shown to improve bone health, there remains limited evidence regarding its impact on older adults. This meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively identify the effects of LI-BFR training on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone biomarkers compared with conventional resistance training programs. Studies were identified through searches of four databases: PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. R packages were utilized for this meta-analysis. The results indicated that compared to low-intensity (LI) training, LI-BFR significantly increased BMD (ES = 0.25, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: [0.08, 0.41], p < 0.01), osteotropic hormones (i.e., GH, ES = 1.18, 95%CI: [0.66, 1.70]), p < 0.001; IGF-1, ES = 0.89, 95% CI: [0.44, 1.33], p < 0.001), but resulted in a smaller increase in bone resorption markers (i.e., CTX, ES = -0.77, 95%CI: [-1.16, -0.37], p < 0.001). LI-BFR training demonstrated similar effects on BMD improvement as high-intensity (HI) resistance training (ES = -0.1, 95%CI: [-0.66, 0.41], p = 0.64). Furthermore, sex and training frequency moderated the secretion of osteotropic hormones (male vs. female: IGF-1, 0.51 vs. 1.64, p < 0.01; ≤ 3 times per week vs. > 3 times per week: GH, 1.62 vs. 0.68, p < 0.01, and IGF-1, 1.13 vs. 0.39, p < 0.05). In conclusion, LI-BFR training shows promise for enhancing bone health in older adults, offering benefits comparable to HI training.

40229393	Rapid formulation of a genetically diverse phage cocktail targeting uropathogenic Escherichia coli infections using the UTI89 model.	Urinary tract infections are commonly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant UPEC, rendering antibiotic treatment ineffective, phage combination-based therapy has been proposed as a potential alternative. Here, we present a formulation of a genetically diverse phage-derived cocktail that is rapidly customized for UPEC using E. coli UTI89 as a model strain. Through our rapid selection and combination of four phages against UPEC strain UTI89 (SR01, SR02, SR04, and Zappy) from our library, the combination of two lytic phages, SR02 and SR04, exhibits the strongest suppression of bacterial growth for at least 16 h, with no emergence of phage resistance observed in vitro. Phage SR02 undergoes subcellular activity for 25 min, producing approximately 106 progeny particles per cell, while SR04 completes its replication cycle in 20 min, generating around 564 progeny particles per cell. These two novel phages are genetically diverse, and their cocktail exhibited potent suppression of bacterial growth, independent of multiplicities of infection (MOIs), significantly reducing the viable bacterial counts after treatment in vitro. The phage cocktail has low immunogenicity and does not induce any proinflammatory gene responses in human bladder uroepithelial cells. Moreover, the cocktail effectively eradicates the invading UPEC strain UTI89 in the uroepithelial cells at a comparable level to that of phage SR04 alone, likely releasing some immunostimulatory agents that, in turn, trigger upregulation of MIP-3 and IL-8 genes. Altogether, this study offers an alternative pipeline for rapidly formulating genetically diverse phage-derived cocktails, which is specifically customized for targeted bacteria.
40229392	Cascaded microwave networks numerical analysis methods based on the strong coupling mechanism.	This paper presents a novel coupling cascaded method (CCM) to address the computational accuracy degradation encountered in two-port strongly coupled cascaded microwave networks (SCCMN) when employing microwave network analysis algorithm, which arises from the electromagnetic coupling effects between microwave networks. Based on the CCM, a binary interpolation coupling cascaded method (BICCM) is innovatively proposed to enhance computational accuracy for the SCCMN composed of identical network elements. Furthermore, considering the imbalance between computational accuracy and simulation time overhead in the BICCM, a coupling degradation method is introduced to achieve a reasonable balance between these two factors. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CCM has significantly enhanced the correlation coefficient by an average of 13.47% for the S<sub>11</sub> scattering parameters and 7.49% for the S<sub>21</sub> scattering parameters compared to the traditional cascade theory (TCT). Moreover, for the S<sub>21</sub> scattering parameters, the proposed BICCM without coupling degradation has significantly enhanced the correlation coefficient by an average of 30.7% compared to the BICCM with the maximum coupling degradation. Therefore, the findings of this study provide new perspectives and methodologies for the development of microwave network analysis techniques, offering potential application value in the cascade design of microwave devices.
40229391	Unveiling the neural network involved in mentally projecting the self through episodic autobiographical memories.	Episodic autobiographical memory involves the ability to travel along the mental timeline, so that events of our own life can be recollected and re-experienced. In the present study, we tested the neural underpinnings of mental travel across past and future autobiographical events by using a spatiotemporal interference task. Participants were instructed to mentally travel across past and future personal (Episodic Autobiographical Memories; EAMs) and Public Events (PEs) during Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We found that a distributed network of brain regions (i.e., occipital, temporal, parietal, frontal, and subcortical regions) is implicated in mental projection across past and future independently from the memory category (EAMs or PEs). Interestingly, we observed that most of these regions exhibited a neural modulation as a function of the lifetime period and/or as a function of the compatibility with a back-to-front mental timeline, specifically for EAMs, indicating the key role of these regions in representing the temporal organization of personal but not public events. Present findings provide insights into how personal events are temporally organized within the human brain.

40229389	RBM10 suppresses colorectal cancer invasion by regulating LncRNA SNHG17 alternative splicing.	To explore the role of RBM10 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the regulatory mechanism of CRC invasion through alternative splicing (AS) of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG17 by RBM10. Samples were collected from sixty cases of CRC and their corresponding adjacent normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to analyze the expression of RBM10. A Transwell invasion assay was conducted to evaluate the effect of RBM10 on the invasion of HCT116 cells, and a Western blot was performed to detect the expression of EMT-related proteins. Moreover, CLIP-seq and RIP experiments were performed to explore the interaction between RBM10 and SNHG17. The expression of RBM10 was significantly decreased in CRC tissues and cells compared to the normal adjacent tissues. Overexpression of RBM10 inhibited CRC invasion, while knockdown of RBM10 had the opposite effect. RBM10 was found to interact with SNHG17 and regulate its splice isoform balance. Specifically, the splice variant SNHG17_2 regulated by RBM10 was upregulated in CRC and was positively correlated with CRC invasion. RBM10 inhibits CRC invasion by regulating the alternative splicing of SNHG17, providing new research directions and potential targets for CRC treatment.
40229388	Circulating citrate as a mediator in the relationship between HMGCR inhibitors and chronic hepatitis B: a Mendelian randomization study.	Observational studies have found that HMGCR inhibitors can be used to treat chronic viral hepatitis. In this study, to explore the potential mechanism of HMGCR inhibitors in treating Chronic hepatitis B (CHB), two-sample and two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) were used to investigate the causal relationship between HMGCR inhibitors and the mediating role of circulating metabolites. GWAS data of expression quantitative trait loci eQTLs of HMGCR inhibitors, 168 circulating metabolites, CHB, and myocardial infarction were obtained from the IEUOpenGWAS project. Random effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was the main causal analysis method, and the MR-Egger regression method was used as a supplementary analysis method. Cochran's Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic were used to determine the heterogeneity of SNPs. The intercept terms of the MR-Egger method and MR-PRESSO were used for pleiotropy analysis, and leave-one-out was used for sensitivity analysis. Mediation effect analysis was used to evaluate the mediating role of the circulating metabolites. Genetic variations in the drug target genes of HMGCR inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of chronic hepatitis B and myocardial infarction (P < 0.05). Eight circulating metabolites had a significant causal relationship with HMGCR inhibitors and CHB. After further calculation of the mediation effect, citrate was used as a mediating variable between HMGCR inhibitors and CHB, with a mediation effect of - 0.015 and a mediation ratio of 9.769%. HMGCR inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of CHB, and the circulating metabolite citrate may mediate this association. However, this study has certain limitations. The short-term effects of HMGCR inhibitors on CHB could not be assessed, and partial overlap between the GWAS data for HMGCR inhibitors and circulating metabolites may introduce bias in estimating causal effects.
40229387	Agreement between self-reported and measured weight, height, and derived BMI by educational attainment across racial and ethnic groups of US women.	Underreporting of weight and overreporting of height is consistently shown among women, thereby reducing accuracy of estimation of body mass index-and thus obesity-in epidemiologic studies that rely on self-reported data. Additionally, misreporting has been shown to differ by socioeconomic status and race and ethnicity, which can result in differential misclassification and bias that can obfuscate associations with obesity across groups in multiethnic and socioeconomically varying populations. Therefore, we sought to assess agreement between self-reported and objectively measured weight, height, and derived body mass index (BMI) across levels of educational attainment within racial and ethnic groups in a population-based cohort of US women.
40229384	Multifaceted roles of OCT4 in tumor microenvironment: biology and therapeutic implications.	OCT4 (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4, encoded by the POU5F1 gene) is a master transcription factor for maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of pluripotent stem cells, as well as a pioneer factor regulating epigenetics-driven cell reprogramming and cell fate conversion. It is also detected in a variety of cancer tissues and particularly in a small subpopulation of cancer cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Accumulating evidence has revealed that CSCs are a dynamic population, exhibiting shift between multipotency and differentiation states, or quiescence and proliferation states. Such cellular plasticity of CSCs is profoundly influenced by dynamic interplay between CSCs and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we review recent evidence showing that OCT4 expressed in CSCs plays a multifaceted role in shaping the TME by interacting with the cellular TME components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, tumor endothelial cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, as well as the non-cellular TME components, such as extracellular matrix (ECM), metabolites, soluble factors (e.g., growth factors, cytokines and chemokines), and intra-tumoral microbiota. Together, OCT4 regulates crucial processes encompassing ECM remodeling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, and immune responses. The complex and bidirectional interactions between OCT4-expressing CSCs and the TME create a supportive niche for tumor growth, invasion, and resistance to therapy. Better understanding OCT4's roles in such interactions can provide deeper insights into potential therapeutic strategies and targets for disrupting the supportive environment of tumors. The emerging therapies targeting OCT4 in CSCs might hold promise to resensitize therapeutic-resistant cancer cells, and to eradicate all cancer cells when combined with other therapies targeting the bulk of differentiated cancer cells as well as the TME.
40229383	Cytogenomic characterization of mosaic X-ring chromosomes in seventeen patients with Turner syndrome (TS)-42 years of experience at a single-site institution.	Individuals with Turner syndrome (TS) phenotypes may exhibit short stature, ovarian dysfunction, and neurocognitive disorders. Their genomes can include ring chromosomes formed from the X chromosome (RCX). Here, we present cytogenomic and clinical findings from seventeen individuals with TS who bore mosaic forms of RCX and frequently presented with short stature and concern for TS. The subjects were retrospectively included and tested at a single-site cytogenetics laboratory for over 42 years. Here, we illustrate each subject's comprehensive cytogenetic workup and phenotypes. The cohort shows comorbidities and sexual characteristics associated with mosaic RCX. These cytogenetic findings and clinical features are distinct from those of individuals with non-mosaic TS. Studying the pattern of X-activation across tissues in this cohort could provide additional data on a postulated source of phenotypic variability. Current guidelines recommend karyotype as the first-line test rather than SNP microarray analysis when aneuploidy is suspected. Conventional cytogenetics is still necessary to understand structural abnormalities, provide genomic context, and detect low-level mosaicism. These cases add to the knowledge of mosaic RCXs and offer new clinical laboratory information that is important for diagnosis and useful for comprehensively caring for and managing TS patients.
40229382	Escherichia coli type I toxin TisB exclusively controls proton depolarization following antibiotic induced DNA damage.	Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are genetic loci where the antitoxin gene product helps to control the expression or activity of the toxin gene product. Type I TA systems typically produce hydrophobic peptides that often localize to the inner membrane of bacteria. These amphipathic peptides can then potentially affect ion flows across the inner membrane. Here, we show that several type I toxins from Escherichia coli can affect depolarization, whereas tisB exclusively controls the depolarization of the proton gradient. tisB has been linked to persister cell formation following treatment with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and tisB-istR has been implicated in the control of proton depolarization following treatment with ofloxacin. These results suggest that tisB could initiate the formation of persister cells by fully dissipating the proton gradient and that most of the electrical gradient greatly limiting ATP production following antibiotic-induced DNA damage.
40229359	Optimum concentrations of potassium and zinc for better performance, nutritional, and biochemical quality of hydroponically cultivated Spinacia oleracea Cv. Virofly.	In order to evaluate micro and macronutrient balance in vegetable growth, a study on greenness, yield, nutritional value, as well as biochemical status in spinach, has been conducted in a greenhouse, utilising the different concentrations of zinc (Zn) and potassium (K) in the nutrient solution. So, three concentrations of Zn (0.22, 5, and 10 mg L<sup>- 1</sup>) and K (39, 78, and 117 mg L<sup>- 1</sup>) were applied to hydroponically grown spinach (Spinacia oleracea cv. Virofly) through a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete design with three replications. The results showed that along with increasing concentrations of Zn and K in a nutrient solution, chlorophyll index and plant performance were increased although Zn showed more influence than K. The maximum plant yield was observed at 117 mg L<sup>- 1</sup> of K in combination with both concentrations of Zn (5 and 10 mg L<sup>- 1</sup>). Along with an increase in Zn and K concentrations, the amount of nutrients including Na, Fe, Cu, Ca, Mn, and Mg decreased compared to the control level of Zn and K in nutrient solution except for Zn and K, which increased due to the Zn and K, respectively. Increased levels of Zn and K caused to decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) content by 51% and 34%, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was decreased also by 29% and 14% at 10 and 117 mg L<sup>- 1</sup> concentration of Zn and K while higher levels of Zn and K in the nutrient solution, increased protein content by 1.4 and 1.2 folded compared to the control plants. The maximum activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was recorded in spinach treated with 10 mg L<sup>- 1</sup> of Zn in combination independent to the K concentrations. The activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) was also affected by Zn as it showed up to 2.1 folded increment at 10 mg L<sup>- 1</sup> Zn compared to the 0.22 mg L<sup>- 1</sup> concentration. In general, an increase in Zn and K concentration in the nutrient solution decreased the absorption of measured nutrients except for Zn and K in spinach leaves. The effect of increased levels of Zn was more obvious than that of potassium in qualitative and biochemical traits of spinach specially at 5 mg L<sup>- 1</sup> concentration. These findings suggest that supplementing hydroponic nutrient solutions with 5 mg L<sup>- 1</sup> Zn in combination with 78 mg L<sup>- 1</sup> K can lead to the better quality and tolerance of the plant, offering a promising strategy to enhance crop productivity and nutritional value in hydroponically cultivated spinach.
40229358	Tracing genomic instability in induced mesenchymal stromal cell manufacture: an integration-free transfection approach.	Here we systematically investigated genomic alterations from the initiation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation to induced mesenchymal stromal/stem cell differentiation. We observed a total of ten copy number alterations (CNAs) and five single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) during the phases of reprogramming, differentiation and passaging. We identified a higher frequency of CNAs and SNVs in iPS cells generated using the Sendai virus (SV) method compared with those generated with episomal vectors (Epi). Specifically, all SV-iPS cell lines exhibited CNAs during the reprogramming phase, while only 40% of Epi-iPS cells showed such alterations. Additionally, SNVs were observed exclusively in SV-derived cells during passaging and differentiation, with no SNVs detected in Epi-derived lines. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of chromosomal instability-related genes in late-passage SV-iPSCs, further indicating increased genomic instability. Notably, TP53 mutations were identified, underscoring the vulnerability of the gene and the critical need for careful genomic scrutiny when preparing iPS cells and derived cell lines.
40229357	Optimizing nursing services for orthopaedic trauma patients using SERVQUAL and Kano models.	Nursing managers increasingly focus on improving the quality of patient-centred nursing services.The combination of SERVQUAL model and Kano model can be used for the study on the improvement of nursing quality. Through a literature review and expert discussion, an evaluation questionnaire and a Kano model questionnaire were developed to assess the nursing service quality for orthopaedic trauma inpatients. The SERVQUAL model was used to identify low-level nursing service elements, and the Kano model, factor selection line and sensitivity analysis were used to determine the rectification order. Three hundred people completed two rounds of the survey. The total score for nursing service quality was -0.55. The 26 items assessing nursing service quality included 21 low-level items. There were 10 items that needed improvement. The main reason for low nursing service quality is inadequate attention to patient safety and comfort requirements. Constructing a training system for orthopaedic nurses and optimising the nursing service process are the primary strategies for optimizing the nursing service quality for orthopaedic trauma inpatients. It lays a good foundation for improving patients' experience and health outcomes.
40229355	The 50% effective dose of remimazolam combined with different doses of esketamine for painless gastroscopy.	Remimazolam is a novel benzodiazepine sedative that provides effective sedation, stable haemodynamics, and minimal adverse effects during intravenous general anaesthesia. The aim of this study was to determine the 50% effective dose (ED50) of remimazolam combined with different doses of esketamine for painless gastroscopy and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination.
40229354	A simplified preparation method for single-nucleus RNA-sequencing using long-term frozen brain tumor tissues.	Single-cell RNA-sequencing has provided intriguing new insights into research areas such as developmental processes and tumor heterogeneity. Most approaches, however, rely on the availability of fresh surgical specimens, thereby dramatically reducing the ability to profile particularly rare tissue types. Here, we optimized a method to isolate intact nuclei from long-term frozen pediatric glioma tissues. We performed a technical comparison between different single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) systems and applied the established nucleus isolation method to analyze frozen primary glioma tissues. The results show that our fast, simple and low-cost nuclear isolation protocol provides intact nuclei, which can be used in both droplet- and plate-based single-cell sequencing platforms - allowing the identification of distinct tumor cell populations and infiltrating microglia. Additional optimization to include shorter RNA fragments in the 3' sequencing library improved gene detection and cell type annotation. Taken together, the method dramatically increases the potential of studying rare tumor entities and is specifically tailored for using frozen brain tumor tissue.
40229353	Non-epinephrine monotherapy matches combination therapy in high-risk PUB patients.	Currently, there is no clear indication in the guidelines whether non-epinephrine injection monotherapy requires the addition of epinephrine for hemostasis.The purpose of this study is to compare the hemostatic efficacy of non-epinephrine injection monotherapy with combination therapy including extra epinephrine injection for peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) patients . We retrospectively analyzed PUB patients who underwent endoscopic non-epinephrine injection as a monotherapy or combined non-epinephrine injection with epinephrine injection treatment in our center from March 2014 to January 2023 and the patients were divided into MT group or CT group. Subsequently, a propensity score matching analysis (PSM) was performed and rebleeding rates were calculated according to Forrest classifications via a stratified analysis. A total of 548 eligible patients were included in this study. After PSM, for PUB patients with nonbleeding visible vessels(FIIa), the recurrent bleeding rates by Days 3, 7, 14, and 30 after PSM were 17.6%, 26.5%, 27.9%, and 27.9% in the MT group, respectively, and rates were 1.4%, 5.6%, 6.9%, and 6.9% in the CT group, respectively, with significant differences observed between the 2 groups (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively).However, for PUB patients with spurting bleeding, oozing bleeding, and adherent clots, there were no significant differences between the two groups. For PUB patients with spurting bleeding(FIa) and oozing bleeding (FIb) ulcers, non-epinephrine injection monotherapy and epinephrine injection combined therapy have similar hemostatic efficacy. However, for PUB patients with visible blood vessel (FIIa) ulcers, combined therapy has higher hemostatic efficacy than non-epinephrine injection monotherapy.
40229352	Effects of Uro-Vaxom vs. placebo on the urinary tract microbiome in individuals with spinal cord injury in a randomized controlled pilot trial (Uro-Vaxom pilot).	Individuals with spinal cord injury/disease (SCI/D) have a high incidence of urinary tract infections (UTI). This randomized controlled pilot trial investigated the effect of an immunomodulator (Uro-Vaxom) versus a placebo on the urinary tract microbiome of individuals with SCI/D to inform the design of a larger trial. Twenty participants with SCI/D undergoing primary rehabilitation were randomized to receive either Uro-Vaxom or a placebo for three months (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04049994 08/08/2019). Urine was collected at baseline, immediately post-treatment, and three months post-treatment. DNA was extracted and sequenced using full-length 16 S rRNA using Oxford Nanopore technology. Internal controls were added for absolute abundance estimation. There were 10 participants in Uro-Vaxom and 10 in placebo analyzed. The prevalence of Escherichia coli was lower in the Uro-Vaxom group (2/10) compared to the placebo group (5/10) post-treatment, although this difference was not statistically significant. Significant alpha and beta diversity differences were associated with the microbial load, sex, and voiding method. Uro-Vaxom showed potential in reducing E. coli prevalence during the treatment period, but this result requires validation in a larger trial. Future trials should consider the baseline microbial load and optimal timing of intervention to ensure that the observed effects are attributable to immunomodulation.
40229351	Learning about color from language.	Certain colors are strongly associated with certain adjectives (e.g. red is hot, blue is cold). Some of these associations are grounded in visual experiences such as seeing glowing red embers. Surprisingly, despite having no visual experience, many congenitally blind people show very similar color associations which are likely learned through language. We show that these associations are indeed embedded in the statistical structure of language. We apply a projection method to word embeddings trained on corpora of spoken and written language to identify color-adjective associations as they are represented in English. These projections were predictive of color-adjective associations reported by blind and sighted English speakers. The most predictive projections were generated by embeddings derived from a corpus of fiction, which outperformed even the state-of-the-art large language model, GPT-4. By augmenting the training corpora in various ways we discover the types of sentences most responsible for conveying the color-adjective associations to the models. We find that word embedding models learn these associations from indirect (second-order) co-occurrences, and that when prompted, people are able to identify some of the words that are most informative for associating colors with specific adjectives. Learning through linguistic co-occurrences is one way word meanings can be continually aligned across language users despite large variations in perceptual experience.
40229350	Adult age differences in the integration of values for self and other.	Previous research suggests that older adults may display more prosocial behavior than younger adults. However, recent meta-analyses indicate that effects are heterogeneous, may be small, and are influenced by how prosociality is measured. Further, the precise cognitive and computational factors contributing to age-related differences in prosocial behavior remain largely unknown. In this study, we utilized a modified dictator game to combine a value-based decision framework with Bayesian hierarchical drift-diffusion modeling to investigate prosocial decision-making in a sample of younger (n = 63) and older adults (n = 48). We observed differences in how older and younger individuals incorporate information corresponding to potential gains for themselves (self) and another person (other) to reach a (potentially prosocial) decision. Younger adults integrated values for benefits for themselves and others in the decision-making process and demonstrated increased decision-making efficiency by effectively integrating both sources of information. In contrast, older adults showed improved decision-making efficiency when solely considering values for self and others separately. Interestingly, individual differences in the capacity of inhibitory control in older adults moderated the observed age effects: older adults with stronger inhibitory control abilities made decisions based on the integrated information of benefits for themselves and others. Together, these findings offer new insights into the behavioral and computational mechanisms influencing age effects in prosocial decision-making.
40229349	Butterfly magnetoreception based neighbour awareness strategy protocol for autonomous aerial vehicles.	Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) play a significant role in emergency response and disaster management, such as during forest fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis. However, navigating through high-density obstacle environments poses substantial challenges due to process overheads, dynamic environmental conditions, and scalability issues. A novel Neighbour Awareness Strategy (NAS) protocol is proposed to address these challenges, focusing on efficient obstacle avoidance while maintaining safety, adaptability, and reactiveness. NAS protocol integrates Butterfly Magnetoreception Mechanism (BMM) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. BMM enhances navigational safety by reducing congestion and minimising decision-making delays during real-time events. ML algorithms ensure optimal energy consumption and risk mitigation by dynamically selecting the shortest path, even under abrupt environmental changes. Key navigation parameters, including orientation angle (θ), heading angle (α), and velocity vector (V), are used to achieve precise and adaptive control. Simulation results demonstrate that NAS outperforms existing methods, such as Adaptive Path planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance (APA-DOA) and Real-time Environment Adaptive Trajectory Planning (REAT). It achieves superior obstacle avoidance, faster reaction times, and enhanced operational efficiency. Overall, the proposed NAS protocol enables AAVs to maintain optimal orientation during flight, adjust heading based on environmental inputs, coordinate swarm movements, and navigate complex three-dimensional spaces effectively.
40229348	Role of serum IL-35 levels in patients with benign and malignant primary ovarian tumors: a case-control study.	IL-35 is known to enhance tumor progression by promoting angiogenesis, increasing cancer cell proliferation, and facilitating immune suppression. Elevated levels of IL-35 have been correlated with the severity of malignancy and clinical stage in various cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum IL-35 levels and the presence and clinicopathological features of primary benign and malignant ovarian tumors. This case-control study consisted of 60 women diagnosed with primary benign and malignant ovarian tumors and 60 age-matched healthy controls. The demographic and clinicopathological data were also collected. The serum level of IL-35 was evaluated using an ELISA kit, and the results were analyzed using SPSS software. The patients had a mean age of 47.93 ± 14.52 which was similar to that of the controls (53.43 ± 11.69) (P = 0.519). The mean serum level of IL-35 was 7.01 ± 0.843 pg/ml in the control group and 7.24 ± 0.811 pg/ml in the patient group (P = 0.213). There was no significant difference in serum IL-35 levels between the tumor types (P = 0.991). There was also no significant association between serum IL-35 levels and disease stage (P = 0.559), grade (P = 0.635), lymph node involvement (P = 0.091), or tumor size (P = 0.564). No significant difference in serum IL-35 levels was observed between the patient and control groups, nor was there a significant association between IL-35 levels and tumor characteristics (stage, grade, size, lymph node involvement. However, further studies with more cases at different stages of the disease are necessary.
40229347	ALL diagnosis: can efficiency and transparency coexist? An explainble deep learning approach.	Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a life-threatening malignancy characterized by its aggressive progression and detrimental effects on the hematopoietic system. Early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to optimizing therapeutic interventions and improving clinical outcomes. This study introduces a novel diagnostic framework that synergizes the EfficientNet-B7 architecture with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies to address challenges in performance, computational efficiency, and explainability. The proposed model achieves improved diagnostic performance, with accuracies exceeding 96% on the Taleqani Hospital dataset and 95.50% on the C-NMC-19 and Multi-Cancer datasets. Rigorous evaluation across multiple metrics-including Area Under the Curve (AUC), mean Average Precision (mAP), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score-demonstrates the model's robustness and establishes its superiority over state-of-the-art architectures namely VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, DenseNet50 and AlexNet . Furthermore, the framework significantly reduces computational overhead, achieving up to 40% faster inference times, thereby enhancing its clinical applicability. To address the opacity inherent in Deep learning (DL) models, the framework integrates advanced XAI techniques, including Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Class Activation Mapping (CAM), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Integrated Gradients (IG), providing transparent and explainable insights into model predictions. This fusion of high diagnostic precision, computational efficiency, and explainability positions the proposed framework as a transformative tool for ALL diagnosis, bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and practical clinical deployment.
40229346	Cost-effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitors for second-line HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in China.	Hormone receptor HR-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer is the most common subtype in China, representing 60-70% of cases, with a rising incidence due to aging demographics and lifestyle changes. CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib have been proven effective in treating HR+/HER2 - advanced or metastatic breast cancer (ABC/MBC), though they may increase healthcare costs. This study aims to compare the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the second-line treatment of HR+/HER2 - ABC/MBC from the Chinese healthcare perspective. A cohort-based partitioned survival model was utilized, drawing on the survival data published from PALOMA-3, MONALEESA-3 and MONARCH-2 trials. Costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over a 15-year time horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model results. In the base-case analysis, the model estimated health benefits to be 2.10 QALYs for palbociclib plus fulvestrant (PAL + FUL), 2.55 QALYs for ribociclib plus fulvestrant (RIB + FUL), and 2.60 QALYs for abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (ABE + FUL), with corresponding costs of $34,423, $41,119, and $48,019. Compared with PAL + FUL, the ICERs were $27,161 per QALY for ABE + FUL and $15,073 per QALY for RIB + FUL. The robustness of these findings was confirmed through uncertainty analyses. Among the three strategies, the most cost-effective probabilities of PAL + FUL, RIB + FUL and ABE + FUL were 0%, 99.8%, and 0.2% under the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 3 times per-capita gross domestic product ($37,738) in China. This study indicated that both RIB + FUL and ABE + FUL are cost-effective at the WTP threshold compared with PAL + FUL. Notably, RIB + FUL offers the greatest cost-effective advantage for the second-line treatment of HR+/HER2 - ABC/MBC among these three CDK4/6 inhibitors.
40229345	Proof of principle demonstration of electro driven silver nanowire for stretchable circuit junctions.	The interlayer connection of circuits within stretchable electronic devices is crucial for enhancing their performance. Conventional methods for interlayer circuit connections are fragile and prone to mechanical deformation, prompting the need for new approaches. Although various methods have been proposed for creating interconnections in stretchable circuits, a universally efficient method for junctions remains to be fully developed. In this study, we propose a method to connect the interlayers of stretchable circuits using electro-driven silver nanowires. By comparing the conventional junction method with our proposed method, we verify the efficiency of the new approach. The results reveal that applying a high electric field during the solidification of the circuit interlayer aligns the isotropic state of the silver nanowires parallel to the field, thereby increasing the conductivity of the interlayer junction. Additionally, the study demonstrates that using silver nanowires for the junction provides better mechanical stability to the junction compared to that of the bulk material, as verified through mechanical stretch experiments. An in-depth analysis with mathematical modeling is presented at the end of the study. The proposed method is a promising approach for creating junctions in stretchable devices and is expected to pave the way for increasing their efficiency.
40229344	Effects of follicular and luteal cysts on reproductive organs, interstitial glands, and mast cell distribution in buffalo ovaries.	A significant factor contributing to reproductive failure in dairy cattle that raised the possibility of culling was ovarian cysts. Its etiology and pathogenesis remained a puzzle, but investigation of the associated tissue modulation, particularly those of the ovaries, oviduct, and uterus, might shed some light on its development. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess changes induced by follicular and luteal cyst formation in the ovary, oviduct, and uterus. In addition, the aims also involved the effect of these cyst formations on the interstitial glands and mast cell distribution in the ovaries of dairy cows. Genital organs of healthy, non-pregnant buffalo-cows (n = 45) were collected from the abattoir. According to the ovarian status, buffalo-cows were divided into three equal groups (15 for each): one normal healthy group was the control group (Ctrl group) and two diseased groups. The first diseased group was the group of buffalo-cows with follicular cysts (FC group), while the second one was the group with luteal cysts (LC group). Blood and tissue samples were collected to determine progesterone levels and do histological investigations of the reproductive organs. Hematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue-PAS, and Alcian blue-safranin-O stains were used for investigating ovarian tissues, interstitial glands (IGs), and mast cells (MCs), respectively. Results showed that significantly reduced thickness of the ovarian cortex and medulla, loss of ovarian folliculi, hemorrhage, and dilated blood vessels were observed in the FC and LC groups compared to the Ctrl group. In addition, the cystic ovaries significantly reduced interstitial gland count that was characterized by histopathological alterations that included atrophied and apoptotic cells and fragmentation, fading, and pyknotic nuclei. Likewise, in cystic ovaries, mast cell counts were found significantly reduced compared to the Ctrl group. The ovarian cysts significantly reduced the length and diameter of oviductal mucosal villi that were characterized by severe histopathological fluctuation in the ciliated cells and protruding and non-protruding secretory cells. For the uterus, the average thickness of the myometrium and endometrium in the ovarian cyst groups was significantly reduced compared to the Ctrl group. Furthermore, histopathological changes in the uterine glands, including severe apoptotic alterations, fading, pyknotic, and fragmented nuclei, were observed. In conclusion, the current study indicated that follicular and luteal cyst formations in the ovary induced various changes in the reproductive organs, interstitial glands, and mast cell distribution in the ovarian stroma, providing insights into the potential pathogenesis of cyst formation.
40229342	Exploring the particle size effect, land use classification, and magnetic characteristics of street dust in urbanized areas in Poland.	Street dust was collected from 149 locations ("all") and fractionated into five size-dependent categories: (1-0.8 mm) "0.8," (0.8-0.6 mm) "0.6," (0.6-0.4 mm) "0.4," (0.4-0.2 mm) "0.2," and (< 0.2 mm) " < 0.2." The main aims were to investigate the role of grain size in differentiating magnetic properties and identify land use factors affecting the magnetic and grain size distribution of street dust. The mass-specific magnetic susceptibility (χ) for "all" exhibited spatial variability, ranging from 30 to 545 × 10<sup>8</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/kg. The average χ for " < 0.2" was 68% higher in Area 1 and 195% higher in Areas 2&3 compared to the "all" samples. The 0.4-0.2 mm grain fraction was the most abundant and comprising 40% ± 7% of the samples in Area 1, 38% ± 9% in Area 2, and 39% ± 12% in Area 3. Area 1 "all" samples predominantly consisted of particles around 1 μm, while samples from Areas 2&3 featured grains ranging between 1 and 5 μm. This study is important as it provides new insights into how grain size and land use factors interact to affect the magnetic properties of street dust, which can be used as an effective indicator for monitoring urban pollution.
40229341	Ethnographic toolstone heat treatment reveals distinctive motives and patterns of material transformation.	The heat treatment of rocks to improve their fracture qualities for stone tool production is a key technological innovation of Pleistocene humans. Because the intentionality and technicality of this transformative process are often associated with cognitive prowess, the topic has attracted considerable archaeological research interest worldwide. Yet, with few ethnographic examples, assumptions about archaeological heat treatment are almost always based upon laboratory experiments. Here we report contemporary Konso craft specialists from southern Ethiopia, who represent the last known stone tool makers to regularly heat treat their toolstone. We found that, while material transformations commonly used as indicators of enhanced knappability (e.g., fracture toughness, elastic modulus, improved homogeneity, and newly formed lustre) are discernible in the studied heat-treated toolstones, other qualities of enhanced knappability (e.g., density and hardness) are also informative. Our results highlight the diversity and peculiarity of intentions and mechanisms through which toolstone workability is improved. The motives, techniques, and material transformations involved in Konso toolstone heat treatment afford important insights into various aspects of archaeological heat treatment that are unavailable with experiments alone.
40229340	Terminal ballistic effects for 3D-printed multi-layered material consisting of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, metal matrix composite and porous titanium.	The influence of the composition and structure of a multilayer titanium-based material on its behaviour under impact testing conditions was studied. The material consisted of four consecutive layers of: (i) metal matrix composite (MMC) based on Ti64 alloy (wt. 6.1% Al-4% V) reinforced with 40 vol % dispersed TiC particles, (ii) Ti64 alloy, (iii) porous commercial purity titanium (about 60% pores), and (iv) the bottom layer of Ti64 alloy. MMC and Ti64 alloy layers were deposited on a layer of porous Ti using a coaxial electron beam 3D printing method with a commercial Ti64 wire, and a specially designed cored wire as the feedstock. The overall density of the layered material was less than 3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. An impact test conducted with a 7.62 mm calibre armour-piercing cartridge (with a bullet kinetic energy of 3430 J) demonstrated high ballistic resistance when a hard bullet core penetrated the sample to a depth of approximately 20 mm, where it was stopped within the porous titanium layer and subsequently ejected from the sample. The features of the microstructure of this four-layer material in different locations and their role in ballistic resistance are considered and discussed.
40229339	Validation of reading as a predictor of mild cognitive impairment.	Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a neurocognitive disorder that precedes Alzheimer's disease, but also other types of dementia. The use of reading tasks, when paired with eye-tracking technology, has been suggested as an effective biomarker for identifying MCI and distinguishing it from healthy individuals. The objective of this study was twofold: (1) to explore the disparities in eye movements during reading between individuals with MCI and healthy controls and train a predictive model to detect MCI, and (2) to validate these findings on a large independent dataset. We developed features for a model designed to automatically detect cognitive impairment based on the data of 115 subjects; 62 cognitively impaired and 53 healthy controls. Each subject was subjected to a neurological evaluation, a thorough psychological analysis, and completed a brief reading exercise while their eye movements were monitored using an eye-tracker. Their eye movements were characterised by patterns of saccades and fixations and were analysed across both groups. Several characteristics showed very high statistical significance, indicating differences in gaze behaviour between the groups. These characteristics were then employed to develop a machine learning model that differentiates cognitively impaired individuals from healthy controls. For the validation purposes, we ran a separate study with 99 new subjects using the same experimental design. The model reached about 75% AUROC. These results confirm that reading tasks can serve as a basis for early detection of MCI; however, complementary eye-tracking tasks are needed to further increase the detection accuracy.
40229338	Multigenerational attitudes to gender norms on intimate partner violence and the sexual and reproductive health of young people in Nigeria.	This study undertook an assessment of multigenerational attitudes towards gender norms related to intimate partner violence (IPV), sexuality, and reproductive health behaviours. A cross-sectional household survey was conducted among 1630 young people and adults, in six communities in Ebonyi state, southeast Nigeria. In data analysis, mean attitude scores were computed and compared across generation cohorts using analysis of variance. Attitudes toward each domain of intimate partner relationships served as the dependent variables in three separate linear regression analyses, where the predictors were identified accordingly. The results showed that the differences in mean scores on attitudes towards gender norms about IPV and sexuality in intimate partner relationship were not statistically significant across the generation cohorts (p > 0.05). However, there were significant differences in the attitudes of generation cohorts towards gender norms relating to sexuality and reproductive health behaviour. The sociodemographic predictors of attitudes to gender norms on IPV were male gender (β = 0.106, p = < 0.001) and urban residence (β = 0.075), p = < 0.001), while tertiary education predicted attitudes to gender norms on sexuality (β= - 0.156, p = 0.012) and reproductive health behaviour (β= - 0.216, p = < 0.001). The findings highlighted generational similarities and differences in attitudes towards gender norms in intimate partner relationships. Generational differences were shaped by factors such as age, gender, and education level. Conducting longitudinal studies could reveal how these attitudes evolve and societal changes' impact.
40229337	Global spatiotemporal analysis of suicide epidemiology and risk factor associations from 2000 to 2019 using Bayesian space time hierarchical modeling.	Suicide is a significant global public health issue, with marked disparities in rates between countries. Much of the existing research has concentrated on high-income nations, creating a gap in the understanding of global suicide epidemiology. This study aims to address this gap through a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of global suicide trends from 2000 to 2019. Data were collected from the Global Health Observatory, encompassing 183 countries across five regions. Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling and cluster detection techniques were employed to assess variations in suicide rates and identify high-risk clusters, alongside examining associations with various risk factors. The findings indicate diverse global and regional age-standardized suicide trends, with overall rates decreasing from an average of 12.97 deaths per 100,000 population in 2000 to 9.93 deaths per 100,000 in 2019. Significant regional variations were noted, particularly in Europe, Asia, and Africa, where high-risk clusters were identified. Additionally, age and sex-specific trends revealed consistently higher rates among males, although these rates have been declining over time. Spatial maps illustrated hotspots of elevated suicide rates, which can inform targeted intervention strategies. Risk factor analysis further revealed associations with socioeconomic and health indicators. The results underscore the necessity for tailored prevention strategies and highlight the importance of international collaboration and surveillance systems in addressing the complexities of global suicide epidemiology. This study contributes valuable insights into suicide patterns and offers implications for mental health policies worldwide.
40229336	Digital twin system for manufacturing processes based on a multi-layer knowledge graph model.	Digital twin technology in the manufacturing process faces challenges like integrating diverse data sources and managing real-time data flow. To address this, we propose a novel three-layer knowledge graph architecture to enhance digital twin modeling for manufacturing processes. This architecture consists of a concept layer that structures key information into a knowledge network, a model layer that aligns digital and physical parameters, and a decision layer that leverages model and real-time data for decision support. Validated in aero-engine blade production, this system integrates multi-source data, enhances predictive analysis and anomaly detection, and supports process control and quality management. Over a 5-month validation period, the maximum contour error precision of the blades improved from 0.073 mm to 0.062 mm, and the product qualification rate increased from 81.3% to 85.2%. This demonstrates the system's robust capability for advancing digital twin utilization in manufacturing, highlighting its potential for future improvements.

40229334	Differential effects of rice irrigation modes on hydrothermal environment and yield from the perspective of TOPSIS model.	In order to clarify the effects of different water-saving irrigation modes on hydrothermal changes in paddy fields in the black soil zone, field experiments were set up in paddy fields in the standard black soil zone in 2023 and 2024 to investigate the changing patterns of water changes, paddy field temperature changes, rice plant height, number of tillers, SPAD, and yield under the shallow-wet irrigation mode (QS), the shallow-wet-dry irrigation mode (QSG), and the deep-wet-dry irrigation mode (SSG). The results showed that (1) controlling the lower irrigation limit and increasing the upper irrigation limit improved rainfall utilisation, and the QSG mode irrigation volume was reduced by 10.27% to 44.52% compared with the QS mode irrigation volume and SSG mode irrigation volume. Increasing the upper limit of irrigation and controlling the lower limit of irrigation helped to increase the canopy temperature, water layer temperature and soil layer temperature of rice. (2) In terms of rice growth, lowering the upper irrigation limit and controlling the lower irrigation limit inhibited the growth of rice plant height. Controlling the lower limit of irrigation would increase the effective number of rice tillers and improve the stem tiller spike formation rate, but it would reduce the SPAD and dry matter accumulations. Yield in QSG mode was significantly higher than that in QS and SSG modes, by 4.12% to 4.65% and 18.42% to 14.69%, respectively. (3) Evaluating the integrated hydrothermal changes and rice growth conditions according to the TOPSIS model, the QSG model was superior to the SSG model, and finally the QS model.
40229333	Twelve month refractive and axial length changes in the Israeli refractive error, activity, and devices (iREAD) study.	The Israel Refraction, Environment, and Devices (iREAD) is a longitudinal study assessing myopia risk factors in three groups of boys with distinct lifestyles. Ultra-Orthodox (N = 41), Religious (N = 53), and Secular (N = 41) boys (ages 8.6 ± 1.5 years) had eye exams at baseline and 12 months, including cycloplegic autorefraction and axial length. Ocular history, education, near work, and electronic device use were assessed. Time outdoors and physical activity were measured objectively. At 12 months, myopia prevalence increased from 32 to 40% (P = 0.02), with no group differences (P > 0.05). The Ultra-Orthodox group had a more myopic spherical equivalent refraction (SER) at baseline and 12 months than the Religious and Secular groups and more myopic shift at 12 months (P < 0.05 for all). The Ultra-Orthodox group spent less time using electronic devices, more time in school, read at an earlier age, and had higher parental myopia (P < 0.01 for all). Time outdoors and activity did not differ between groups (P > 0.05 for both). In univariate and multivariate analyses, group and parental myopia were associated with greater myopic shift of SER and axial elongation (P < 0.05). In conclusion, risk factors associated with greater myopia progression included being part of the Ultra-Orthodox educational system and number of myopic parents and not screen use.
40229332	ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression is reduced acutely in SARS-CoV-2 patients but returns to normal with recovery.	During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the major entry receptor for the virus and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as an important SARS-CoV-2 entry factor. Previous studies investigating the impact of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in adults have yielded inconsistent results, thereby underscoring the need for further research in this domain. We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from infected adults during the acute and late convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the expression of both genes with non-infected household member contacts. We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression is temporarily reduced during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection presumably due to viral disruption of transcription. Post-recovery, however, the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was comparable to non-infected household contacts. The lack of significant differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression between SARS-CoV-2-positive adults and uninfected household controls suggests that factors influencing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults may extend beyond ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the study's limited sample size and the heterogeneity of COVID-19 cases. Other non-physiological factors, such as enhanced hygiene practices following the infection of a household member, may also contribute to absence of infection among healthy controls.
40229331	Identification of novel inhibitors targeting Mycobacterium abscessus InhA through virtual screening, docking, and molecular dynamic simulations.	Effective treatment options for Mycobacterium abscessus (MAB) pulmonary diseases (PD) are limited due to inadequate drug efficacy, rising drug resistance, and genetic mutations. New compounds are urgently needed to treat MAB-PD. The MAB Enoyl Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) Reductase InhA (MAB-InhA) plays a crucial role in mycobacterial cell death and mycolic acid (MA) biosynthesis, making it a potential drug target for new lead identification. The purpose of this study was to identify new potential inhibitors of MAB-InhA in MAB-PD by using structure-based virtual screening, docking, molecular mechanics-based generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA), Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The Enamine antibacterial library containing 32,000 compounds was prepared using phase to create the database. The identified hits were analysed using the phase score, which combines vector alignments, volume score, and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) site matching. Based on the docking results and obtained scores of the Glide docking tool, we identified Z2378320480 (Z1), Z1188959831 (Z2), Z5292493137 (Z3), Z2437620504 (Z4), Z2440336150 (Z5), and Z3390516726 (Z6) ligand molecules as potential hits. MD simulations (200 ns) were conducted on the best-docked poses of potential hits Z4, Z5, and Z6 to analyse stability and interaction at the MAB-InhA active site. The MD simulation trajectories, including RMSD, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), ligand-protein interaction, 2D principal component analysis (PCA), and molecular dynamics secondary structure analysis (SSE), were analysed to interpret the stability.
40229330	The impact of inflammatory bowel disease on dementia risk: a current systematic review and meta-analysis.	Emerging evidence indicates that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and dementia may share underlying pathological mechanisms and risk factors. However, the association between a prior IBD diagnosis and the subsequent risk of dementia remains largely unexplored. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to February 4, 2025, without language restrictions. Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated methodological quality and risk of bias. Observational studies comparing dementia risk in IBD and non-IBD populations were included. Pooled effect estimates for odds ratios (OR) were calculated using random-effects models. A total of 10 population-based studies, involving 7,895,339 participants (269,387 with IBD), were included. Meta-analysis of eight studies showed a significant association between IBD and dementia risk (OR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.08-1.27, P = 0.0001). However, IBD was not associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.98-1.36, P = 0.09). Stratified analysis by IBD type revealed a positive association between both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and dementia risk (UC: OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.25, P = 0.002, I² = 81%; CD: OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11-1.43, P = 0.0003, I² = 53%). This study identifies a significant correlation between IBD and dementia, suggesting that IBD patients have an elevated risk of developing dementia. However, current evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship. Further research should explore whether effective IBD treatments can mitigate this risk and elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms connecting these conditions.
40229329	X- ray absorption spectroscopy analysis of aerosol particles during summer and winter in Krakow, Poland.	Airborne fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) pollution decreased during last decade in Krakow, Poland. X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) technique at ASTRA beamline of SOLARIS Synchrotron (Krakow, Poland) has been used to study of 8 aerosol samples (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) collected in Krakow during summer and winter 2018/2019 and 2020/2021 at K absorption edges of sulphur, chlorine, potassium, iron and zinc. Samples of PM<sub>2.5</sub> collected in summer contain sulphur mostly as sulphates. On the other hand, samples collected in winter additionally contain bisulphates, sulphides and organic sulphur. KHSO<sub>4</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are the primary contributors to potassium pollution in winter. Iron phases of Fe<sup>+ 3</sup> and Fe<sup>+ 2</sup> oxidation states (FeSO<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and FeOOH) are present in the samples of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Main zinc containing phases present in PM<sub>2.5</sub> samples are ZnSO<sub>4,</sub> ZnS and ZnO. Such advanced unique technique as XANES applied for PM<sub>2.5</sub> research can be useful for preparing a program reducing the air pollution level of the city. The study also has a broad aspect, it helps to clarify the kind of chemical compounds present in particulate matter.
40229328	Cord blood IgA/M reveals in utero response to SARS-CoV-2 with fluctuations in relation to circulating variants.	It is estimated that in utero SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare. However, few studies have systematically assessed for IgA and IgM antibodies indicating potential in utero response to SARS-CoV-2 infection using multi-isotype serology, and no studies have assessed in utero infection markers in relation to circulating variants. Between October 21, 2021 and February 15, 2023, remnant cord blood samples (CBS) from neonates born at a single hospital in Los Angeles, were systematically tested for serological markers suggesting in utero infection. SARS-CoV-2 specific fetal IgA and/or IgM antibodies were detected in 28.7% (298/1038 CBS, 95% CI: 26.0, 31.6), higher than previous in utero infection estimates that used only PCR and/or IgM. Importantly, the probability of detecting markers of in utero infection varied by month (P-value = 0.0144). The prevalence of fetal IgA/IgM varied with the emergence of new variants, increasing during the BA.1 wave with a peak in February 2022 at 36% (18/50, 95% CI: 22.7-49.3) and again during the BA.4/5 wave, with a peak at 48.8% in September 2022 (39/80, 95% CI 37.8-59.7), suggesting variant-related fluctuations. These data suggest it may be useful to identify SARS-Cov-2 in utero exposure at birth so these newborns may be more closely followed for adverse clinical outcomes.
40229327	Multi-omics analysis identifies diagnostic circulating biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets, revealing IQGAP1 as an oncogene in gastric cancer.	This study employed a multi-omics integration approach to identify circulating biomarkers for gastric cancer (GC). We analyzed plasma and tumor tissue single-cell RNA sequencing data, along with gene and protein quantitative trait loci analyses. Leveraging data from UK Biobank and FinnGen, we investigated genetic associations with GC. Through colocalization, Mendelian Randomization, and various filtering analyses, we identified four genes (IQGAP1, KRTCAP2, PARP1, MLF2) and four proteins (EGFL9 [DLK2], ECM1, PDIA5, TIMP4) as potential GC biomarkers. These were selected based on significant genetic colocation probabilities and significant associations with GC. Seven of these biomarkers demonstrated predictive capability for GC occurrence, with AUC ranging from 0.61 to 0.99. Drug prediction analysis identified seven protein biomarkers as potential targets for immunotherapy, targeted therapies, and tumor chemotherapy. Further scRNA-seq analysis revealed significant expression differences between gastric tumor and normal tissues, particularly the upregulation of IQGAP1, which highlights its role in tumor growth.

40229325	Application of an improved LSTM model based on FECA and CEEMDAN VMD decomposition in water quality prediction.	To address the limitations of existing water quality prediction models in handling non-stationary data and capturing multi-scale features, this study proposes a hybrid model integrating Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), and Frequency-Enhanced Channel Attention (FECA). The model aims to improve prediction accuracy and robustness for complex water quality dynamics, which is critical for environmental protection and sustainable water resource management. First, CEEMDAN and Sample Entropy (SE) were used to decompose raw water quality data into interpretable components and filter noise. Then, a VMD-enhanced LSTM architecture embedded with FECA was developed to adaptively prioritize frequency-specific features, thereby improving the model's ability to handle nonlinear patterns. Results show that the model is successful in predicting all six water quality indicators: NH₃-N (ammonia nitrogen), DO (dissolved oxygen), pH, TN (total nitrogen), TP (total phosphorus), and CODMn (chemical oxygen demand, permanganate method). The model achieved Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values ranging from 0.88 to 0.99. Using dissolved oxygen (DO) as an example, the model reduced the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 0.12% and increased the coefficient of determination (R2) by 0.20% compared to baseline methods. This work provides a robust framework for real-time water quality monitoring and supports decision making in pollution control and ecosystem management.
40229324	The linkage between chronotype, social jetlag, and responses to sleep inertia.	This research explores the interplay between chronotype, sleep inertia (SI), and social jetlag (SJL), examining whether an interaction between chronotype and SJL increases susceptibility to SI in individuals with an evening chronotype, due to their more pronounced SJL. However, a minimal correlation between SJL and SI was observed. The study included 231 participants, all of whom completed a series of questionnaires, including the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ), and the Sleep Inertia Questionnaire (SIQ). Our findings indicated that individuals showing greater eveningness exhibited higher levels of SJL. While there was no significant correlation between SJL and SI, and SJL did not mediate the relationship between eveningness and SI, controlling for sex revealed that SJL partially mediated the relationship between chronotype and the Responses to Sleep Inertia, one subscale of SIQ. This suggests that individuals with an evening chronotype are more likely to exhibit behavioral responses indicative of sleep inertia. The findings underscore the complexity of the relationships between chronotype, SJL, and SI, suggesting that SJL does not act as a mediator between chronotype and SI, except for the small mediation effect on behavioral responses. This research provides a foundation for future investigations into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying SI and how other lifestyle factors influence SI.
40229323	Platelet-rich plasma relieves inflammation and pain by regulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization in knee osteoarthritis rats.	Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common, chronic, degenerative disease. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can significantly relieve KOA pain; however, the mechanism of PRP-induced analgesia remains to be studied. Macrophages are closely related to KOA pain, and regulating macrophage polarization may be an effective way to relieve KOA pain. Therefore, the aim of this study is: First, to explore whether PRP can effectively relieve pain in a KOA animal model and whether it relieves pain by regulating macrophage polarization. Second, to explore the mechanism by which PRP regulates macrophage polarization. Thirty-six healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into sham group, MIA group and PRP group. The KOA rat model was established by injecting 1 mg of MIA into the joint cavity. Behavioral tests, including weight-bearing asymmetry, hot plate, and von Frey hairs tests, were performed. The positive expression rates of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and CD163 in the synovium were detected via immunohistochemical staining. Meanwhile, RAW 264.7 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide were treated with PRP in vitro. The production levels of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway-related proteins NF-κB p65, inhibitor-κ binding protein α (IκBα), p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα and the iNOS and CD163 proteins were measured via western blotting. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and nerve growth factor (NGF). The behavioral results revealed that PRP relieved pain. PRP reduced the proportion of M1/M2 macrophages among synovial macrophages, significantly inhibited the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in the synovium, and increased the secretion of IL-10. In addition, in vivo experiments revealed that PRP decreased the protein expression of iNOS, p-IκBα/IκBα, and p-p65/p65 and increased the protein expression of CD163. Furthermore, PRP decreased TNF-α, IL-1β, and NGF levels in RAW 264.7 cells and increased the secretion of IL-10. Our findings indicate that PRP can improve long-term relief from KOA pain. The analgesic mechanism promotes the transformation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, which reduces the release of downstream pain-causing factors, thus relieving inflammation and pain.
40229322	A systems biology approach to define SARS-CoV-2 correlates of protection.	Correlates of protection (CoPs) for SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be sufficiently defined. This study uses the machine learning platform, SIMON, to accurately predict the immunological parameters that reduced clinical pathology or viral load following SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a cohort of 90 non-human primates. We found that anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody and neutralising antibody titres were the best predictors of clinical protection and low viral load in the lung. Since antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike showed the greatest association with clinical protection and reduced viral load, we next used SIMON to investigate the immunological features that predict high antibody titres. It was found that a pre-immunisation response to seasonal beta-HCoVs and a high frequency of peripheral intermediate and non-classical monocytes predicted low SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titres. In contrast, an elevated T cell response as measured by IFNγ ELISpot predicted high IgG titres. Additional predictors of clinical protection and low SARS-CoV-2 burden included a high abundance of peripheral T cells. In contrast, increased numbers of intermediate monocytes predicted clinical pathology and high viral burden in the throat. We also conclude that an immunisation strategy that minimises pathology post-challenge did not necessarily mediate viral control. This would be an important finding to take forward into the development of future vaccines aimed at limiting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These results contribute to SARS-CoV-2 CoP definition and shed light on the factors influencing the success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
40229321	A partitioned conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method considering spatial heterogeneity in digital soil mapping.	The design of sampling methods is crucial in digital soil mapping for soil organic carbon (SOC), as it directly affects prediction precision and reliability. While sampling methods based on environmental variables are widely used, the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties poses challenges by introducing variability in influential driving factors across subregions, potentially reducing prediction accuracy. To address this, a partitioned conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (PcLHS) method explicitly considering spatial heterogeneity is proposed. PcLHS first employs the regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning (REDCAP) method to partition the study area into relatively homogeneous subregions. Key environmental variables are then identified using the Boruta and the Variance Inflation Factor method, followed by conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to select training points within each subregion. Finally, the selected training points are combined to form the complete training dataset. A case study on SOC sampling in northeastern France demonstrated that PcLHS consistently outperformed traditional sampling methods, achieving lower root mean square error (RMSE, 0.40-0.43), higher coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>, 0.36-0.44), and improved concordance correlation coefficient (CCC, 0.58-0.63). Compared to other methods, PcLHS reduced RMSE by 4-11%, increased R<sup>2</sup> by 18-46%, and improved CCC by 14-29%. These results highlight the necessity of considering spatial heterogeneity in soil sampling design and establish PcLHS as an effective method for SOC prediction in heterogeneous landscapes.
40229320	Revealing the structure-activity relationship of Pt<sub>1</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub> with <sup>17</sup>O solid-state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.	Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted significant interest due to their exceptional and tunable performance, enabled by diverse coordination environments achieved through innovative synthetic strategies. However, various local structures of active sites pose significant challenges for precise characterization, a prerequisite for developing structure-activity relationships. Here, we combine <sup>17</sup>O solid-state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations to elucidate the detailed structural information of Pt/CeO<sub>2</sub> SACs and their catalytic behaviors. The NMR data reveal that single Pt atoms, dispersed from clusters with water vapor, exhibit a square planar geometry embedded in CeO<sub>2</sub> (111) surface, distinct from the original clusters and other conventionally generated Pt single atoms. The square planar Pt/CeO<sub>2</sub> SAC demonstrates improved CO oxidation performance compared to Pt/CeO<sub>2</sub> SAC with octahedral coordination, due to moderately strong CO adsorption and low energy barriers. This approach can be extended to other oxide-supported SACs, enabling spatially resolved characterization and offering comprehensive insights into their structure-activity relationships.
40229319	Chiral symmetry breaking and information accumulation in pre-biological protocell evolution.	We study a linear evolutionary model based on the two-dimensional distribution of protocells by total enantiomeric excess and the amount of stored information, which they can pass from generation to generation, and without any mutual inhibition. We show that the evolution of such systems occurs in four distinct stages. The first stage is an exponential growth of the concentration of protocells near the point [Formula: see text] and it should take negligible time on a geological scale. The second stage is a diffusion-like process in both dimensions. This process can also be accompanied by a drift in the direction of increased information passed from generation to generation, provided that the appropriate linear coefficient in the information storage subspace is large enough. The third stage is a rapid symmetry breaking and formation of the species near [Formula: see text] value of enantiomeric excess (assuming a small positive global enantiomeric asymmetry factor). The fourth stage is a relaxation toward a global stationary point, which is a narrow peak located near [Formula: see text] value of enantiomeric excess and some optimal value of the amount of stored information.
40229318	Structural analysis shows the mode of inhibition for Staphylococcus aureus lipase by antipsychotic penfluridol.	It is now well-established that Staphylococcus aureus can produce a range of toxin proteins, resulting in a spectrum of pathological conditions when it infects individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or immunocompromised. Among these, MRSA is one of the most prominent antimicrobial-resistant organisms and a significant cause of mortality in many patients. It has been demonstrated that Staphylococcus aureus lipase (SAL) is a vital factor in the proliferation of this bacterium. A combination of in silico screening and X-ray crystallography was employed to analyze inhibitors of SAL, and the results were highly significant. In silico screening identified a number of compounds, and the enzyme activity assay demonstrated that the antipsychotic drug penfluridol exhibited potent inhibitory activity against SAL. We have conducted co-crystallization of penfluridol and SAL on the ground and in space. The resulting co-crystals were subjected to data measurement using the synchrotron radiation facility at SPring-8, and the complex structure was determined. The crystal structure of the penfluridol-SAL complex was determined at 2.2 Å resolution, thereby providing the structural basis for developing new anti-infective agents that inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. These findings are anticipated to facilitate the development of compounds with potent inhibitory activity.
40229317	Establishing a comprehensive host-parasite stable isotope database to unravel trophic relationships.	Over the past decades, stable isotopes have been infrequently used to characterise host-parasite trophic relationships. This is because we have not yet identified consistent patterns in stable isotope values between parasites and their host tissues across species, which are crucial for understanding host-parasite dynamics. To address this, we initiated a worldwide collaboration to establish a unique database of stable isotope values of novel host-parasite pairs, effectively doubling the existing data in published literature. This database includes nitrogen, carbon, and sulphur stable isotope values. We present 3213 stable isotope data entries, representing 586 previously unpublished host-parasite pairs. Additionally, while existing literature was particularly limited in sulphur isotope values, we tripled information on this crucial element. By publishing unreported host-parasite pairs from previously unsampled areas of the world and using appropriate host tissues, our dataset stands unparalleled. We anticipate that end-users will utilise our database to uncover generalisable patterns, deepening our understanding of the complexities of parasite-host relationships and driving future research efforts in stable isotope parasitology.
40229316	Applied research on innovation and development of blue calico of Chinese intangible cultural heritage based on artificial intelligence.	In light of the challenges currently facing the inheritance of blue calico, including the reduction in the number of inheritors and the contraction of the market, this paper puts forth a stylistic transfer method based on an enhanced cycle consistency generative adversarial network. This approach is designed to facilitate the creation of novel designs for traditional blue calico patterns. To address the shortcomings of existing style transfer models, including the generation of blurry details, poor texture and color effects, and excessive model parameters, we propose the incorporation of the Ghost convolution module and the SRM attention module into the generator network structure. This approach aims to reduce the model parameter quantity and computational cost while enhancing the feature extraction ability of the network. The experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper not only effectively enhances the content details, texture, and color effects of the generated images, but also successfully combines traditional blue calico with modern daily necessities, thereby enhancing its appeal to young people. This research provides novel insights into the digital protection and innovative development of traditional culture, and illustrates the extensive potential applications of deep learning technology in the field of cultural heritage.
40229315	Experimental validation of the precision of sinusoidal amplitude estimation using a least squares procedure in the presence of additive noise.	This study focuses on fitting sinusoidal mathematical models to a set of measured data points by minimizing the least squares difference between data points and the model. We investigated the impact of various parameters such as the amplitude, number of data points, and the standard deviation of the additive noise on the sinusoidal amplitude estimation in the specific case where the data points cover an integer number of periods of the sinusoid. The mathematical results are validated by carrying out actual voltage measurements using an analog-to-digital converter. A sinusoidal model with a known frequency, but unknown amplitude, initial phase, and offset is fitted to the acquired samples. The estimated amplitude is consequently a random variable, with its standard deviation influenced by the additive noise standard deviation. The mathematical relation that governs this dependence is presented here and validated experimentally. The resulting analytical expression allows for the computation of confidence intervals for the sinewave amplitude measurements made in the presence of additive noise. Additionally, it provides engineers with a method to determine the number of samples that should be acquired in order to achieve a desired level of precision in the sinusoidal amplitude estimation, or for other quantities derived from the model.
40229314	Effects of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome serum on AA pathway in podocytes cultured in 3D in vitro glomerular model.	Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is the most severe form of nephrotic syndrome, with genetic or unidentified immunological origins and rapidly progressing to the need for kidney replacement therapy. Lipotoxicity can affect podocytes inducing kidney damage. In this study, we evaluate the effects of SRNS serum on podocyte functionality and lipid metabolism. A three-dimensional (3D) dynamic in vitro glomerulus was incubated with serum from multi-drug resistant (MDR) and genetic SRNS or healthy controls. The glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) integrity, podocyte viability, and fatty acids (FAs) composition were evaluated by serum albumin permeability estimation, cytofluorimetric analysis and gas chromatography, respectively. Expression of slit diaphragm molecules and FA-related enzymes was analyzed by immunofluorescence and PCR. Serum from SRNS patients induced cell granularity, increased GFB permeability, and disrupted slit diaphragm protein structure. The podocyte damage was most severe when MDR serum was administered compared to the serum of genetic-SRNS. This was associated with a significant upregulation of the transcripts coding for nephrin, synaptopodin, and CD2AP. An alteration of fatty acid profile in MDR-treated podocytes was observed, with increased monounsaturated FAs following the decrease of saturated FAs. The exposure of cultured podocytes to MDR- and genetic-SRNS serum induced disruption of arachidonic acid (AA) synthesis pathway, with different intermediate players involved. This study highlights the detrimental effects of serum from SRNS patients on podocyte function and the association of AA synthesis pathway with the podocyte damage.
40229312	Left ventricular hypertrophy among adults in a population-based cohort in Haiti.	Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is one of the strongest predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality; yet the means to diagnose LVH in resource-constrained settings remain limited. The objectives of this study were to determine LVH prevalence by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in a high-risk group, and compare TTE vs. electrocardiography (ECG-LVH) for LVH detection. We analyzed enrollment data from the Haiti cardiovascular disease cohort study on adults (≥ 18 years, n = 3,005) in Port-au-Prince between 2019 and 2021. All participants underwent questionnaires, vital signs, physical exams, and 12-lead ECGs. TTEs were acquired on those with hypertension or exhibiting CVD symptoms (n = 1040, 34.7%). TTE-LVH was defined according to the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines and ECG-LVH by Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell, and Limb-Lead Voltage criteria. The prevalence of TTE-LVH was 39.0% (95% CI 36.6-41.5%) and associated with older age. Only 26% of those with TTE-LVH and elevated blood pressure were on antihypertensives. Prevalence of ECG-LVH ranged from 1.9 to 5.0%, and compared to TTE-LVH had low agreement (κ < 0.20), low sensitivity (< 10%) and high specificity (> 90%). These findings indicate a high prevalence of TTE-LVH among high-risk Haitian adults, and poor detection using ECGs compared to TTEs. For those with TTE-LVH, treatment with antihypertensives may reduce the risk of adverse CVD outcomes.
40229311	Gamma-ray and fast neutron shielding characteristics of inconel super alloys, stainless steel-304, and Pb using MCNPX, WinXCom, XMuDat, and Auto-Z<sub>eff</sub> software.	Fast neutron and gamma-ray attenuation characteristics of Inconel-600, -601, -625, and - 718 superalloys, stainless steel-304, and lead were studied using MCNPX Monte Carlo code, WinXCom, XMuDat, and Auto-Z<sub>eff</sub> computer programs. The µ<sub>m</sub>, HVL, MFP, σ<sub>a</sub>, σ<sub>e</sub>, Z<sub>eff</sub> and N<sub>eff</sub>, and Σ<sub>T</sub> were calculated for <sup>192</sup>Ir, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>137</sup>Cs, and <sup>60</sup>Co gamma sources and 1 MeV fast neutrons. The difference between the MCNPX and calculated results was less than ± 2%. Above and below 511 keV photon energy, respectively, Inconel-600 and Inconel-625 have the highest mass attenuation coefficient among Inconel alloys. The thickest HVL and MFP values were achieved for the Inconel-601 superalloy. The σ<sub>a</sub> and σ<sub>e</sub> values decreased as photon energy increased. The Z<sub>eff</sub> values were approximately constant with photon energy increase. The Z<sub>eff</sub> of the Inconel-601 was the lowest, while that of Inconel-625 was the highest. In the studied gamma-ray energies, the N<sub>eff</sub> value variations were insignificant. The stainless steel-304 material was found to have the highest Σ<sub>T</sub>, while Inconel-600 had the highest value between Inconel superalloys. Calculated data indicates that Inconel-600 is the superior candidate for shielding gamma rays among Inconel superalloys.
40229309	An adaptive sliding mode fault-tolerant control of variable speed reaching law for steer-by-wire systems.	Fault-tolerant control (FTC) is crucial for enhancing the safety, reliability, and tracking performance of steer-by-wire (SBW) systems. This paper focuses on actuator effectiveness reduction faults and establishes an analytical model of the SBW system that incorporates motor disturbances, steering feedback, and self-aligning torque characteristics. To solve the inadequate tracking accuracy resulting from actuator fault and system disturbances, an adaptive sliding mode fault-tolerant control strategy based on a variable-speed reaching law (VSRL-ASMFTC) is proposed. By integrating an adjustment function into the constant-velocity reaching polynomial and designing an adaptive law, dynamic updating of the control law is achieved. Furthermore, the closed-loop stability of the system is proven based on Lyapunov's stability criterion. The example information demonstrates that the proposed method reduces the root mean square (RMS) of tracking error by nearly 40% in three typical conditions compared to adaptive fault-tolerant control methods (ASMFTC), and the disturbances of the controller are relatively slighter. This indicates that the VSRL-ASMFTC mitigates system chattering, optimizes the system's anti-disturbance capability and robust stability, and improves fault tolerance efficiency in the presence of actuator failures. It maintains good tracking performance of the system, which provides a basis for the design of high-performance fault-tolerant control strategies.

40229307	An open retail boundary dataset for South Korea using open data and computer vision technique.	Although delineating retail boundaries is important to explore and comprehend the dynamics of the retail sector, it is hard to find studies specifically addressing it in the South Korean context. This study fills this gap by proposing new retail boundaries across South Korea. To achieve this goal, we employed a variety of retailers and building datasets and proposed a unique computer vision-based framework with a deep ensemble voting technique. As a result, we delineated 6,636 distinct retail boundaries that were validated against existing reference retail boundaries. These newly delineated retail boundaries provide valuable insights for researchers, governments, and other relevant stakeholders by enhancing their understanding of retail geography. This dataset can be used as a foundational resource for analyses on topics such as pandemic recovery, retail gentrification, and the resilience of retail spaces in response to e-commerce growth, ultimately contributing to more robust retail sector research in South Korea.
40229306	Stereo olfaction underlies stable coding of head direction in blind mice.	Stereo olfaction, the difference in odor concentration between the two nostrils, has been shown to affect a variety of animal behaviors, including olfactory search. However, it is unknown whether stereo olfaction can enable the formation of allocentric spatial representations. Here, recording from head direction (HD) cells in the anterior dorsal nucleus of the thalamus in blind mice-a model system for studying olfaction-dependent allocentric spatial representations-we find that inhibiting stereo olfaction, by blocking olfactory processing in one nostril or merging the airflow going to both nostrils, drastically impairs head direction coding. To assess the behavioral impact of impaired HD cell tuning caused by loss of stereo olfaction, we developed a closed-loop head direction preference assay, in which a mouse received medial forebrain bundle reward stimulation upon orientating its head in a specific direction. We find that inhibiting stereo olfaction significantly impairs performance in the HD preference assay. These results reveal that stereo olfaction is required for mice to use smell to form a stable allocentric spatial representation of head direction.
40229305	Nanocluster-mediated signaling crosstalk between FcγR and TLR4 in macrophage inflammatory responses.	Receptor crosstalk, the interaction between different receptors to modulate signaling, is crucial for fine-tuning the inflammatory responses of innate immune cells. Although the synergistic crosstalk between Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) is well documented, the detailed mechanism underlying this synergy remains unclear. In this study, we addressed this knowledge gap by imaging the molecular organization of TLR4 and FcγR on the macrophage cell surface and correlating it with their synergistic co-activation using ligands functionalized on lipid bilayers. We confirmed that co-activation of TLR4 and FcγR enhances whole-cell pro-inflammatory responses and tyrosine phosphorylation at the receptor level. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that TLR4 and FcγR each form discrete nanoclusters after ligand stimulation, and their synergistic co-activation increases both the size and spatial overlap of these nanoclusters. Contrary to previous assumptions that TLR4 and FcγR form heterodimers during their crosstalk, our results emphasize the critical role of nanoscale spatial organization between distinct receptor clusters in modulating innate immune responses. Additionally, these findings align with similar receptor interaction mechanisms that we previously reported in other receptor pairs, such as Dectin-1/TLR2 and FcγR/TLR2, suggesting that nanocluster interactions may represent a predominant mechanism governing crosstalk between TLRs and ITAM-containing receptors.
40229304	Genomic epidemiology and phylodynamics of Acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream isolates in China.	In recent decades, Acinetobacter baumannii has become a major global nosocomial pathogen, with bloodstream infections (BSIs) exhibiting mortality rates exceeding 60% and imposing substantial economic burdens. However, limited large-scale genomic epidemiology has hindered understanding of its population dynamics. Here, we analyzed 1506 non-repetitive BSI-causing A. baumannii isolates from 76 Chinese hospitals over a decade (2011-2021). We identified 149 sequence types (STs) and 101 K-locus types (KLs), revealing increased population diversity. International clone (IC) 2 accounted for 81.74% of isolates, with a notable shift in prevalent STs: ST208 increased while ST191 and ST195 declined, aligning with global trends. ST208 exhibited higher virulence, greater antibiotic resistance, enhanced desiccation tolerance, and more complex transmission patterns compared to ST191 and ST195. Its genomic plasticity drives its adaptation and spread. Using the high-resolution Oxford MLST scheme, this study uncovered greater diversity and genetic factors behind ST208's rise. A. baumannii is evolving from a low-virulence, multidrug-resistant pathogen to a more virulent one, highlighting the urgent need to address its growing threat. These findings have critical implications for infection control and public health policies.
40229303	ERA5-Drought: Global drought indices based on ECMWF reanalysis.	Droughts are increasingly intensified by human-induced climate change and pose a growing threat to society. Thus, enhancing our capabilities to monitor drought occurrence and intensity is crucial. This paper introduces a new dataset of drought indices derived from the 5th generation ECMWF reanalysis system (ERA5), which offers long-term monitoring of the global climate in both deterministic and probabilistic forms. This global dataset is freely accessible through an ECMWF-hosted data store, and it entails two prominent drought indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Both indices are calculated over a range of accumulation periods from 1 month to 4 years and are available for the full ERA5 climatology from 1940 to today. It also contains validation data that indicates the quality of these drought indices. The ERA5-Drought dataset serves as a valuable tool for environmental agencies and supports sectors such as water management and agriculture, thus contributing to efforts that monitor water and food security.
40229302	Integrated renin angiotensin system dysregulation and immune profiles predict COVID-19 disease severity in a South African cohort.	Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation is an important component of the complex pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the entry receptor and key to the alternative RAS, was proposed as a severity/prognostic biomarker for risk-stratification. However, experimental RAS data from diverse cohorts are limited, particularly analyses integrating RAS with immune biomarkers. Participants (n = 172) in Cape Town were sampled longitudinally (including a recovery timepoint [> 3-month]), across WHO asymptomatic to critical severity. Using fluorometric assays and LC-MS/MS RAS Fingerprinting<sup>®</sup>, results show serum ACE1 activity significantly decreases with increasing COVID-19 severity (P < 0.01) and mortality (P < 0.05), while increased ACE2 activity is associated with worse severity (P < 0.01). Neither enzyme activity correlates with viral load proxy or nasal ACE mRNA levels. ACE1 and ACE2 activities were the most effective severity biomarkers compared to 96 established immune markers obtained via proximity extension assay, as demonstrated by principal component analysis. A multivariate variable selection model using random forest classification identified biomarkers discriminating COVID-19 severity (AUC = 0.82), the strongest being HGF, EN-RAGE, cathepsin L. Adding ACE1 activity and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres improved differentiation between ambulatory and hospitalised participants. Notably, RAS dysregulation has unique severity associations in coronavirus infections with implications for treatment and pathophysiological mechanisms.
40229301	Integrating conventional and remote sensing with DC resistivity datasets to map groundwater potential areas using the analytical hierarchy process method, North Wadi Diit, Egypt.	This study investigates the groundwater potential (GWP) in Wadi Diit, an arid region with promising resource development prospects, by integrating topographic, hydrogeological, and mineralogical parameters. To analyze the study area, a combination of conventional methods, remote sensing data from Sentinel-2, ASTER-GDEM, and ASTER-L1B, as well as DC resistivity datasets was utilized. The study region comprises Precambrian, Tertiary, and Quaternary surface rock units, supporting lithosol and Yermosol soil types. Barren lands dominate the landscape, while the southern portion experiences higher rainfall. Nine thematic layers (quartz index, carbonate index, slope, rainfall, drainage density, topographic wetness index, lineament density, land cover, and mafic index) were classified and weighted using GIS-based analytical hierarchy process, achieving a model accuracy of 0.0959. The GWP zones were categorized into very low (4.53%), low (17.33%), moderate (27.05%), high (27.79%), and very high (23.3%) categories, predominantly falling within moderate to very high classifications. Validation through hydrogeological data from 11 wells and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under curve = 0.8) confirmed the model's reliability. DC resistivity measurements were conducted at nine vertical electrical sounding (VES) sites using a Schlumberger array (AB/2 = 500 m) along two profiles. The data were analyzed using various inversion techniques, including unconstrained 1D-VES, laterally constrained inversion (LCI-VES), spatially constrained inversion (SCI-VES), and 2D-VES inversions. A 0.3 constraint factor was applied to assess the accuracy of the model parameters, as their STDF derived from SCI-VES data were determined to be well-resolved. The SCI-VES and 2D-VES inversion results identified four distinct geological layers; unconsolidated surface deposits, gravelly-sand sediments of fresh-brackish Quaternary aquifer (30-384 Ω m and 3.7-15.9 m depth), saturated clayey-sand deposits, and saline Fractured Basement aquifer (10-137 Ω m and 33-90.4 m depth). The region exhibits a complex geological structure, characterized by an uplifted Fractured Basement aquifer trending southeast and southwest as indicated by 2D-VES models. The north-central region emerges as the most favorable location for substantial GWPZ, making it strategically ideal for the installation of additional water wells.

40229299	Maternal hypertensive disorders and modifiable risk factors among pregnant women in North Central Ethiopia.	Even though maternal hypertensive disorders (MHDs) is the second cause of maternal death in Ethiopia, detail and population based study among pregnant women is lacking in the study area. Hence, this study had assesed the prevalence of MHDs and associated risk factors among pregnant women, in North Central Ethiopia, 2023. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted using the WHO STEPWISE questionnaire among 855 participants through multi-stage cluster sampling in five districts of North Central Ethiopia from May to June 2023. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed, and a P-value of < 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Seven percent (95% CI 6%, 8%) of pregnant women had MHDs. Pregnant women who had no history of hypertension had 52% lower odds (adjusted odds ratio (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.44, 0.52) than those with a history of hypertension. Pregnant women, who ate processed food that are high in salt sometimes and rarely had 88% and 81% less odds (AOR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.03, 0.47), (AOR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.07, 0.55) than those who ate always, respectively. Women who didn't know to express blood pressure measurement had 56% lower odds (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.22, 0.89) of maternal hypertensive disorders than those who expressed the measurement. Seven out of hundred pregnant women had MHDs. Previous history of hypertension, women knew how to express their blood pressure measurement and consumed processed foods high in salt rarely and sometimes were factors strongly associated with MHDs. Zonal health departments and their partners should strengthen advocacy for prevention and control of MHDs in the study area.
40229297	GABAergic neurons in central amygdala contribute to orchestrating anxiety-like behaviors and breathing patterns.	Anxiety is characterized by dysregulated respiratory reactivity to emotional stimuli. The central amygdala (CeA) is a pivotal structure involved in processing emotional alterations, but its involvement in orchestrating anxiety-like behaviors and specific breathing patterns remains largely unexplored. Our findings demonstrate that the acute restraint stress (ARS) induces anxiety-like behaviors in mice, marked by prolonged grooming time and faster respiratory frequency (RF). Conversely, silencing GABAergic CeA neurons reduces post-ARS anxiety-like behaviors, as well as the associated increases in grooming time and RF. In actively behaving mice, stimulation of GABAergic CeA neurons elicits anxiety-like behaviors, concurrently prolongs grooming time, accelerates RF through a CeA-thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) circuit. In either behaviorally quiescent or anesthetized mice, stimulation of these neurons significantly increases RF but does not induce anxiety-like behaviors through the CeA-lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) circuit. Collectively, GABAergic CeA neurons are instrumental in orchestrating anxiety-like behaviors and breathing patterns primarily through the CeA-PVT and CeA-LPBN circuits, respectively.
40229296	Understanding the structural basis of ALS mutations associated with resistance to sulfonylurea in wheat.	Developing herbicide-tolerant wheat varieties is highly desirable for effective weed management and improved crop yield. The enzyme acetolactate synthase (ALS) is the target enzyme for the sulfonylurea class of herbicides. The structural analysis of mutable sites in ALS is crucial for the generation of herbicide-resistant crops. Previous studies indicated that mutant lines of Triticum aestivum ALS (TaALS) with amino acid substitutions at P174, G631, and G632 residues provided resistance to sulfonylurea herbicide, nicosulfuron. The present study aimed to provide structural insights into mutable residues causing sulfonylurea herbicide resistance to TaALS enzyme through in-silico molecular docking and simulation approaches. The molecular docking analysis suggested a single point mutation at TaALS-P174S, its double mutant conformations (TaALS-G632S/P174S and TaALS-G631D/G632S) and associated triple mutant conformation (TaALS-G631D/G632S/P174S) to have the lowest binding affinity with nicosulfuron than the wild-type conformation of TaALS. Furthermore, the molecular dynamic simulation study confirms the weakest and more stable binding of the triple mutant conformation with nicosulfuron. Our computational study identifies a triple mutant conformation (TaALS-G631D/G632S/P174S) to be more effective in developing sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant wheat crops.
40229295	Homogeneous polymer-ionic solvate electrolyte with weak dipole-dipole interaction enabling long cycling pouch lithium metal battery.	Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are considered as promising electrolytes for high-voltage lithium metal batteries. Whereas, the strong dipole-dipole interaction in polymer electrolytes limits the enhancement of the ionic conductivity. Here, we propose the 1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-Tetrafluoropropylether (TTE) diluent to significantly regulate the dipole-dipole interaction in polymer-ionic solvate electrolytes (TPISEs). The TTE encapsulates ionic solvate to reduce the dipole-dipole interaction of ionic solvate with the polymer matrix, which promotes their homogeneous distribution, creating a continuous ion percolating network among the polymer matrix. The ion conductivity of TPISEs is therefore enhanced to 1.27×10<sup>-3</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup> at 25 °C. Meanwhile, the TTE induces the ionic solvate to transform from contact ion pairs to aggregates, contributing to a stable lithium/electrolyte interface with exchange current density 190 times larger than that without TTE. The Li||LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> full cells exhibit good cycling stability from -30 °C to 60 °C. The practical pouch cells consisting of a thin Li metal foil (50 μm) and a high-areal-capacity positive electrode (3.58 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup>) achieve a high specific energy of 354.4 Wh·kg<sup>-1</sup> and maintain 78.1% capacity after 450 cycles at 54 mA g<sup>-1</sup> and 25 °C. This work provides a design strategy for SPEs beyond the bottleneck of ionic conductivity for practical solid-state batteries.
40229294	Bulk Bi-Sb polycrystals underpinned by high electron/phonon mean free path ratio enabling thermoelectric cooling under 77 K.	Bi-Sb alloy, as a promising thermoelectric material at cryogenic temperatures, has seen stagnant progress due to challenges in understanding the transport behaviors of energy carriers, and difficulties in synthesizing high-homogeneity, large-grain samples. In this study, an inherent electron-phonon decoupling in Bi-Sb is revealed using the first-principles calculations based on the virtual crystal approximation. The mean free path of the dominant electrons (λ<sub>ele</sub> ~ 10<sup>3</sup> nm) is found of two orders of magnitude larger than that of phonons (λ<sub>ph</sub> ~ 10<sup>1 </sup>nm), suggesting that a grain size greater than 10 μm would be favorable for thermoelectric transport. Bulk Bi-Sb polycrystals with highly elemental homogeneity and large grain size (~80 μm) are successfully synthesized through an ultra-fast quenching method combined with annealing, delivering superior thermoelectric performance. A prototype module based on the Bi<sub>0.88</sub>Sb<sub>0.12</sub> polycrystal, with a ZT<sub>max</sub> of 0.48 at 150 K, is fabricated and demonstrates a ΔT<sub>max</sub> of 4 K at a T<sub>h</sub> of 75 K. This marks the first report of n-p paired thermoelectric cooling modules operating below liquid nitrogen temperature.
40229293	A Dataset of SNPs Related to Downy Mildew Resistance in East Asian Grape Based on GBTS.	Grapevine is an important commercial crop widely grown in the world. However, grapevine cultivation has long been seriously threatened by grapevine downy mildew caused by Plasmopara viticola. Screening the resistance resources and identifying the resistance germplasm is the key to improve the resistance of cultivars to P. viticola. East Asia is one of the three origin regions of wild grapevine (North America, Eurasia and East Asia), and many varieties have strong disease resistance. In present study, we selected nine wild East Asian grape vines and selected three of them with the highest P. viticola resistance to construct genetic populations. Genotyping by Targeted Sequencing (GBTS) is a high-throughput and cost-effective technology for sequencing specific genome regions, and its application in genetic population analysis and disease resistance related markers identification has revealed that may be abundant P. viticola-resistant germplasm in East Asian grapes. Our sequencing data and disease resistance grade data provided a valuable reference for mining downy mildew resistant germplasm of East Asian grape and breeding resistant varieties.
40229292	Room-temperature phosphorescence and anomalous piezochromism in molecular crystals enabled by iodine atomic orbital sharing.	Controlling room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in organic materials through external stimuli is crucial for elucidating RTP mechanisms and engineering stimuli-responsive materials for various applications. However, compared to fluorescent materials, regulating RTP presents greater challenges due to its intricate photophysical processes, particularly in the quest for RTP materials with desirable stimulus-responsive properties. Here we show that when the interactions of iodine with neighboring molecules in 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene (1,4-DITFB) crystals are tuned by pressure, exotic emission behaviors emerge. These emissions exhibit anomalous blue-shifted characteristics and enhanced intensities upon compression, accompanied by prolonged lifetimes. Notably, such piezochromic luminescence responses are impeded through a co-crystallization strategy that hinders iodine-iodine interactions. We further reveal that the observed anomalous emissions related to the unique state of iodine by providing additional orbitals shared with surrounding molecules. Our findings not only open pathways for designing tailored stimuli-responsive luminescent materials but also offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms governing organic RTP emitters.
40229290	A conserved fungal effector disturbs Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing and ROS homeostasis to induce plant cell death.	Acting as a major Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, calmodulin (CaM) activates target proteins to regulate a variety of cellular processes. Here, we report that CaM-target binding is disturbed by a fungal virulence effector PdCDIE1 (Penicillium digitatum Cell Death-Inducing Effector 1), which results into reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent plant cell death. PdCDIE1 is an evolutionarily conserved fungal effector that exhibits plant cell death-inducing activity and contributes significantly to pathogen virulence. PdCDIE1 interacts with a plant heat shock protein Hsp70 that is antagonistic to ROS-dependent plant cell death. Hsp70 is a bona fide target of CaM and its CaM-binding domain also interacts with N-terminal PdCDIE1. The interaction between CaM and Hsp70 in citrus fruit is disturbed during pathogen infection but recovered during ΔPdCDIE1 mutant infection. Application of a CaM inhibitor and silencing of CaM genes induce plant cell death and high levels of ROS as PdCDIE1 does. These results reveal a molecular framework of effector-triggered susceptibility which integrates Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing and ROS homeostasis to induce plant cell death.
40229289	Chromosome-level genome and annotation of the tetraploid Rhodiola kirilowii.	Rhodiola kirilowii, a perennial medical herb native to China, is highly valued for its detoxification and anti-swelling properties, as well as its role as an adaptogen, making it an intriguing subject for understanding its medicinal potential and molecular biochemistry. In this study, we generated a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome of R. kirilowii achieved through a combination of Illumina short-read sequencing, PacBio long-read sequencing, and Hi-C sequencing techniques. The final assembly spans 1.92 Gb, including 40 homoeologous chromosomes and one sex chromosome, with a scaffold NG50 of 46.03 Mb, and a BUSCO completeness of 98.9%. Additionally, we annotated a total of 1.23 Gb of repetitive sequences, encompassing 63.88% of the entire genome, and identified 122,035 protein-coding genes. Each sub-genome achieved similar completeness and continuity. This high-quality reference genome provides critical insights into the genetic underpinnings of R. kirilowii's pharmacological properties, facilitating comparative genomics and the enhancement of its medicinal applications.
40229288	Gene clusters linked to insulin resistance identified in a genome-wide study of the Taiwan Biobank population.	This pioneering genome-wide association study examined surrogate markers for insulin resistance (IR) in 147,880 Taiwanese individuals using data from the Taiwan Biobank. The study focused on two IR surrogate markers: the triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG:HDL-C) ratio and the TyG index (the product of fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides). We identified genome-wide significance loci within four gene clusters: GCKR, MLXIPL, APOA5, and APOC1, uncovering 197 genes associated with IR. Transcriptome-wide association analysis revealed significant associations between these clusters and TyG, primarily in adipose tissue. Gene ontology analysis highlighted pathways related to Alzheimer's disease, glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, and lipoprotein dynamics. The study identified sex-specific genes associated with TyG. Polygenic risk score analysis linked both IR markers to gout and hyperlipidemia. Our findings elucidate the complex relationships between IR surrogate markers, genetic predisposition, and disease phenotypes in the Taiwanese population, contributing valuable insights to the field of metabolic research.
40229286	ICAM-1/CD18-mediated sequestration of parasitized phagocytes in cortical capillaries promotes neuronal colonization by Toxoplasma gondii.	Microbial translocation across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a prerequisite for colonization of the central nervous system. The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii chronically infects the brain parenchyma of humans and animals, in a remarkably stealthy fashion. We investigated the mechanisms of BBB traversal by T. gondii (genotypes I, II, III) and T. gondii-infected leukocytes, using intracarotid arterial delivery into the cerebral circulation of mice. Unexpectedly, parasitized dendritic cells (DCs) and other peripheral blood mononuclear cells were found to persistently sequester within cortical capillaries. Post-replicative egress of T. gondii from sequestered DCs was followed by rapid parasite localization within cortical neurons. Infection-induced microvascular inflammation dramatically elevated the sequestration of parasitized DCs, while treatments targeting the ICAM-1/CD18 leukocyte adhesion axis with blocking antibodies strongly reverted sequestration. The parasite effectors TgWIP and GRA15, known to promote leukocyte hypermigration and inflammatory activation, further increased both the capillary sequestration of infected DCs and cerebral parasite loads in a strain-dependent manner. These findings reveal that the sequestration of parasitized leukocytes in cortical capillaries, with subsequent BBB traversal following parasite egress, provides a mechanism for T. gondii's rapid access to cortical neurons during primary infection.
40229284	Advancements in delivery systems for dietary polyphenols in enhancing radioprotection effects: challenges and opportunities.	Radiotherapy, a widely employed cancer treatment, often triggers diverse inflammatory responses such as radiation enteritis, pulmonary injury, pelvic inflammation, dermatitis, and osteitis. Dietary polyphenols have recently emerged as promising agents for mitigating radiation-induced inflammation. However, their clinical application faced challenges related to variable bioavailability, individual pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing, and limited clinical evidence. Current researches revealed the efficacy of bioactive small molecule polyphenols in addressing radiation-induced inflammation. In this review, along with a comprehensive examination of the etiology and categories of radiation-induced inflammatory conditions, the diversity of polyphenols and elucidating their anti-inflammatory mechanisms are explored. This study emphasizes the recent progresses in delivery systems for dietary polyphenols, aiming to enhance radioprotection effects. The optimized utilization of polyphenols, with a theoretical framework and reference guide, is of paramount relevance. Through diverse delivery mechanisms, the more effective and safer radioprotective strategies become achievable. This endeavor aspires to contribute to breakthroughs in the dietary polyphenols' application, significantly enhancing human health protection during radiotherapy. These comprehensive insights presented here also support (pre)-clinical practices in navigating the complexities of utilizing dietary polyphenols for radioprotection, fostering advancements in the field and improving patient outcomes.

40229281	Electronic band structure engineering of π-d conjugated metal-organic framework for sodium organic batteries.	Two-dimensional conjugated metal organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) hold significant promise as electrode materials for alkali metal ion batteries while their electrochemical properties still lack reasonable and effective regulation. Here, two representative 2D c-MOFs (M-HHTQ/M-HHTP, M=Cu or Ni) as positive electrodes are used as models to explore the basic/microscopic principles of their complex storage mechanism in sodium ion batteries (SIBs). It is demonstrated that the energy storage mechanism of 2D c-MOFs is determined by the interaction between coordination covalent bonds and organic linkers. Theoretical calculations and experiment results have jointly demonstrated that the redox potential and theoretical capacity can be regulated based on the valence of M-O bond and the utilization of anions and cations, respectively. As a result, Cu-HHTQ achieves a high discharge voltage at 2.55 V (vs. Na<sup>+</sup>/Na), a higher stable specific capacity of 208 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.05 A g<sup>-1</sup>, and long cyclability with the capacity retention rate of 100% at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> after 2000 cycles.
40229280	Genome-wide association study identifies common variants associated with breast cancer in South African Black women.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have characterized the contribution of common variants to breast cancer (BC) risk in populations of European ancestry, however GWAS have not been reported in resident African populations. This GWAS included 2485 resident African BC cases and 1101 population matched controls. Two risk loci were identified, located between UNC13C and RAB27A on chromosome 15 (rs7181788, p = 1.01 × 10<sup>-08</sup>) and in USP22 on chromosome 17 (rs899342, p = 4.62 × 10<sup>-08</sup>). Several genome-wide significant signals were also detected in hormone receptor subtype analysis. The novel loci did not replicate in BC GWAS data from populations of West Africa ancestry suggesting genetic heterogeneity in different African populations, but further validation of these findings is needed. A European ancestry derived polygenic risk model for BC explained only 0.79% of variance in our data. Larger studies in pan-African populations are needed to further define the genetic contribution to BC risk.
40229279	EFCNet enhances the efficiency of segmenting clinically significant small medical objects.	Efficient segmentation of small hyperreflective dots, key biomarkers for diseases like macular edema, is critical for diagnosis and treatment monitoring.However, existing models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, struggle with these minute structures due to information loss.To address this, we introduce EFCNet, which integrates the Cross-Stage Axial Attention (CSAA) module for enhanced feature fusion and the Multi-Precision Supervision (MPS) module for improved hierarchical guidance. We evaluated EFCNet on two datasets: S-HRD, comprising 313 retinal OCT scans from patients with macular edema, and S-Polyp, a 229-image subset of the publicly available CVC-ClinicDB colonoscopy dataset. EFCNet outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) gains of 4.88% on S-HRD and 3.49% on S-Polyp, alongside Intersection over Union (IoU) improvements of 3.77% and 3.25%, respectively. Notably, smaller objects benefit most, highlighting EFCNet's effectiveness where conventional models underperform. Unlike U-Net-Large, which offers marginal gains with increased scale, EFCNet's superior performance is driven by its novel design. These findings demonstrate its effectiveness and potential utility in clinical practice.
40229278	The NR3C2-SIRT1 signaling axis promotes autophagy and inhibits epithelial mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers with a complex pathogenesis, there is an urgent need to find new drug therapeutic targets. This study highlights the important role of the NR3C2-SIRT1 signaling axis in the metastasis mechanism of CRC. Our findings revealed that the expression of NR3C2 in CRC tissues was lower than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and was negatively correlated with N stage by bioanalysis, IHC, western blot and qRT-PCR. NR3C2 overexpression / knockdown can significantly inhibit / promote the migration and invasion of CRC cells, at the same time inhibit / promote EMT. Mechanically, the regulatory molecule SIRT1 was identified by RNA-seq, bioinformatics analysis, western blot and ChIP. SIRT1 was also involved in the metastasis process of CRC, and NR3C2 was found to regulate the expression of LC3B and SQSTM1/p62 in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Therefore, NR3C2 forms a signaling axis with SIRT1, which can directly promote autophagy and inhibit EMT process in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, our findings suggest that NR3C2 - SIRT1 signal axis promote autophagy and inhibit EMT, ultimately inhibits lung metastasis of CRC.
40229277	Targeting site-specific N-glycosylated B7H3 induces potent antitumor immunity.	B7H3, an immune checkpoint molecule, is a highly N-glycosylated membrane protein. However, the key glycosylated asparagine residues that mediate the function of the B7H3 protein are still unclear. Here we identify that N-glycans attached to asparagine residues N91/309 and N104/322 are required for proper B7H3 localization on the cell surface membrane. We demonstrate that mutations in these two pairs of N-glycosylation sites induce ER accumulation of B7H3 by blocking its ER-to-Golgi translocation and subsequently promote its degradation via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway. Additional evidence suggests that N-glycosylation at N91/309 and N104/322 of B7H3 is essential for its inhibition of T-cell proliferation and activation. More importantly, a monoclonal antibody, Ab-82, preferentially targeting B7H3 glycosylated at N91/309 and N104/322 is developed, which exhibits the ability to elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated antitumor immunity via B7H3 internalization. Together, these findings offer a rationale for targeting glycosylated B7H3 as a potential strategy for immunotherapy.
40229276	H3.1K27M-induced misregulation of the TONSOKU-H3.1 pathway causes genomic instability.	The oncomutation lysine 27-to-methionine in histone H3 (H3K27M) is frequently identified in tumors of patients with diffuse midline glioma-H3K27 altered (DMG-H3K27a). H3K27M inhibits the deposition of the histone mark H3K27me3, which affects the maintenance of transcriptional programs and cell identity. Cells expressing H3K27M are also characterized by defects in genome integrity, but the mechanisms linking expression of the oncohistone to DNA damage remain mostly unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of H3.1K27M in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana interferes with post-replicative chromatin maturation mediated by the H3.1K27 methyltransferases ATXR5 and ATXR6. As a result, H3.1 variants on nascent chromatin remain unmethylated at K27 (H3.1K27me0), leading to ectopic activity of TONSOKU (TSK/TONSL), which induces DNA damage and genomic alterations. Elimination of TSK activity suppresses the genome stability defects associated with H3.1K27M expression, while inactivation of specific DNA repair pathways prevents survival of H3.1K27M-expressing plants. Overall, our results suggest that H3.1K27M disrupts the chromatin-based mechanisms regulating TSK activity, which causes genomic instability and may contribute to the etiology of DMG-H3K27a.
40229274	China food security comprehensive assessment dataset 2012-2022.	Ensuring food security is an eternal issue in the development process of human society, and as a major global grain-producing country, China has played an important role in stabilizing world food security. However, China's food security is facing new challenges in the context of the new development pattern, and the existing grain statistics are fragmented and not comprehensive enough to meet the needs of current food security assessment studies. In this study, we constructed the time-series China food security comprehensive assessment dataset (CFSAD), which includes five categories of grain, rice, wheat, maize and soybean, and covers five dimensions of the basic guarantee level, the market operation situation, the scientific and technological support capacity, the resource and environmental conditions, and the level of purchasing power, and includes fourteen indicators. Our dataset enables a more scientific and comprehensive assessment of China's food security situation, which can provide data support for effective government policy making and academic research.
40229273	The chromosomal-level genome assembly and annotation of pen shell Atrina pectinata.	The pen shell Atrina pectinata is a bivalve recognized for its outstanding large adductor muscle and developed byssus. Now, it becomes threatened in East Asia, requiring special attention for artificial breeding to boost yield. However, the lack of high-quality genomes hinders our understanding of its reproductive biology, which resulting in the artificial breeding in pen shell is still a scientific technological problem. Here, we produced a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of A. pectinata combing the PacBio, Illumina, and high-resolution chromosome conformation capture sequencing. The final assembly has a size of 951.01 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 52.64 Mb, 98.87% of sequence was anchored onto 17 chromosomes, with a BUSCO evaluation integrity score of 98.8%. We successfully identified 29,326 protein-coding genes and 24,708 genes (84.25%) were functionally annotated. The BUSCO evaluation integrity score for the predicted protein-coding genes was 97.7%. This work promotes the applicability of the A. pectinata genome, laying a solid foundation for future investigations into genomics and biology within this species.
40229272	Neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab in stage IV high-grade serous ovarian cancer: the phase II Neo-Pembro trial.	While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, their efficacy in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) remains limited. Some patients, however, achieve lasting responses, emphasizing the need to understand how tumor microenvironment and molecular characteristics influence ICI response. The phase 2 Neo-Pembro study (NCT03126812) included 33 untreated stage IV HGSOC patients, who were scheduled for 6 cycles of carboplatin-paclitaxel and interval cytoreductive surgery. Pembrolizumab (pembro) was added from cycle two and continued for one year. The primary objective was to assess intratumoral immune activation using multiplexed immunofluorescence and immune-related gene expression. Our findings show immune activation, evidenced by an increase in CD3 + , CD8 + , CD8 + /FOXP3+ ratio, TNF-α and interferon-γ signaling. Treatment was well-tolerated. We observed major pathologic responses in 9/33 patients (27%, 95%CI 14-46), with pathologic response strongly associated with immune activation and OS. At a median follow-up of 52.8 months, 8/9 major responders were alive, with 6 patients recurrence-free. In contrast, 4/24 minor responders survived, including one recurrence-free. ctDNA clearance was observed in all major responders and was associated with prolonged PFS and OS. PD-L1 expression and homologous recombination deficiency were predictive of major response and may serve as biomarkers, warranting further exploration. These results suggest major responders may benefit from neo-adjuvant pembro.
40229271	Inactivation of GH3.5 by COP1-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination promotes seedling hypocotyl elongation.	CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), which was first discovered as a central repressor of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis, destabilizes proteins by ubiquitination in both plants and animals. However, it is unclear whether and how Arabidopsis COP1 mediates non-proteolytic ubiquitination to regulate photomorphogenesis. Here, we show that COP1-mediated lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination inhibits the enzyme activity of GRETCHEN HAGEN 3.5 (GH3.5), a synthetase that conjugates amino acids to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), thereby promoting hypocotyl elongation in the dark. We show that COP1 physically interacts with and genetically acts through GH3.5 to promote hypocotyl elongation. COP1 does not affect GH3.5 protein stability; however, it suppresses GH3.5 activity through K63-linked ubiquitination in the dark, inhibiting the endogenous conversion of IAA to IAA-amino acid conjugates. Further, light regulates IAA metabolism by suppressing the inhibitory effect of COP1 on the function of GH3.5 and its homologs. Our results shed light on the non-proteolytic role of COP1-mediated ubiquitination and the mechanism by which light regulates auxin metabolism to modulate hypocotyl elongation.
40229270	PIN1-SUMO2/3 motif suppresses excessive RNF168 chromatin accumulation and ubiquitin signaling to promote IR resistance.	RNF168 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase critical to the mammalian DNA double-strand break repair response. The protein is recruited to and amplifies ubiquitin signals at damaged chromatin and, if not properly regulated, can drive an uncontrolled ubiquitin cascade potentially harmful to repair outcomes. Several indirect mechanisms restrict RNF168 positive feedback, and a longstanding question has been whether these alone suppress excessive RNF168 signaling or whether mechanisms to remove RNF168 from damaged chromatin exist. Here, we reveal a cascade of post-translational modifications which act at three adjacent amino acids, threonine-208, proline-209 and lysine-210, to process RNF168 actively. Phosphorylation at threonine-208 by CDK1/2 induces interaction with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PIN1. PIN1 promotes RNF168 SUMOylation at lysine-210, resulting in p97/VCP mediated removal. These actions promote RNF168 clearance and limit RNF168 chromatin build-up. Thus, single amino acid substitutions of the regulatory motif (SUMO-PIN1-assisted Chromatin Regulator, SPaCR) that restrict PIN1 interaction or SUMOylation are sufficient to drive supraphysiological accumulation of RNF168, increased ubiquitin signaling, excessive 53BP1 recruitment and radiosensitivity. Our findings define a mechanism of direct RNF168 regulation that is part of the normal damage response, promoting RNF168 dissociation from chromatin and limiting deleterious ubiquitin signaling.
40229269	Specific labeling of outer membrane vesicles with antibiotic-conjugated probe reveals early bacterial infections in blood.	Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are nano-sized structures derived from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, which have emerged as key players in host-pathogen interactions, yet their potential as biomarkers remains largely unexplored due to the difficulty of identification in complex biological samples. Here we show an approach for detecting and quantifying bacterial OMVs in blood using a Polymyxin B-fluorescein probe (PmBF), which targets bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The probe selectively labels OMVs, enabling their differentiation from host extracellular vesicles and quantitative analysis using nano-flow cytometry. In male mouse models of pneumonia, we observe elevated serum PmBF<sup>+</sup> EVs as early as 6 h post-infection, preceding positive blood cultures. In clinical samples, PmBF<sup>+</sup> EVs show superior performance for diagnosing bacterial infections and differentiate them from virus or mycoplasma infections. Our findings highlight circulating PmBF<sup>+</sup> EVs as promising biomarkers of bacterial infections.
40229268	CAR T-cell therapy response varies by extranodal disease site in large B-cell lymphoma.	The role of extranodal (EN) sites as potential sanctuary regions resistant to CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) remains unclear. To investigate this, we retrospectively analyzed 283 adults treated with commercial CD19 CAR-T therapy, assessing 958 PET-CT scans across four time points: pre-apheresis, pre-lymphodepletion, best response, and relapse. EN involvement prior to CAR-T therapy was common (76%). Outcomes for patients with exclusive EN disease were similar to those with nodal (ND) disease alone; however, patients with concomitant EN and ND disease (EN + ND) had lower complete response rates and shorter progression-free survival. Site-specific outcomes varied: lungs/pleura/pericardium and gastrointestinal/peritoneum involvement had the lowest local response rates (48% and 51%, respectively). Notably, the risk of same-site relapse was highest in the lungs/pleura/pericardium (hazard ratio [HR] 7.8) and gastrointestinal/peritoneum (HR 5.97). Among patients relapsing after CAR-T, two-year overall survival rates from time of relapse were significantly lower in those with EN relapse (23% for exclusive EN; 25% for EN + ND) compared to exclusive ND relapse (64%; p = 0.008). These findings underscore the high prevalence of EN disease in CAR-T recipients and its site-specific impact on outcomes, highlighting the need for organ-targeted strategies to enhance treatment efficacy. Differential site-specific response and relapse/progression risk according to pre-CAR-T therapy anatomical site involvement in Large B-cell Lymphoma. Risk of site-specific relapse or progression was not evaluable for CNS/orbital/cranial sinuses, adrenal/genitourinary, hepatobiliary/pancreas, and spleen due to insufficient number of events.
40229267	β-adrenergic receptor inhibits heart regeneration by downregulating Yap m6A modification.	Newborn mammals transiently maintain the heart regenerative capacity. β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) is the most critical receptor in regulating cardiomyocyte behavior. However, the role and mechanism of β-AR, especially the subtypes of β-AR, in heart regeneration remain unclear. Here, we reveal that β-AR inhibits heart regeneration by downregulating Yap m6A modification. The β-AR expression is associated with heart regenerative capacity. After apical resection, β-AR (including β<sub>1</sub>-AR and β<sub>2</sub>-AR) inhibits heart regeneration. β<sub>2</sub>-AR exerts a more potent inhibitory effect compared with β<sub>1</sub>-AR. Mechanistically, both β<sub>1</sub>-AR and β<sub>2</sub>-AR downregulate Yap m6A modification and then YAP expression differentially by reducing METTL14 and IGF2BP1, respectively. Elevation of Yap m6A modification with adenoviruses encoding METTL14 and IGF2BP1 rescues YAP expression and cardiomyocyte proliferation inhibited by β<sub>1</sub>-AR and β<sub>2</sub>-AR, respectively. These findings indicate that both β<sub>1</sub>-AR and β<sub>2</sub>-AR inhibit heart regeneration in a m6A-dependent manner and reveal subtype-specific mechanism. These results will provide a new intervention strategy for heart regeneration.
40229265	Engineering biology applications for environmental solutions: potential and challenges.	Engineering biology applies synthetic biology to address global environmental challenges like bioremediation, biosequestration, pollutant monitoring, and resource recovery. This perspective outlines innovations in engineering biology, its integration with other technologies (e.g., nanotechnology, IoT, AI), and commercial ventures leveraging these advancements. We also discuss commercialisation and scaling challenges, biosafety and biosecurity considerations including biocontainment strategies, social and political dimensions, and governance issues that must be addressed for successful real-world implementation. Finally, we highlight future perspectives and propose strategies to overcome existing hurdles, aiming to accelerate the adoption of engineering biology for environmental solutions.
40229264	Voltage detected single spin dynamics in diamond at ambient conditions.	Defect centres in crystals like diamond or silicon find a wide application in quantum technology, where the detection and control of their quantum states is crucial for their implementation as quantum sensors and qubits. The quantum information is usually encoded in the spin state of these defect centres, but they also often possess a charge which is typically not utilized. We report here the detection of elementary charges bound to single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres several nanometres below the diamond surface using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) under laser illumination. Moreover, the measured signal depends on the NV's electron spin state, thus allowing to perform a non-optical single spin readout, a technique we refer to as "Surface Voltage Detected Magnetic Resonance" (SVDMR). Our method opens a way of coherent spin dynamics detection for quantum sensing applications and could be potentially applied to other solid state systems. We believe that this voltage-based readout would help to simplify the design of devices for quantum technology.

40229262	An orexin-sensitive subpopulation of layer 6 neurons regulates cortical excitability and anxiety behaviour.	Cortical layer 6 neurons are the only projection neuron population in the cortical mantle known to electrophysiologically respond to orexin-a neuropeptide involved in cortical arousal and emotive behaviour. These neurons exhibit extensive intercortical and thalamic projections, yet the exact mechanisms underlying these responses are not fully understood. We hypothesize that cortical circuits activated by orexin sensitive L6 neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are responsible for detecting salient features of sensory stimuli and are therefore involved in regulating emotional states. Here, we show that Drd1a-Cre+ neurons in the mPFC are selectively sensitive to orexin and gate the activation of the prefrontal network in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that chronically "silencing" this subpopulation of L6 neurons (Drd1a-Cre<sup>+/+</sup>:Snap25<sup>fl/fl</sup>) across the cortical mantle from birth abolishes the orexin-induced prefrontal activation. Consequently, the chronic silencing of these neurons had strong anxiolytic effects on several anxiety-related behavioural paradigms, indicating that orexin-responsive L6 neurons modulate emotional states and may be a substrate for anxiety regulation.
40229261	Controlled and orthogonal partitioning of large particles into biomolecular condensates.	Partitioning of client molecules into biomolecular condensates is critical for regulating the composition and function of condensates. Previous studies suggest that client size limits partitioning. Here, we ask whether large clients, such as macromolecular complexes and nanoparticles, can partition into condensates based on particle-condensate interactions. We seek to discover the fundamental biophysical principles that govern particle inclusion in or exclusion from condensates, using polymer nanoparticles surface-functionalized with biotin or oligonucleotides. Based on our experiments, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and theory, we conclude that arbitrarily large particles can controllably partition into condensates given sufficiently strong condensate-particle interactions. Remarkably, we also observe that beads with distinct surface chemistries partition orthogonally into immiscible condensates. These findings may provide insights into how various cellular processes are achieved based on partitioning of large clients into biomolecular condensates, and they offer design principles for drug delivery systems that selectively target disease-related condensates.
40229260	The dual HDAC/PI3K inhibitor CUDC-907 inhibits the growth and proliferation of MYC-driven Group 3 medulloblastoma.	Metastatic Group 3 medulloblastoma (G3 MB) have been shown in several studies to be very high risk, particularly those harboring MYC amplification. More effective therapies are especially important for these patients. CUDC-907, a novel dual inhibitor targeting the MYC upstream pathway (HDAC/PI3K), shows significant antitumor efficacy across multiple cancer types. However, the antitumor effects and underlying mechanisms of CUDC-907 in MB, particularly in very high-risk MB, remain unexplored. In this study, we showed that MYC amplified G3 MB cells, patient-derived organoids and xenograft models were sensitive to CUDC-907. CUDC-907 inhibited MYC expression through the HDAC and PI3K pathways, and then induced G0/G1 phase arrest through the MYC-P21/P27-CDKs/cyclins axis. Furthermore, when CUDC-907 was combined with chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin, G0/G1 phase blocking effect was further enhanced. CUDC-907 in combination with radiotherapy (RT) inhibited DNA damage repair and increased DNA damage. These findings indicate that CUDC-907, either as a monotherapy or in combination with chemoradiotherapy, represents a promising therapeutic strategy for MYC amplified G3 MB, potentially influencing future clinical trials targeting this patient population.
40229259	Dynamic ice-ocean pathways along the Transpolar Drift amplify the dispersal of Siberian matter.	The Transpolar Drift (TPD) plays a crucial role in regulating Arctic climate and ecosystems by transporting fresh water and key substances, such as terrestrial nutrients and pollutants, from the Siberian Shelf across the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic. However, year-round observations of the TPD remain scarce, creating significant knowledge gaps regarding the influence of sea ice drift and ocean surface circulation on the transport pathways of Siberian fresh water and associated matter. Using geochemical provenance tracer data collected over a complete seasonal cycle, our study reveals substantial spatiotemporal variability in the dispersal pathways of Siberian matter along the TPD. This variability reflects dynamic shifts in contributions of individual Siberian rivers as they integrate into a large-scale current system, followed by their rapid and extensive redistribution through a combination of seasonal ice-ocean exchanges and divergent ice drift. These findings emphasize the complexity of Arctic ice-ocean transport pathways and highlight the challenges of forecasting their dynamics in light of anticipated changes in sea ice extent, river discharge, and surface circulation patterns.
40229258	SPI1 activates mitochondrial unfolded response signaling to inhibit chondrocyte senescence and relieves osteoarthritis.	Chondrocyte senescence is a critical pathological hallmark of osteoarthritis (OA). Aberrant mechanical stress is considered a pivotal determinant in chondrocyte aging; however, the precise underlying mechanism remains elusive. Our findings demonstrate that SPI1 plays a significant role in counteracting chondrocyte senescence and inhibiting OA progression. SPI1 binds to the PERK promoter, thereby promoting its transcriptional activity. Importantly, PERK, rather than GCN2, facilitates eIF2α phosphorylation, activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) and impeding chondrocyte senescence. Deficiency of SPI1 in mechanical overload-induced mice leads to diminished UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation and accelerated OA progression. Intra-articular injection of adenovirus vectors overexpressing SPI1 and PERK effectively mitigates cartilage degeneration. In summary, our study elucidates the crucial regulatory role of SPI1 in the pathogenesis of chondrocyte senescence by activating UPR<sup>mt</sup> signaling through PERK, which may present a novel therapeutic target for treating OA. SPI1 alleviates the progression of OA by inhibiting mechanical stress-induced chondrocyte senescence through mitochondrial UPR signaling.
40229257	Safety and Efficacy of Anterior Cervical Corpectomy and Reconstruction With Expandable Cages for Treatment of Cervical Myelopathy-Focusing on Stand-Alone Cages: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Study DesignSystematic review and Meta-analysis.ObjectivesThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy, postoperative outcomes, and potential complications of using expandable cages in cervical spine surgery.MethodsA comprehensive search was performed across Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Embase up to May 22, 2023. Meta-analyses and subgrouping analyses were performed using "OpenMetaAnalyst" and R software to analyze efficacy outcomes and complications. The assessment of heterogeneity utilized the i<sup>2</sup> and chi-squared tests, applying the random effect model.ResultsThirty studies were included, with 22 eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled data showed a significant improvement in the Cobb angle, Nurick's score and modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score. The pooled stability rate post-surgery was 0.94 based on 7 studies, but the stand-alone cages showed a lower stability rate (0.83). Fusion rate showed high success at 0.94 across 14 studies but also the fusion rate in the stand-alone group was lower (0.89) with substantial heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 91.81%) suggests that stand-alone cages may not consistently achieve the same level of fusion as cages with anterior plating (fusion rate of 0.98, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Dysphagia was observed in 16% of patients, and hardware-related issues were reported in 9% of cases.Conclusionsexpandable cages offer significant advantages in terms of fusion, stability, and neurological recovery. In particular, stand-alone expandable cages were associated with higher rates of complications, including dysphagia, subsidence, and hardware failure, compared to cages with anterior plating.
40229256	The Association Between Midpregnancy Food Intake Timing Patterns and Gestational Weight Gain.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> This article aims to characterize midpregnancy food timing profiles and examine their association with gestational weight gain (GWG). <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> This secondary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial of two gestational diabetes screening approaches included 641 individuals with primary exposures and outcomes data. Food timing indicators (i.e., first and last eating episode time, caloric midpoint time, and the total eating window) were assessed using two 24-hour dietary recalls conducted in midpregnancy. Latent profile analysis was used to identify distinct food timing profiles based on these indicators. Regression analyses explored the associations between individual food intake timing indicators, food timing profiles, and GWG. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We identified four food timing profiles: extended window eating (<i>n</i> = 133; earliest first eating episode and the longest eating window), restricted window eating (<i>n</i> = 120; latest first eating episode and shortest eating window), early eating (<i>n</i> = 188; earliest caloric midpoint), and typical eating (<i>n</i> = 200; food intake aligning with the sample median). Participants with a restricted window eating profile (vs. typical eating profile) had an increased risk of insufficient GWG (unadjusted relative risk [RR] = 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12, 3.05). Each hour increase in the timing of the last eating episode was associated with 0.39 kg (0.03, 0.75) higher GWG. Both associations were attenuated in adjusted models and no longer statistically significant in adjusted models. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> We identified four distinct midpregnancy food timing profiles, but these profiles were not independently associated with GWG. These findings suggest that midpregnancy food timing may not play a major role in GWG.
40229255	Simulated Gastrointestinal Digestion Enhances the Immunomodulatory Activity of Ovalbumin Peptide NVMEERKIK: Mechanistic Insights into TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB Signaling Modulation.	NVMEERKIK, a peptide derived from ovalbumin, exhibited remarkable immunomodulatory activity. This study investigated the effect of simulated gastrointestinal digestion on its structure and bioactivity. NVMEERKIK was found to be unstable against gastrointestinal enzymes and completely degraded into NVME, NVMEE, KIK, K, and R. Among these, NVME, which constituted 90.90% of the digest, was synthesized and demonstrated a superior immune-enhancing activity than NVMEERKIK. Specifically, NVME improved phagocytosis, NO production, and TNF-α content in RAW264.7 cells by 1.31-15.86%, 17.17-122.08%, and 0.36-16.76%, respectively. TLR4 inhibition and immunofluorescence assays revealed the strong TLR4 activation and recognition capacities of both peptides. Furthermore, the Western blot results showed that NVMEERKIK and NVME activated the MAPK/NF-κB pathway by upregulating ERK, JNK, p38, and p65, leading to enhanced activation of RAW264.7 cells. The improved immune-enhancing activity of NVMEERKIK after digestion highlighted its potential as an immunomodulatory peptide for functional food applications.
40229254	Parallel comparison of T cell and B cell subpopulations of adenoid hypertrophy and tonsil hypertrophy of children.	The adenoids and tonsils are important immune organs of the nasopharynx that often become hypertrophic in childhood because of recurrent pathogen infection. However, the differences in the immune microenvironment of adenoid hypertrophy (AH) and tonsil hypertrophy (TH) are unclear. Here, we show the epidemiological characteristics and peripheral blood cell indices of 1209 pediatric patients (1-15 years old) diagnosed with AH, and find that AH is often accompanied by TH and characterized by specific changes in immune cell types. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis show that 12 paired AH and TH samples contain large numbers of B, T cells and some exhausted effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Compared with matched TH, AH have more naïve B cells and regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and less plasma B cells. Weaker antigen presentation and more significant immunosuppression are also observed in AH. In contrast, the number and cytotoxicity of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells decrease with AH grade. These findings will help our understanding of the immune response to nasopharyngeal infection.
40229253	GERDA: The German Election Database.	Elections are the key mechanism through which voters hold elected officials accountable. The partisan composition of local, state, and federal governments, in turn, shapes policy choices and public goods provision. Yet studying representation, government responsiveness, and partisan politics across multiple levels of government-especially at the local level-has been difficult due to inconsistently reported, incomplete, or insufficiently harmonized election data at small geographic scales. This paper introduces GERDA ( https://www.german-elections.com/ ), a panel dataset of local, state, and federal election results in Germany at the municipality level spanning the past three decades. GERDA includes turnout and vote shares for all major parties and resolves challenges arising from municipal boundary changes and joint mail-in voting districts, yielding a consistent panel of municipalities in their 2021 boundaries. We also provide municipal and county boundary shapefiles to facilitate spatial analyses. Our dataset enables new research on partisan politics, policy responsiveness, and political representation at fine-grained geographic scales and over time.
40229252	Peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70 confers drug resistance in colorectal cancer.	Metabolic reprogramming is a key contributor to cancer therapeutic resistance. Peroxisomes are highly metabolic organelles essential for lipid metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) turnover. Recent studies pointed out that targeting peroxisomal genes could be a promising strategy for treating therapy-resistant cells. However, the role of peroxisomes in CRC chemoresistance remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the function of peroxisomes in CRC chemoresistance and uncover the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that the protein level of peroxisome marker PMP70 was strongly correlated with oxaliplatin (LOHP)-treated tumor recurrence in CRC. LOHP was confirmed to induce pexophagy in CRC cells, whereas LOHP-resistant cells maintained stable peroxisome levels and resisted this selective autophagy. Moreover, depletion of PMP70 significantly reduced the viability of resistant CRC cells in response to LOHP, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PMP70 acted as a potential protector against excessive lipid peroxidation (LPO) in PMP70<sup>High</sup> and LOHP-resistant CRC cells. Additionally, PMP70-depleted cells exhibited an altered metabolic profile, characterized by reduced neutral lipids, fewer lipid droplets (LDs), and cell cycle arrest, indicating that PMP70 downregulation resulted in metabolic impairment. In conclusion, our study unveiled the pivotal role of PMP70-mediated peroxisomal functions in conferring chemoresistance, particularly in the context of LOHP resistance in CRC.
40229250	A genetically informed brain atlas for enhancing brain imaging genomics.	Brain imaging genomics has manifested considerable potential in illuminating the genetic determinants of human brain structure and function. This has propelled us to develop the GIANT (Genetically Informed brAiN aTlas) that accounts for genetic and neuroanatomical variations simultaneously. Integrating voxel-wise heritability and spatial proximity, GIANT clusters brain voxels into genetically informed regions, while retaining fundamental anatomical knowledge. Compared to conventional (non-genetics) brain atlases, GIANT exhibits smaller intra-region variations and larger inter-region variations in terms of voxel-wise heritability. As a result, GIANT yields increased regional SNP heritability, enhanced polygenicity, and its polygenic risk score explains more brain volumetric variation than traditional neuroanatomical brain atlases. We provide extensive validation to GIANT and demonstrate its neuroanatomical validity, confirming its generalizability across populations with diverse genetic ancestries and various brain conditions. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive genetic architecture of the GIANT regions, covering their functional annotation at the molecular levels, their associations with other complex traits/diseases, and the genetic and phenotypic correlations among GIANT-defined imaging endophenotypes. In summary, GIANT constitutes a brain atlas that captures the complexity of genetic and neuroanatomical heterogeneity, thereby enhancing the discovery power and applicability of imaging genomics investigations in biomedical science.
40229249	Navigation-grade interferometric air-core antiresonant fibre optic gyroscope with enhanced thermal stability.	We present a groundbreaking navigation-grade interferometric air-core fibre optic gyroscope (IFOG) using a quadrupolar-wound coil of four-tube truncated double nested antiresonant nodeless fibre (tDNANF). This state-of-the-art tDNANF simultaneously achieves low loss, low bend loss, single-spatial-mode operation, and exceptional linear polarization purity over a broad wavelength range. Our 469 m tDNANF coil demonstrated a polarization extinction ratio (PER) of ~20 dB when illuminated by an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source spanning 1525-1565 nm. Under these conditions, the gyro archives an angular random walk (ARW) of 0.00383 deg h<sup>-1/2</sup> and a bias instability (BI) drift of 0.0017 deg h<sup>-1</sup>, marking the first instance of navigation-grade performance in air-core FOGs. Additionally, we validated the low thermal sensitivity of air-core FOGs, with reductions of 9.24/10.68/6.82 compared to that of conventional polarization-maintaining solid-core FOGs of the same size across various temperature ranges. These results represent a significant step towards long-standing promise of high-precision inertial navigation applications with superior environmental adaptability.
40229248	DIA-BERT: pre-trained end-to-end transformer models for enhanced DIA proteomics data analysis.	Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) has become increasingly pivotal in quantitative proteomics. In this study, we present DIA-BERT, a software tool that harnesses a transformer-based pre-trained artificial intelligence (AI) model for analyzing DIA proteomics data. The identification model was trained using over 276 million high-quality peptide precursors extracted from existing DIA-MS files, while the quantification model was trained on 34 million peptide precursors from synthetic DIA-MS files. When compared to DIA-NN, DIA-BERT demonstrated a 51% increase in protein identifications and 22% more peptide precursors on average across five human cancer sample sets (cervical cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, myosarcoma, gallbladder cancer, and gastric carcinoma), achieving high quantitative accuracy. This study underscores the potential of leveraging pre-trained models and synthetic datasets to enhance the analysis of DIA proteomics.
40229247	A targetable antioxidant defense mechanism to EZH2 inhibitors enhances tumor cell vulnerability to ferroptosis.	Epigenetic changes are present in all human cancers and are responsible for switching on or off genes, thus controlling tumor cell transcriptome. These changes occur through DNA methylation, histone modifiers and readers, chromatin remodelers, and microRNAs. The histone H3 methyl-transferase EZH2 gene is overexpressed in several cancer types, including adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), a rare cancer still lacking a targeted therapy. EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i) have been tested in several clinical trials, but their effectiveness was limited by the toxic effects of the therapeutic doses. We tested several EZH2i on ACC cells, and observed a significant reduction in cell growth only with doses much higher than those required to prevent H3 methylation. We found that all tested EZH2i doses affected lipid metabolism genes, ROS, and glutathione production. Transcript changes correlated with metabolic data, which suggested the effects of EZH2i on ferroptosis. We found that EZH2i dose-dependently increased SLC7A11/glutathione axis and glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), required to counteract lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. A GPX4 inhibitor synergized with EZH2i, making low doses - which otherwise do not affect cell viability - able to significantly reduce ACC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we found that the anti-ferroptosis defense mechanism induced by EZH2i is a common response for several aggressive tumor phenotypes, uncovering a general co-targetable mechanism that could limit EZH2i effectiveness. Correcting this antioxidant response by ferroptosis inducers may be a new combination therapy that will easily find clinical applications.
40229246	Drugit: crowd-sourcing molecular design of non-peptidic VHL binders.	Building on the role of human intuition in small molecule drug design, we explored whether crowdsourcing could recruit citizen scientists to this task while in parallel building awareness for this scientific process. Here, we introduce Drugit ( https://drugit.org ), the small molecule design mode of the online citizen science game Foldit. We demonstrate its utility by identifying distinct binders to the von Hippel Lindau E3 ligase. Several thousand molecules were suggested by players in a series of ten puzzle rounds. The proposed molecules were further evaluated in silico and manually by an expert panel. Selected candidates were synthesized and tested. One of these molecules shows dose-dependent shift perturbations in protein-observed NMR experiments. The co-crystal structure in complex with the E3 ligase reveals that the observed binding mode matches the player's original idea. The completion of one full design cycle is a proof of concept for the Drugit approach and highlights the potential of involving citizen scientists in early drug discovery.
40229245	Inflammation and cancer cell survival: TRAF2 as a key player.	TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) plays a crucial role in both physiological and pathological processes. It takes part in the regulation of cell survival and death, tissue regeneration, development, endoplasmic reticulum stress response, autophagy, homeostasis of the epithelial barrier and regulation of adaptive and innate immunity. Initially identified for its interaction with TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), TRAF2 contains a TRAF domain that enables homo- and hetero-oligomerization, allowing it to interact with multiple receptors and signaling molecules. While best known for mediating TNFR1 and TNFR2 signaling, TRAF2 also modulates other receptor pathways, including MAPK, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin cascades. By regulating NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), TRAF2 is a key activator of the alternative NF-κB pathway, linking it to inflammatory diseases, immune dysfunction, and tumorigenesis. In the innate immune system, TRAF2 influences macrophage differentiation, activation, and survival and stimulates natural killer cell cytotoxicity. In the adaptive immune system, it represses effector B- and T-cell activity while sustaining regulatory T-cell function, thus promoting immune suppression. The lack of fine-tuning of TRAF2 activity leads to excessive NF-kB activation, driving chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. Although TRAF2 can act as a tumor suppressor, it is predominantly described as a tumor promoter, as its expression has been correlated with increased metastatic potential and poorer prognosis in several types of cancer. Targeting TRAF2 or TRAF2-dependent signaling pathways might represent a promising anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.
40229244	Preparation of oxygen-sensitive proteins for high-resolution cryoEM structure determination using blot-free vitrification.	High-quality grid preparation for single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) remains a bottleneck for routinely obtaining high-resolution structures. The issues that arise from traditional grid preparation workflows are particularly exacerbated for oxygen-sensitive proteins, including metalloproteins, whereby oxygen-induced damage and alteration of oxidation states can result in protein inactivation, denaturation, and/or aggregation. Indeed, 99% of the current structures in the EMBD were prepared aerobically and limited successes for anaerobic cryoEM grid preparation exist. Current practices for anaerobic grid preparation involve a vitrification device located in an anoxic chamber, which presents significant challenges including temperature and humidity control, optimization of freezing conditions, costs for purchase and operation, as well as accessibility. Here, we present a streamlined approach that allows for the vitrification of oxygen-sensitive proteins in reduced states using an automated blot-free grid vitrification device - the SPT Labtech chameleon. This robust workflow allows for high-resolution structure determination of dynamic, oxygen-sensitive proteins, of varying complexity and molecular weight.
40229243	Galectin-3: a novel biomarker of glycogen storage disease type III.	Glycogen storage disease type III (GSDIII) is a rare genetic disorder leading to abnormal glycogen storage in the liver and skeletal muscle. In this study, we conducted a comparative gene expression analysis of several in vitro and in vivo models and identified galectin-3 as a potential biomarker of the disease. Interestingly, we also observed a significant decrease in galectin-3 expression in mice treated with an AAV gene therapy. Finally, galectin-3 expression was studied in muscle biopsies of GSDIII patients, confirming its increase in patient tissue. Beyond the identification of this novel biomarker, our study offers a new perspective for future therapeutic developments.
40229242	Phosphoinositide signaling at the cytoskeleton in the regulation of cell dynamics.	The cytoskeleton, composed of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules, provides the structural basis for cellular functions such as motility and adhesion. Equally crucial, phosphoinositide (PIP<sub>n</sub>) signaling is a critical regulator of these processes and other biological activities, though its precise impact on cytoskeletal dynamics has yet to be systematically investigated. This review explores the complex interplay between PIP<sub>n</sub> signaling and the cytoskeleton, detailing how PIP<sub>n</sub> modulates the dynamics of actin, intermediate filaments, and microtubules to shape cellular behavior. Dysregulation of PIP<sub>n</sub> signaling is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, highlighting promising therapeutic opportunities through targeted modulation of these pathways. Future research should aim to elucidate the intricate molecular interactions and broader cellular responses to PIP<sub>n</sub> signaling perturbations, particularly in disease contexts, to devise effective strategies for restoring cytoskeletal integrity.
40229241	Combination radiation and αPD-L1 enhance tumor control by stimulating CD8+ PD-1+ TCF-1+ T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node.	Combination radiotherapy (RT) and αPD-L1 therapy has potential to enhance local and distant (abscopal) tumor control, however, clinical results in humans have been variable. Using murine melanoma models, we found RT + αPD-L1 increases intra-tumor progenitor CD8+ PD-1+ TCF-1+ T cells. This increase depends on trafficking of the PD-1+ TCF-1+ cells from the tumor-draining lymph node (TdLN) to the tumor. RT alone promotes the expansion and differentiation of the TdLN derived PD-1+ TCF-1+ cells into TIM-3+ GZMB+ TCF-1- effector-like cells in the tumor with further enhancement after the addition of αPD-L1. In the TdLN, combination therapy enriches for a novel PD-1+ TCF-1+ TOX- LY6A+ subset with expression of a type I interferon and migratory signature. This subset is able to traffic to the tumor and differentiate into TIM-3+ TCF-1- cells. Finally, we found that ablation of the PD-1+ TCF-1+ T cell population attenuates the enhanced tumor control observed with combination RT + αPD-L1. These results suggest that abscopal response failures may be secondary to impaired stimulation of TdLN CD8+ PD-1 + TCF-1+ T cells or an inability of PD-1+ TCF-1+ cells in the TdLN to traffic to the tumor.

40229238	Vesicular and non-vesicular extracellular small RNAs direct gene silencing in a plant-interacting bacterium.	Extracellular plant small RNAs (sRNAs) and/or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors act as triggers of RNAi in interacting filamentous pathogens. However, whether any of these extracellular RNA species direct gene silencing in plant-interacting bacteria remains unknown. Here, we show that Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing sRNAs directed against virulence factors of a Pseudomonas syringae strain, reduce its pathogenesis. This Antibacterial Gene Silencing (AGS) phenomenon is directed by Dicer-Like (DCL)-dependent antibacterial sRNAs, but not cognate dsRNA precursors. Three populations of active extracellular sRNAs were recovered in the apoplast of these transgenic plants. The first one is mainly non-vesicular and associated with proteins, whereas the second one is located inside Extracellular Vesicles (EVs). Intriguingly, the third population is unbound to proteins and in a dsRNA form, unraveling functional extracellular free sRNAs (efsRNAs). Both Arabidopsis transgene- and genome-derived efsRNAs were retrieved inside bacterial cells. Finally, we show that salicylic acid (SA) promotes AGS, and that a substantial set of endogenous efsRNAs exhibits predicted bacterial targets that are down-regulated by SA biogenesis and/or signaling during infection. This study thus unveils an unexpected AGS phenomenon, which may have wider implications in the understanding of how plants regulate microbial transcriptome, microbial community composition and genome evolution of associated bacteria.
40229237	Relationships between brain activity, tryptophan-related gut metabolites, and autism symptomatology.	While it has been suggested that alterations in the composition of gut microbial metabolites may play a causative role in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is not known how gut microbial metabolites are associated with ASD-specific brain alterations. In this cross-sectional, case-control observational study, (i) fecal metabolomics, (ii) task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and (iii) behavioral assessments were obtained from 43 ASD and 41 neurotypical (NT) children, aged 8-17. The fMRI tasks used socio-emotional and sensory paradigms that commonly reveal strong evoked brain differences in ASD participants. Our results show that fecal levels of specific tryptophan-related metabolites, including kynurenate, were significantly lower in ASD compared to NT, and were associated with: 1) alterations in insular and cingulate cortical activity previously implicated in ASD; and 2) ASD severity and symptoms (e.g., ADOS scores, disgust propensity, and sensory sensitivities). Moreover, activity in the mid-insula and mid-cingulate significantly mediated relationships between the microbial tryptophan metabolites (indolelactate and tryptophan betaine) and ASD severity and disgust sensitivity. Thus, we identify associations between gut microbial tryptophan metabolites, ASD symptoms, and brain activity in humans, particularly in brain regions associated with interoceptive processing.
40229236	Bioenergetic biomarkers as predictive indicators and their relationship with cognitive function in newly diagnosed, drug-naïve patients with bipolar disorder.	Mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted bioenergetic processes are critical in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BD), with cognitive impairment being a prominent symptom linked to mitochondrial anomalies. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, integral to mitochondrial energy production, may be implicated in this cognitive dysfunction, yet its specific association with BD remains underexplored. In this cross-sectional study, 144 first-episode, drug-naive BD patients and 51 healthy controls were assessed. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), serum TCA cycle metabolites were quantified, and cognitive function was evaluated through the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and the Stroop color-word test. The study found that BD patients exhibited significantly elevated serum levels of several TCA metabolites compared to healthy controls, alongside lower cognitive function scores. Correlational analyses revealed that certain bioenergetic metabolites were significantly positively associated with anxiety and negatively correlated with cognitive performance in BD patients. Notably, succinic acid, α-Ketoglutaric acid (α-KG), and malic acid emerged as independent risk factors for BD, with their combined profile demonstrating diagnostic utility. These findings underscore the potential of serum bioenergetic metabolites as biomarkers for BD, providing insights into the mitochondrial dysfunction underlying cognitive impairment and offering a basis for early diagnosis and targeted therapeutic strategies.
40229235	Semirational Design and Immobilization Synergistically Enhance Barnase Activity and Stability.	Barnase, derived from <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i>, is a key enzyme in biocatalysis with widespread applications in pharmaceutical synthesis. However, its stability under extreme conditions, such as high temperatures and extreme pH, limits its industrial applications. Therefore, enhancing both its catalytic efficiency and stability through genetic engineering has become a critical focus of research. In this study, AlphaFold was employed to predict the structure of Barnase, followed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to design and construct 24 mutants. The results demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of the S28H and D101 K mutants increased by 75.28% and 71.86%, respectively, while the stability of D101 K declined under high temperatures. To address this, D101 K was immobilized onto a ZIF-8 carrier. Under optimized immobilization conditions (1.5 M 2-methylimidazole, 1.5 mL enzyme solution, 20 °C), ZIF-8@D101 K exhibited significantly enhanced thermal stability and pH adaptability. Recycling experiments showed that 96.21% of its activity was retained after three cycles, and 72.47% after eight cycles, demonstrating superior reusability and stability, making it more suitable for industrial applications.
40229233	Total Synthesis of Kanamycins.	Structurally-modified aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, have shown promise as antibiotics and premature termination codon read-through drugs to fight against drug-resistant bacteria and to treat genetic diseases, respectively. Therefore, research on developing and discovering aminoglycoside antibiotics has recently increased. However, synthetic strategies for controllably positioning the two 1,2-cis-glycoside moieties on the symmetrical structure of kanamycin have not yet been established. Herein, we report on a novel route for the total synthesis of kanamycins A and B via regio- and stereo-selective introduction of 1,2-cis-glycosidic linkages as the key step. We successfully synthesized α(1,6)-linked glycoside using a 1,2-anhydro donor and 2-deoxy-myo-inositol 1,3,5-orthoformate acceptor in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst via desymmetric boron-mediated aglycon delivery. In addition, we also synthesized α(1,4)-linked glycoside using its corresponding trichloroacetimidate donor.
40229232	Identification of a Novel Second-Generation HIV-1 Circulating Recombinant Form (CRF174_0708) Arising from CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC in Yunnan, China.	Extraordinary HIV-1 recombination is occurring in China. Here, a novel second-generation circulating recombinant form (CRF174_0708) was found in Yunnan Province, China. First, Bootscanning revealed a mosaic structure with three subtype B segments inserted into a subtype C backbone. However, phylogenetic analysis showed that subregions 2B (2978-3267) and 4B (6023-6196) were related to CRF07_BC, whereas subregion 6B (8846-8997) was related to CRF08_BC, suggesting that the sequences could be recombined from CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC. Furthermore, Bootscanning-guided partitioning with subregion-specific phylogenetic analysis confirmed that subregions I (790-1902), III (2636-3746), V (4327-5825), VII (6023-6196) and IX (6379-6782) from CRF07_BC, and subregions II (1903-2635), IV (3747-4326), VI (5826-6022), VIII (6197-6378) and XI (7463-9512) from CRF08_BC. Bayesian dating traced the emergence to 2005-2007, consistent with the expansion of the parental strains. This discovery advanced our understanding of HIV-1 evolution.
40229231	Vinyl-Functionalized Linear Alkyl Chains in Non-fullerene Acceptors Enable 19.2% Efficiency and Stable As-Cast Organic Solar Cells.	Developing efficient and stable as-cast organic solar cells (OSCs) is imperative for alleviating costs and complexity for large-scale commercial applications. Nevertheless, achieving the desired double-fibril morphology of active layer through single-step processing is challenging. Herein, two non-fullerene acceptors, namely BTP-N6 and BTP-V6, are designed and synthesized to construct as-cast OSCs by introducing linear alkyl chains adjacent to the pyrrole moiety. The reduction of steric hindrance attributable to linear chains engenders diminished dihedral angles of molecular skeletons, thereby promoting compact and face-on oriented molecular stacking. Moreover, BTP-V6 featuring vinyl-functionalized linear chains manifests additional interaction sites with neighboring molecules to instigate enhanced π-π stacking during rapid film-formation process, and engenders the formation of a refined double-fibril network morphology, which facilitates exciton dissociation, bolsters charge carrier transport, and suppresses recombination loss. Consequently, the D18:BTP-V6 based device attained a record-shattering efficiency of 19.2% with a high fill factor (FF) of 80.7%, and also demonstrated robust thermal and shelf stability. Moreover, the meticulously optimized layer-by-layer (LBL) structured devices achieved an excellent efficiency up to 20.1%. This study introduces a viable strategy for alkyl chain modification to fabricate efficient and stable as-cast devices, with the anticipation of expediting the progression toward widespread commercialization of OSCs.
40229230	Molecular evidence of Wolbachia and Orthoflavivirus infection in field-collected mosquitoes in three provinces of Türkiye.	Mosquitoes transmit various pathogens causing diseases like Zika, Dengue, West Nile and Chikungunya. They also harbour insect-specific viruses (ISVs) and Wolbachia, which can block arbovirus transmission. This study investigated the prevalence of Orthoflavivirus and Wolbachia in mosquito populations from three provinces in Türkiye.
40229229	One novel C22-diterpenoid alkaloid from of Dendrobium huoshanense and its primary in vitro bioactive evaluation as well as the molecular dynamics simulations.	One previously undescribed C22-diterpenoid alkaloid (DHS-DA-1) was isolated from Dendrobium huoshanense C. Z. Tang et S. J. Cheng. The structure of the new alkaloid was elucidated using extensive spectroscopic analyses and NMR calculations. Griess reaction results showed that the new compound could reduce the creation of NO in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, and the ELISA experiments suggested that DHS-DA-1 could efficaciously decreased LPS-induced inflammation by inhibiting TNF-α and IL-6 expressions. In addition, DHS-DA-1 could effectively inhibit the survival and proliferation of AGS cells and promote their apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. The stability and feasibility of binding the DHS-DA-1 to the target protein are further verified by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation validation. In addition, DHS-DA-1 exhibits favorable ADMET properties.
40229228	Sequence Notes: Identification of Two New CRF01_AE/CRF07_BC Recombinants in Men Who Have Sex with Men Populations in Beijing, China.	Since HIV-1 is a retrovirus with a high mutation rate and recombination rate, the virus contains a variety of genotypes and recombinants. The men who have sex with men (MSM) population in Beijing has become the main group of HIV transmission, and the co-transmission of multiple HIV-1 subtypes in the same high-risk group has led to the continuous generation of recombinants between various subtypes. In this study, two unique recombinant forms were identified in the samples from Beijing, and the full-length sequences were amplified and sequenced for analysis. Through the construction of phylogenetic trees and recombination breakpoint analysis, the two recombinants were identified as second-generation recombinants composed of CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC. The emergence of more complex recombinant strains poses new challenges to HIV prevention, and it is necessary to focus on monitoring the epidemic in the MSM population.

40229226	Chemical Diversity and Bioactive Compound Profiling of Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess. Morphotypes.	Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess. is a native Brazilian tree rich in bioactive compounds, such as coumarins, xanthones, and chromanones. This study investigated the chemical composition of four morphotypes of the species using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). FTIR revealed functional groups related to phenolic compounds and allowed the chemical distinction among the morphotypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)  classified the samples into two distinct  groups, while principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the first component (PC1) explained 96% of the variation. Spectral regions between 3500-3100 cm⁻¹, 1050 cm⁻¹, and 870 cm⁻¹ were crucial for differentiation. ESI-MS identified compounds such as mammea, jacareubin, and inophyllum, highlighting chemical differences among the morphotypes. These results reinforce the potential of C. brasiliense as a source of phenolic compounds and emphasize the chemical variations among its morphotypes, which may help in exploring bioactive properties and future applications in pharmacology.
40229225	Water-in-acid Strategy for Corrosion-Free Proton Storage: Phosphoric Acid Electrolyte Engineering Toward Sustainable Aqueous Batteries.	Aqueous proton batteries, leveraging the intrinsic advantages of protons such as minimal hydrated radius, natural abundance, and rapid transport kinetics, have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation energy storage. However, conventional strong acid electrolytes like H2SO4 suffer from critical limitations including electrode dissolution and incompatibility with battery components. To circumvent these challenges, weak acids (e.g., HCOOH and H3PO4) have been strategically selected as alternative electrolytes due to their non-corrosive characteristics. Particularly, the implementation of a high-concentration "water-in-acid" (WIA) effectively suppresses undesirable interactions between electrode materials and free water molecules. Through electrolyte engineering, we developed a 9.5 M H3PO4 WIA system that synergizes with a molybdenum trioxide electrode, achieving remarkable electrochemical performance: a high reversible capacity of 229.8 mAh g-1 at 3 A g-1 and exceptional cycling stability with 83.86% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles at 5 A g-1, surpassing conventional H2SO4-based systems by both capacity and cyclability. This innovative approach establishes a new paradigm for developing high-performance aqueous energy storage systems through acid-dominated electrolyte design.
40229224	Death from <i>S. pneumoniae</i> in HbSC Disease: Was Expanded Pneumococcal Vaccination Too Late?	Despite proven efficacy, only 70% of eligible individuals in the U.S. are vaccinated against <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>. This is especially concerning for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), as they are susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease owing to functional asplenia. Early and complete vaccination is crucial in preventing pneumococcal sepsis and its complications, including the rare but often fatal fat embolism syndrome. Here, we report a case of an adolescent male with Hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease who presented to our pediatric emergency department (ED) with abdominal and back pain. Notably he had received all vaccinations according to published guidelines, however had not yet received the expanded pneumococcal vaccine. He was in his usual state of health the previous day. He arrived to the ED mildly febrile, tachypneic, and tachycardic with altered mental status. His condition rapidly deteriorated into acute respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Unfortunately, he succumbed following multiple cardiac arrests less than 12 hours into his illness course. This case highlights to pediatric and adolescent providers that invasive pneumococcal disease remains a significant risk for vaccinated, adolescent patients, even with mild SCD genotypes. Moreover, it underscores the critical importance of early, complete pneumococcal vaccination in SCD patients. The newer expanded pneumococcal vaccines could enhance protection for this vulnerable population.
40229223	Parent, Unsubstituted Corrphycene: Synthesis and Properties.	We report the synthesis of a porphyrin isomer that, until now, has only been obtained in the form of multiply substituted derivatives. Structural, spectral, and electrochemical characteristics of unsubstituted corrphycene (Cp) are described along with the data for its precursor, 11,18-di-tert-butylcorrphycene. Similar to porphine, Cp turns out to be a soft chromophore, characterized by very similar energy splittings between the pairs of frontier HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Magnetic circular dichroism spectra indicate that the splitting in the HOMO orbitals is larger than in the LUMO, opposite to the DFT predictions. Corrphycene exists in the form of a doubly degenerated trans tautomeric species. The two intramolecular H-bonds are not equivalent, which strongly suggests a stepwise mechanism of trans-trans conversion. Being a nearly perfect soft chromophore, Cp emerges as an attractive candidate for sensing changes in its environment.
40229222	Synthesis of Vacancy-Rich NiTe<sub><i>x</i></sub>-NC Catalyst under Mild Conditions for High-Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries.	Due to the slow conversion kinetics of polysulfides, the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries faces significant challenges. Transition metal tellurides exhibit good catalytic activity and are expected to help mitigate the shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur batteries. Vacancies, as a form of defect, can further enhance the conductivity and catalytic activity of the catalysts. However, most vacancy creation is achieved by the action of strong reducing agents (such as H<sub>2</sub>, NaBH<sub>4</sub>, hydrazine, etc.). Here, we utilized the similarity in lattice parameters between NiTe and NiTe<sub>2</sub> to adjust the extent of lattice contraction in NiTe<sub>2</sub> by controlling the Te powder content, ultimately obtaining a Te-vacancy-rich NiTe<sub><i>x</i></sub>-NC catalyst under mild conditions. The unsaturated coordination between Ni and Te provides abundant active sites for the chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides, thus allowing NiTe<sub><i>x</i></sub>-NC to significantly lower the reaction energy barrier of polysulfides and effectively inhibit the shuttle effect. The results show that NiTe<sub><i>x</i></sub>-NC can achieve a specific capacity of 589.4 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at a rate of 7 C, and after 1000 cycles at 2 C, the capacity decay per cycle is only 0.0278%. Even under complex conditions (with a sulfur loading of 7.5 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> and a liquid sulfur ratio of 10 μL mg<sup>-1</sup>), it still maintains good cycling stability.
40229220	Excellent Fe(II) Binding Tag in Protein Paramagnetic NMR Spectroscopy.	Most first series of transition metal ions have one or more unpaired electrons and show great variations in the paramagnetic property. The magnetic anisotropy of some transition metal ions, including Co(II), as well as lanthanide ions [Ln(III)], has been well examined in proteins by NMR. In contrast, few examples of Fe(II) complexes reporting the magnetic anisotropy were analyzed in proteins, except for the ones containing a heme motif or iron-sulfur clusters. Here, we showed that [2,2':6',2″-terpyridine]-6,6″-dicarboxylic acid (TDA) is an excellent iron-binding ligand. It forms a stable iron complex in aqueous solution and demonstrates distinct iron-binding properties. TDA forms a 1:1 stable complex with both Fe(II) and Fe(III), but Fe(II) presents a high-spin state in the complex. The TDA moiety can be site-specifically attached to a protein, and its protein conjugate generates sizable pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) in complex with Fe(II), which are larger than those of commonly used metal binding tags. In contrast, the protein-TDA-Fe(III) complex produces negligible paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) effects in the protein signals, indicating a low-spin state of Fe(III) in the protein-TDA complex. The high stability of the protein-TDA-Fe(II) complex allows one to measure accurate PCSs in cell lysate even in the presence of other transition metal ions and an excess of GSH.
40229219	The Synthesis of a Naloxone-Related Oxidative Drug Product Degradant.	Naloxone is a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist used to reverse the effects of opiate-related overdose. Studies aimed toward identifying naloxone degradants present in a buprenorphine/naloxone combination drug product revealed several compounds whose structures could not be confirmed by comparison to authentic samples. We report herein the confirmation of the structural assignment of one of these compounds (so-called, "Degradant E") by chemical synthesis starting from naloxone. Key features of the developed route include the conversion of the <i>N</i>-allyl group to the corresponding Boc carbamate as a means of facilitating the chemoselective oxidative cleavage of the C6-C7 bond. In addition, the use of a pivalate ester derivative of naloxone's phenol group offered a convenient means of isolating Degradant E as the corresponding HCl salt using an acid-promoted global ester hydrolysis in the final step.
40229218	Rheocarna treatment for non-dialysis patients.	Rheocarna has attracted attention as an alternative therapy for severe chronic limb-threatening ischemia, and there have been reports of its usefulness. However, most of these reports have been on dialysis patients, and there are few reports on the treatment conditions and efficacy in non-dialysis patients.
40229217	Acidic CO2 Electrolysis with Near-Ideal Selectivity and Carbon Efficiency Enabled by Overcoming Its Inherent Trade-Off.	Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2R) in acid tends to be a promising route to avoid CO2 loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes; however, high alkali cation concentrations (typically ≥3 M) are required to activate CO2 and suppress water electroreduction, causing carbonate formation and thus unsatisfied single-pass carbon efficiency (SPCE). Based on theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that an inherent trade-off exists: increasing cation concentrations improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward CO2R products but comes at the expense of reduced SPCE. We demonstrate a polyimide-modification strategy to overcome this trade-off by taking advantage of the amino groups that can effectively capture protons, creating local alkaline microenvironment surrounding the electrode surface. In a proof-of-concept experiment, SnO2 nanoparticles were modified with polyimide and acted as a CO2R catalyst, which achieved, simultaneously, near-ideal SPCE of 95.7% and FE of 96% (toward HCOOH) at pH 1.36 with dilute potassium ions down to even 0.1 M. We expect that these findings will accelerate the development of carbon- and electron-efficient acidic CO2 electrolysis.
40229216	Emission Dynamics and Public Health Implications of Airborne Pathogens and Antimicrobial Resistance from Urban Waste Collection Facilities.	Airborne pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) present significant global health threats. Household waste collection facilities (WCFs), crucial initial nodes in urban waste management systems, have been understudied in regards to their role in emitting these hazards. This study investigated the abundance, composition, sources, driving mechanisms, and health risks associated with pathogens and AMR originating from WCFs in a major city, using culture-based analysis, high-throughput sequencing, and health risk modeling, respectively. The atmospheric escape rates of culturable bacteria (43.4%), fungi (71.7%), and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) (43.7%) were estimated based on the concentration differences between the interior and exterior of the WCFs by using SourceTracker2 analysis. Health risk assessments showed that annual infection risks for waste-handling workers ranged from 0.194 to 0.489, far exceeding the World Health Organization's acceptable limit of 10<sup>-4</sup>. Community exposure risks were notable up to 220 m downwind from WCFs, marking the maximum extent of pathogen dispersion. Our analysis suggests that approximately 6.3% of the megacity's area (equivalent to 400 km<sup>2</sup>) is within potential risk zones influenced by WCF emissions. These results underscore the critical need to evaluate and mitigate the public health risks posed by airborne pathogens and AMR emitted from WCFs in megacities globally.
40229215	Coalescence-Driven Local Crowding Promotes Liquid-to-Solid-Like Phase Transition in a Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Droplet Assembly: Regulatory Role of Ligands.	Liquid-to-solid-like phase transition (LSPT) of disordered proteins via metastable liquid-like droplets is a well-documented phenomenon in biology and is linked to many pathological conditions including neurodegenerative diseases. However, very less is known about the early microscopic events and transient intermediates involved in the irreversible protein aggregation of functional globular proteins. Herein, using a range of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, we show that the LSPT of a functional globular protein, human serum albumin (HSA), is exclusively driven by spontaneous coalescence of liquid-like droplets involving various transient intermediates in a temporal manner. We show that interdroplet communication via coalescence is essential for both initial aggregation and growth of amorphous aggregates within individual droplets, which subsequently transform to amyloid-like fibrils. Immobilized droplets neither show any nucleation nor any growth upon aging. Moreover, we found that the exchange of materials with the dilute dispersed phase has negligible influence on the LSPT of HSA. Our findings reveal that interfacial properties effectively modulate the feasibility and kinetics of LSPT of HSA via ligand binding, suggesting a possible regulatory mechanism that cells utilize to control the dynamics of LSPT. Furthermore, using a dynamic heterogeneous droplet assembly of two functional proteins, HSA and human serum transferrin (Tf), we show an intriguing phenomenon within the fused droplets where both liquid-like and solid-like phases coexist within the same droplet, which eventually transform to a mixed fibrillar assembly. These microscopic insights not only highlight the importance of interdroplet interactions behind the LSPT of biomolecules but also showcase its adverse effect on the structure and function of other functional proteins in a crowded and heterogeneous protein assembly.
40229213	Metagenomic source tracking after microbiota transplant therapy.	Reliable engraftment assessment of donor microbial communities and individual strains is an essential component of characterizing the pharmacokinetics of microbiota transplant therapies (MTTs). Recent methods for measuring donor engraftment use whole-genome sequencing and reference databases or metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to track individual bacterial strains but lack the ability to disambiguate DNA that matches both donor and patient microbiota. Here, we describe a new, cost-efficient analytic pipeline, MAGEnTa, which compares post-MTT samples to a database comprised MAGs derived directly from donor and pre-treatment metagenomic data, without relying on an external database. The pipeline uses Bayesian statistics to determine the likely sources of ambiguous reads that align with both the donor and pre-treatment samples. MAGEnTa recovers engrafted strains with minimal type II error in a simulated dataset and is robust to shallow sequencing depths in a downsampled dataset. Applying MAGEnTa to a dataset from a recent MTT clinical trial for ulcerative colitis, we found the results to be consistent with 16S rRNA gene SourceTracker analysis but with added MAG-level specificity. MAGEnTa is a powerful tool to study community and strain engraftment dynamics in the development of MTT-based treatments that can be integrated into frameworks for functional and taxonomic analysis.
40229212	Metallic Dendrites: How Far Can We Go?	Metallic dendrites, novel hierarchical nanostructures with a distinctive fern- or tree-like appearance, introduce a new era in sensing and wearable technologies. They possess several properties, including high surface area, crystal defects, grain boundaries, and edge sites, all of which contribute to an increased number of catalytic sites for sensing and wearable platforms, as well as functionalization sites for antibodies and drug molecules' adhesion. The aforementioned characteristics endow them with superior conductivity and enhanced catalytic activity, thereby facilitating improved mass and charge transfer rates of analytes in catalytic platforms. Since their discovery, there has been substantial progress in their synthesis, nanoengineering with composites, and extensive analytical applications in diverse domains, such as sensor platforms and wearables, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and drug delivery. Although platforms based on dendrites have performed well over the past ten years, their commercialization has yet to take place for a variety of reasons, primarily being the challenge to achieve homogeneity in large-scale synthesis due to uncontrolled development. Besides this, other challenges include transitioning to non-noble metals while still maintaining high activity and stability, as well as their sluggish metabolism <i>in vivo</i> following drug delivery and poor excretion by the body, which collectively hinder their translation. This Perspective encompasses important breakthroughs of metallic dendrites and analytical platforms based upon them, crucial knowledge gaps, and bottlenecks in commercialization with an eye towards the future of dendrite-based sensing, wearable electronics, as well as other such platforms.
40229211	Highly Robust 3D rGO Aerogel with Tunable Thermoelectric Effect for Multifunctional Sensing Applications.	The increasing demands for all-carbon-based flexible sensors in engineering have intensified research efforts toward multifunctional integration that responds to diverse stimuli. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide thermoelectric aerogel (rGOTEA) was created by a chemical agent-assisted bottom-up assembly with nanometer-thick rGO sheets as basic building units. Through bidirectional freeze-squeezing and reconstructing treatments, the hyperbolically patterned 3D rGOTEA exhibited lightweight density (≤5.4 mg cm<sup>-3</sup>), superelastic deformation capability (recoverable strain ≥ 90%) and remarkable fatigue resistance. By quantitative regulation of oxygen-containing groups' distribution and interfacial bonding conditions, the carrier transport and phonon scattering over the multilayered rGO sheets were decoupled to optimize rather than that of 3D graphene monoliths with intact crystal structures. Attributed to numerous graphitized domains and in-plane defects (e.g., dangling bonds and holes), the 3D rGOTEA exhibited high electrical conductivity (95.834 S m<sup>-1</sup>) yet low thermal conductivity (0.028 W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>). 3D rGOTEA demonstrated a programmable thermoelectric performance with a tunable Seebeck coefficient ranging from 6.9 to 19.5 μV/K. This tunability endowed the material with a heightened sensitivity for detecting fluctuations in external physical signals. As a result, the flexible rGOTEA device displayed multifunctional sensing responses to changes in thermal insulation, electrical conductivity, and mechanical deformation. Moreover, an rGOTEA-based thermal energy converter was assembled to deliver a maximum output of 600 μV under a temperature gradient of 2.4 K/mm. The versatility of the 3D rGOTEA suggested its promising applications as multifunctional sensors, thermal insulator, and energy harvestor.
40229210	Sacrificial Prelithiation Using Different Lithium Salt-Coated LNMO Cathodes for Stabilizing the Electrode Structure and Enhancing Battery Performance.	The cobalt-free, high-voltage spinel-type cathode LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LNMO) exhibits high energy and power densities, rendering it a promising candidate for incorporation into next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, its high operating voltage of 4.7 V can lead to electrolyte decomposition, causing structural damage. In addition, the irreversible loss of active lithium in the early cycles reduces capacity performance, hindering its commercial application. To take full advantage of the catalytic effect of LNMO and the prelithiation of sacrificial salt, this work involved blending sacrificial salts (Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and CH<sub>3</sub>COOLi) with LNMO to form prelithiated electrodes (LNMO-Sac) and investigating the influence of different sacrificial salts on the performance of LIBs. The results demonstrate that LNMO could efficiently catalyze the decomposition of sacrificial salts and promote the formation of a more stable electrode-electrolyte interface after cycling to mitigate structure destruction of electrodes caused by electrolyte decomposition. Compared with other sacrificial salts, Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> provided a highly efficient supplement of active lithium and improved the electrochemical performance of the battery. Thus, LNMO-Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> achieved an excellent discharge capacity of 137.9 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 1C, and capacity retention of 85.9% after 500 cycles, superior to that of LNMO without prelithiation. Moreover, the LNMO-LO/Gr full cell presented an initial capacity of 117.9 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and retained 79.4 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 300 cycles. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a sacrificial salt as a lithium replenishment strategy for LNMO in practical applications.
40229209	Balancing CO2 Adsorption and H2 Activation on Confined ZnOx Species for CO2 Hydrogenation.	Many oxide catalysts exhibit high selectivity but low conversion in CO2 hydrogenation due to strong CO2 adsorption, which often impedes H2 dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation. Herein, we report that a ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst featuring monodispersed ZnOx overlayer confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual-site mechanism in which ZnCr2O4 surface and/or ZnOx/ZnCr2O4 interface provide sites for CO2 activation and monodispersed ZnOx promote homolytic H2 dissociation and formation of stable metal-H species, enabling formate formation through hydrogen spillover to CO2 adsorption sites for hydrogenation at 303 K. In contrast, H2 activation on ZnO or ZnCr2O4 suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption. Consequently, the ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst shows 2 - 8 folds enhancement in CO2 hydrogenation between 623 - 773 K than ZnO and maintains 33% conversion and 100% CO selectivity at 723 K over 150 hours. The established structure-performance relationship illustrates the critical role of dual-site catalysis and hydrogen spillover in hydrogenation reaction.
40229208	Electrically Driven Biocatalysis for Sustainable CO2-to-Chemicals Transformation.	The catalytic transformation of CO2 into value-added chemicals has become a critical strategy for mitigating environmental issues and generating economic benefits. Although substantial progress has been made in renewable electricity-driven CO2 conversion into C1/C2 products, the efficient synthesis of high-value, long-chain compounds remains a significant challenge. Biosynthesis offers a feasible route for producing long-chain value-added products at mild conditions. Consequently, the integration of electrocatalysis with bioconversion has emerged as a promising approach for sustainable CO2 conversion. This short review outlines recent advances in the sustainable synthesis of long-chain compounds from CO2 via electrically driven biocatalysis, highlighting innovative coupling strategies that combine electrochemical and biochemical processes. Furthermore, the remaining challenges and prospects are tentatively discussed for further advancing CO2-based sustainable synthesis.
40229207	Pediatric Patient With Generalized Pustular Psoriasis With MEFV Gene Variant: Successful Treatment With Adalimumab.	Pediatric generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a rare, severe, and potentially life-threatening variant of childhood psoriasis. Early-onset GPP has a well-known association with deficiency of the interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (DITRA). We present a case of a pediatric patient diagnosed with GPP found to have a heterozygous variant in the Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) that was successfully treated with adalimumab. MEFV variants are a newly identified genetic risk factor for GPP. Our case highlights the need for ongoing genomic studies for childhood autoinflammatory diseases and the call for evidence-based management for these challenging cases.
40229206	Multistep Self-Assembly of the Gold-Binding Peptide AuBP1.	Solid-binding peptides have emerged as a distinct class of peptides, offering significant potential for biohybrid materials technologies due to their ability to bind selectively to a specific target material and integrate different materials with bioactive molecules and their ease of biochemical and genetic conjugation with proteins. Their vast applications span health and nonmedical applications including biocatalysis, biosensing, and agriculture, as well as sustainable engineering platforms. As these applications continue to expand, it is critical to understand the optimal performance conditions of these peptides and develop a fundamental understanding of the factors controlling their binding and surface organization that lead to self-assembled properties at the material interfaces. In this work, the self-assembly of one such peptide, AuBP1 (WAGAKRLVLRRE), was revisited through atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies conducted on a Au(111) surface to gain further insight into the assembly process. Peptide film coverage on the surface was monitored as a function of adsorption time (seconds to hours) and concentration of the peptide (1 fM to 10 μM). Our analysis reveals that initial isolated peptide binding is followed by assembly into a large-scale network of clustered peptides, slower filling of the remaining sites on the surface into a uniform film, and finally reorganization of the peptide film. Our observations suggest a multistep assembly process involving both peptide-peptide and peptide-surface interactions that cooperatively influence binding transitions. We compared noncooperative and semicooperative models, which provided additional insight into the growth phase of the peptide adsorption and assembly process. Understanding real-time binding kinetics and the boundary conditions that lead to robust self-assembled peptide films could extend the utilization of material-binding peptides into future technologies.
40229205	Staphylococcus Aureus AgrA Modulators from South African Antimicrobial Plants.	South African plants are an underutilized metabolites source for novel antimicrobials targeting key quorum sensing (QS) systems like the Staphylococcus aureus AgrA. AgrA modulating metabolites constitute a new approach to reducing resistance development. This study created a library of 1211 metabolites from 266 South African plants with antimicrobial action. Metabolites' anti-QS activities were assessed using advanced computational methods. Molecular docking showed 5 top metabolites (hinokiflavone, asphodelin, elliptinone, mamegakinone, robustaflavone). Most leads conformed to the Lipinski's rule of 5. Dynamics simulation revealed closest ∆Gbind for robustaflavone (-25.50 kcal/mol), and hinokiflavone (-20.94 kcal/mol) compared to the standard (-26.59 kcal/mol). Leads interacted with key residues (Asn62/201, Asp75/214, Arg94/233, Asn95/234) and high number of interactions that ensured thermodynamic stability and compactness. The identified leads could be key mechanistic contributors to the antimicrobial activity of their inherent plants. Both the plants and metabolites (robustaflavone, hinokiflavone) could be further explored following structural modification as QS inhibitors.
40229204	A comparative analysis of CDC and AI-generated health information using computer-aided text analysis.	AI-generated content is easy to access. Members of the public use it as an alternative or to supplement official sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the quality and reliability of AI-generated health information is questionable. This study aims to understand how AI-generated health information differs from that provided by the CDC, particularly in terms of sentiment, readability, and overall quality. Language expectancy theory serves as a framework and offers insights into how people's expectations of message content from different sources can influence perceived credibility and persuasiveness of such information.
40229203	Tau Repeats Disassemble Amyloid-β Fibrils <i>In Vitro</i> by Interacting with KLVFFA and GGVVIA Domains.	The interplay between amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein is acknowledged as a crucial factor in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the precise molecular mechanisms underlying their interaction remain elusive. In this study, we explore how the key regions within tau, specifically the repeat domains, modulate Aβ aggregation. Through microscale thermophoresis and peptide mapping assays, we identified that tau repeats containing the amyloid motifs VQIINK and VQIVYK directly interact with Aβ(1-42) and Aβ(1-40), targeting the hydrophobic regions of Aβ. Tau repeats were found to inhibit Aβ fibril formation and promote the dissociation of preformed fibrils <i>in vitro</i>. Notably, while disassembling Aβ(1-42) fibrils, tau repeats concurrently stabilized oligomeric forms. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms by which tau influences the Aβ pathology, with potential implications for AD progression.

While there is extensive research on the prevalence of tinea pedis in adults, data regarding prevalence in children are limited. Therefore, it is important to gain information about epidemiology and prevalence in pediatric patients to prevent and treat this condition in children.
40229201	Evaluation of the glottic surface dose in three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for early-stage glottic cancer using a treatment planning system.	In radiotherapy for early-stage glottic cancer, evaluating the target surface dose at the glottic air-tissue boundary is crucial, as buildup effect can cause underdosing. The accuracy of dose evaluation in the surrounding tissues is affected by both the dose calculation algorithms and the accuracy of the Hounsfield unit values in the glottic air cavities.
40229200	Electrochemistry of Azobenzenes and Its Potential for Energy Storage.	Azobenzenes are promising materials for energy storage due to their reversible photoisomerization and redox properties. Given the critical role of redox behavior in the latter application, an investigation of their redox processes is essential. We propose a classification of azobenzenes into two categories: <i>benzenoid</i>-type and <i>quinoid</i>-type, based on the mechanism of their oxidation. <i>Benzenoid</i>-type compounds have been extensively studied due to their reversible reduction. <i>Quinoid</i>-type compounds exhibit oxidative and reductive versatility, making them promising for further research in energy storage.
40229199	Installation of Site-Specific Inorganic and Organic Phosphate to Peptides and Proteins via Vinylaryl Sulfonium Reagents.	Protein phosphorylation is a very important post-translational modification that regulates diverse cellular activities. In addition to classic monophosphorylation, there is also oligophosphorylation from pyrophosphorylation to polyphosphorylation. Moreover, organophosphates may modify residues such as via AMPylation and ADPylation. Although plenty of new types of protein phosphorylation have been revealed, molecular mechanisms of the biological functions are still challenging to study due to the lack of a good method to prepare proteins of interest with such site-specific PTMs. Here we report a facile method to install inorganic and organic phosphates on peptides and proteins. Vinylaryl sulfonium with an electron-withdrawing group was applied to cysteine alkylation and subsequent cyclization by γ-sulfur yielding episulfonium. This highly electrophilic intermediate was later attacked by a phosphate reagent to yield site-specifically phosphorylated cysteine peptides and proteins. As a result, this method does not require a special precursor residue on peptides/proteins or activation of phosphate reagents. In addition, this method is applicable to diverse inorganic phosphates and organophosphate. Therefore, we believe that this method will accelerate protein phosphorylation research by simple preparation of site-specific modified proteins. We also believe it offers a simple bioconjugation strategy via a phosphate linker.
40229198	Gate-Defined Single-Electron Transistors in Twisted Bilayer Graphene.	Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) near the magic angle is a unique platform where the combination of topology and strong correlations gives rise to exotic electronic phases. These phases are gate-tunable and related to the presence of flat electronic bands, isolated by single-particle band gaps. This enables gate-controlled charge confinements, essential for the operation of single-electron transistors (SETs), and allows one to explore the interplay of confinement, electron interactions, band renormalization, and the moiré superlattice, potentially revealing key paradigms of strong correlations. Here, we present gate-defined SETs in tBLG with well-tunable Coulomb blockade resonances. These SETs allow us to study magnetic field-induced quantum oscillations in the density of states of the source-drain reservoirs, providing insight into gate-tunable Fermi surfaces of tBLG. Comparison with tight-binding calculations highlights the importance of displacement-field-induced band renormalization crucial for future advanced gate-tunable quantum devices and circuits in tBLG including, e.g., quantum dots and Josephson junction arrays.

This study aimed to investigate whether a second examination of the right colon using narrow-band imaging (NBI) increases ADRs in the right colon compared with repeat examinations using white light imaging (WLI).
40229196	General Synthesis of Wurtzite Cu-Based Quaternary Selenide Nanocrystals via the Colloidal Method.	Cu-based multinary selenide nanomaterials have garnered significant attention in photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications, owing to their unique electronic and optical properties. However, the high-yield and scalable synthesis of wurtzite colloidal Cu-based multinary selenide nanocrystals via a versatile and simple colloidal method has not yet been achieved. In this work, we report a general hot-injection colloidal method for the high-yield synthesis of a diverse library of wurtzite Cu-based quaternary selenide nanocrystals, including Cu<sub>2</sub>CdSnSe<sub>4</sub>, Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnSe<sub>4</sub>, Cu<sub>2</sub>FeSnSe<sub>4</sub>, Cu<sub>2</sub>CoSnSe<sub>4</sub>, Cu<sub>2</sub>MnSnSe<sub>4</sub>, Cu<sub>3</sub>InSnSe<sub>5</sub>, Cu<sub>3</sub>GaSnSe<sub>5</sub>, CuZnInSe<sub>3</sub>, CuZnGaSe<sub>3</sub>, CuCdInSe<sub>3</sub>, and Cu(InGa)Se<sub>2</sub>. As a proof of concept, the wurtzite Cu<sub>2</sub>CdSnSe<sub>4</sub> nanocrystals are used as photocatalysts for solar-to-hydrogen production, displaying a good photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Moreover, this approach has broad applicability for the high-yield synthesis of other wurtzite nanomaterials, which show significant potential for a wide range of applications.

Six quinoidal compounds terminated by oxindole have been synthesized via selective nucleophilic addition, dehydroxylation, and oxidation. Through the modification of the quinoidal core and terminal benzene rings with fluoride atoms or cyano groups, the LUMO energy levels of the quinoidal compounds can be tuned within the range -4.05 to -4.54 eV. The quinoidal molecules exhibited electron transport behavior and can be used as dopants to dope an oligo(ethylene glycol)-substituted polythiophene.
40229193	The Effect of Massage and Foot Reflexology on Sleep in Newborns.	<b>Objective:</b> This study was conducted to examine the effects of massage and foot reflexology on the sleep of premature infants. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The research was designed as a randomized controlled experimental study. The study population consisted of premature infants born at 30-37 weeks of gestation who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a hospital in the Central Anatolia Region. The sample included 108 premature infants divided into three groups: Massage group (<i>n</i> = 36), Foot reflexology group (<i>n</i> = 36), and Control group (<i>n</i> = 36). Data were collected using a neonatal follow-up form and actigraphy. Massage and foot reflexology interventions were administered to the respective groups twice daily (Morning: 07:00-09:00 and Evening: 19:00-21:00) for 15 minutes each session over two consecutive days, making up a total of four sessions. The control group received routine nursing care without any additional intervention. Pre-test (once) and post-test (once) measurements of 24-h sleep durations were assessed using actigraphy for all groups. <b>Results:</b> Sleep duration in the massage group increased compared to pre-intervention (251 minutes) and the control group (272 minutes), while the sleep duration in the foot reflexology group similarly increased compared to pre-intervention (268 minutes) and the control group (266 minutes) (<i>p <</i> .001). Sleep efficiency also showed a significant increase post-intervention, rising to 73% in the massage group and 71.8% in the foot reflexology group compared to the control group (<i>p <</i> .001). Furthermore, the number of awakenings and wakefulness duration significantly decreased in the massage and foot reflexology groups compared to the control group (<i>p <</i> .05). <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings indicate that massage and foot reflexology are effective non-pharmacological methods for improving sleep duration and sleep efficiency while reducing wakefulness duration and the number of awakenings in premature infants.
40229191	Atomic Cobalt-Doped Palladium Metallene toward Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis.	Designing a high-efficiency catalyst for the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells still faces enormous challenges due to the stringent requirements for high power density and long-term durability. Palladium (Pd) metallene, on account of its unique properties and high Pd utilization efficiency, is recognized as a prospective candidate for enhancing the ORR catalytic performance. Herein, we present atomic cobalt (Co)-doped Pd metallene (Co-Pdene), featuring an ultrathin and highly curved morphology, developed via a straightforward wet-chemical approach for efficient ORR electrocatalysis in alkaline media. Resulting from the metallene structure and transition metal Co doping, the Co-Pdene catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance, achieving an electrochemical mass activity (MA) of 3.14 A per milligram palladium at 0.85 V while maintaining structural integrity over 30000 potential cycles. Theory simulations (DFT) manifest that the single-atom Co sites optimize the electronic structure of palladium in the Co-Pdene, thereby lowering the theoretical overpotential to 0.29 V. This work proposes an innovative design strategy of single-atom transition metal-doped Pd metallene as a highly efficient ORR electrocatalyst.
40229189	Photoinduced Cascade Reaction of Ene-Yne-Oxazoles with Trimethylsilyl Azide and N-Iodosuccinamide: Synthesis of Azidyl Spiroindenoxazolones.	An intriguing photoinduced azidation cyclization of ene-yne-oxazolones using trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN<sub>3</sub>) as an azide source and N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) as the iodine source provided access to the corresponding iodobenzylidene spiroindenoxazolones in good yields as a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers (d.r. ratio). A simple and mild metal-free condition was developed by using blue LEDs to induce the formation of the azidyl radical from TMS-N<sub>3</sub> as an azide source followed by its aza-1,4-addition and the ensuing 5-exo-dig cyclization to forge multiple bond formations of C─C, C─N, and C─I to furnish the desired spiroindenoxazolones.
40229188	Color Changes in Gels Composed of Hydrogen-Bonding Donor-Acceptor-Donor-Type Fluorenone Derivatives and Short-Chain Polyethylene Glycol in Response to Ionic Species.	A series of donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D)-type fluorenone derivatives with urethane units and oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) linkers of different lengths (F-EG<sub>n</sub>-BU, n = 2-4) are synthesized to investigate the effect of the length of the OEG linker on the self-assembling behavior and photophysical properties of the fluorenone derivatives. In alcoholic media such as ethanol and 2-propanol, the fluorenone-based D-A-D triad with triethylene glycol linkers (F-EG<sub>3</sub>-BU) specifically form supramolecular gels via hydrogen bonds between the urethane units. The extension of the OEG linkers (F-EG<sub>4</sub>-BU) reduced the strength of molecular aggregates, resulting in higher solubility in various organic solvents. Each compound formed intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states, as evidenced by the ICT band in the UV-vis absorption spectra and the twisted intramolecular charge transfer emission bands in the photoluminescence spectra. Changes in the absorption and emission spectra of short-chain poly(ethylene glycol)s (SC-PEGs) gelated with F-EG<sub>2</sub>-BU depend on the coexisting ionic species. In this study, we describe the unique chemical stimuli-response behaviors of fluorenone-based SC-PEG gels that cause significant changes in the spectroscopic properties upon ion doping with NaCl and alkali metal hydroxides.

40229173	Boosting The Solid-State Luminescence of Phenazine Derivatives by Enhancing Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonds and π-π Interactions in Cocrystals.	Six monosubstituted phenazine derivatives were designed and synthesized for constructing cocrystals to investigate their structure-property relationship. It was found that 2-substituted phenazines could form cocrystals with 2,6-dimethylphenylboronic acid (DBA). These cocrystals exhibited red-shifted and enhanced luminescence relative to their individual components, especially 2NP-DBA whose luminescence efficiency was nearly 100 times higher than that of 2NP. By analyzing the single-crystal structures of the cocrystals and their components, enhanced hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions between molecules were detected in cocrystals, which suppressed the nonradiative transition pathways. Consequently, all three cocrystals demonstrated enhanced luminescence with strong continuous π-π interactions, which differed from the previously reported luminescence enhancement resulting from the destruction of π-π interactions. An in-depth investigation of these cocrystals can not only provide a better understanding of the structure-property relationship of organic luminescent materials, but also help develop organic luminescent materials with intense solid-state luminescence and strong π-π interactions. In addition, the optical response of these cocrystals to acidic vapors has been successfully applied in anti-counterfeiting.
40229172	Enhancing Transfection Efficiency of Spermine-Based Cationic Lipids with a Lysine-Based Spacer.	L-shape spermine-based cationic lipids with a lysine spacer and both identical and non-identical hydrophobic tails were successfully synthesized. Liposomes prepared from these lipids, either alone or in combination with DOPE, demonstrated DNA-binding capability, as confirmed by gel electrophoresis assays. The physicochemical properties, such as size, zeta-potential, and stability of the lipoplexes formed from the cationic lipids were investigated. The liposomes efficiently condensed DNA into compact structures at an N/P ratio of approximately 5-10. Interestingly, liposomes without DOPE exhibited higher transfection efficiency than those containing DOPE, with the cationic lipid featuring a spermine polar head bonded to a lysine spacer and C12-C16 hydrocarbon tails (Sper-Lys-C<sub>12,16</sub>) achieved the greatest transfection efficiency, as revealed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Notably, this formulation maintained high transfection efficiencies even in serum concentrations up to 40%, outperforming the commercial standard Lipofectamine 3000. Additionally, these liposomes exhibited low cytotoxicity, highlighting their potential as safe and effective gene delivery agents.
40229171	Fluorine-Substituted Rhenium(I) Metallocycle: A New Class of Potent Anticancer Agent.	Fluorine and nonfluorine substituted rhenium(I) metallocycles, fac-[{Re(CO)<sub>3</sub>}<sub>2</sub>(μ-SO<sub>4</sub>)(L1)<sub>2</sub>] (C1) and fac-[{Re(CO)<sub>3</sub>}<sub>2</sub>(μ-SO<sub>4</sub>)(L2)<sub>2</sub>] (C2), respectively, were synthesized using Re<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>10</sub>, sodium bisulfite, fluorobenzimidazolyl/benzimidazolyl-based ditopic nitrogen-donor ligands (L1/L2), and toluene-acetone via coordination-driven one-pot solvothermal approach. The metallocycles were characterized using elemental analysis, ESI-TOF-MS, ATR-IR, NMR, and PXRD methods. The molecular structures of C1·9(DMSO), C1·(toluene)(acetone), and C2·(toluene) were determined using SCXRD analysis. The in vitro cytotoxicity study of C1 and C2 was performed against cervical (HeLa) and skin (B16) cancer cells. Murine fibroblast (L929) and mouse myoblast (C2C12) cells were used as noncarcinogenic model cell lines for biocompatibility determination. The metallocycles exhibited potent anticancer activity against both cancer cell lines, showing greater efficacy than the commonly used cisplatin. Moreover, fluorine-substituted C1 metallocycle exhibited significantly higher anticancer activity than nonfluorinated C2 metallocycle, indicating a fluorine effect. Further, in-depth studies of C1 on HeLa cells showed elevated intracellular ROS generation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and antiproliferative properties. The in vitro studies also revealed its ability to bind with DNA and induce changes in cellular morphology, thus leading to DNA damage and cancer cell death by apoptosis. Molecular docking studies of the metallocycles with B-DNA macromolecule revealed the binding sites, binding affinity, and type of noncovalent interactions.
40229145	Transforming End-of-Life Care: Impact of the "<i>Melhor em Casa</i>" Home-Based Palliative Care Program in Brazil.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> Palliative care (PC) is essential for managing symptoms and improving the quality of life for cancer patients. In Brazil, the "<i>Melhor em Casa</i>" ("Better at Home") program offers interdisciplinary home-based care. The SAD-Caratinga Program (SAD-CP) in Minas Gerais has provided care to patients with cancer since 2013. <b><i>Objectives:</i></b> This study aimed to evaluate the SAD-CP, focusing on sociodemographic and clinical data of cancer patients, symptoms, survival, number of hospitalizations, and place of death. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A retrospective, cross-sectional, quantitative analysis was conducted on data from 471 consecutive oncology patients who died while under the program's care between 2013 and 2023. Demographic, clinical, and service data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, chi-square, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The median age was 70 years, with 52.9% male patients and stage IV (57.8%). Pain was the most reported symptom (94.7%), followed by dyspnea (77.1%) and hypersomnolence (69.2%). Median survival was 48 days, with significant variation by cancer type. Notably, 468/471 (99.4%) patients died at home. The program demonstrated effective symptom management, as only three patients (0.6%) patients were hospitalized, and there were minimal emergency visits (0.08 visits/day). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This interdisciplinary intensive home-based PC program improved patient symptom control and dramatically reduced hospital deaths. Future research should explore scalability and long-term outcomes in diverse populations.
40229144	Frailty, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy: Proposal of the new concept of the geriatric triangle.	As people age, the prevalence of frailty, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy increases, presenting significant challenges in geriatric medicine. These three elements are interrelated in a bidirectional manner, forming what can be termed the "geriatric triangle." The complexity of their interconnections means that addressing each issue in isolation is insufficient for achieving an effective resolution. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of this geriatric triangle is essential for appropriate geriatric management. This review aims to illuminate the relationships within the geriatric triangle and to offer insights into potential strategies for managing these interconnected challenges. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2025; ••: ••-••.
40229143	Biological adaptive radiotherapy for short-time dose compensation in lung SBRT patients.	Conventional adaptive radiation therapy (ART) primarily focuses on adapting to anatomical changes during radiation therapy but does not account for biological effects such as changes in radiosensitivity and tumor response, particularly during treatment interruptions. These interruptions may allow sublethal damage repair in tumor cells, reducing the effectiveness of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
40229142	Understanding Individual Intraocular Pressure Response to Treatment with Latanoprost and Timolol.	<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> To identify reasons for variable intraocular pressure (IOP) responses to latanoprost and timolol in healthy volunteers and to generate the control group as part of Eye Dynamics and Engineering Network. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> In this multicenter, randomized, crossover study (NCT01677507), both eyes of 106 healthy subjects (212 eyes) were treated with latanoprost or timolol for 7 days, with a 6-week washout between treatments. Ocular biometrics, tonometry, and aqueous humor dynamics (AHD) were assessed at baseline and day 8 of each treatment. Subjects were divided into responders and nonresponders using cutoffs of >15% or >10% IOP reduction. Treatment effects and correlations were analyzed with paired t-tests. <b><i>Results:</i></b> More subjects responded to latanoprost (54%) than timolol (27%) at >15% cutoff (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Responders had higher mean baseline IOP than nonresponders for both drugs at both cutoffs (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Among timolol nonresponders (<i>n</i> = 56), 39% responded to latanoprost in both eyes, 20% in one eye, and 41% in neither. Among latanoprost nonresponders (<i>n</i> = 31), 13% responded to timolol in both eyes, 13% in one eye, and 74% in neither. Latanoprost increased uveoscleral outflow, while timolol reduced aqueous flow and outflow facility. Low baseline uveoscleral outflow was associated with latanoprost response. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Higher baseline IOP predicted better responses to both drugs. Higher baseline uveoscleral outflow predicted nonresponse to latanoprost. No AHD differences were linked to the timolol response. Timolol nonresponders were often responsive to latanoprost, but not vice versa.
40229141	Identification of Genetic Variants Causing Paediatric Cataract in Myanmar.	Genetic testing for paediatric cataract detects a cause in 50%-70% of affected children but is as low as 20% in some reports. We screened 180 cataract-related genes in 22 children (from 20 families) with paediatric cataract from Myanmar using whole-exome sequencing. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 45% (9/20) of probands in genes MIP, COL2A1, NHS, GJA8, GJA3, CRYGC, CRYBB2, PAX6 and SLC7A8. Variants of uncertain significance likely to be important were identified in three children for a maximum diagnostic rate of 12/20 probands (60%) comparable to other reports. This is the first study to examine the genetics of paediatric cataract in Myanmar.
40229140	Medical Aid in Dying in the State of Colorado: Perspectives, Data, and Lessons Learned in the First Years of a Uniquely Centralized Program.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> In 2016, Colorado voters approved Proposition 106, "Access to Medical Aid in Dying," which amended Colorado statutes to include the Colorado End-of-life Options Act. This statute is similar to the aid in dying laws enacted in states that currently have aid in dying laws. In 2018, Denver Health and Hospital Authority, an urban, county safety-net hospital established a program to provide comprehensive medical aid in dying care via a centralized clinic with a dedicated team including a medical director, social worker, and a network of volunteer consultants. This clinic is physically located on the main campus of Denver Health Medical Center, but most patients are seen via the virtual platform. As the program has developed and matured, it has grown exponentially. This is due to its ease of accessibility, statewide educational efforts, and the relatively low cost and need-based, free services it provides. We present here the programs' five-year statistics and methodology that have resulted in a unique medical aid in dying care model. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who met the state law criteria with at least one visit to the clinic. As consistent with Colorado law, inclusion criteria include patients are 18 years of age or older, a resident of Colorado, have a terminal illness with a prognosis of less than six months to live, do not have any underlying mental illness, and are voluntarily expressing a desire to access the law without evidence of coercion. The patient must also be able to self-administer the medication. <b><i>Results:</i></b> From January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2024, 660 patients met inclusion criteria. Diagnoses included cancer (53%), progressive neurological disease (14%), lung disease (13%), and cardiac disease (12%). Of the total 497/660 (75%) patients had two visits with physicians and 494/497 (99%) received a medication combination prescription. Of the 163 (25%) patients with only one visit, 50% had a date of death documented with 64/80 (80%) patients dying within 15 days of the first visit. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> In six and a half years, our centralized program assisted over 650 Colorado patients in their quest for accessing medical aid in dying care, providing a wide continuum of services from initial intake and counseling, visits, and financial aid to specific grief counseling for loved ones. We believe our centralized system may function as a model for other hospitals considering the need to improve aid in dying access and care.
40229139	Automatic, machine-agnostic, convolution-based beam, and fluence modeling for Monte Carlo independent dose calculation.	Monte Carlo (MC)-based independent dose calculation is increasingly sought after for plan- and delivery-specific quality assurance (QA) in modern radiotherapy because of its high accuracy. It is particularly valuable for online adaptive radiotherapy, where measurement-based QA solutions are impractical. However, challenges related to beam modeling, commissioning, and plan/delivery-specific fluence calculation have hindered its widespread clinical adoption.

Accurate and reliable segmentation of esophageal gross tumor volume (GTV) in computed tomography (CT) is beneficial for diagnosing and treating. However, this remains a challenging task because the esophagus has a variable shape and extensive vertical range, resulting in tumors potentially appearing at any position within it.
40229137	The Science of Tai Chi and Qigong as Whole Person Health- Part II: Evidence Gaps and Opportunities for Future Research and Implementation.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> The emerging paradigm of whole person health shares many core principles with traditional complementary and integrative health frameworks, including Tai Chi and Qigong (TCQ). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> In the fall of 2023, the Harvard Medical School Osher Center for Integrative Health hosted the inaugural international conference on <i>The Science of Tai Chi & Qigong for Whole Person Health</i>: <i>Advancing the Integration of Mind-Body Practices into Contemporary Healthcare</i> at Harvard Medical School. A two-part white paper was written to summarize key conference topics, findings, and issues. <b><i>Results and Discussion:</i></b> Part II presented here summarizes evidence gaps and future research opportunities, including: understudied clinical conditions and populations, impact of long-term TCQ training, understanding the impact of specific TCQ styles, training regimens, dosage, and contextual effects; implementation, cost-effectiveness, and medical utilization research; individual data meta-analysis, and teaching competencies, credentialing, and licensure. Part I of this white paper discusses the rationale for the conference, synthesizes the state of evidence for TCQ as rehabilitative and preventive tools for a range of clinical conditions, and summarizes the translational research informing therapeutic mechanisms associated with TCQ training.

40229132	Application Research on the Triplex RT-ddPCR Assay for the Simultaneous Detection of Human Astrovirus and Sapovirus in Bivalve Shellfish.	Human astrovirus (HAstV) and sapovirus (SaV) are significant pathogens associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans. This study established a triple reverse transcription-droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (RT-ddPCR) assay incorporating MS2 phage as a process control virus for the simultaneous quantification of HAstV and SaV. The assay was validated using 240 bivalve samples, comprising five shellfish species: <i>Ostreidae</i> (<i>n</i> = 43), <i>Ruditapes philippinarum</i> (<i>n</i> = 84), <i>Sinonovacula constricta</i> (<i>n</i> = 27), <i>Scapharca subcrenata</i> (<i>n</i> = 23), and <i>Pectinidae</i> (<i>n</i> = 63). The results indicated that the developed RT-ddPCR assay had a good exclusivity, with detection limits of 5.15 copies/reaction for HAstV, 7.71 copies/reaction for SaV, and 6.13 copies/reaction for MS2 RNA. Viral screening revealed HAstV in 1.25% (3/240) of samples, with a maximum load of 22,140 copies/2 g, while SaV exhibited a higher prevalence of 13.33% (32/240) and a peak concentration of 68,700 copies/2 g. Different species of bivalve shellfish exhibited varying detection rates; the highest SaV detection rate was found in <i>Ostreidaes</i> at 20.93% (9/43), followed by <i>Ruditapes philippinarums</i> at 14.29% (12/84), <i>Scapharca subcrenatas</i> at 13.04% (3/23), <i>Pectinidaes</i> at 11.11% (7/63), and <i>Sinonovacula constrictas</i> at 3.70% (1/27). HAstV was only detected in <i>R. philippinarums</i> and <i>Pectinidaes</i>, with detection rates of 1.19% (1/84) and 3.17% (2/63), respectively. Additionally, both HAstV and SaV were detected in a single <i>Pectinidae</i> sample (0.42%, 1/240). The triple RT-ddPCR assay developed in this study is reliable, accurate, and highly sensitive, providing effective technical support for the quantitative detection of HAstV and SaV in bivalve shellfish.
40229131	Safety and Efficacy of Anti-OX40 Therapies in Atopic Dermatitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	<i><u></u></i>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Novel biological agents targeting the OX40 pathway have shown promise in refractory cases. We aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-OX40 therapies (amlitelimab, rocatinlimab, and telazorlimab) in moderate-to-severe AD. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases up to January 2025 for clinical trials comparing anti-OX40 therapies with placebo in patients with AD. This study followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Five randomized clinical trials were included, comprising 1118 patients, of whom 857 (76.6%) received one of the anti-OX40 therapies. Both high-dose (mean difference [MD] = -17.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -23.79 to -10.87; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and low-dose (MD = -16.35; 95% CI = -27.42 to -5.28; <i>P</i> = 0.004) regimens significantly improved the SCORing AD, and multiple other outcomes also showed statistically significant improvements, including reductions in the mean Eczema Area and Severity Index score and body surface area affected by the disease. The incidence of any treatment-emergent adverse event was not statistically significant for either the high-dose group (risk ratio [RR] = 1.14; 95% CI = 0.82-1.59; <i>P</i> = 0.443) or the low-dose group (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 0.84-1.45; <i>P</i> = 0.486). In conclusion, anti-OX40 therapies demonstrate clinically meaningful efficacy and an acceptable safety profile for moderate-to-severe AD, offering a potential alternative for patients with inadequate responses to current treatments. Further research is warranted to confirm these results and to refine optimal dosing strategies.
40229130	Comparison of Uniportal Subxiphoid Lung Cancer Surgery Using Multi-Joint Wristed Instruments and Uniportal Lung Cancer Surgery Technique: Evaluation of Early Outcomes.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> This study aims to compare the early outcomes of the surgeon-powered robotic uniportal subxiphoid resection technique with conventional uniportal techniques. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients operated on for lung cancer between January 2022 and December 2023, comparing those who underwent uniportal lung resection with those who received the uniportal subxiphoid surgical technique. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Out of 90 patients in the study, 31 underwent subxiphoid resection while 59 underwent the uniportal surgical technique. When comparing the average lengths of hospital stay, the subxiphoid group had an average stay of 3.8 ± 1.2 days while the uniportal surgery group had an average stay of 4.8 ± 1.9 days (<i>P</i> = .004). At the 1-hour postoperative evaluation, the visual analog scale score for the subxiphoid group averaged 2.2 ± 1, while the uniportal surgery group averaged 3.2 ± 1.6 (<i>P</i> = .002). Complications were observed in four patients (12.9%) in the subxiphoid group and eight patients (13.5%) in the uniportal surgery group (<i>P</i> = .927). <b><i>Conclusion</i></b>: Uniportal subxiphoid video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery resections are safe and provide advantages such as less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stays for patients.
40229129	The self-supervised fitting method based on similar neighborhood information of voxels for intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted MRI.	The intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameter estimation is affected by noise, while existing CNN-based fitting methods utilize neighborhood spatial features around voxels to obtain more robust parameters. However, due to the heterogeneity of tissue, neighborhood features with low similarity can lead to excessively smooth parameter maps and even loss of tissue details.
40229128	Synergistic Effect of ROS and p38 MAPK in Apoptosis of TM4 Cells Induced by Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles.	The adverse effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs) on the integrity of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) are widely recognized. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The integrity of the BTB is imperative for the preservation of male reproductive health. TM4 cells, which are major component of the BTB, play a critical role in its integrity. The apoptosis of TM4 cells is closely associated with the disruption of the BTB. Therefore, we selected TM4 cells as experimental models to investigate the apoptosis induced by TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs and the underlying mechanisms. Cell viability, excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and apoptosis-related protein expression levels were determined under various concentrations (50, 100, 150, and 200 μg/mL) of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs exposure. The results indicate that TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs induced the overproduction of ROS and activated the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which subsequently led to apoptosis. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was able to suppress the activation of p38 MAPK pathway induced by TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs, while the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 mitigated TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-induced ROS overproduction and subsequent apoptosis, suggesting an interplay between ROS overproduction and p38 MAPK pathway activation. In summary, TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs induced mitochondrial apoptosis via the ROS-p38 MAPK axis. A positive feedback regulatory mechanism exists between the two processes, promoting apoptosis in TM4 cells through a synergistic effect.
40229127	Extracellular matrix modulating effects of amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells on aging skin wounds in α-Klotho knockout mice.	Wounds in the elderly are frequently recalcitrant and chronic as a result of the effects of skin aging and associated complications. The objective of this study is to utilize an α-Klotho knockout (KO) mice wound model to assess the capacity of amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) to facilitate wound healing in aging skin.
40229126	Real-World Performance of Personal Continuous Glucose Monitors During Hospitalization.	<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To assess the accuracy of patients' personal continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) worn in the hospital and accuracy correlation with laboratory values and vital signs and to compare CGM glucometric data with data from published literature and guidelines. <b><i>Method:</i></b> We enrolled adult patients with diabetes mellitus wearing outpatient-inserted CGMs at the time of hospital admission to a noncritical setting. CGM readings were paired within 5 min with point of care (POC) glucometers and laboratory (Lab) blood glucose levels. CGM accuracy was expressed using mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and Clarke Error Grids. CGM accuracy variation with labs and vital signs was analyzed with Spearman's correlation method. <b><i>Results:</i></b> For 188 hospitalizations, we analyzed 3316 CGM-POC pairs from 101 patients (56 with Dexcom® sensors and 45 with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre® sensors) and 771 CGM-Lab pairs for 97 patients. For CGM-POC pairs, MARD was 13.7%, 14.4%, and 11.8% for all sensors, Dexcom, and Libre sensors, respectively. MARD was 22.6% for POC glucose <70 mg/dL. For CGM-Lab pairs, MARD was 13.6%, 12.7%, and 15.4% for all sensors, Dexcom, and Libre sensors, respectively. Of CGM-POC pairs, 98.7% and 98.8% of CGM-Lab pairs were in zones A and B of Error Grid Analysis. There was no correlation between ARD and daily mean arterial blood pressure, hemoglobin level, glomerular filtration rate, and pulse oximetry. CGMs' time below range (TBR), time in range (TIR), and time above range were 2.2% (standard deviation [SD]: 4.7%), 58.7% (SD: 22.5%), and 39.9% (SD: 23.4%), respectively. The coefficient of variation was 31.2%. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Except for hypoglycemia ranges, patients' personal CGMs had adequate accuracy for glucose monitoring in the hospital. Vital signs and Lab values did not interfere with CGM accuracy. The TBR and glucose variability were low, better than outpatient recommendations. TIR was in line with inpatient consensus guidelines, and "glucometrics" were comparable with reports for hospital inserted sensors.
40229124	Tracking Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-Producing and Colistin-Resistant <i>Escherichia Coli</i> in Pig Abattoirs: Impacts on Food Safety.	The ongoing increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, particularly the emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and colistin-resistant strains in livestock, is a significant public health concern. The effectiveness of pig abattoir management, specifically through Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) protocols, in reducing antimicrobial-resistant contamination continues to be scrutinized. This study investigated the prevalence, characteristics, and critical contamination points of ESBL-producing <i>E. coli</i> (ESBL-Ec) and colistin-resistant ESBL-Ec across the slaughtering processes in two pig abattoirs in Thailand-one operating under HACCP standards and the other certified solely under Good Manufacturing Practices. A higher prevalence of ESBL-Ec was found in the non-HACCP facility (67.98%) compared with the HACCP facility (52.04%), especially in pig carcasses. Skin and carcass washing in HACCP facilities effectively decreased bacterial contamination. Conversely, non-HACCP facilities should implement measures such as cleaning skin with disinfectants at the lairage, regularly monitoring and adjusting the final washing protocol, and strict sterilization of chopping plates to effectively control contamination points. Most ESBL-Ec isolates were multidrug-resistant and carried <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M</sub> group 1 or group 9 genes. Additionally, 12.6% of these isolates were resistant to colistin, with the <i>mcr-1</i> gene predominantly identified. ST10 was the dominant clone of <i>mcr</i>-carrying ESBL-Ec across various slaughtering stages and sample types. These findings highlight the importance of implementing HACCP protocols to reduce contamination, enhance food safety, and mitigate public health risks. Ongoing AMR monitoring to find critical points along the slaughtering process is essential to reduce sources of AMR transmission to consumers.
40228903	Evolution of genome-wide methylation profiling technologies.	In this mini-review, we explore the advancements in genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, tracing the evolution from traditional methods such as methylation arrays and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to the cutting-edge single-molecule profiling enabled by long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies. We highlight how LRS is transforming clinical and translational research, particularly by its ability to simultaneously measure genetic and epigenetic information, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex disease mechanisms. We discuss current challenges and future directions in the field, emphasizing the need for innovative computational tools and robust, reproducible approaches to fully harness the capabilities of LRS in molecular diagnostics.
40228902	The impact of long-read sequencing on human population-scale genomics.	Long-read sequencing technologies, particularly those from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, are revolutionizing genome research by providing high-resolution insights into complex and repetitive regions of the human genome that were previously inaccessible. These advances have been particularly enabling for the comprehensive detection of genomic structural variants (SVs), which is critical for linking genotype to phenotype in population-scale and rare disease studies, as well as in cancer. Recent developments in sequencing throughput and computational methods, such as pangenome graphs and haplotype-resolved assemblies, are paving the way for the future inclusion of long-read sequencing in clinical cohort studies and disease diagnostics. DNA methylation signals directly obtained from long reads enhance the utility of single-molecule long-read sequencing technologies by enabling molecular phenotypes to be interpreted, and by allowing the identification of the parent of origin of de novo mutations. Despite this recent progress, challenges remain in scaling long-read technologies to large populations due to cost, computational complexity, and the lack of tools to facilitate the efficient interpretation of SVs in graphs. This perspective provides a succinct review on the current state of long-read sequencing in genomics by highlighting its transformative potential and key hurdles, and emphasizing future opportunities for advancing the understanding of human genetic diversity and diseases through population-scale long-read analysis.
40228901	A Hitchhiker's Guide to long-read genomic analysis.	Over the past decade, long-read sequencing has evolved into a pivotal technology for uncovering the hidden and complex regions of the genome. Significant cost efficiency, scalability, and accuracy advancements have driven this evolution. Concurrently, novel analytical methods have emerged to harness the full potential of long reads. These advancements have enabled milestones such as the first fully completed human genome, enhanced identification and understanding of complex genomic variants, and deeper insights into the interplay between epigenetics and genomic variation. This mini-review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in long-read DNA sequencing analysis, encompassing reference-based and de novo assembly approaches. We explore the entire workflow, from initial data processing to variant calling and annotation, focusing on how these methods improve our ability to interpret a wide array of genomic variants. Additionally, we discuss the current challenges, limitations, and future directions in the field, offering a detailed examination of the state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods for long-read sequencing.
40228900	Decomposing Cognitive Processes in the mPFC During Self-Thinking.	Past cognitive neuroscience research has demonstrated that thinking about both the self and other activate the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a central hub of the default mode network. The mPFC is also implicated in other cognitive processes, such as introspection and autobiographical memory, rendering elusive its exact role during thinking about the self. Specifically, it is unclear whether the same cognitive process explains the common mPFC involvement or distinct processes are responsible for the mPFC activation overlap. In this preregistered functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with 35 male and female human participants, we investigated whether and to what extent mPFC activation patterns during self-reference judgment could be explained by activation patterns during the tasks of other-reference judgment, introspection, and autobiographical memory. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) showed that only in the mPFC were neural responses both concurrently different and similar across tasks. Furthermore, multiple regression and variance partitioning analyses indicated that each task (i.e., other-reference, introspection, memory) uniquely and jointly explained significant variances in mPFC activation during self-reference. These findings suggest that the self-reference task engages multiple cognitive processes shared with other tasks, with the mPFC serving as a crucial hub where essential information is gathered and integrated to support judgments based on internally constructed representations.<b>Significance statement</b> This study advances our understanding of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a central hub of the default mode network, in self-referential thinking. By using fMRI, multi-voxel pattern analysis, and variance partitioning, we demonstrate that mPFC activation during self-reference judgment is explained by shared and unique contributions from other cognitive processes, including other-reference, introspection, and autobiographical memory. Importantly, the mPFC is the only region where neural responses were concurrently similar and different across these tasks, suggesting its role in integrating diverse cognitive processes. These findings highlight the mPFC's critical function in gathering and integrating information for judgments based on internal representations, shedding light on its multifaceted role in self-related cognition.
40228899	Impact of rod-dominant mesopic conditions on spatial summation and surround suppression in early visual cortex.	Mesopic (dim light) conditions are prevalent in everyday environments, yet most human vision research is conducted under idealized, photopic (bright) conditions. Electrophysiological studies suggest that under mesopic conditions, retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, which encode contrast, expand their center width while diminishing surround inhibition. These retinal modifications enhance light capture by increasing the summation area but they limit spatial resolution. However, the impact of mesopic conditions on human cortical spatial integration mechanisms remains unclear. To address this, we investigate how mesopic conditions affect early visuocortical processing, specifically spatial summation and surround suppression. Across two experiments, we acquired fMRI BOLD responses from 11 normally-sighted participants of both sexes under photopic and mesopic conditions in visual areas V1 - V3. The first experiment estimated population receptive field (pRF) properties while the second experiment assessed cortical surround suppression. Photopic and mesopic psychophysical surround suppression, Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF), and visual acuity were also measured. At the cortical level, mesopic conditions were associated with smaller pRF sizes, while surround suppression remained robust. At the perceptual level, mesopic conditions led to reduced acuity, lower CSF, and weaker suppression, diverging from the observed cortical effects. Importantly, individual differences linked these findings: participants who exhibited greater mesopic reductions in visual acuity also showed larger decreases in early visuocortical surround suppression, underscoring its role in contrast coding and spatial resolution. Altogether, our fMRI findings contrast with retinal electrophysiology and suggest that early visual cortex may employ distinct, perhaps compensatory, mechanisms in response to reduced retinal input under mesopic conditions.<b>Significance Statement</b> Despite the prevalence of mesopic (dim light) environments, their impact on human visuocortical processing remains understudied. Electrophysiological studies suggest that mesopic conditions lead to larger receptive fields and reduced surround inhibition in retinal ganglion cells, enhancing light summation at the cost of spatial resolution. Using fMRI and psychophysical measurements, we investigate how mesopic conditions impact spatial summation and surround suppression across early visual cortex. We find that under mesopic conditions, population receptive fields become smaller, and cortical surround suppression remains robust. However, individual differences revealed a correlation between mesopic visual acuity impairment and changes in V1 surround suppression. These findings contrast with retinal electrophysiological findings, pointing to potential cortical refinement mechanisms that help preserve visual function under degraded viewing conditions.
40228898	Functional heterogeneity within the primate ventral striatum for motivational regulation.	The ventral striatum (VS) is a key brain region for reward processing and motivation, and its dysfunctions have been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as apathy and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although functional heterogeneity within the VS has been well established in rodents, its relevance and mechanisms in primates remain unclear. To address this issue, we performed bilateral pharmacological inactivation of the VS in two male macaque monkeys using muscimol, a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist. Precise targeting was achieved through computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral effects were evaluated using two methods: a goal-directed task with variable rewards and analysis of spontaneous behavior. Our results demonstrated that anterior (a)VS inactivation induced a hypoactivity state that we termed "resting," whereas posterior (p)VS inactivation elicited compulsive-like "checking" behaviors. Notably, neither the aVS nor the pVS inactivation affected reward value or drive processing, thus differentiating aVS and pVS from those involved in incentive motivation, such as the rostromedial caudate and ventral pallidum. Retrograde tracing demonstrated distinct anatomical projection patterns for the aVS and pVS, supporting their functional segregation. Together, the present results suggest the functional heterogeneity of the primate VS along its anterior-posterior axis, with the aVS and pVS participating in distinct motivational control circuits. Our findings may have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and for the development of new therapeutic approaches.<b>Significance Statement</b> The ventral striatum (VS) is a core brain region that is involved in motivation and reward-based behaviors. Its dysfunction is implicated in psychiatric disorders such as apathy and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In macaque monkeys, we used imaging-guided pharmacological manipulations to reveal that the anterior and posterior VS subregions have distinct roles in motivation, independent of the incentive or reward drive. Specifically, anterior VS inactivation induced a hypoactive state, whereas posterior VS inactivation elicited compulsive-like behaviors. These findings reveal distinct motivational mechanisms within the primate VS, thus offering valuable insights into the neural basis of psychiatric disorders and identifying promising therapeutic targets.
40228897	GABAergic projections from the pretectum boost retinogeniculate signal transfer via disinhibition.	The transfer of retinal signals from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) to the primary visual cortex (V1) is modulated by a variety of extraretinal inputs, including extrinsic connections formed by GABAergic neurons in the pretectum (PT) and visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus (vTRN), as well as the intrinsic connections of GABAergic dLGN interneurons. In the current study, we determined how GABAergic PT projections to the dLGN and vTRN can influence retinogeniculate transfer using a variety of viral tracing techniques, electron microscopy, <i>in vitro</i> physiological recordings, and optogenetics in male and female mice. We found that the PT provides over 75% of the GABAergic, and over 30% of the total synaptic input to the vTRN. Optogenetic activation of PT terminals reduced the firing frequency of vTRN neurons as well as the amplitudes of their postsynaptic responses to V1 input. In the dLGN, synaptic terminals originating from the PT targeted interneurons more frequently than thalamocortical (relay) cells, and optogenetic activation of PT input had a greater impact on interneuron firing frequency compared to relay cells. This cell type specific impact of PT input to the dLGN resulted in the disinhibition of relay cells and an increase in the amplitude of their postsynaptic responses to retinal input. Taken together, our results indicate that GABAergic PT projections to the visual thalamus serve to boost retinogeniculate transfer via two types of disinhibition, potentially enhancing the flow of visual information to V1 following gaze shifts.<b>Significance Statement</b> The transfer of visual information from the retina to the cortex must be coordinated with gaze shifts to explore the surrounding environment. Here we document pathways from the pretectum, a region responsive during gaze shifts, to the visual thalamus. We find that pretectum neurons that use the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) selectively innervate GABAergic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, which serves to boost the transfer of visual information from the thalamus to the cortex. The identification of these brain circuits may have important implications for disorders of gaze shifts and/or sensory modulation.
40228896	Mitochondrial glutamine metabolism drives epileptogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons.	All available anti-seizure medications aim at symptomatic control of epilepsy, but there is no strategy to stop the development of the disease. The main reason is the lack of understanding of the epileptogenic mechanisms. Closing this knowledge gap is an essential prerequisite for developing disease-modifying therapies that can prevent the onset of epilepsy. Using primary co-cultures of hippocampal neurons and glial cells derived from rat pups of either sex, we show that epileptiform paroxysmal depolarization shifts (PDS) induce neuronal glucose hypometabolism which is compensated for by increased glutaminolysis. Glutaminolysis not only provides sufficient ATP to support electrical activity, but also leads to decreased vesicular glutamate release, thereby promoting neuronal hypersynchrony. Moreover, prolonged promotion of PDS increased neuronal arborization and synaptic density, which in combination with spontaneous recovery of neuronal glucose metabolism led to seizure-like discharge activity. Since inhibition of glutaminolysis did not prevent the PDS-induced morphogenesis, but eliminated seizure-like activity, we propose that glutaminolysis is a causative process linking neuronal metabolism with electrical activity thereby driving epileptogenesis.<b>Significance statement</b> The available pharmacotherapy for epilepsy provides symptomatic control of seizures by interfering with ictogenesis. However, understanding the preceding epileptogenic processes would offer an opportunity to intervene in the development of the disease. The electrical activity and glucose metabolism of the brain regions corresponding to the epileptic foci are disturbed long before the first seizures occur. The significance of the altered neuronal activity and metabolism is not well understood. We present evidence that abnormal neuronal electrical activity called paroxysmal depolarization shifts increase neuronal arborization and lead to metabolic shifts making neurons transiently rely on glutamine. We show that the interplay of these processes induces glucose hypometabolism, hyper-synchronization, and ultimately leads to seizure-like discharge activity, thus replicating several key features of epilepsy.
40228895	Multimodal MEG and microstructure-MRI investigations of the human hippocampal scene network.	Although several studies have demonstrated that perceptual discrimination of complex scenes relies on an extended hippocampal posteromedial system, we currently have limited insight into the specific functional and structural properties of this system in humans. Here, combining electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography, MEG) and advanced microstructural (multi-shell diffusion MRI, dMRI; quantitative magnetisation transfer, qMT) imaging in healthy human adults (30 female/10 male), we show that both theta power modulation of the hippocampus, and fibre restriction/hindrance (reflecting axon packing/myelination) of the fornix (a major input/output pathway of the hippocampus), were independently related to scene, but not face, perceptual discrimination accuracy. Conversely, microstructural features of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (a long-range occipito-anterotemporal tract) correlated with face, but not scene, perceptual discrimination accuracy. Our results provide new mechanistic insight into the neurocognitive systems underpinning complex scene discrimination, providing novel support for the idea of multiple processing streams within the human medial temporal lobe.<b>Significance Statement</b> In contrast to theories positing segregated cortical areas for perception and memory, the specialized representations of the hippocampus may support both the perception and memory of visual scenes. To investigate, we utilised the unique window into hippocampal electrophysiological activity offered by magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found hippocampal theta activity modulations in the hippocampus and posteromedial cortex during scene, versus face and shape-size, perceptual odd-one-out discrimination, the magnitude of which correlated with scene, but not face or shape-size, discrimination accuracy. Moreover, multimodal white matter imaging revealed that specific microstructural features of the fornix - the major hippocampal output tract - independently predicted scene discrimination performance. Our multimodal MEG-microstructure study provides novel evidence that the hippocampus and connected structures conjointly support online scene processing.
40228894	Mef2c Controls Postnatal Callosal Axon Targeting by Regulating Sensitivity to Ephrin Repulsion.	Intracortical circuits, including long-range callosal projections, are crucial for information processing. The development of neuronal connectivity in the cerebral cortex is contingent on ordered emergence of neuronal classes followed by the formation of class-specific axon projections. However, the genetic determinants of intracortical axon targeting are still unclear. We find that the transcription factor Myocyte enhancer factor 2-c (Mef2c) directs the development of somatosensory cortical (S1) Layer 4 and 5 identity in murine postmitotic pyramidal neurons during embryogenesis. During postnatal development <i>Mef2c</i> expression shifts to Layer 2/3 callosal projection neurons (L2/3 CPNs). At this later developmental stage, we identify a novel function for <i>Mef2c</i> in regulating the targeting of homotopic contralateral regions by S1-L2/3 CPNs. We employ functional manipulation of EphA-EphrinA signaling in <i>Mef2c-</i>mutant CPNs, and demonstrate that Mef2c represses <i>EphA</i>6 to desensitize S1-L2/3 CPN axons to EphrinA5-repulsion at their contralateral targets. Our work uncovers dual roles for <i>Mef2c</i> in cortical development: regulation of laminar subtype specification during embryogenesis, and axon targeting in postnatal callosal neurons.<b>Significance statement</b> The corpus callosum is the largest white-matter tract in the mammalian brain. Precise topographic targeting of callosal projections is crucial for information flow between cortical areas, and deficits in callosal connectivity are associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We identify the transcription factor Mef2c as one of the first regulators of interhemispheric projection targeting in the mammalian neocortex. We further demonstrate a functional link between the dysregulation of a specific axon guidance receptor (EphA6) downstream of Mef2c deletion and a corresponding deficit in interhemispheric connectivity. By ascribing a role for EfnA5-EphA signaling in orchestrating callosal projection targeting downstream of Mef2c, we shed new light on the molecular logic of callosal projection targeting.
40228893	EEG of the dancing brain: Decoding sensory, motor and social processes during dyadic dance.	Real-world social cognition requires processing and adapting to multiple dynamic information streams. Interpreting neural activity in such ecological conditions remains a key challenge for neuroscience. This study leverages advancements in de-noising techniques and multivariate modeling to extract interpretable EEG signals from pairs of participants (male-male, female-female, and male-female) engaged in spontaneous dyadic dance. Using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), we investigated how music acoustics, self-generated kinematics, other-generated kinematics, and social coordination uniquely contributed to EEG activity. Electromyogram recordings from ocular, face, and neck muscles were also modeled to control for artifacts. The mTRFs effectively disentangled neural signals associated with four processes: (I) auditory tracking of music, (II) control of self-generated movements, (III) visual monitoring of partner movements, and (IV) visual tracking of social coordination. We show that the first three neural signals are driven by event-related potentials: the P50-N100-P200 triggered by acoustic events, the central lateralized movement-related cortical potentials triggered by movement initiation, and the occipital N170 triggered by movement observation. Notably, the (previously unknown) neural marker of social coordination encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, surpassing the encoding of self- or partner-related kinematics taken alone. This marker emerges when partners can see each other, exhibits a topographical distribution over occipital areas, and is specifically driven by movement observation rather than initiation. Using data-driven kinematic decomposition, we further show that vertical bounce movements best drive observers' EEG activity. These findings highlight the potential of real-world neuroimaging, combined with multivariate modeling, to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex yet natural social behaviors.<b>Significance statement</b> Real-world brain function involves integrating multiple information streams simultaneously. However, due to a shortfall of computational methods, laboratory-based neuroscience often examines neural processes in isolation. Using multivariate modeling of EEG data from pairs of participants freely dancing to music, we demonstrate that it is possible to tease apart physiologically established neural processes associated with music perception, motor control, and observation of a partner's movement. Crucially, we identify a previously unknown neural marker of social coordination that encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, beyond self- or partner-related kinematics alone. These findings highlight the potential of computational neuroscience to uncover the biological mechanisms underlying real-world social and motor behaviors, advancing our understanding of how the brain supports dynamic and interactive activities.
40228892	Timing of speech in brain and glottis and the feedback delay problem in motor control.	To learn complex motor skills, an organism must be able to assign sensory feedback events to the actions that caused them. This matching problem would be simple if motor neuron output led sensory feedback with a fixed, predictable lag. However, nonlinear dynamics in the brain and the body's periphery can decouple the timing of critical events from that of the motor output which caused them. During human speech production, for example, phonation from the glottis (a sound source for speech) begins suddenly when subglottal pressure and laryngeal tension cross a sharp threshold (i.e. a bifurcation). Only if the brain can predict the timing of these discrete peripheral events resulting from motor output, then, would it be possible to match sensory feedback to movements based on temporal coherence. We show that event onsets in the (male and female) human glottal waveform, measured using electroglottography, are reflected in the electroencephalogram during speech production, leading up to the time of the event itself. Conversely, glottal event times can be decoded from the electroencephalogram. After prolonged exposure to delayed auditory feedback, subjects recalibrate their behavioral threshold for detecting temporal auditory-motor mismatches, and decoded event times decouple from actual movements. This suggests decoding performance is driven by plastic predictions of peripheral timing, providing a missing component for hindsight credit assignment, in which specific feedback events are associated with the neural activity that gave rise to movements. We discuss parallel findings from the birdsong system suggesting that results may generalize across vocal learning species.<b>Significance Statement</b> To learn complex motor skills such as speech, the brain must pair actions with sensory feedback. However, feedback is delayed in time relative to actual movement, rendering this "hindsight credit assignment" problem a nontrivial task. We present evidence that events in the glottis, the articulatory organ that generates sound for human speech, are predictively encoded in the human brain during speech production. Given that corresponding events in auditory feedback are known to be prominently encoded in cortex, this highlights a common temporal marker by which articulatory gestures and sensory feedback could be aligned. Findings suggest activity in the human vocomotor system is shaped by biophysical dynamics in the vocal periphery, aligning with corresponding results in the birdsong system.
40228867	Electrical Stimulation of the M1 Activates Somatostatin Interneurons in the S1: Potential Mechanisms Underlying Pain Suppression.	Chronic pain affects millions globally, yet no universally effective treatment exists. The primary motor cortex (M1) has been a key target for chronic pain therapies, with electrical stimulation of the M1 (eMCS) showing promise. However, the mechanisms underlying M1-mediated analgesic effects are not fully understood. We investigated the role of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in M1-mediated analgesia using a neuropathic pain mouse model. In this model, neuropathic pain is associated with increased spontaneous activity of layer V pyramidal neurons (LV-PNs) in the S1, partly attributed to the reduced activity of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SST<sup>+</sup> INs), which normally suppress LV-PNs. While manipulation of either LV-PNs or SST<sup>+</sup> INs has been shown to alleviate pain, the role of S1 in M1-mediated analgesia has not been identified. Using multichannel silicon probes, we applied eMCS to neuropathic mice and observed significant analgesia. Histological analyses revealed that eMCS activated SST<sup>+</sup> INs and suppressed hyperactivity of LV-PNs in the S1, suggesting that eMCS suppresses pain by modulating S1 neuronal circuits, alongside other pain-related regions. Notably, eMCS induced long-lasting analgesia, persisting for at least two days post-stimulation. These findings implicate S1 as a critical mediator of eMCS-induced analgesia and suggest eMCS as a potential durable therapeutic strategy for chronic pain.<b>Significance Statement</b> Chronic pain is a devastating disorder that affects over 25% of the global population. The lack of universally and entirely effective treatments, combined with severe social and economic burdens posed by the side effects of current analgesics, underscores the need to explore multifaceted approaches. In this study, we applied a silicon probe to target layer 5 of the M1 region of mice and delivered electrical stimulation to a chronic constriction injury mouse model. Our findings demonstrated that eMCS induced analgesic effects on mechanical stimuli, with the effect notably persisting for at least two days after the cessation of eMCS. As a potential mechanism, we identified SST+ neuronal activation in S1, along with other previously known brain regions influenced by eMCS.
40228866	Eye Movements in Silent Visual Speech track Unheard Acoustic Signals and Relate to Hearing Experience.	Behavioral and neuroscientific studies have shown that watching a speaker's lip movements aids speech comprehension. Intriguingly, even when videos of speakers are presented silently, various cortical regions track auditory features, such as the envelope. Recently, we demonstrated that eye movements track low-level acoustic information when attentively listening to speech. In this study we investigated whether ocular speech tracking occurs during visual speech and how it influences cortical silent speech tracking. Furthermore, we compared the data of hearing individuals with congenitally deaf individuals, and those with acquired deafness or hearing loss (DHH; Deaf or hard of hearing) to assess how audiovisual listening experience and auditory deprivation (early vs. late onset) affects neural and ocular speech tracking during silent lip-reading. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examined ocular and neural speech tracking of 75 participants observing silent videos of a speaker played forward and backward. Our main finding is a clear ocular unheard speech tracking effect with a dominance <1 Hz, which was not present for the lip movements. Similarly, we observed a <=1.3 Hz effect of neural unheard speech tracking in temporal regions for hearing participants. Importantly, neural tracking was not directly linked to ocular tracking in this study. Strikingly, across different listening groups, deaf participants with auditory listening experience showed higher ocular speech tracking than hearing participants, while no ocular speech tracking effect was revealed for congenitally deaf participants in a very small sample. This study extends our previous work by demonstrating the involvement of eye movements in speech processing, even in the absence of acoustic input.<b>Significance statement</b> Speech processing is usually an audiovisual process. In this study, we show that when watching silent speakers, eye movements track the unheard speech envelope. Comparing different listening groups, we find this unheard ocular speech tracking even more pronounced in late deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) individuals, while congenitally deaf individuals exhibit no such ocular tracking of unheard speech. This underscores the role of individual listening experience for the development of ocular unheard speech tracking. This work emphasizes the importance of including eye movements in future research on audiovisual integration.
40228865	Stabilized Supralinear Network Model of Responses to Surround Stimuli in Primary Visual Cortex.	In the mammalian primary visual cortex (V1), there are complex interactions between responses to stimuli present in the cell's classical receptive field or "center" and in the surrounding region or "surround". The circuit mechanisms underlying these behaviors are likely to represent more general cortical mechanisms for integrating information. Here we develop a circuit model that accounts for three important features of surround suppression (suppression of response to a center stimulus by addition of a surround stimulus): 1) The surround stimulus suppresses the inhibitory as well as excitatory currents that the cell receives; 2) The strongest suppression arises when the surround orientation matches that of the center stimulus, even when the center stimulus orientation differs from the cell's preferred orientation; and 3) A surround stimulus of a given orientation most strongly suppresses that orientation's component of the response to a plaid center stimulus ("feature-specific suppression"). We show that a stabilized supralinear network (SSN) with biologically plausible connectivity and synaptic efficacies that depend on cortical distance and orientation difference between units can consistently reproduce phenomena (1) and (3), and, qualitatively, phenomenon (2). We explain the mechanism behind each result. We argue that phenomena (2) and (3) are independent: the model with some aspects of the connectivity removed still produces phenomenon (3) but not (2). The model also reproduces the rapid time scale of activity decay observed in mouse V1 when thalamic input to V1 is silenced. Finally, we show that these results hold both in networks with rate-based and conductance-based spiking units.<b>Significance Statement</b> A visual neuron responds to stimuli present in its classical receptive field or <i>"center"</i> These responses are modulated in a complex manner by stimuli outside the receptive field <i>i.e</i> in <i>"the surround"</i> Understanding the underlying circuit behind center-surround interactions is crucial to understanding fundamental brain computations. Here, we focus on a set of key center-surround phenomena in the primary visual cortex. We demonstrate how complex aspects of cortical computation can be carried out by the local cortical circuit. We demonstrate that the stabilized supralinear network, a mechanism that accounts for a multitude of cortical response properties, can also account for these phenomena, given appropriate connectivity. We also demonstrate that this mechanism can be achieved in a biologically realistic spiking network.
40228864	STAT5B leukemic mutations, altering SH2 tyrosine 665, have opposing impacts on immune gene programs.	STAT5B is a vital transcription factor for lymphocytes. Here, the function of two STAT5B mutations from human T-cell leukemias: one substituting tyrosine 665 with phenylalanine (STAT5B<sup>Y665F</sup>) and the other with histidine (STAT5B<sup>Y665H</sup>), was interrogated. In silico modeling predicted divergent energetic effects on homodimerization with a range of pathogenicity. In primary T cells in vitro, STAT5B<sup>Y665F</sup> showed gain-of-function, whereas STAT5B<sup>Y665H</sup> demonstrated loss-of-function. Introducing the mutation into the mouse genome illustrated that the gain-of-function <i>Stat5b</i> <sup>Y665F</sup> mutation resulted in accumulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> effector and memory and CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells, altering CD8<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> ratios. In contrast, STAT5B<sup>Y665H</sup> "knock-in" mice showed diminished CD8<sup>+</sup> effector and memory and CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells. In contrast to WT STAT5B, the STAT5B<sup>Y665F</sup> variant displayed greater STAT5 phosphorylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity after cytokine activation, whereas the STAT5B<sup>Y665H</sup> variant resembled a null. The work exemplifies how joining in silico and in vivo studies of single nucleotides deepens our understanding of disease-associated variants, revealing structural determinants of altered function, defining mechanistic roles, and, specifically here, identifying a gain-of-function variant that does not directly induce hematopoietic malignancy.

Myocardial protection against ischaemia-reperfusion injury is a key determinant of heart function and outcome following cardiac surgery in children. However, myocardial injury still occurs routinely following aortic cross-clamping, as demonstrated by the ubiquitous rise in circulating troponin. del Nido cardioplegia was designed to protect the immature myocardium and is widely used in the USA but has not previously been available in the UK, where St. Thomas' blood cardioplegia is most common. The del Nido versus St. Thomas' blood cardioplegia in the young (DESTINY) trial will evaluate whether one solution is better than the other at improving myocardial protection by reducing myocardial injury, shortening ischaemic time and improving clinical outcomes.

40228855	MultifocAL COntact Lenses for Myopia (MALCOLM) control in Australian children: a study protocol for a double-blind, contralateral eye, non-inferiority, randomised controlled clinical trial.	Myopia is the most common refractive error worldwide, but each dioptre increase in myopia leads to an increased risk of degenerative eye disease and permanent vision impairment. Soft contact lens (CL) designs have been developed to slow myopia and potentially reduce long-term risk, but there is still a need for additional designs of varied materials and parameters to cater for diverse patient needs. The MultifocAL COntact Lenses for Myopia control study aims to compare the efficacy of the Acuvue Oasys for Presbyopia (AOP) CL against the Food and Drug Administration approved MiSight 1-Day multifocal CL in controlling progressive myopia in children using a non-inferiority contralateral eye design.

However, the complex biological, psychological and sociocultural factors underlying STB have not been comprehensively captured to date, which has limited our understanding of how these factors interact to influence STB. Moreover, acute care settings, such as emergency departments (EDs), are often first points of contact for individuals with STB, highlighting a need for more research in these settings.

40228822	Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocol in Patients With Adult Spinal Deformity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Study DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.ObjectivesPerioperative interventions in Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols for managing adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients vary widely across institutions without widespread standardization. This study aims to evaluate the various interventions performed in ERAS protocols and the impact of these protocols on postoperative outcomes following ASD surgery.MethodsA comprehensive systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies that addressed the implementation of ERAS protocol for thoraco-lumbar corrective surgery were included. We conducted a meta-analysis on postoperative outcomes, where possible, calculating the pooled standardized mean difference between conventional care (pre-ERAS) and ERAS pathways (post-ERAS).ResultsOut of 63 articles, 8 were included in the systematic review. Common interventions in the ERAS protocols included: (1) preoperative anesthesia-related risk assessment and multidisciplinary assessment, (2) intraoperative tranexamic acid (TXA) administration and continuous monitoring of lab data, and (3) postoperative early mobilization and early nutritional support. Multimodal analgesia plans were commonly observed in many of the ERAS protocols. Although meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in length of stay (LOS) between the groups, the post-ERAS group generally tended to exhibit lower rates of readmission and medical complications, and reductions in total opioid consumption.ConclusionsThe goals of ERAS protocols for ASD surgery often address preoperative optimization, intraoperative stress minimization, and postoperative recovery facilitation. While the implementation of the ERAS protocol has shown improvements in postoperative outcomes, further studies are required to standardize the ERAS protocol for ASD surgery and enhance the impact on multiple postoperative outcomes.
40228815	Words Left Unspoken: Exploring the Unspoken Narratives of Loved Ones Supporting a Person who has Survived a Suicide Attempt.	Experiences of informal carers supporting a loved one following a suicide attempt are under-reported in research. This is partly due to specific psychological barriers which lead to carers feeling silenced. This study aimed to uncover and explore unspoken narratives of informal carers who have provided care for a loved one following a suicide attempt. Fourteen adult participants responded to a social media advert inviting them to an interview to talk about their experience of caregiving. Interviews were analysed using Reflective Thematic Analysis. Five main themes were identified: 'The Conspiracy of Silence', Unequivocally Unspoken', 'A Sense of Responsibility', 'Making Comparisons', and 'Relationships with Professionals'. Results are discussed in relation to existing literature before highlighting clinical implications. Researchers and clinicians should aspire to learn more about the experience of informal caregivers in this context, aiming for carers to be able to access appropriate service provision and receive the care and support they deserve.
40228812	Metabolic engineering of yeast to efficiently synthesize heme and hemoproteins: recent advance and prospects.	Owing to the potential for commercialization, the recombinant production of hemoproteins has been heavily investigated. Yeast is a superior host for the synthesis of eukaryotic hemoproteins with optimal pathway to facilitate heme delivery and utilization, as well as the suitable environment for the post-translational folding and modification. The efficient binding of heme is the critical determinants for the various functions of hemeproteins. Thus, many metabolic engineering strategies have been employed to modify heme synthetic pathways and balance the intracellular metabolic burden. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the improvement of heme supply, the enhancement of hemoprotein expression, and the current efforts to harmonize the synthesis of heme and the expression of protein components in yeast. These insights offer a solid foundation for the development of yeast chassis for the efficient production of high-active hemoproteins in the future.
40228811	Transcranial magnetic stimulation use with chronic vestibular disorders: A scoping review.	BackgroundTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is extensively studied as a neuromodulation tool in neurological disorders. However, its use with the central vestibular disorders is limited.ObjectiveTo evaluate the utility of TMS as an assessment and treatment of chronic vestibular disorders and propose recommendations for future work.MethodsA comprehensive search of four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine Source) identified 206 records of which 16 studies were included.ResultsOne study used TMS as a neurophysiological assessment tool and 15 used repetitive TMS (rTMS) as a neuromodulatory intervention. Mal de Debarquement syndrome was the most frequently explored diagnosis. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum were the most frequent sites for rTMS application. Statistically significant improvements were noted on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (3/7 studies) but clinically significant improvements were not observed. Postural control (7/7 studies) showed improvements along with VOR gain (1/1 studies).ConclusionsTMS shows promise as both a neurophysiological assessment tool and a neuromodulatory intervention for chronic vestibular disorders. Methodological limitations of the studies warrant caution while interpreting the results. Larger sample sizes, control groups, optimal neuroanatomical targeting, and dosing along with active rehabilitation are required to determine effectiveness in chronic vestibular disorders.
40228810	Optimization and Characterization of N-Acetamide Indoles as Antimalarials That Target PfATP4.	To discover new antimalarials, a screen of the Janssen Jumpstarter library against <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> uncovered the N-acetamide indole hit class. The structure-activity relationship of this chemotype was defined and culminated in the optimized frontrunner analog WJM664, which exhibited potent asexual stage activity and high metabolic stability. Resistant selection and whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in PfATP4, which was validated as the target by showing that analogs exhibited reduced potency against parasites with resistance-conferring mutations in PfATP4, a metabolomic signature similar to that of the PfATP4 inhibitor KAE609, and inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent ATPase activity consistent with on-target inhibition of PfATP4. WJM664 inhibited gamete development and blocked parasite transmission to mosquitoes but exhibited low efficacy in a<i>Plasmodium berghei</i> mouse model, which was attributed to ATP4 species differentiation and its moderate systemic exposure. Optimization of these attributes is required for N-acetamide indoles to be pursued for development as a curative and transmission-blocking therapy.
40228808	Amphibian bacterial communities assemble variably among host species, across development, and between similar habitats.	Symbiotic host-associated microbial communities are nearly ubiquitous and are often essential to host growth and development. The assembly of these communities on hosts is the result of a combination of the processes of selection, dispersal, and drift. For some species, essential symbionts are quickly acquired from the environment during embryonic development, while others may vertically acquire symbionts from parents. For amphibians with complex life cycles that undergo metamorphosis, an additional physiological transition from larval to adult forms may represent another distinct developmental window for bacterial colonization. Prior research has demonstrated that metamorphosis impacts the composition of amphibian-associated bacterial communities, however, we do not know whether similar shifts occur during metamorphosis across different amphibian species. To more clearly understand patterns in microbiome development across host species within a given area, we assessed the bacterial communities associated with eggs from five locally-occurring amphibian species and tadpoles and juveniles from four of the species. Additionally, to determine if stochasticity result in varied microbiome composition among conspecifics, we raised one species, spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), in outdoor 1000 L mesocosms. Through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we detected distinct bacterial communities across amphibian species and development. Additionally, we found that tadpoles harbored different communities of bacteria in the different mesocosms, suggesting that stochasticity may play a large role in bacterial assembly on tadpoles. Our results serve to deepen our understanding of natural shifts in amphibian-associated bacterial communities and how these shifts are host-species dependent. Additionally, this study provides support for the idea that stochasticity in the form of drift or priority effects can drive individual variation in microbiome composition among hosts.

40228802	Self-Image Perception as a Key Determinant of Long-Term Patient Satisfaction Following Adult Spinal Deformity Surgery.	Study DesignRetrospective study.ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify the key determinants of long-term patient satisfaction after adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery.MethodsData of 393 patients who underwent long-segment fusion for ASD were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into the highly satisfied (HS) and less satisfied (LS) groups based on the mean satisfaction scores of the Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire at the final follow-up. Demographic data, surgical variables, radiographic parameters, mechanical complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictors of high satisfaction.ResultsThe LS and HS groups comprised 31.0% and 69.0% of the cohort, respectively. The mean follow-up duration was 36.7 months. No significant differences were found in patient demographics, surgical factors, or 6-week radiographic parameters between groups. However, at the final follow-up, the LS group exhibited a significantly greater thoracic kyphosis (<i>P</i> = .038), greater sagittal vertical axis (<i>P</i> = .013) and a higher revision rate (<i>P</i> = .022) than the HS group. All patient-reported outcomes were significantly better in the HS group than in the LS group. Multivariate analysis identified the final SRS-22 self-image score as the only independent predictor of high satisfaction (odds ratio = 6.982, <i>P</i> = .001). The calculated cutoff value of the self-image score for predicting high satisfaction was 3.0.ConclusionSelf-image perception at the final follow-up was the most significant factor influencing patient satisfaction after ASD surgery. Therefore, global sagittal alignment should be pertinently achieved and maintained to optimize patient satisfaction.
40228800	Limit of Detection of Raman Spectroscopy Using Polystyrene Particles from 25 to 1000 nm in Aqueous Suspensions.	Raman spectroscopy is an analytical method capable of detecting various microorganisms and small particles. Here, we used 25-1000 nm polystyrene particles in aqueous suspensions, which are comparable in size to viral particles and viral aggregates, to determine the limit of detection (LOD) of a confocal Raman microscope. We collected Raman spectra using a 785 nm wavelength laser with a power of 300 mW and a 10 s exposure time with a 5× objective lens. We detected the most prominent peak of the polystyrene particles at 1001 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the ring breathing mode. We established the minimum and maximum LOD (LOD<sub>min</sub> and LOD<sub>max</sub>) using a Kernel partial least-squares model. The LOD of the smallest size of 50 nm was identified as 1.80 × 10<sup>12</sup>-8.31 × 10<sup>12</sup> particle/mL, and for the largest size of 1000 nm, 5.11 × 10<sup>8</sup>-2.53 × 10<sup>9</sup> particle/mL. We demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy was nondestructive under these conditions by comparing the particle size before and after collecting Raman spectra using dynamic light scattering. Due to their size similarity to viral particles and viral aggregates, this systematic characterization of polystyrene particles provides detailed information on their Raman spectral signatures in aqueous suspensions. These findings establish a foundation for using Raman spectroscopy for the detection of small particles in aqueous suspensions and highlight its potential as a tool for real-time monitoring in vaccine manufacturing.
40228799	Multi-Frequency Interpolation X-talk Removal Algorithm: Enabling Combinations of Concurrent Optogenetics and Lock-in Amplification Fiber Photometry via Removal of Optogenetic Stimulation Crosstalk.	Simultaneous fiber photometry and optogenetics is a powerful emerging technique for precisely studying the interactions of neuronal brain networks. However, spectral overlap between photometry and optogenetic components has severely limited the application of an all-optical approach. Due to spectral overlap, light from optogenetic stimulation saturates the photosensor and occludes photometry fluorescence, which is especially problematic in physically smaller model organism brains like mice. Here, we demonstrate the multi-frequency interpolation X-talk removal algorithm (MuFIX or μFIX) for recovering crosstalk-contaminated photometry responses recorded with lock-in amplification. μFIX exploits multifrequency lock-in amplification by modeling the remaining uncontaminated data to interpolate across crosstalk-affected segments (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> ≈ 1.0); we found that this approach accurately recovers the original photometry response after demodulation (Pearson's <i>r</i> ≈ 1.0). When applied to crosstalk-contaminated data, μFIX recovered a photometry response closely resembling the dynamics of noncrosstalk photometry recorded simultaneously. Upon further verification using simulated and empirical data, we demonstrated that μFIX reproduces any signal that underwent simulated crosstalk contamination (<i>r</i> ≈ 1.0). We believe adopting μFIX will enable experimental designs using simultaneous fiber photometry and optogenetics that were previously not feasible due to crosstalk.
40228798	Evaluation of bleed duration and adverse donor reactions during the blood donation process.	There are great gaps regarding the demand and supply of blood and its derivatives in the blood transfusion field, which remains a major health issue. Adverse reactions experienced in the blood donation process have been reported to be one of the demotivating factors for donors returning. This study assessed bleed duration and the occurrence of adverse donor reactions (ADRs) in a blood bank setting in Cameroon.
40228797	Combating Concomitant Bacterial and Fungal Infections via Codelivery of Nitric Oxide and Fluconazole.	Device-associated infections are a major challenge for healthcare and cause patient morbidity and mortality as well as pose a significant economic burden. Infection-causing bacteria and fungi are equally notorious and responsible for biofilm formation and the development of antibiotic and antifungal-resistant strains. Biomaterials resisting bacterial and fungal adhesion can address device-associated infections more safely and efficiently than conventional systemic antibiotic therapies. Herein, we present a combination of potent antibacterial nitric oxide (NO) with antifungal fluconazole codelivery system from a polymeric matrix to combat bacterial and fungal infections simultaneously. The NO donor <i>S</i>-nitroso-<i>N</i>-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP)-blended low-water-uptake polycarbonate urethane (TSPCU) was dip-coated with high-water-uptake polyether urethane (TPU) containing fluconazole to have an antibacterial and antifungal surface. The composites were characterized for surface wettability and coating stability using water contact angle (WCA) analysis. The real-time NO release (72 h) was evaluated using a chemiluminescence-based nitric oxide analyzer which showed physiologically relevant levels of NO released. The composites released fluconazole for 72 h under physiological conditions. Antibacterial analysis demonstrated a > 3-log reduction of viable <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and >2-log reduction of viable <i>Escherichia coli</i> compared to controls. The antifungal evaluation resulted in ∼98% reduction in adhered and ∼92% reduction in planktonic <i>Candida albicans</i>. The SNAP-fluconazole composites also showed biocompatibility against mouse fibroblast cells. This novel preventative strategy to combat bacterial and fungal infections may offer a promising tool for further translational research.

40228554	Variable Return-to-Sport Rates with Improved Pain and Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation: A Systematic Review.	Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) of the knee is a reliable surgical technique for managing symptomatic full-thickness chondral lesions ≥ 2 cm² in young and active patients. There is a need for comprehensive analysis of recent studies among a growing body of literature to better understand the outcomes of OCA among athletic patients, particularly in return to sports participation and graft longevity. The study purpose is to systematically review existing literature reporting the return-to-sport (RTS) outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) following OCA of the knee among athletic patients.
40228553	Functional Outcomes in Older Patients following Patella Fracture Repair.	The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of age on outcomes following repair of acute displaced patella fractures Methods: 248 patients who sustained a displaced patella fracture and underwent open reduction and internal fixation were identified. Patients included underwent a similar operative protocol, were prescribed a standard post-operative protocol of therapy, and were seen at standard follow-up intervals. Patients were divided into groups of < 65 years old (young) and ≥ 65 years old (older). Statistical analysis was run to determine if there was a significant difference in range of knee motion and rate of major complications.
40228552	Assessing Older Adults Who Have Experienced Homelessness: Findings from an Exploratory Study.	We report results of a workforce initiative to increase functional screenings for older adults with lived experiences of homelessness. Thirty-four healthcare practitioners screened 253 patients ages 50 years + using a battery of screening tools aligned with the 4 Ms. Using secondary analyses, we describe practitioners' participation in the workforce initiative, patients' functional scores, and a qualitative analysis of "what matters" to patients. Many practitioners did not complete all screenings. Among patient respondents, 6% reported moderate to severe ADL impairment; 24% scored positive cognitive impairment; 32% reported being unable to walk 250 feet; 46% reported moderate to severe pain. Resilience strategies developed during homelessness "matter." Few participants reported impaired ADL performance, which may reflect levels of independence needed to survive homelessness or to maintain services while homelessness. Findings suggest a need for additional workforce training to increase functional screenings for older adults in this population.

40228543	A Randomized, Controlled Study Evaluating Effects of Saccharomyces boulardii in Adult Patients with Asthma.	To determine the potential benefit of adding <i>Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii</i>) probiotic supplementation to conventional treatments in asthmatic patients.In this randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial 50 asthmatic patients were enrolled. The eligible subjects received either <i>S. boulardii</i> (N=25) or placebo (N=25) added to conventional treatments for three months. Spirometry parameters (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and FEF 25-75%) and blood test parameters (CBC, eosinophil percentage, IgE, IL-5, ESR and CRP) were measured and compared at baseline and after treatment completion.The mean age was 39.22±12.55 years. As compared to baseline values, a significant improvement was noted in FEV1 in patients who received <i>S. boulardii</i> (<i>p</i>=0.026). Although the changes in FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, and FEF 25-75% were comparable between the study groups, the differences were not statistically significant (<i>p</i> ˃ 0.05). In addition, patients who received probiotic showed lower levels of IL-5 and IgE in comparison with patients who received placebo.Our findings showed that the addition of <i>S. boulardii</i> to conventional treatments partially improved the pulmonary function and was associated with reductions in IgE and IL-5 levels.
40228542	Therapeutic Potential of Sotagliflozin in Animal Models of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease with and without Diabetes.	Sotagliflozin, a dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor, enhances glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels and GLP-1 receptor agonists are used to manage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Study investigates the effects of sotagliflozin on NAFLD, alone and combined with linagliptin, comparing outcomes in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic animal models.Obese fatty liver disease (FLD) model was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, while a diabetic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model was developed by administering a single dose of streptozotocin to neonatal mice, followed by HFD feeding post-weaning. At termination of the study, parameters including biochemical markers, inflammatory cytokines, hepatic lipid content, and histopathology were assessed.In NASH mice, sotagliflozin and linagliptin reduced hepatic triglycerides by 60% and 44%, respectively, and cholesterol by 46% and 49%. Their combination further decreased triglycerides by 68.5% and cholesterol by 83.9%. In FLD mice, sotagliflozin and linagliptin reduced triglycerides by 33% and 17%, respectively, and cholesterol by 46% and 21%. Combination treatment offered no benefit, reducing triglycerides by 38% and cholesterol by 27%. Both the treatments improved plasma fibroblast growth factor 21, hepatic interlukin-6, glucose tolerance, steatosis and mitigated fat pad weight, but their combination did not show additional benefit. However, combination treatment demonstrated added benefit in modulating NAFLD activity score, liver enzymes, glycogenated hepatic nuclei, plasma glucose and active GLP-1 levels.Study underscores sotagliflozin's potential to mitigate NAFLD and highlights the benefit of combining it with linagliptin in hyperglycemic NASH model, which showed limited efficacy in normoglycemic FLD mice.
40228541	Levocabastine ameliorates cyclophosphamide-induced nephrotoxicity in Swiss albino mice via NF-κB/cleaved caspase-3/TGF-β signaling pathways.	Cyclophosphamide (CP) is a potent anticancer drug, but nephrotoxicity is one of the vital organ toxicities that it causes as a side effect. We tried to evaluate the nephroprotective effect of levocabastine (LEV) in CP-induced nephrotoxicity in Swiss albino mice. Mice were given CP 200 mg/kg, i.p., once on the 7<sup>th</sup> day. LEV (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and fenofibrate (FF) (80 mg/kg, p.o.) were given daily for 14 days. On the 15<sup>th</sup> day, animals were sacrificed and kidneys were removed for examination. The docking study showed significant binding of LEV and FF against TGF-β1, which is a prime target molecule involved in nephrotoxicity. CP 200 group showed nephrotoxicity in terms of oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis as manifested by decreased levels of SOD, catalase, GSH, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio, and increased TBARS, nitrite, TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β1, IL-1β, urea, uric acid, creatinine, and BUN. A decrease in body weight (BW) and an increase in kidney weight (KW) with an increased KW/BW ratio was also observed. Cleaved caspase-3 and NF-κB expression was also increased. Histopathological aberrations, like renal corpuscle damage, Bowman's space widening, glomerulus, mesangium cell disintegration, atrophic podocytes, vacuolation, and fibrotic changes were also seen. LEV 0.1 and FF 80 significantly reversed these changes toward normal and showed nephroprotective potential. Thus, seeing the protective effect of LEV on CP-intoxicated mice, we conclude that LEV may be used as an adjuvant with CP in cancer, however, it needs more studies with the direct cancer model to confirm the claim.
40228540	Patient Satisfaction in Functional Rhinoseptoplasty: The Role of Non-Surgical Factors.	Functional Rhinoseptoplasty (FRS) is a surgical procedure with both functional and aesthetic impacts, affecting patients' quality of life.

The Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaire is a useful tool for assessing patients' satisfaction once submitted to this surgery.
40228539	Therapeutic Potential of the Novel GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Semaglutide in Alcohol Use Disorder.	Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder with serious health and social consequences. However, few licensed and successful pharmacotherapies exist for heterogeneous and complex disorders such as AUD, and these are poorly utilized. Preclinical and clinical findings suggest that the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) system, a gut-brain peptide, is involved in the neurobiology of addictive behaviors. Additionally, the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has become a promising target for the treatment of AUD. Semaglutide, a novel GLP-1R agonist, has received clinical approval to treat type 2 diabetes in both subcutaneous and oral dosage forms. Studies have shown that it significantly reduces alcohol consumption and relapse of alcohol addiction in rats, suggesting its potential effectiveness for treating alcohol abuse in humans, particularly in overweight patients with AUDs. However, the use of semaglutide is associated with potential risks, such as gallbladder disease and clinical complications associated with delayed gastric emptying. This review evaluates the safety of semaglutide to inform its wider clinical application. Further extensive and in-depth studies on semaglutide are needed to reveal additional valuable clinical benefits.

40228537	A Neutral Glucan Extracted from Dried Ginger (Zingiberis Rhizoma): Preparation, Structure Characterization, and Immunomodulatory Activity.	A neutral glucan, GJ0D, was obtained from dried ginger (Zingiberis rhizoma) by enzymatic extraction and purification with column chromatography. The fine structure of GJ0D was assessed through monosaccharide composition analysis, methylation, and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. GJ0D has a relative molecular weight of 4.0 KDa and possesses a backbone consisting of 1,4-linked <i>α</i>-Glc<i>p</i> with substitution at C-6 of Glc<i>p</i> by T-Glc<i>p</i>. Immunoactivity assessment showed that GJ0D significantly upregulates the expression of IL-6, IL-1<i>β</i>, and TNF-<i>α</i> in RAW264.7 cells. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was also increased in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, the expression of several proteins associated with immune activation signaling pathways including TLR4, the phosphorylation of IKK<i>β</i>, and NF-<i>κ</i>B (p100 and p52) were significantly upregulated by GJ0D. These results suggest that GJ0D could promote inflammation through the TLR4/IKK<i>β</i>/P100 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential application as an immunomodulating agent.

The current study analyses the concrete reasons of the peers for non-reproducibility of sociomedical judgments concerning performance capability in these expert opinion reports.Free-text comments documented by peers in the peer review process 2021 of the German pension insurance with respect to shortcomings in the reproducibility of sociomedical judgments (n=569) were evaluated in a structured-inductive manner using Mayring's qualitative content analysis.Contentwise the reasons for the non-reproducibility of sociomedical judgments in these expert opinion reports comprise recurrent shortcomings in anamnesis/clinical assessment, specifically with respect to confirmation of diagnosis, as well as gaps/inconsistencies in the chain of arguments concerning sociomedical evaluation of performance capability.Identification of these reasons concretizes the complexity of the sociomedical evaluation process, allows sharpening of the content expectations towards the expert consultants and further sensitizes readers to assessment of the sociomedical key aspects in expert reports.
40228533	Assessing the time required for qualitative analysis: A comparative methodological study of coding interview data in health services research.	A reliable estimation of required resources is essential for sound research. So far, there have only been a few studies on researchers' time investment in qualitative studies. The aim of this study, therefore, was to provide an empirical account of the estimation of timescales of qualitative analysis.In this methodological study, time expenditure was documented and compared for the focused coding of transcripts of semi-structured interviews within five qualitative studies in health services research. Data were analyzed descriptively by means of absolute frequencies.Across studies, focused coding was assessed in 94 interviews with a total interview duration of 52 hours and 44 minutes. The number of interviews per study ranged from n=11 to n=27, with a mean duration of 36 minutes. Total coding time amounted to 76 hours, with a mean of 32 min per interview. Coding time per interview time ratio ranged from 0.75 to 1.52 minutes. On average, the time spent on focused coding roughly corresponds to the duration of the interviews. Focused coding tended to get quicker over time, though variation among studies was high.The results of this study provide a reference for estimating timescales of qualitative analysis and highlights the importance of considering factors such as composition of data and researchers' experience and involvement. In a specific research project, this effort must be balanced against the objective of the analysis, including the desired accuracy, detail and depth. Further research is needed to specify how specific parameters (i. e. nature of the study population, method of data analysis and use of concepts and theories) affect coding in qualitative analysis.
40228532	[The greatest potential for reducing the workload of physicians through digital care applications (DiPAs) lies within the age group of 50 to 65 years].	The first digital care application (DiPA) was expected to be approved in 2024 for use by individuals in need of care who live at home. DiPAs must demonstrate benefits like improved mobility, cognitive and communicative skills, and self-care abilities. They can provide direct care or support caregiving relatives. If effective, DiPAs could reduce the need for home visits by medical professionals, easing their workload. This study identifies the age group that could benefit most from DiPAs, using data from digital health application (DiGA) prescriptions as an indicator.Using billing data from ambulatory physicians under §295 SGB V, we determined the number of adults in Germany insured under statutory health insurance for whom a DiGA prescription was billed by their ambulatory physicians between March 2021 and December 2022. The fourth quarter of 2022, with the highest number of available DiGAs, was compared with home visit data using corresponding billing codes.The billing of DiGA prescriptions from ambulatory physicians increased from 6,660 in the second quarter of 2021 to 32,546 in the fourth quarter of 2022. DiGAs were more commonly prescribed to younger and middle-aged adults, peaking at ages 30 and 56, while home visits were more frequent among older adults, peaking at ages 61 and 83.The steady rise in DiGA prescriptions suggests growing acceptance among physicians and patients. This trend, particularly among younger and middle-aged adults, indicates that DiPAs could also gain acceptance. The second age peak for DiGA prescriptions pertains to the age group of approximately 50 to 65 years, which overlaps with the first age peak for home visits. Therefore, DiPAs should focus on the 50-65 age group for maximum physician workload relief, with later adjustments made for older age groups. Involving stakeholders in development could enhance trust.
40228530	Mapping the Caregiver Experience: Predicting Dimensions of Caregiver Strain Through Task-Based Profiles.	<b>Objective:</b> Family caregiving is a prevalent, diverse, and often challenging experience. We develop caregiving activity profiles to better understand how sets of care-tasks contribute to various aspects of strain.<b>Methods:</b> Using diary data from a survey of 213 family caregivers in the U.S., we perform latent class analysis to group commonly occurring care-related tasks into activity profiles. We then use these classifications to predict physical, financial, and emotional strain.<b>Main Findings:</b> We identified 4 unique activity profiles based on a set of 36 daily caregiving activities performed. Activity profiles varied significantly across the three analyzed strain dimensions.<b>Conclusion:</b> Activity profiles present opportunities to better understand how caregiving tasks are related to specific types kinds of caregiving strain.
40228529	Bornavirus (BoDV-1) Encephalitis in Children: Update on Diagnosis and Treatment.	Infectious encephalitis in children can be caused by several pathogens, very rarely this can be caused by bornaviruses (BoDV-1). Due to the recent discovery of the disease in humans and the small number of cases, especially pediatric infections, knowledge about the disease pathology as well as therapeutic options is limited. Therefore, this review shall help raise awareness of this rare and mostly fatal disease, promote an early diagnosis, and present current knowledge about possible treatment options.
40228528	A Quantitative Relationship Between Electron Localization Function and the Strength of Physical Binding.	The electron localization function (ELF) measures electron localization within matter and provides insights into the nature of bonds in materials and molecules. This study examines the relationship between ELF and binding energy in bimolecular systems, focusing on van der Waals interactions, including Keesom forces, Debye forces, and London dispersion forces. These interactions play significant roles in crystalline molecular materials. This work addresses the challenge of accurately calculating binding energies in molecular materials and supramolecular synthons by exploring their correlation with ELF. We use density functional theory (DFT) with seven exchange-correlation functionals to identify which functional provides the most accurate binding energies in comparison to values obtained with coupled cluster, while balancing precision and computational efficiency. The findings revealed that rev-vdW-DF2 offers high precision, whereas PBE-D3(BJ) is computationally efficient. These functionals were utilized to demonstrate how ELF can be effectively employed to accurately determine binding energies. By analyzing the ELF and its correlation with binding energies in 95 bimolecular systems held together with physical bindings ranging from weak to strong interactions, we demonstrate a strong linear correlation, with a coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) reaching 0.960. These findings suggest that ELF can effectively differentiate between weak and strong van der Waals interactions, providing a reliable quantitative metric for evaluating interaction strengths. The results indicate that ELF can be used as method to determine the strength of intermolecular interactions, with potential applications in materials science. The main contribution of this work is the exploration of methodologies for analyzing and predicting molecular interaction strengths within molecular materials and supramolecular synthons. Deriving binding energies within the unit cell directly from the ELF has the potential to simplify practical calculations. Furthermore, the study revealed a possible systematic error for current xc-functionals in describing systems with double O--H···O hydrogen bonds between interacting molecules.
40228526	Modeling and measurement of lead tip heating in implanted wires with loops.	&#xD;In MRI, conductive lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition is an important safety issue for patients with implanted devices. In this work we investigate lead tip heating in different wire configurations that contain loop(s) through theoretical models and experimental measurements.&#xD;Approach:&#xD;We have previously proposed analytical transfer function models to predict relative heating of implanted, straight metallic leads. Here we extend the models' application to leads containing loops, that are widely used in the clinic. Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on twenty (20) insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation.&#xD;Main Results:&#xD;Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. In a typical MRI configuration where the RF electric field is predominantly in the superior/inferior (S/I) direction, wires oriented in the same direction showed decreased heating as the number of loops increased. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the corresponding component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating.&#xD;Significance:&#xD;The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the models' usefulness to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.&#xD.
40228524	Prdm16-dependent antigen-presenting cells induce tolerance to gut antigens.	The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microbes with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pTreg) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents<sup>1-4</sup>. While RORγt<sup>+</sup> antigen-presenting cells (RORγt-APCs) were shown to program gut microbiota-specific pTreg<sup>5-7</sup>, their definition remains incomplete, and the APC responsible for food tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we identify an APC subset required for differentiation of both food- and microbiota-specific pTreg cells and for establishment of oral tolerance. Development and function of these APCs require expression of the transcription factors Prdm16 and RORγt, as well as a unique Rorc(t) cis-regulatory element. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and surface marker analysis establish the pTreg-inducing APCs as myeloid in origin, distinct from ILC3, and sharing epigenetic profiles with classical dendritic cells (cDC), and designate them Prdm16<sup>+</sup> RORγt<sup>+</sup> tolerizing DC (tolDC). Upon genetic perturbation of tolDC, we observe a substantial increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cells in lieu of pTreg, leading to compromised tolerance in mouse models of asthma and food allergy. Single-cell analyses of freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, as well as multiple specimens of human intestine and tonsil, reveal candidate tolDC with co-expression of PRDM16 and RORC and an extensive transcriptome shared with mice, highlighting an evolutionarily conserved role across species. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how tolDC develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance.
40228521	Staged Versus Same-Day Circumferential Lumbar Fusion for Degenerative Disease: Which is the Safer Approach?	Study DesignRetrospective cohort study.ObjectivesTo evaluate utilization trends and outcomes of same-day vs staged circumferential lumbar fusion (cLF) in lumbar degenerative disease.MethodsThe PearlDiver national database was queried for patients with lumbar degenerative disease who underwent same-day or staged cLF, defined as anterior lumbar interbody fusion followed by posterior fusion within 1 to 14 days after. Annual utilization trends (2010-2021) were analyzed. Multivariate regression adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity index, obesity, smoking, and multi-level PSF was used to evaluate 30-day complications, readmissions, and revision rates at 1 and 2 years.ResultsOf 45,204 patients undergoing cLF, 40,052 (88.60%) underwent same-day cLF, and 5152 (11.40%) underwent staged procedures. Patients who underwent staged procedures had higher comorbidity rates and longer fusion constructs. Annual utilization of staged cLF increased on average by 3.76% from 2010. Staged procedures had higher risks of 30-day readmissions (aOR: 1.14), infection (aOR: 1.38), DVT (aOR: 2.62), epidural hematoma (aOR: 1.73), seroma (aOR:1.77), AKI (aOR: 1.34), cardiac arrest (aOR: 2.45), blood loss anemia (aOR: 1.56), urinary retention (aOR: 1.50), UTI (aOR: 1.36), ileus (aOR: 1.64), durotomy (aOR: 4.67), mechanical complications (aOR: 3.39), and blood transfusions (aOR: 2.57) (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). No significant differences in revision rates were found.ConclusionStaged cLF, utilized in 11.40% of cases, particularly for longer fusions and patients with higher comorbidity risk, is associated with higher risks of hospital readmissions and complications, but is not an independent risk factor. Further research is needed to identify patients who may benefit most from staging.
40228520	Injectable microgel and micro-granular hydrogels for bone tissue engineering.	Injectable microgels, made from both natural and synthetic materials, are promising platforms for the encapsulation of cells or bioactive agents, such as drugs and growth factors, for delivery to injury sites. They can also serve as effective micro-scaffolds in bone tissue engineering, offering a supportive environment for cell proliferation or differentiation into osteoblasts. Microgels can be injected in the injury sites individually or in the form of aggregated/jammed ones named micro-granular hydrogels. This review focuses on common materials and fabrication techniques for preparing injectable microgels, as well as their characteristics and applications in bone tissue engineering. These applications include their use as cell carriers, delivery systems for bioactive molecules, micro-granular hydrogels, bio-inks for bioprinting, 3D microarrays, and the formation of microtissues. Furthermore, we discuss the current and potential future applications of microgels in bone tissue regeneration.&#xD.
40228519	A survey of dosimetry quality assurance practice at UK small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) facilities.	Improvements in preclinical radiation research have been made to better mimic the equipment and techniques implemented in the clinic. The development of dedicated small animal radiation units facilitates such advances by combining treatment planning, image guidance and conformal delivery. One area significantly behind its clinical equivalent are standardised dosimetry quality assurance (QA) protocols, hampering the translatability of results into the development of clinical interventions. &#xD;Approach: The aim of the study described herein was to summarise the current QA procedures implemented at several institutions on Small Animal Radiation Research Platforms (SARRPs), the system used by the six institutions surveyed, and to determine the barriers to implementing a standard dosimetry protocol. Participants at UK research institutions were invited to complete a questionnaire to ascertain their current preclinical QA practice. &#xD;Main results: All participants involved undertake regular dose output measurements and most perform image guidance QA measurements. Consistency in QA procedures differed when more complex plan verification or end-to-end testing was discussed. &#xD;Significance: This survey demonstrates that, although improvements are being made in the awareness of the importance of regular dosimetry tests, there is still a way to go to standardise the procedures with regards to more complex verifications. Incorporating robust QA procedures and strict dose constraints would ensure the reliability and ethical integrity of experiments involving small animals. This approach not only protects the welfare of the animals but also enhances the quality and reproducibility of the preclinical results.
40228518	Investigating the Role of Blood Models in Predicting Rupture Status of Intracranial Aneurysms.	&#xD;Selecting patients with a high-risk intracranial aneurysm (IA) is of clinical importance. Recent work in machine learning-based (ML) predictive modeling has demonstrated that lesion-specific hemodynamics within IAs can be combined with other information to provide critical insights for assessing rupture risk. However, how the adoption of blood rheology models (i.e., Newtonian and Non-Newtonian blood models) may influence ML-based predictive modeling of IA rupture risk has not been investigated.&#xD;Methods and Materials.&#xD;In this study, we conducted transient CFD simulations using Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheology models on a large cohort of "patient-specific" IA geometries (> 100) under pulsatile flow conditions to investigate how each blood model may affect the characterization of the IAs' rupture status. Key hemodynamic parameters were analyzed and compared, including wall shear stress (WSS) and vortex-based parameters. In addition, velocity-informatics features extracted from the flow velocity were utilized to train a support vector machine (SVM) model for rupture status prediction.&#xD;Results.&#xD;Our findings demonstrate significant differences between the two models regarding the WSS-related metrics. In contrast, the parameters derived from the flow vortices and velocity informatics agree. Similar to other studies, using a non-Newtonian model results in lower peak WSS and higher oscillatory shear index (OSI) values. Furthermore, integrating velocity informatics and machine learning achieved robust performance for both blood models (area under the curve [AUC] ˃0.85).&#xD;Conclusions.&#xD;Our preliminary study found that ML-based rupture status prediction derived from velocity informatics and geometrical parameters yielded comparable results despite differences observed in aneurysmal hemodynamics using two blood rheology models.&#xD.
40228517	Zr-doped porous Ni2P nanoarray as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline seawater.	The utilization of seawater electrolysis is recognized as a promising method for generating hydrogen as a substitute for conventional technology. Herein, the electrodes were fabricated by in-situ growth of Zr-Ni2P arrays on a nickel foam substrate (Zr-Ni2P/NF) through a low-temperature hydrothermal and phosphating process. The Zr-Ni2P/NF can achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline seawater electrolyte. This Zr-Ni2P/NF shows overpotentials as low as 197 and 274 mV at 100 and 500 mA cm-2 for HER in alkaline seawater, respectively. Moreover, it exhibits strong stability for at least 50 hours of electrolysis at a current density of 500 mA cm-2 in alkaline seawater with the overpotential attenuation of 38 mV. The excellent performance and hierarchical structure advantages of Zr-Ni2P/NF provide new ideas for designing efficient seawater splitting electrocatalysts.&#xD.
40228502	COVID-19 Factors Associated With Medication Changes Among Nursing Home Residents With Dementia.	This study examined associations of COVID-19 mortality rates, staffing, and resident behavior with changes in antidementia and psychotropic medication initiation among nursing home (NH) residents with dementia. A nationally representative survey of Directors of Nursing was analyzed to assess changes in medication initiation at the peak of the pandemic. NHs with higher COVID-19 mortality rates were less likely to report increases in antidementia medication initiation. COVID-19 mortality rates were not associated with significant increases or decreases in psychotropic initiation. NH's that reported increased resident behavioral problems during the pandemic had higher odds of psychotropic initiation. In summary, NHs most affected by COVID-19 deaths were less likely than NHs with a milder pandemic experience to increase initiation of antidementia medications. Increased behavioral symptoms, possibly due to consequences of COVID-19, were associated with more psychotropic drug use. More research is needed to understand factors influencing prescribing practices during public health emergencies.
40228499	CONSORT 2025 Statement: Updated Guideline for Reporting Randomized Trials.	Well-designed and properly executed randomized trials are considered the most reliable evidence on the benefits of health care interventions. However, there is overwhelming evidence that the quality of reporting is not optimal. The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement was designed to improve the quality of reporting and provides a minimum set of items to be included in a report of a randomized trial. CONSORT was first published in 1996, then updated in 2001 and 2010. Herein, we present the updated CONSORT 2025 statement, which aims to account for recent methodological advancements and feedback from end users.
40228498	Assessment of myocardial dysfunction of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus based on myocardial perfusion imaging and analysis of potential influencing factors.	The incidence and prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have increased annually over the past decade. The involvement of myocardium is one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with SLE. Identifying myocardial involvement in patients with autoimmune diseases and providing early targeted treatment can improve patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate myocardial dysfunction in patients with SLE using <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MIBI rest gated myocardial perfusion imaging (rGMPI) and to investigate factors associated with myocardial dysfunction. 76 patients with SLE were prospectively enrolled in the study and 46 patients without autoimmune diseases or other inflammatory diseases who had undergone <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MIBI rGMPI were selected as a control group. Results of relevant blood test indicators, echocardiography and rGMPI were recorded, and comparison was made between the two groups. Meanwhile, based on diagnostic results of rGMPI, SLE patients were divided into myocardial dysfunction group and normal myocardial function group and to analyze the influencing factors of myocardial dysfunction in SLE patients. The incidence of myocardial dysfunction was significantly higher in SLE patients than in controls (30.3% vs 0%, 2= 16.131, <i>p</i> < .001). Moderate/severe disease activity, decreased myocardial perfusion and positive anti-SSA/Ro52kDa antibody were associated with impaired myocardial function in SLE patients (OR = 2.753, 5.359, 3.646; <i>p</i> = .049, 0.015, 0.014). Positive anti-SSA/Ro52kDa antibody was is independently correlated with myocardial dysfunction in SLE patients [OR (95% CI) = 3.159 (1.071-9.316), <i>p</i> = .037]. In conclusion, <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MIBI rGMPI can noninvasively evaluate myocardial dysfunction in patients with SLE and provide evidence for clinical treatment decisions. Positive anti-SSA/Ro52kDa antibody was an independent risk factor for myocardial dysfunction in SLE patients.
40228497	Impact of food, beverage, and alcohol brand marketing on consumptive behaviors and health in children and adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Exposure to unhealthy food, beverage, and alcohol marketing can contribute to inadequate diet and excess alcohol consumption, both risk factors for diet-related non-communicable diseases including obesity and cancer. By not featuring specific products, brand-only marketing strategies circumvent restrictions that assess healthiness at the product level and restrict accordingly. Currently, there is no global or national government policy that explicitly addresses brand marketing for unhealthy products linked to diet-related non-communicable diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes contemporary evidence on the effects of food, beverage, and alcohol brand-marketing on diet-related cognitive outcomes (preference, choice), diet-related behavioral outcomes (purchase requests, purchase, consumption), and health-related outcomes (body weight, body mass index, obesity) in children and adults. Included studies manipulated acute marketing exposure, with at least one brand-only marketing condition. Fourteen databases were searched (including MEDLINE and PubMed) for articles published from January 2004 to February 2024. Nineteen eligible studies were identified and assessed for bias; five were included in the meta-analysis assessing effects on consumption. Findings from the review suggest brand marketing for food, beverages, and alcohol can influence preference, choice, and purchase intent. The meta-analysis found no evidence of a significant effect of brand-only marketing on consumption. Overall, evidence was limited and of mixed quality so further robust research is needed to inform regulatory action. Government policies for reducing brand-only marketing are needed to protect vulnerable populations from brand marketing promoting unhealthy consumption behaviors that increase the risk of non-communicable disease.

40228495	Living donor liver transplantation for neo-adjuvant treated, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (LIVINCA): study protocol for a one-armed, mono-centric, non-randomized trial.	Background Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has demonstrated a consistently increasing incidence in recent years. In cases of unresectability, palliative chemotherapy often remains the only option, typically associated with a poor prognosis. Liver transplantation might be an option for otherwise unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. We aim to conduct a prospective, non-randomized study to further explore the effects of living-donor liver transplantation in the treatment of unresectable neoadjuvant treated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Methods Patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma having a stable disease or tumor regression after systemic chemotherapy without an extrahepatic tumor burden are suitable for study inclusion. For a local control of the tumor, an additional local-ablative therapy in means of a selective internal radio-therapy is mandatory. The main concept of the surgical procedure is a liver transplantation using the left (segments II - IV) or the right lobe (segments V - VIII) of a living donor. In oncosurgical optimal conditions, a two-staged hepatectomy combined with the (initially) auxiliary transplantation of a left-lateral lobe of a living donor is the possible. Results The patient recruitment will start in September 2024. Conclusion The design of the LIVINCA study may provide patients with otherwise unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma a chance for a curative treatment option. This procedure does not reduce the deceased donor organ supply because living donation is the primary treatment option in these patients. Trial registration Registered at Clinical Trials; NCT06539377; registered on August 6, 2024.

The estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) is a useful indicator of insulin resistance (IR). This study explores its association with cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM), a relationship that has been rarely investigated. The aim of this research is to examine potential correlations between eGDR and CKM.
40228493	Addressing Renal sodium avidity in Chronic Heart Failure: There's always more than one way to skin a cat.	Renal sodium avidity, a hallmark of chronic cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), is characterized by persistent sodium retention despite significant fluid overload. This resistance to natriuresis and diuresis exacerbates volume overload, contributes to hemodynamic instability, and accelerates the decline of cardiac and renal function, presenting a critical challenge in long-term CRS management. Conventional diuretic therapies, while effective during acute decompensations, often fail in chronic settings due to neurohormonal activation, renal tubular adaptations, and diuretic resistance. Innovative approaches targeting sodium regulation, including sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, and extracorporeal techniques such as hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), offer promising alternatives. HD and PD provide precise sodium and fluid removal, bypassing many limitations of pharmacological therapies, with PD showing particular efficacy in refractory cases by preserving residual renal function and enhancing diuretic responsiveness. This review focuses on strategies to overcome resistance to natriuresis and diuresis in patients with chronic CRS. By exploring the underlying pathophysiology, limitations of current therapies, and the potential of advanced interventions like ultrafiltration (UF) through HD and PD, we propose a multidisciplinary and personalized approach to breaking the pathological cycle of sodium retention and fluid overload, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. As the saying goes, "there's always more than one way to skin a cat.

40228490	Integral Theory Paradigm- common pelvic ligament pathogenesis guides management for Urology, Gynecology, Coloproctology.	Background The pathophysiology behind this work is the same as for the midurethral sling: collagen-deficient ligaments weaken the closure muscles which contract against them; precise insertion of tapes in the anatomical position of the ligaments (PUL) create new collagen to restore function and cure symptoms. Aims/methods To briefly describe how the same collagen-creating system applied to PUL and other ligaments such as uterosacral, can treat common symptoms from Urology, Gynecology, Coloproctology. VIDEO 1 describes 16 practical applications of this system to cure bladder/bowel/pain and tethered vagina syndrome dysfunctions. Results Collagen-induced laxity in ligaments and vagina diminishes contractile forces required by pelvic muscles to close urethra and anus for continence; open them for evacuation; stretch bladder base and rectum like a trampoline to prevent stretch receptors prematurely activating micturition and defecation reflexes, perceived cortically as bladder or fecal "urge to go". The pictorial algorithm summarizes common ligament pathogeneses for prolapse/bladder/bowel/pain dysfunctions, which can be confirmed by mechanical support of PUL for relief of urine loss on coughing, and uterosacral ligaments (USL) for relief of urge and chronic pelvic pain. The same minimally-invasive ligament repairs used for SUI, prolapse, pain/bladder dysfunctions were demonstrated by xray defecography controlled studies to cure fecal incontinence, obstructive defecation, anterior rectal wall intussusception and descending perineal syndrome.

40228488	Nutrition for Preconception Health and Fertility.	The importance of preconception care is now widely recognised. Optimisation of the lifestyle, nutrition, and the health of a couple not only affects the chances of conception and a successful pregnancy but also the health of the resulting offspring. Currently, limited data reinforce the importance of further research examining the role of individual nutrients. The complex interactions that these nutrients have with each other and the resultant effect on fertility should also be a focus for future investigation. Modifiable risk factors such as alcohol, caffeine, and body mass index should be optimised prior to attempting to conceive. New research is examining the role of personalised preconception advice.
40228487	Cholesterol levels as a predictive marker for ICU survival in patients with cardiogenic shock supported by VenoArterial ExtraCorporeal membrane oxygenation.	BackgroundVeno-Arterial Extracorporeal Life Support (VA ECMO) is a critical intervention for patients with cardiogenic shock, serving as bridge to recovery, transplantation, or long-term therapies. The complexity of VA ECMO and its associated risks underscore the need for reliable prognostic markers to guide patient management. This study aimed to evaluate whether cholesterol levels could serve as a specific marker for ICU survival in patients with cardiogenic shock treated with VA ECMO.MethodsA retrospective observational study was conducted at Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, The Netherlands, between January 2013 and November 2019. Data from 67 patients treated with VA ECMO were analyzed. Cholesterol levels were measured daily from day 1 to day 5 after VA ECMO initiation. Demographic data, comorbidities, and outcomes were extracted from the patient data management system. Statistical analysis was performed, with a focus on non-normality of data distribution and the predictive value of cholesterol levels on ICU survival.ResultsThe study identified a significant association between higher cholesterol levels on the first day of VA ECMO treatment and increased ICU survival. A cholesterol threshold of 2.0 mmol/L was found to be an independent predictor of survival, with patients above this threshold having a higher survival rate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the significance of this cholesterol threshold in predicting ICU survival.ConclusionCholesterol levels measured on the first day after the initiation of VA ECMO are a significant indicator of ICU survival in patients with cardiogenic shock. A threshold of 2.0 mmol/L is particularly predictive, offering a potential prognostic tool for clinicians managing these critically ill patients.
40228486	STREAMLINE - Retrospective Cohort Study of FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3-Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Real-World Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes of Patients in First Relapse or Refractory Diagnosis.	Background Recent advances in genomic research have expanded the treatment landscape for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study examined treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among relapsed/refractory (R/R) FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutated AML patients. Patients and Methods This retrospective longitudinal study included patients with confirmed AML diagnosis, FLT3 mutation, and 1st R/R event from 1/1/2015-1/31/2023 in the ConcertAI Oncology Dataset. Treatment patterns, FLT3 testing rates, real-world overall survival (rwOS), and real-world time to next treatment (rwTTNT) were studied. Results Among the 336 treated patients, 50.6% received FLT3-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FLT3-TKIs) as first treatment after R/R event, of which 51.8% received gilteritinib. High-intensity chemotherapy used as first treatment after R/R event decreased from 67.9% in 2015 to 20.0% in 2022, while FLT3-TKI utilization rose to 50% over the same period. Among the 246 patients tested for FLT3 at initial AML diagnosis, only 36% were retested at 1st R/R event. Median rwOS and rwTTNT among FLT3-TKI patients were 12.4 months and 2.9 months, respectively. Conclusion This study reveals a trend toward increasing FLT3-TKI use and highlights the need for repeated FLT3 testing among R/R AML patients. Real-world evidence is vital in understanding R/R AML patient care amidst emerging therapies.
40228485	The moderating effect of tobacco smoking on the efficacy of a computer-based brief alcohol intervention: Results from a randomized controlled trial.	Alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking may have synergistic harmful effects when present in combination. This combination is highly prevalent and associated with a multitude of diseases. Brief alcohol intervention (BAI) may be less effective among persons who drink alcohol and smoke tobacco than among persons who drink alcohol and do not smoke. The aim of this study was to find out whether BAI is more effective among adults who do not smoke than among those who smoke.

40228482	Prognosis and Therapy of Ovarian Cancer, Part 1: Patient selection and surgical management in advanced ovarian cancer: what tools do we have to make the right decision?	Ovarian cancer is the gynecological cancer with the worst overall survival worldwide. Around 70% of patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage. Since low residual tumor after surgery has been repeatedly observed to deeply affect survival, the achievement of a complete resection of tumor with no macroscopic residual disease through primary debulking surgery (PDS) has become the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer.
40228481	End-stage chronic kidney disease affects serum Nostrin turnover.	Serum Nostrin was recently identified as novel predictor of important clinical outcomes in acute kidney injury (AKI) and has also emerged as a predictor of recovery of kidney function (ROKF) in AKI patients. ROKF is a critical factor for the transition of AKI into chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore the aim of the present study was to evaluate serum Nostrin levels in CKD patients.
40228480	Intratumoral Holmium-166 Microsphere Injection in Patients with Unresectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: a Single-Center, Single-Arm, Open-Label Feasibility and Safety Study.	Introduction Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis and lacks local treatment options. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of the first-in-human intraoperative ultrasound-guided intratumoral injection of radioactive holmium-166 microsphere in patients with PDAC. Methods Patients with proven PDAC eligible for open surgical resection were included. If resection was abandoned during exploration, study intervention was performed. Feasibility was defined by injection success and on/off-target radiation. Safety was based on adverse event (AE) monitoring for 12 weeks categorized by severity grade and study attribution. Results Three of the thirteen included patients received study intervention. Injection was successful in all three patients. Mean tumor doses of 5.0, 17.0 and 39.0 Gy and maximum tumor doses of 25.0, 41.0 and 256.0 Gy were achieved. Off-target radiation was found once in the lungs and once in the colon with a mean dose <1.0 Gy. There were no AEs with high study attribution, 16, 14 and 19 AEs with low study attribution, including 3, 2 and 4 AEs with grade ≥3. Holmium-166 microspheres appeared hyperdense on CT. Conclusion Intratumoral injection of holmium-166 microspheres in patients with unresectable PDAC seems feasible and safe. Research into minimally invasive image-guided application is advised.
40228479	Membrane Permeability of Cyclic and Linear Peptides, a Halogenated Antisickling Molecule, and Water Across a Red Blood Cell Bilayer Model.	We studied through molecular dynamics and inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion theory the permeability of several cyclic peptides (CPs) recently proposed as potential antisickling drugs, across a red blood cell (RBC) membrane model. The permeability of the CPs is compared to that of a linear precursor, a highly charged CP, a high permeability halogenated antisickling molecule (PD150606), and water. The influence of cholesterol (45% of the membrane) is assessed through comparison with the permeability across a homogeneous lipid bilayer. The most promising CPs concerning their potential antisickling activity depict the highest permeabilities, only exceeded by PD150606. The permeability of a hydrophobic CP is four decades higher than its linear precursor despite noncovalent cyclization in the interior of the membrane. Further, cholesterol is found to significantly reduce the permeability of water and a model CP, while not influencing that of PD150606. The influence of the water model is also investigated.
40228478	The role of peritubular capillaritis in severity of lupus nephritis.	Background & ObjectivePresence of lupus nephritis is associated with a shorter time to death in systemic lupus erythematosus. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of peritubular capillaritis (ptc) and its relationship with both active and chronic lesions in lupus nephritis.Material-MethodsSpecimens from 57 patients were re-evaluated. The degree of inflammation within the peritubular capillaries in each biopsy was assessed according to the Banff classification, and ptc scoring was performed. Additionally, patients were grouped based on high/low activity and chronicity index scores.ResultsForty-five (78.9%) of the patients were female, with a mean age of 27.43 years. Ptc was identified in 45 (78.9%) patients, with ptc scores of 1, 2, and 3 observed in 20 (35.08%), 20 (35.08%), and 5 (8.7%) patients, respectively. Severe ptc (scores 2 or 3) was more commonly detected in patients with elevated serum creatinine (>1.20 mg/dL) compared to those with normal creatinine levels (92.3% vs 29.5%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The severity of ptc was higher in Class 4 patients than in Class 3 patients (68.2% vs 21.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.005). The rate of high ptc scores was greater in patients with an activity index of 6 or above compared to those with an activity index below 6 (62.5% vs 30.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.032). No significant correlation was found between the chronicity index and ptc.ConclusionsThe findings of this study suggest that ptc is a frequently observed pathological feature in patients with lupus nephritis. Furthermore, the severity of ptc appears to be positively associated with elevated serum creatinine levels, and higher ptc scores are more commonly detected in cases with a high activity index.
40228477	CONSORT 2025 statement: Updated guideline for reporting randomised trials.	Well designed and properly executed randomised trials are considered the most reliable evidence on the benefits of healthcare interventions. However, there is overwhelming evidence that the quality of reporting is not optimal. The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement was designed to improve the quality of reporting and provides a minimum set of items to be included in a report of a randomised trial. CONSORT was first published in 1996, then updated in 2001 and 2010. Here, we present the updated CONSORT 2025 statement, which aims to account for recent methodological advancements and feedback from end users.

40228320	Association Between Erythromycin or Clindamycin Resistance and 30-Day Mortality in Patients With MSSA Bacteremia.	<b>Objectives:</b> The objective of the present study is to assess the association of erythromycin and clindamycin susceptibilities with 30-day mortality in patients with MSSA bacteremia treated with cefazolin. <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective cohort study of patients with least one positive blood culture growing MSSA and treated with cefazolin for at least 3 consecutive days. Groups included patients who had an MSSA strain that was both erythromycin and clindamycin susceptible (E/C-S), the comparator group included patients with erythromycin resistant and clindamycin resistant or susceptible (E/C-R) MSSA strains. The relative risk for 30-day mortality was calculated for E/C-R compared to E/C-S along with the sensitivity and specificity for E/C-R as a predictor of 30-day mortality. <b>Results:</b> A total of 114 patients were eligible for analysis; with 72 (63%) categorized in the E/C-S group and 42 (37%) categorized in the E/C-R group. The primary outcome of 30-day mortality was met in 7 (10%) patients in the E/C-S group vs 7 (17%) in the E/C-R group; unadjusted relative risk (95% CI) 1.71 (0.65-4.55). The sensitivity and specificity of E/C-R as a predictor of 30-day mortality was 50% (95% CI = 23-77) and 65% (95% CI = 55-74), respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> This exploratory study did not find clindamycin or erythromycin susceptibility to be associated with 30-day mortality in patients treated with cefazolin for MSSA bacteremia. The relevance of this surrogate marker in clinical practice is negligible due to its limitations, and future investigations are required to establish pragmatic means of detecting isolates which may be insufficiently treated with cefazolin.

40228317	Discovery of Polyketides and Alkaloids From the Mangrove Endophytic Fungus Diaporthe sp. and Their Anti-Osteoclastogenic Bioactivities.	Two new compounds, 5-methoxymethylmellein (1) and 6-benzyl-2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methylpyradine (2), along with nine known compounds (3-11), were obtained from the mangrove endophytic fungus Diaporthe sp. SCSIO 41011. Their structures were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analysis and by comparison with literature. The absolute configuration of 1 was assigned by electronic circular dichroism calculations. The structure of naturally rare compound 2 was unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Notably, compound 4 displayed inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear factor kappa B in RAW264.7 macrophages at 20 µM. It further dose-dependently suppressed receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand-induced osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow macrophage cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 19.0 µM, without observed cytotoxicity. Our findings provided 4 as a promising lead compound for the treatment of osteolytic diseases.
40228316	Evaluation of the efficacy of a biomimetic peptide solution for rejuvenation of donor scalp and as storage media for hair follicle grafts during FUE hair transplantation.	Androgenetic alopecia significantly affects individuals' quality of life, creating a need for better therapeutic strategies. Hair transplant surgery plays a key role in treating hair loss, with adjuncts like PRP and meso-cocktails explored to enhance results and procedure longevity. A prospective, single-blind study involved 112 males aged 25-50 years with Norwood-Hamilton grade IV-VI alopecia. Patients were randomly divided into two groups receiving different transplant methods. In Stage I, hair condition was evaluated, and QR678 Neo® was administered intradermally in Group A. Stage II involved hair transplantation surgery with diluted QR678 Neo® for graft preservation. Post-transplantation (Stage III) included additional QR678 Neo® administration in Group A. Evaluation methods consisted of global photographic assessment and videomicroscopy to measure hair growth and density. Group A (QR678 Neo®) demonstrated significant improvements in regrowth, density, and shaft diameter compared to Group B (conventional transplant). By Stage III, Group A had higher Global Photographic Assessment scores (8.87) and terminal hair count (181.02), with statistically significant differences (<i>p</i> < .001). The study suggests that QR678 Neo® improves outcomes and offers a promising treatment option for androgenetic alopecia.
40228314	Scaling Up and Enhancing the Functionality of the Electronic Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response System in Uganda, 2020-2022: Description of the Journey, Challenges, and Lessons Learned.	In 2017, Uganda implemented an electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response System (eIDSR) to improve data completeness and reporting timelines. However, the eIDSR system had limited functionality and was implemented on a small scale. The Ministry of Health, with support from the Infectious Disease Institute, Makerere University, and Health Information Systems Program Uganda, upgraded the system functionality and scaled up its implementation. This study describes the process and impact of upgrading eIDSR functionality and expanding its implementation across additional districts. The Ministry of Health, through its Integrated Epidemiology, Surveillance & Public Health Emergency Department, coordinated the implementation of the eIDSR. User requirements were identified through consultations with national surveillance stakeholders. The feedback informed the design and development of the upgraded eIDSR functionalities. The eIDSR rollout followed a consultative workshop to create awareness of the system among stakeholders. A curriculum was developed, and a national training of trainers was conducted. These trainers cascaded the training to the district health teams, who later cascaded the training to health workers. The training adopted an on-site training approach, where a group of national or district trainers would train new users at their desks. The eIDSR system was upgraded to the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) 2.35 platform featuring faster reading and writing tracker data, handling over 100 concurrent users and enhanced case-based surveillance features on Android and web platforms. From October 2020 to September 2022, the eIDSR was rolled out in 68% (100/146) of districts. Additionally, the system permitted prompt reporting of signals of epidemic-prone diseases. Improving the functionality and the expanded geographical scope of the eIDSR system enhanced disease surveillance. Stakeholder commitment and leveraging existing structures will be needed to scale up eIDSR.
40228295	Highly Thermally Conductive Boron Nitride Fiber.	Innovative thermal management fiber materials have emerged as a solution to address thermal challenges across diverse fields, ranging from personal comfort and electronic device cooling to aerospace engineering. While graphene fiber is known for its higher thermal conductivity over conventional carbon fiber, boron nitride (BN) has received much less attention in its one-dimensional form, despite its combined high thermal conductivity and notable insulating properties. Previous studies have mainly focused on composite fibers with BN nanosheets embedded in a polymer matrix. In contrast, pure BN fibers and consequent thermal conductivity investigations on a single-fiber level have barely been reported. In this study, we report the fabrication of continuous, pure BN fibers via the polymer-derived ceramic approach and its studies as thermally conductive fillers. Comprehensive structural characterizations confirm fibers' high quality and purity without apparent contamination. With the big-MEMS method we developed, the thermal conductivity of the single BN fiber is precisely measured and reaches an impressive 54 W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, using a stacking-cutting method, the resulting vertically aligned BN fiber-reinforced epoxy composite demonstrates a thermal conductivity as high as 24 W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, showing immense potential for usage as a thermal interface material. This work explores the potential of pure BN fibers for electrically insulating thermal management applications.

40228244	Summarizing Online Patient Conversations Using Generative Language Models: Experimental and Comparative Study.	Social media is acknowledged by regulatory bodies (eg, the Food and Drug Administration) as an important source of patient experience data to learn about patients' unmet needs, priorities, and preferences. However, current methods rely either on manual analysis and do not scale, or on automatic processing, yielding mainly quantitative insights. Methods that can automatically summarize texts and yield qualitative insights at scale are missing.
40228243	Acoustic Features for Identifying Suicide Risk in Crisis Hotline Callers: Machine Learning Approach.	Crisis hotlines serve as a crucial avenue for the early identification of suicide risk, which is of paramount importance for suicide prevention and intervention. However, assessing the risk of callers in the crisis hotline context is constrained by factors such as lack of nonverbal communication cues, anonymity, time limits, and single-occasion intervention. Therefore, it is necessary to develop approaches, including acoustic features, for identifying the suicide risk among hotline callers early and quickly. Given the complicated features of sound, adopting artificial intelligence models to analyze callers' acoustic features is promising.
40228242	The EmpkinS-EKSpression Reappraisal Training Augmented With Kinesthesia in Depression: One-Armed Feasibility Study.	Harboring dysfunctional depressogenic cognitions contributes to the development and maintenance of depression. A central goal of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression is to invalidate such cognitions via cognitive reappraisal (CR). However, relatively low remission rates and high dropout rates in CBT demonstrate the need for further improvement. Potentially, the effects of CBT could be enhanced by addressing not only dysfunctional depressogenic cognitions but also body states associated with depression. This may be done, for example, by systematically pairing the invalidation of depressogenic cognitions with the performance of antidepressive kinesthesia.

However, existing digital health maturity models (DHMMs) primarily focus on technology and infrastructure, often neglecting critical communication components.
40228238	Reported Strategies by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations to Improve Access to Behavioral Health Services.	Policy Points Despite the growing role of managed care organizations (MCOs) in financing and delivering behavioral health services in Medicaid, little is known about MCO strategies to overcome critical access barriers and the factors influencing these strategies. Through semistructured interviews of 27 administrators and executives across 19 local, regional, and national Medicaid MCOs, we describe a number of reported approaches to enhance behavioral health access: 1) contracting with core groups of Medicaid-focused behavioral health providers to provide a substantial share of care, and 2) targeted strategies to enhance the existing workforce through outreach, training, and workforce support programs; rate enhancements; telehealth and mobile unit care models; and high-touch case management. Findings highlight MCO perspectives on barriers and facilitators of access to behavioral health care, as well potential strategies that hold promise for other MCOs. Future research should evaluate the outcomes associated with these strategies and identify best practices that can be adapted across MCOs.
40228237	Designing eHealth Interventions for Pediatric Emergency Departments: Protocol for a Usability Testing Study With Youth, Parent, and Clinician Participants.

40228236	Impact of an Alert-Based Inpatient Clinical Decision Support Tool to Prevent Drug-Induced Long QT Syndrome: Large-Scale, System-Wide Observational Study.	Prevention of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) has been the focus of many system-wide clinical decision support (CDS) tools, which can be directly embedded within the framework of the electronic health record system and triggered to alert in high-risk patients when a known QT-prolonging medication is ordered. Justification for these CDS systems typically lies in the ability to accurately predict which patients are at high risk; however, it is not always evident that identification of risk alone is sufficient for appropriate CDS implementation.
40228234	Pd/NBE-Catalyzed One-Pot Modular Synthesis of Tetrahydro-γ-carbolines.	Tetrahydro-γ-carbolines are especially outstanding fused heterocyclic ring systems possessing significant biological activities in the central nervous system. Here, using commercially available NBE derivatives (NBEs), we report an efficient protocol for the one-pot modular synthesis of 4-substituted tetrahydro-γ-carbolines via Catellani/aza-Michael addition cascade from easily available 3-iodo-1-tosyl-1<i>H</i>-indole, aziridines and olefins. This approach exhibits a wide substrate scope, good yields, scalability, and potential extension toward the synthesis of Mebhydroline analogues.
40228233	Predicting Remission in Anti-PLA2R Antibody-Associated Membranous Nephropathy: A Secondary Analysis of the GEMRITUX, MENTOR and STARMEN Trials.

40228231	High-Temperature Dynamic Organic Phosphorescence Based On Cyclodextrins Supramolecular Assemblies.	Dynamic organic phosphorescent materials present great potential for practical applications. But the temperature-sensitive nature of organic phosphors makes the development of high-temperature dynamic organic phosphorescence (HTDOP) a significant challenge. Herein, we report a HTDOP system assembled from β-cyclodextrins (β-CDs) and 4-diphenylamino-benzoic acid (TPAC). The TPAC@β-CDs complex system exhibits only short-lived fluorescence at room temperature but transitions to phosphorescence emission with an ultralong emission lifetime of up to 567 ± 13 ms upon heating. A mechanistic study combining spectroscopic analysis, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy revealed that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions effectively suppressed nonradiative relaxation of triplets even at temperature as high as 140 °C. Meanwhile, elevated temperatures also drive oxygen out of the system, significantly reducing quenching processes and ensuring the robust survival of HTDOP. Additionally, the introduction of fluorescent dyes permits color regulation of the afterglow from green to red through Förster resonance energy transfer from the triplet to the singlet state. Moreover, this system's fast and reliable response upon high temperature makes it an excellent candidate for overtemperature trace detection in electronic components and circuit diagnostics. This work discloses an effective strategy for constructing HTDOP systems that can be fully exploited in a range of fields.
40228230	Screening <i>Isodon rubescens</i>-Derived Vesicles Harvested at Different Periods as Carriers for the Treatment of Colitis-Associated Cancer.	Plant-derived extracellular vesicles are of great significance in practical applications due to their availability, low immunogenicity, and effective carrier performance. <i>Isodon rubescens</i>-derived vesicles (IRDVs) not only have the capability for drug-carrying targeted therapy but also exhibit certain anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects as part of traditional Chinese medicine. The harvest time is closely related to the quality of its medicinal ingredients; however, whether there are differences in the IRDVs harvested at different times has yet to be explored. Herein, we analyzed the morphology and chemical composition of IRDVs collected at different time points and identified six-month-harvested IRDVs as the most suitable delivery vector. To further enhance their therapeutic potential, we modified the IRDVs with deoxycholic acid to facilitate the oral delivery of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX). This novel nanotherapy, termed DOX-IRDVs@DA, was developed as an oral targeted treatment for colitis-associated cancer (CAC). The results demonstrated that DOX-IRDVs@DA effectively delivered DOX to colon tumor 26 (CT26) cells, induced cancer cell apoptosis by modulating apoptosis-related proteins, and inhibited the proliferation of CT26 cells. In vivo studies in a mouse model of CAC revealed that DOX-IRDVs@DA achieved superior targeted therapeutic effects, reducing the number of colonic nodules, restoring the structural integrity of the colon, and causing minimal systemic toxicity.
40228229	Static Subspace Approximation for Random Phase Approximation Correlation Energies: Applications to Materials for Catalysis and Electrochemistry.	Modeling complex materials using high-fidelity, ab initio methods at low cost is a fundamental goal for quantum chemical software packages. The GW approximation and random phase approximation (RPA) provide a unified description of both electronic structure and total energies using the same physics in a many-body perturbative approach that can be more accurate than generalized-gradient density functional theory (DFT) methods. However, GW/RPA implementations have historically been limited to either specific materials classes or application toward small chemical systems. The static subspace approximation allows for reduced cost full-frequency GW/RPA calculations and has previously been benchmarked thoroughly for GW calculations. Here, we describe our approach to including partial occupations of electronic orbitals in full-frequency GW and RPA calculations for the study of electrocatalysts. We benchmarked RPA total energy calculations using the subspace approximation across a diverse test suite of materials for a variety of computational parameters. The benchmarking quantifies the impact of different extrapolation procedures for representing the static polarizability at infinite screened cutoff, and shows that using screened cutoffs above 20-25 Ryd result in diminishing accuracy returns for predicting RPA total energies. Additionally, for moderately sized electrocatalytic models, 2-3 times fewer computational resources are used to compute RPA total energies by representing the static polarizability with 20-30% of the static subspace basis, with an error of approximately 0.01 eV or better in RPA adsorption energy calculations. Finally, we show that for these electrochemical models RPA can shift DFT adsorption energy shifts by up to 0.5 eV and that GW can frequently shift DFT eigenvalues of surface and adsorbate states by approximately 0.5-1 eV.

The accurate monitoring of gallic acid (GA) in foodstuffs is crucial for safeguarding human health. The application of nanozymes in colorimetric assays offers a promising route for assessing the GA level. However, the development of high-efficiency and cost-effective nanozymes for quick GA detection holds a substantial challenge. In this study, copper (Cu) nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on <i>N</i>-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) have been prepared, exhibiting exceptional peroxidase (POD)-like activity for GA detection in food. The anchoring of Cu nanoparticles with NCNTs enables their excellent antioxidant capacity. Then, the obtained Cu NPs/NCNTs show remarkable POD-like activity in catalyzing TMB oxidation, with the attributes of long-term storage stability and reproducibility. Electrochemical assays and radical scavenging experiments reveal a dual mechanism action (involving reactive oxygen species and electron transfer) for the POD-mimicking activity. Furthermore, the developed colorimetric catalytic platform is applied to detect GA in actual tea samples, demonstrating high reliability and potential utility for GA monitoring in the food industry.
40228221	Photoinduced Formation of Oxygen Vacancies on Mo-Incorporated WO<sub>3</sub> for Direct Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol by Air.	Photocatalysts with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) exhibit enhanced activity for the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol with O<sub>2</sub>, owing to their superior O<sub>2</sub> activation and charge separation properties. However, OVs on metal oxide surfaces such as WO<sub>3</sub> are susceptible to healing by oxygen-containing reactants or intermediates, leading to their irreversible deactivation. Herein, we demonstrate that incorporating Mo into the WO<sub>3</sub> lattice effectively lowers the energy barrier for OV formation, promoting the dynamic formation of more abundant photoinduced OVs <i>in situ</i> on the surface during the photocatalytic reaction. These Mo-promoted photoinduced OVs are found to ensure the long-term sustainability of sufficient OVs under working conditions, enhancing photocatalytic performance and particularly its durability in the aerobic oxidation of benzene to phenol. These findings provide a straightforward strategy to overcome the issue of OV healing, enabling the sustainable operation of OV-rich photocatalysts for a range of emerging applications, even in O<sub>2</sub>-involved redox reactions.
40228214	Geographical and disciplinary coverage of open access journals: OpenAlex, Scopus, and WoS.	This study aims to compare the geographical and disciplinary coverage of OA journals in three databases: OpenAlex, Scopus and the Web of Science (WoS). We used the Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources (ROAD), provided by the ISSN International Centre, as a reference to identify OA active journals (as of May 2024). Among the 62,701 active OA journals listed in ROAD, the WoS indexes 6,157 journals, Scopus indexes 7,351, while OpenAlex indexes 34,217. A striking observation is the presence of 24,976 OA journals exclusively in OpenAlex, whereas only 182 journals are exclusively present in the WoS and 373 in Scopus. The geographical analysis focuses on two levels: continents and countries. As for disciplinary comparison, we use the ten disciplinary levels of the ROAD database. Moreover, our findings reveal a similarity in OA journal coverage between the WoS and Scopus. However, while OpenAlex offers better inclusivity and indexing, it is not without biases. The WoS and Scopus predictably favor journals from Europe, North America and Oceania. Although OpenAlex presents a much more balanced indexing, certain regions and countries remain relatively underrepresented. Typically, Africa is proportionally as under-represented in OpenAlex as it is in Scopus, and some emerging countries are proportionally less represented in OpenAlex than in the WoS and Scopus. These results underscore a marked similarity in OA journal indexing between WoS and Scopus, while OpenAlex aligns more closely with the distribution observed in the ROAD database, although it also exhibits some representational biases.
40228213	GlomSAM: Hybrid customized SAM for multi-glomerular detection and segmentation in immunofluorescence images.	In nephrology research, multi-glomerular segmentation in immunofluorescence images plays a crucial role in the early detection and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. However, obtaining accurate segmentations often requires labor-intensive annotations and existing methods are hampered by low recall rates and limited accuracy. Recently, a general Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated promising performance in several segmentation tasks. In this paper, a SAM-based multi-glomerular segmentation model (GlomSAM) is introduced to employ SAM in the immunofluorescence pathology domain. The fusion encoder strategy utilizing the advantages of both convolution networks and transformer structures with prompts is conducted to facilitate SAM's transfer learning in applications of pathological analysis. Moreover, a rough mask generator is employed to generate preliminary glomerular segmentation masks, enabling automated input prompting and improving the final segmentation results. Extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies show its state-of-the-art performance surpassing other relevant research. We hope this report will provide insights to advance the field of glomerular segmentation and promote more interesting work in the future.
40228212	Towards a secure Metaverse: Leveraging hybrid model for IoT anomaly detection.	The seamless interaction between the virtual and real worlds is due to the unprecedented degrees of decentralization, immersiveness and connectedness made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT) and the metaverse. In this light, it brings important ethical, privacy, and security considerations into play, hence calling for the strong protection of IoT-enabled metaverse systems. Anomaly detection is critical for solving the aforementioned issues and ensuring the dependability and security of the connected devices by identification and preventing malicious activity in IoT networks. With IoT networks being highly dynamic and complex, robust anomaly detection frameworks are essential for ensuring security and trust in the metaverse. This paper proposed a hybrid model combining Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN) and compared it with a variety of machine learning (ML) techniques including Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), RF and Logistic Regression (LR) to detect anomalies in IoT-enabled metaverse environments. These models were trained and tested using the CIC-IDS 2017 Network Intrusion Dataset, a comprehensive benchmark used for evaluating intrusion detection systems (IDS). Indeed, with outstanding accuracy equaling a staggering 99.99%, the proposed hybrid model algorithm performed better than other ML models under study. This illustrates its vast potential for high-accuracy anomaly identification and false positives.
40228211	Revealing non-trivial information structures in aneural biological tissues via functional connectivity.	A central challenge in the progression of a variety of open questions in biology, such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and development, is learning from empirical data how information is integrated to support tissue-level function and behavior. Information-theoretic approaches provide a quantitative framework for extracting patterns from data, but so far have been predominantly applied to neuronal systems at the tissue-level. Here, we demonstrate how time series of Ca2+ dynamics can be used to identify the structure and information dynamics of other biological tissues. To this end, we expressed the calcium reporter GCaMP6s in an organoid system of explanted amphibian epidermis derived from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, and imaged calcium activity pre- and post- a puncture injury, for six replicate organoids. We constructed functional connectivity networks by computing mutual information between cells from time series derived using medical imaging techniques to track intracellular Ca2+. We analyzed network properties including degree distribution, spatial embedding, and modular structure. We find organoid networks exhibit potential evidence for more connectivity than null models, with our models displaying high degree hubs and mesoscale community structure with spatial clustering. Utilizing functional connectivity networks, our model suggests the tissue retains non-random features after injury, displays long range correlations and structure, and non-trivial clustering that is not necessarily spatially dependent. In the context of this reconstruction method our results suggest increased integration after injury, possible cellular coordination in response to injury, and some type of generative structure of the anatomy. While we study Ca2+ in Xenopus epidermal cells, our computational approach and analyses highlight how methods developed to analyze functional connectivity in neuronal tissues can be generalized to any tissue and fluorescent signal type. We discuss expanded methods of analyses to improve models of non-neuronal information processing highlighting the potential of our framework to provide a bridge between neuroscience and more basal modes of information processing.
40228210	On the validity of electric brain signal predictions based on population firing rates.	Neural activity at the population level is commonly studied experimentally through measurements of electric brain signals like local field potentials (LFPs), or electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To allow for comparison between observed and simulated neural activity it is therefore important that simulations of neural activity can accurately predict these brain signals. Simulations of neural activity at the population level often rely on point-neuron network models or firing-rate models. While these simplified representations of neural activity are computationally efficient, they lack the explicit spatial information needed for calculating LFP/EEG signals. Different heuristic approaches have been suggested for overcoming this limitation, but the accuracy of these approaches has not fully been assessed. One such heuristic approach, the so-called kernel method, has previously been applied with promising results and has the additional advantage of being well-grounded in the biophysics underlying electric brain signal generation. It is based on calculating rate-to-LFP/EEG kernels for each synaptic pathway in a network model, after which LFP/EEG signals can be obtained directly from population firing rates. This amounts to a massive reduction in the computational effort of calculating brain signals because the brain signals are calculated for each population instead of for each neuron. Here, we investigate how and when the kernel method can be expected to work, and present a theoretical framework for predicting its accuracy. We show that the relative error of the brain signal predictions is a function of the single-cell kernel heterogeneity and the spike-train correlations. Finally, we demonstrate that the kernel method is most accurate for contributions which are also dominating the brain signals: spatially clustered and correlated synaptic input to large populations of pyramidal cells. We thereby further establish the kernel method as a promising approach for calculating electric brain signals from large-scale neural simulations.
40228209	Liver gene expression and its rewiring in hepatic steatosis are controlled by PI3Kα-dependent hepatocyte signaling.	Insulin and other growth factors are key regulators of liver gene expression, including in metabolic diseases. Most of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity induced by insulin is considered to be dependent on PI3Kα. We used mice lacking p110α, the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, to investigate its role in the regulation of liver gene expression in health and in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The absence of hepatocyte PI3Kα reduced maximal insulin-induced PI3K activity and signaling, promoted glucose intolerance in lean mice and significantly regulated liver gene expression, including insulin-sensitive genes, in ad libitum feeding. Some of the defective regulation of gene expression in response to hepatocyte-restricted insulin receptor deletion was related to PI3Kα signaling. In addition, though PI3Kα deletion in hepatocytes promoted insulin resistance, it was protective against steatotic liver disease in diet-induced obesity. In the absence of hepatocyte PI3Kα, the effect of diet-induced obesity on liver gene expression was significantly altered, with changes in rhythmic gene expression in liver. Altogether, this study highlights the specific role of p110α in the control of liver gene expression in physiology and in the metabolic rewiring that occurs during MASLD.
40228208	A generalized higher-order correlation analysis framework for multi-omics network inference.	Multiple -omics (genomics, proteomics, etc.) profiles are commonly generated to gain insight into a disease or physiological system. Constructing multi-omics networks with respect to the trait(s) of interest provides an opportunity to understand relationships between molecular features but integration is challenging due to multiple data sets with high dimensionality. One approach is to use canonical correlation to integrate one or two omics types and a single trait of interest. However, these types of methods may be limited due to (1) not accounting for higher-order correlations existing among features, (2) computational inefficiency when extending to more than two omics data when using a penalty term-based sparsity method, and (3) lack of flexibility for focusing on specific correlations (e.g., omics-to-phenotype correlation versus omics-to-omics correlations). In this work, we have developed a novel multi-omics network analysis pipeline called Sparse Generalized Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis Network Inference (SGTCCA-Net) that can effectively overcome these limitations. We also introduce an implementation to improve the summarization of networks for downstream analyses. Simulation and real-data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel method for inferring omics networks and features of interest.
40228207	Limitations and optimizations of cellular lineages tracking.	Tracking cellular lineages using genetic barcodes provides insights across biology and has become an important tool. However, barcoding strategies remain ad hoc. We show that elevating barcode insertion probability and thus increasing the average number of barcodes within the cells, adds to the number of traceable lineages but may decrease the accuracy of lineages inference due to reading errors. We establish the trade-off between accuracy in tracing lineages and the total number of traceable lineages, and find optimal experimental parameters under limited resources concerning the populations size of tracked cells and barcode pool complexity.
40228206	The role of host mobility in the transmission and spread of Echinococcus granulosus: A Chile-based mathematical modeling approach.	This paper explores, as a proof-of-concept, the impact of definitive and intermediate host mobility on the transmission and spread of cystic echinococcosis by characterizing disease dynamics using three classical epidemic models: S-E-I-R for the accidental intermediate host, S-E-I for the habitual intermediate host, and S-I-S for the definitive host. The simulations revealed a significant relationship between the mobility of dogs and the increase in infected sheep. Specifically, for each infected dog, there were twice as many infected sheep as in a situation where mobility was not a factor. The initial conditions took into account that the prevalence of the disease in dogs is higher in rural areas than in peri-urban areas, as has been observed in the Magallanes region of Chile. The results of the simulations suggest that mobility can have a role in the propagation of the disease in humans. Furthermore, the sensitivity index on [Formula: see text] indicates that a 10% reduction in the average time spent by peri-urban dogs in urban and rural areas could result in a decrease of approximately 1% in [Formula: see text] In conclusion, including the host mobility factor allows us to observe that, in general, the number of infected in the domestic cycle of the disease increases, i.e., our mathematical model provides valuable information on the impact of host mobility on the transmission and spread of cystic echinococcosis.
40228205	Deep learning models for segmenting phonocardiogram signals: a comparative study.	Cardiac auscultation requires the mechanical vibrations occurring on the body's surface, which carries a range of sound frequencies. These sounds are generated by the movement and pulsation of different cardiac structures as they facilitate blood circulation. Subsequently, these sounds are identified as phonocardiogram (PCG). In this research, deep learning models, namely gated recurrent neural Network (GRU), Bidirectional-GRU, and Bi-directional long-term memory (BILSTM) are applied separately to segment four specific regions within the PCG signal, namely S1 (lub sound), the systolic region, S2 (dub sound), and the diastolic region. These models are applied to three well-known datasets: PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2016, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MITHSDB), and CirCor DigiScope Phonocardiogram.The PCG signal underwent a series of pre-processing steps, including digital filtering and empirical mode decomposition, after then deep learning algorithms were applied to achieve the highest level of segmentation accuracy. Remarkably, the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 97.2% for the PhysioNet dataset and 96.98% for the MITHSDB dataset. Notably, this paper represents the first investigation into the segmentation process of the CirCor DigiScop dataset, achieving an accuracy of 92.5%. This study compared the performance of various deep learning models using the aforementioned datasets, demonstrating its efficiency, accuracy, and reliability as a software tool in healthcare settings.
40228204	A teaching proposal for a short course on biomedical data science.	As the availability of big biomedical data advances, there is a growing need of university students trained professionally on analyzing these data and correctly interpreting their results. We propose here a study plan for a master's degree course on biomedical data science, by describing our experience during the last academic year. In our university course, we explained how to find an open biomedical dataset, how to correctly clean it and how to prepare it for a computational statistics or machine learning phase. By doing so, we introduce common health data science terms and explained how to avoid common mistakes in the process. Moreover, we clarified how to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and how to reasonably interpret its results. We also described how to properly execute a supervised or unsupervised machine learning analysis, and now to understand and interpret its outcomes. Eventually, we explained how to validate the findings obtained. We illustrated all these steps in the context of open science principles, by suggesting to the students to use only open source programming languages (R or Python in particular), open biomedical data (if available), and open access scientific articles (if possible). We believe our teaching proposal can be useful and of interest for anyone wanting to start to prepare a course on biomedical data science.
40228197	Human papillomavirus vaccination at age 9 or 10 years to increase coverage - a narrative review of the literature, United States 2014-2024.	The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination at 11-12 years; the series can begin at age 9. U.S. HPV vaccination coverage is lower than other adolescent vaccinations. One proposed strategy to increase coverage is initiation at 9-10 years. We systematically reviewed studies addressing vaccination at age 9 to identify and evaluate evidence regarding potential programmatic advantages. Among 30 publications from 2014 to 2024 there were retrospective cohort studies (<i>N</i> = 11), intervention studies with a component focused on vaccination at 9-10 (<i>N</i> = 12), and studies of feasibility or acceptability by providers or caregivers (<i>N</i> = 7). While retrospective analyses found earlier initiation associated with completion, limitations in methodology preclude a cause-and-effect interpretation. Impact of age 9 vaccination is difficult to isolate in intervention studies that had multiple components. While initiating vaccination at age 9 is feasible, questions remain regarding the benefit of this approach to increase coverage.
40228196	Empirical estimation of Young's modulus for biological tissue mimics using acoustic impedance measurements: A study on agar gel tissue phantoms.	The mechanical properties of biological tissues are significant biomarkers for diagnosing various diseases. The aim of this study was to develop an empirical formula to estimate Young's modulus from the acoustic impedance measured by scanning acoustic microscopy. Agar, a material with mechanical properties similar to those of biological tissues, was prepared at concentrations ranging from 5% to 20%. The acoustic impedance was measured by scanning acoustic microscopy, and Young's modulus was determined via indentation testing. The results showed that both the acoustic impedance and Young's modulus increased with agar concentration. Theoretical models did not accurately describe the relationship between the acoustic impedance Z and Young's modulus E; however, the empirical formula [Formula: see text] (with E in Pa and Z in Ns/[Formula: see text]) provided a better fit. This formula could potentially be used to estimate Young's modulus for biological tissues, aiding in the realistic analysis of stress fields and understanding the etiology of various diseases.
40228195	Structural deformation control in bridge construction based on error analysis and correction.	Structural deformation control of constructed bridges not only affects the alignment of the bridge, it is also the key to ensure safety. Factors such as temperature and time interval in actual construction can make the bridge deviate from the design state, therefore, this paper proposes a method based on error analysis and correction to eliminate these errors, and realize the structural deformation control in bridge construction control. The cantilever deflection in main girder is modeled and the effect of subsequent cantilevers on deflection at current section is further considered. The error in elevation caused by factors such as temperature and time interval is calculated, and a linear minimum variance estimate is employed to reduce this error. Practical engineering verification is carried out on a bridge in Shanxi, where the proposed error analysis method is further implemented by measuring the current cantilever elevation and comparing it with the original design value, with a purpose of obtaining a reasonable elevation for the next cantilever. The results show that, with the application of error analysis and correction, the elevation error generated during construction process is less than 20 mm, and the elevation error after the completion of bridge is less than 30 mm, the linear shape and internal condition of the bridge structure can also be further conformed to design requirements.
40228194	Association of the child opportunity index with in-hospital mortality and persistence of organ dysfunction at one week after onset of Phoenix Sepsis among children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with suspected infection.	The social determinants of health (SDoH) are fundamental factors that contribute to overall health and health-related outcomes. Children living in lower socioeconomic areas have a higher risk of critical illness and worse outcomes compared to children living in more socioeconomically advantaged areas. In this work, we determine whether the Child Opportunity Index (COI 3.0), a multi-dimensional child-specific indicator of neighborhood environment, is associated with in-hospital mortality or persistence of a Phoenix Sepsis Score  ≥  2 at one week following Phoenix Sepsis onset in children admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) with suspected infection. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 63,824 patients with suspected or confirmed infection admission diagnosis in two PICUs in Atlanta, Georgia with a Georgia residential address that could be geocoded and linked to a census tract. The primary outcome was the composite of in-hospital mortality or persistence of a Phoenix Sepsis Score  ≥  2 at one week following Phoenix Sepsis onset. Model performance measures of interest were the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Models developed with electronic medical record (EMR) data using Egleston (EG) or Scottish Rite (SR) as the training site achieved AUROCs of 0.81-0.84 (95% CI range: 0.8-0.85) and 0.82-0.82 (95% CI range: 0.81-0.83) and AUPRCs of 0.59-0.68 (95% CI range: 0.58-0.69) and 0.62-0.64 (95% CI range: 0.61-0.65) respectively. Despite significant differences in COI 3.0 characteristics and overall in-hospital mortality of children with Phoenix suspected infection between the EG and SR PICUs, the addition of COI 3.0 did not improve the overall model performance metrics. While children admitted to both PICUs were more often from COI 3.0 neighborhoods in the lowest two quintiles, these neighborhood features had less of an impact on the model's predictive performance compared to patient physiologic and biologic features available in the EMR.
40228193	Computer-based quantitative image texture analysis using multi-collinearity diagnosis in chest X-ray images.	Despite tremendous efforts devoted to the area, image texture analysis is still an open research field. This paper presents an algorithm and experimental results demonstrating the feasibility of developing automated tools to detect abnormal X-ray images based on tissue attenuation. Specifically, this work proposes using the variability characterised by singular values and conditional indices extracted from the singular value decomposition (SVD) as image texture features. In addition, the paper introduces a "tuning weight" parameter to consider the variability of the X-ray attenuation in tissues affected by pathologies. This weight is estimated using the coefficient of variation of the minimum covariance determinant from the bandwidth yielded by the non-parametric distribution of variance-decomposition proportions of the SVD. When multiplied by the two features (singular values and conditional indices), this single parameter acts as a tuning weight, reducing misclassification and improving the classic performance metrics, such as true positive rate, false negative rate, positive predictive values, false discovery rate, area-under-curve, accuracy rate, and total cost. The proposed method implements an ensemble bagged trees classification model to classify X-ray chest images as COVID-19, viral pneumonia, lung opacity, or normal. It was tested using a challenging, imbalanced chest X-ray public dataset. The results show an accuracy of 88% without applying the tuning weight and 99% with its application. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, as attested by all performance metrics.
40228192	Features extraction and fusion by attention mechanism for software defect prediction.	Software defect prediction is a technology that uses known software information to predict defects in the target software. Generally, models are built using features such as software metrics, semantic information, and software networks. However, due to the complex software structure and the small number of samples, without effective feature representation and feature extraction methods, it is impossible to fully utilize software features, which can easily lead to misjudgments and reduced performance. In addition, a single feature cannot fully characterize the software structure. Therefore, this research proposes a new method to efficiently and accurately represent the Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) and a model called MFA(Multi Features Attention) that uses a deformable attention mechanism to extract features and uses a self-attention mechanism to fuse semantic and network features. By selecting 21 Java projects and comparing them with multiple models for cross-version and cross-project experiments, the experiments show that the average ACC, F1, AUC of the proposed model in the cross-version scheme reach 0.7, 0.614 and 0.711. In the cross-project scheme, the average ACC, F1 and AUC are 0.687, 0.575 and 0.696. Up to 41% better than other models, and the results of fusion features are better than those of a single feature, showing that MFA using two features for extraction and fusion has greater advantages in prediction performance.

In patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), the impact of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after endovascular treatment (EVT) on poorer stroke outcome is well established when associated with clinical deterioration. However, the influence of asymptomatic HT remains unclear. We aimed to examine the impact of asymptomatic HT after EVT on functional outcome and mortality.
40228187	Clinical Reasoning: A Toddler With Acute-Onset Hypotonia, Areflexia, and Ataxia.	This is a case report of an established genetic etiology with a unique clinical presentation and novel imaging findings that add to the clinical spectrum of this known condition. A 2-year-old male toddler presented with acute-onset weakness and ataxia after a respiratory viral illness. A previous admission was marked by similar weakness with areflexia, ataxia, and metabolic acidosis. Initial examination revealed weakness with areflexia, loss of tone, and ataxia, followed by intermittent encephalopathy. These physical findings localized to both central and peripheral etiologies. Differential diagnoses included atypical Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute cerebellar ataxia, an inborn error of metabolism, or an underlying genetic etiology. Laboratory evaluation revealed a metabolic lactic acidosis with a normal lactate/pyruvate ratio but an unrevealing additional metabolic evaluation. CSF studies were significant for an albuminocytologic dissociation. MRI brain revealed symmetric diffusion restriction in the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles extending into the central white matter of the cerebellum, with diffusion restriction also present in the central pons, which was considered to be a novel imaging finding of this condition. The definitive diagnosis was found with genetic testing with whole-exome sequencing. This case report reiterates the importance of genetic testing for conditions that may otherwise be difficult to identify based solely on the clinical findings.
40228186	A Beneficial Role for Gluteofemoral Adipose Tissue in Cerebrovascular Disease: Causal Pathway and Mediation Analysis.	Previous studies have shown that increased body fat is associated with stroke risk, with evidence suggesting that body fat distribution, rather than total body fat, exerts a more prominent role in cerebrovascular risk prediction. In this study, we explore causal associations between body mass index (BMI)-independent adipose tissue distribution profiles and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) risk, aiming to refine the association between body fat distribution and stroke.

40228183	Child Neurology: Creatine Biosynthesis Disorder in an Adolescent With Capgras Syndrome and Reduplicative Paramnesia.	This case report and discussion pertain to a 17-year-old female patient with developmental delay and acute onset of psychosis, diagnosed with guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency, a rare creatine biosynthesis disorder. The patient experienced auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and delusional misidentification syndromes (Capgras syndrome and reduplicative paramnesia), following a viral respiratory illness. The neurologic examination was nonfocal but included intermittent negative myoclonus, generalized stiff movements, and a mechanical gait, which initially suggested catatonia or autoimmune encephalitis. MRI of the brain was normal, as was her CSF profile, although EEG revealed diffuse slowing with frequent generalized spike waves. Sequential empiric treatments for catatonia and autoimmune encephalitis provided limited benefit. Subsequent biochemical and genetic testing confirmed GAMT deficiency, supported by a markedly decreased creatine peak on MR spectroscopy of the brain. This case highlights GAMT deficiency as a consideration in young patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly psychosis with atypical motor findings and a history of developmental delay. The rare presentation of delusional misidentification symptoms expands the spectrum of clinical findings described in patients with GAMT deficiency, a rare disorder reported in at least 130 individuals to date. Treatment with creatine and ornithine supplementation led to marked improvement, returning her incrementally toward baseline functioning. This case broadens the understanding of GAMT deficiency's phenotypic range and underscores the importance of metabolic testing in tandem with or closely following empiric but unsuccessful treatment trials, even when the initial clinical presentation suggests primary psychiatric, autoimmune, or inflammatory etiologies.

40228180	Complex networks applied to political analysis: Group voting behavior in the Brazilian congress.	The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies constitute the Brazilian Congress and are responsible for the Brazilian legislative management. Complex networks were shown to be a suitable tool to analyze this type of system. Several researches explored party dynamics in the Chamber of Deputies, however, no attention has been given to the Senate. Previous works that have stated the necessity of a backbone extraction methodology to be used in these types of networks also failed to define an automatic backbone extraction methodology to uncover group structure in legislative networks, reverting to heuristics or subjective approaches. In this work, we explore both legislative houses and compare them to see their differences and similarities. We also systematize an automatic backbone extraction methodology. Further, we expand on previous analyses by bringing spectrum and government x opposition analysis based on voting data. Our results show that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have behaved differently during major events in Brazil over the second decade of the century. From the obtained results it is fair to say that the dynamics for both houses are different and that the best backbone extraction algorithm varies over time and is different for each house.
40228178	A data-driven approach for real-time soft tissue deformation prediction using nonlinear presurgical simulations.	A method that allows a fast and accurate registration of digital tissue models obtained during preoperative, diagnostic imaging with those captured intraoperatively using lower-fidelity ultrasound imaging techniques is presented. Minimally invasive surgeries are often planned using preoperative, high-fidelity medical imaging techniques such as MRI and CT imaging. While these techniques allow clinicians to obtain detailed 3D models of the surgical region of interest (ROI), various factors such as physical changes to the tissue, changes in the body's configuration, or apparatus used during the surgery may cause large, non-linear deformations of the ROI. Such deformations of the tissue can result in a severe mismatch between the preoperatively obtained 3D model and the real-time image data acquired during surgery, potentially compromising surgical success. To overcome this challenge, this work presents a new approach for predicting intraoperative soft tissue deformations. The approach works by simply tracking the displacements of a handful of fiducial markers or analogous biological features embedded in the tissue, and produces a 3D deformed version of the high-fidelity ROI model that registers accurately with the intraoperative data. In an oﬄine setting, we use the finite element method to generate deformation fields given various boundary conditions that mimic the realistic environment of soft tissues during a surgery. To reduce the dimensionality of the 3D deformation field involving thousands of degrees of freedom, we use an autoencoder neural network to encode each computed deformation field into a short latent space representation, such that a neural network can accurately map the fiducial marker displacements to the latent space. Our computational tests on a head and neck tumor, a kidney, and an aorta model show prediction errors as small as 0.5 mm. Considering that the typical resolution of interventional ultrasound is around 1 mm and each prediction takes less than 0.5 s, the proposed approach has the potential to be clinically relevant for an accurate tracking of soft tissue deformations during image-guided surgeries.
40228177	c-Triadem: A constrained, explainable deep learning model to identify novel biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that requires early diagnosis for effective management. However, issues with currently available diagnostic biomarkers preclude early diagnosis, necessitating the development of alternative biomarkers and methods, such as blood-based diagnostics. We propose c-Triadem (constrained triple-input Alzheimer's disease model), a novel deep neural network to identify potential blood-based biomarkers for AD and predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD with high accuracy. The model utilizes genotyping data, gene expression data, and clinical information to predict the disease status of participants, i.e., cognitively normal (CN), MCI, or AD. The nodes of the neural network represent genes and their related pathways, and the edges represent known relationships among the genes and pathways. Simulated data validation further highlights the robustness of key features identified by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). We trained the model with blood genotyping data, microarray, and clinical features from the Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Disease Initiative (ADNI). We demonstrate that our model's performance is superior to previous models with an AUC of 97% and accuracy of 89%. We then identified the most influential genes and clinical features for prediction using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our SHAP analysis shows that CASP9, LCK, and SDC3 SNPs and PINK1, ATG5, and ubiquitin (UBB, UBC) expression have a higher impact on model performance. Our model has facilitated the identification of potential blood-based genetic markers of DNA damage response and mitophagy in affected regions of the brain. The model can be used for detection and biomarker identification in other related dementias.
40228175	Designing Clinical Trials for Patients With Rare Cancers: Connecting the Zebras.	The field of rare cancer research is rapidly transforming, marked by significant progress in clinical trials and treatment strategies. Rare cancers, as defined by the National Cancer Institute, occur in fewer than 150 cases per million people each year, yet they collectively represent a significant portion of all cancer diagnoses. Because of their infrequency, these cancers pose distinct challenges for clinical trials, including limited patient populations, geographical dispersion, and a general lack of awareness of treatment options. Economic limitations further complicate drug development, making initiatives such as the Orphan Drug Act essential for incentivizing research. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and precision medicine has been instrumental in identifying actionable genetic alterations in parallel with an explosion in the development of genomically targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and antibody drug conjugates. Advances in clinical NGS, precision medicine, and tumor-agnostic therapies have become central to the progress in rare cancer research. The development and approval of tumor-agnostic drugs, such as BRAF, NTRK, and RET inhibitors, and immunotherapy for mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instability-high status cancers highlight the potential of personalized treatments across diverse cancer types and across the age spectrum. Collaborative trials from cooperative groups including SWOG DART, ASCO TAPUR, NCI-MATCH, pediatric COG-match, DRUP, IMPRESS, and innovative registrational basket and platform trials (eg, VE-Basket, ROAR, LIBRETTO-001, ARROW), along with patient advocacy group-run trials like TRACK, are enhancing access to clinical trials. In addition, artificial intelligence has the potential to improve the trial matching process. An integrated approach, combining these innovations in collaboration with multiple stakeholders, is crucial for advancing rare cancer research, offering hope for better patient outcomes and quality of life.
40228174	Survivorship Care for People Affected by Advanced or Metastatic Cancer: Building on the Recent Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer-ASCO Standards and Practice Recommendations.	Although there is a growing number of people living with advanced or metastatic cancer, primarily because of more effective treatment regimens, there are limited estimates of the actual number of people living with advanced or metastatic cancer. Many people will have treatable but not curable cancers, may have survival measured in years, and may have periods on and off therapy. People with advanced or metastatic disease, as well as their families and caregivers, may experience significant unmet needs, overlapping yet distinct to those with potentially curable cancer. Recently, the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and ASCO developed standards and practice recommendations relevant to the delivery of quality survivorship care for people living with advanced or metastatic cancer. The recommendations included seven domains: (1) person-centered care; (2) coordinated and integrated care; (3) evidence-based and comprehensive care; (4) evaluated and communicated care; (5) accessible and equitable care; (6) sustainable and resourced care; and (7) research and data-driven care. Immediate priorities to improve clinical care include focusing on (1) discussions regarding prognosis and goals of care; (2) routinely assessing physical, psychological, and social unmet needs with referral to appropriate supportive care services; and (3) creating blended models of care, incorporating elements of palliative care and survivorship services. Additional areas for focus include (1) advocacy and policy; (2) system design and health care delivery; (3) defining, measuring, and managing quality; (4) addressing inequity; and (5) research specifically focused on these cancer populations.

40228167	Circularized Supramolecular Spherical Nucleic Acids Alleviates Liver Fibrosis through Blocking Upstream Activation and Reversing Activation State of Hepatic Stellate Cells.	Inhibition of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and reversal of its activation state represent two distinct yet complementary strategies in antifibrotic therapy. While synergy of those two strategies is anticipated to improve the therapeutic outcomes, synergism through nanomedicine remains elusive. Herein, we report a circular spherical nucleic acid (cSNA) with a supramolecular core comprising collagenase I and ML-290 and a surface attached with circular PDGF-BB aptamer instead of the stereotypical linear counterpart. Unlike conventional inert SNA, this cSNA core dissociates in response to elevated ROS levels in the fibrotic liver so that collagenase I is released to disrupt the collagen barrier to promote the penetration of ensuing nanoparticles. Of significant importance is that the PDGF-BB aptamer after circularization exhibits enhanced nuclease resistance and improved molecular recognition, thereby demonstrating superior capability in blocking HSC activation mediated by PDGF-BB/PDGFR-β signaling. Meanwhile, relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1) agonist ML-290 initially transforms pro-fibrogenic macrophages into pro-resolution macrophages by activating RXFP1 signaling, facilitating the secretion of pro-resolution factors for the reversal of the activated state of HSCs. This work thus presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of a supramolecular SNA that undergoes structural and functional refinements, enabling concurrent upstream etiological blockade and downstream pathological restoration in liver fibrosis.
40228166	Identification of Nitric Oxide Donating Dasatinib Derivatives with Intraocular Pressure Lowering and Senolytic Activities.	Based on two major risk factors of glaucoma, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and senescence, two new series of nitric oxide (NO) donating dasatinib derivatives <b>1a</b>-<b>f</b>, <b>2a</b>-<b>f</b> were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. The results demonstrated that the most active compound <b>2e</b> effectively released NO and increased the concentration of 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate in human trabecular meshwork cells, as well as maintained senolytic activity. Topical administration of <b>2e</b> in chronic ocular hypertension (COHT) glaucoma mice not only significantly eliminated senescent cells in retina but also exhibited potent retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) surviving, IOP lowering, and visual function protection activities, which were superior to those of dasatinib. Compared with younger adult mice, aged COHT mice resulted in more severe RGCs loss, while <b>2e</b> demonstrated a greater capacity to improve RGCs survival. Our findings show that dual IOP lowering and senolytic functions could be a promising therapeutic strategy for glaucoma, particularly in older patients.
40228164	Lightly Se-Doped Monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition Using SeS<sub>2</sub> Precursor.	Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)-based two-dimensional semiconductors are promising materials for next-generation electronic devices. However, challenges such as optimizing the carrier mobility, on/off current ratio, threshold voltage, and minimization of hysteresis remain. Herein, we report lightly Se-doped monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using selenium disulfide (SeS<sub>2</sub>) as a chalcogen source. Interestingly, doping with 5.5% Se (MoS<sub>1.89</sub>Se<sub>0.11</sub>) enhanced the electron mobility compared to conventional MoS<sub>2</sub>, contrary to the typical trend of increased effective mass with substitutional doping. Additionally, bandgap tunability was achieved by controlling the Se content via temperature control of SeS<sub>2</sub>. This approach offers a pathway for tailoring the properties of TMDCs for advanced applications.
40228163	Space Charge, Modulating the Catalytic Activity of Single-Atom Metal Catalysts.	Potential-induced electrode charging is a prerequisite to initiate electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The 'interface space charge' could dramatically alter the reaction environment and the charge density of the active site, both of which potentially affect the electrochemical activity. However, our understanding of the electrocatalytic role of space charge has been limited. Here, we separately modulate the amount of space charge (characterized by the areal density, σ) with maintaining the electrochemical potential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the same level, by exploiting the unique structural feature of MeNC. We reveal that changes in σ control the ORR activity, which is computationally explained by the inductive polarization of the charge density at the active sites, affecting their turnover rates. To guide catalyst design including the space charge effect, we develop a new descriptor, explaining the activity trend in various metal centers and pH conditions using a single volcano. These findings offer fresh insights into the role of space charge in electrocatalysis, providing a new framework for optimizing catalyst design and performance.
40228162	Machine Learning and Structural Dynamics-Based Approach to Reveal Molecular Mechanism of PTEN Missense Mutations Shared by Cancer and Autism Spectrum Disorder.	Missense mutations in oncogenic proteins that are concurrently associated with neurodevelopmental disorders have garnered significant attention. Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) serves as a paradigmatic model for mapping its mutational landscape and identifying genotypic predictors of distinct phenotypic outcomes, including cancer and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite extensive research into the genotype-phenotype correlations of PTEN mutations, the mechanisms underlying the dual association of specific PTEN mutations with both cancer and ASD (PTEN-cancer/ASD mutations) remain elusive. This study introduces an integrative approach that combines machine learning (ML) with structural dynamics to elucidate the molecular effects of PTEN-cancer/ASD mutations. Analysis of biophysical and network-biology-based signatures reveals a complex energetic and functional landscape. Subsequently, an ML model and corresponding integrated score were developed to classify and predict PTEN-cancer/ASD mutations, underscoring the significance of protein dynamics in predicting cellular phenotypes. Further molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that PTEN-cancer/ASD mutations induce dynamic alterations characterized by open conformational changes restricted to the P loop and coupled with interdomain allosteric regulation. This research aims to enhance the genotypic and phenotypic understanding of PTEN-cancer/ASD mutations through an interpretable ML model integrated with structural dynamics analysis. By identifying shared mechanisms between cancer and ASD, the findings pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
40228161	Simultaneous Capture of N<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> from a N<sub>2</sub>O/N<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> Mixture with a Ni(II)-Pyrazolecarboxylate Framework.	Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is a potent greenhouse gas and a major contributor to ozone depletion. Its primary industrial emission source is tail gas from adipic acid production, which typically comprises a mixture of N<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>. Current technologies for the removal of N<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> from tail gas are energy-intensive and operationally complex. Herein, for the first time, simultaneous capture of N<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> from the quaternary mixture is achieved using a Ni(II)-pyrazolecarboxylate framework, BUT-167. This material demonstrated an exceptional adsorption capacity (135.8 cm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> at 40 kPa) and a high packing density (790 mg cm<sup>-3</sup>) for N<sub>2</sub>O, outperforming reported sorbents. Moreover, BUT-167 also exhibits a remarkable CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity (101.5 cm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> at 4 kPa), achieving simultaneously high selectivity values of 257.6 for CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> (4:96, v/v) and 135.7 for N<sub>2</sub>O/N<sub>2</sub> (40/60). Importantly, BUT-167 exhibits robust and outstanding dual-gas removal performance across multiple adsorption-desorption breakthrough cycles under both dry and humid conditions. The strong affinity toward CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O could be attributed to multiple hydrogen bonding interactions facilitated by its highly confined channel structure, as confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
40228160	Ramsdellite-MnO<sub>2</sub> Regeneration via Acid-Mediated Redox Tuning toward Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries.	The mounting accumulation of spent alkaline batteries (SABs) elicits concerns over both environmental threats and the recycling industry's profitability, closely tied to the chemical reactions in manganese-based waste treatment. Herein, we design an acid-modulated phase-reconstruction strategy for sustainable recovery of manganese oxides from SABs, where moderate proton participation facilitates the preformation of MnOOH intermediates before the initial transformation to <i>ramsdellite</i>-MnO<sub>2</sub> (RM-<i>R,</i> orthorhombic) and the final conversion to <i>pyrolusite</i>-MnO<sub>2</sub> (RM-β<i>,</i> tetragonal) nanomaterials. This rarely reported metastable RM-<i>R</i> phase features a unique tunneled framework (1 × 2 edge-shared MnO<sub>6</sub> octahedra) enabling reversible H<sup>+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> (de)intercalation, though its traditional synthesis remains challenging due to thermodynamic instability. First-principles calculations reveal that RM-<i>R</i> possesses lower Zn<sup>2+</sup> diffusion barriers (0.44 eV) than RM-β (0.99 eV), consistent with its superior Zn<sup>2+</sup> storage performance. Moreover, the higher specific surface area enables the RM-<i>R</i> cathode with a battery-supercapacitor hybrid storage behavior, which delivers remarkable capacity (214.9 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.1 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and long cycling stability (98% retention after 1000 cycles), outperforming most reported MnO<sub>2</sub>-based cathodes. This low-acid regeneration protocol (4 mL of HCl/1.85 g of waste) paves a sustainable way for closed-loop battery recycling and clarifies the structure-property relationships in metastable manganese oxides.
40228159	Fine Tuning of the Rotational Speed of Light-Driven, Second-Generation Molecular Motors by Fluorine Substitution.	The elementary steps in the rotation of several second-generation molecular motors are analyzed by finding the minimum energy path between the metastable and stable states and evaluating the transition rate within harmonic transition state theory based on energetics obtained from density functional theory. Comparison with published experimental data shows remarkably good agreement and demonstrates the predictive capability of this approach. While previous measurements by Feringa and co-workers have shown that a replacement of the hydrogen atom at the stereogenic center by a fluorine atom can slow down the rate-limiting thermal helix inversion (THI) step by raising the energy of the transition state, even to the extent that the backreaction in the ground state becomes preferred in some cases, we find that a replacement of a CH<sub>3</sub> group by CF<sub>3</sub> at the same site accelerates the THI by elevating the energy of the metastable state without affecting the transition state significantly. Since these two fluorine substitutions have an opposite effect on the rate of the THI, the combination of both can provide ways to fine-tune the rotational speed of molecular motors.
40228158	Discovery of Limonoids from <i>Xylocarpus granatum</i> as Potential Leads against Neuroinflammation.	Discovery of new natural products with both anti-inflammatory effects on activated microglia and protective activity on dopaminergic neurons is a new strategy to find new drug leads against neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease. In this work, nine new limonoids, named thaigranatumins A-I (<b>1</b>-<b>9</b>), and two new protolimonoids, named thaigranatumins J (<b>10</b>) and K (<b>11</b>), were obtained from seeds of the Thai mangrove, <i>Xylocarpus granatum</i>. The structures of these compounds were established by analysis of spectroscopic data, single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Cu Kα), and comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra. Thaigranatumin A (<b>1</b>), containing a C-16/C-30 δ-lactone ring-D and a <i>tetra</i>-substituted C<sub>8</sub>-O-C<sub>17</sub>-bridged tetrahydrofuran ring-F, is the first limonoid featuring a unique 6/6/6/6/6/5/5-fused heptacyclic framework. Thaigranatumin G (<b>7</b>) exhibited both inhibitory effects on the protein expression of iNOS, COX2, and IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse microglia BV2 cells and neuroprotective activity against rotenone-induced injury in mouse midbrain dopaminergic neuron MN9D cells in a dose-dependent manner. Preliminary bioassays indicated that thaigranatumin G might be a valuable lead against neuroinflammation, thus warranting further studies.
40228157	Tracking Spatially Heterogeneous Dynamics of Single Nanoparticles Near Liquid-Solid Interfaces.	A classical problem in colloidal physics is the behavior of a spherical particle when it randomly walks close to the interface between a fluid and a rigid wall. Solutions to the two complementary aspects of this problem have been provided by Faxén and Brenner, respectively, based on continuum mechanics. Their results predict that the closer the particle is to the interface the slower it moves, but the pace of the slow-down depends on whether the particle steps parallel with or perpendicular to the interface; that is, the particle's diffusivity divaricates in a distance- and direction-dependent manner. While the theoretical predictions enjoy unequivocal experimental supports for μm-sized particles, their applicability on the smaller length scales remains unclear, however. Here we present the first direct experimental test for the complete Faxén-Brenner solutions on the nanoscale. Our experiment was enabled by a new multiresolution instrument which concurrently and synchronously recorded both the high-resolution lifetime-gated μs 3D tracking of a single diffusing nanoparticle for nanoscale diffusivity and the lower-resolution two-photon laser-scanning microscopy images for the nanoparticle's location relative to the wall interface. The directional diffusivity divarication predicted by Faxén and Brenner was reproduced on the single-nanoparticle level with no adjustable parameters. Our results thus provided experimental supports for the underlying fluid-dynamics physical picture down to ∼ 65 nm, the radius of the nanoparticle sample used in this work, and pointed to next experimental challenges being in the sub-100 nm regime where finite-temperature fluctuations and the molecularity of the fluid are expected to become increasingly noticeable for smaller nanoparticles.
40228156	Large and Tunable Electron-Depletion-Based Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy in the CoFeB/MgO System via Work-Function-Engineered Pt<sub><i>x</i></sub>W<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub> Underlayers.	Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA) effect is a promising strategy for reducing energy consumption in Magnetic Random-Access Memory (MRAM) for embedded applications. However, the low efficiency of VCMA poses challenges for CoFeB/MgO-based MRAM. Although significant VCMA coefficients have been predicted based on electron depletion (ED) in the orbital population model for Fe/MgO interfaces, experimental validation remains limited. Here, we demonstrate an effective and industry-compatible approach to achieving an electrical-field tunable interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and an enhanced VCMA coefficient by synthesizing W-based metallic alloy underlayers with varying Pt concentrations, leveraging Pt's high work function and strong electronegativity. Compared with pure W control devices, the alloy with the highest Pt concentration achieves a VCMA enhancement approximately eight times greater. Additionally, significant electron depletion in the Fe 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and 2p<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals at the CoFeB/MgO interface is observed through binding energy shifts. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) confirms these shifts as increased binding energies, indicating reduced electron density at the interface. These findings suggest that VCMA efficiency in MRAM devices can be enhanced by controlling the Fermi surface at the CoFeB/MgO interface under thermal equilibrium.
40228155	Engineered Macrophage Membrane-Camouflaged Nanodecoys Reshape the Infectious Microenvironment for Efficient Periodontitis Treatment.	A vicious cycle between microbiota dysbiosis and hyperactivated inflammation, hardly disrupted by conventional therapies, remains a significant clinical challenge for periodontitis treatment. Herein, by cloaking a cascade catalysis system in an engineered macrophage membrane, a nanodecoy-based strategy, with targeted bacteria-killing and immunomodulatory abilities, is proposed for reshaping the hostile periodontitis microenvironment. Specifically, recombinant human antimicrobial peptide, LL-37, is anchored to a Toll-like receptor-enriched macrophage membrane via genetic engineering, which facilitates the specific bacteria elimination and efficient tissue retention of the nanodecoys. Moreover, the cascade catalysis system integrates L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) with hollowed manganese dioxide (hMnO<sub>2</sub>) by reciprocal elevation of the catalytic efficiency of hMnO<sub>2</sub> and LAAO, leading to accelerated O<sub>2</sub> generation under a hypoxic microenvironment and disrupted metabolism of periodontopathogenic bacteria. Notably, the nanodecoys trigger the nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor-2 (NRF2) to reduce oxidative stress response and rewire the polarization of macrophages, thereby boosting the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts. Furthermore, the alveolar bone regeneration therapeutically benefits from the nanodecoys in vivo. Altogether, these results highlight the attractive functions of engineered macrophage membrane-cloaked nanodecoys for effective periodontitis treatment.
40228154	Endophytic Bacterial Communities Facilitate the Dissipation of Phthalates in Soil and Their Biodegradation in <i>Oryza Sativa</i> L.	The role of endophytic bacterial communities in aiding the degradation of organic pollutants like phthalates (PAEs) in soil and <i>in planta</i>, as well as their effects on pollutant accumulation in plants, remains unclear. Herein, microcosm experiments were conducted with rice cultivated in agricultural soil polluted with di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and further verified with PAE-degrading endophytic consortia. Soil indigenous microbes, especially PAE-degrading bacteria, significantly contributed to DEHP dissipation in soil and diminished DEHP accumulation in rice. Endophytic bacterial communities participated in DEHP degradation <i>in planta</i>, as validated by efficient DEHP degradation by <i>in vitro</i> culturable endophytic consortia and abundant PAE-degrading genes. The inoculation of PAE-degrading endophytic consortia demonstrated their immigration between soil and roots (especially in low-PAE-accumulating cultivar), which enhanced DEHP degradation in soil and in planta and subsequently reduced rice PAE accumulation. This study underscores the facilitative role of endophytic bacterial communities in PAE degradation and in lowering PAE accumulation in crops.
40228153	Chiral Luminescent Ion Pair (CLIP) Strategy Enables Amorphous Platinum Complexes Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence.	Chiral ion-pairing (CIP) has been developed as an effective chirality transfer strategy from chiral ionic species to its achiral counter-ionic substrate. When the achiral counter-ions were endowed luminescent property, the resultant chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) will open a new window for high-performance chiral luminescence. In this research, three pairs of CLIP molecules featuring the platinum complexes as achiral cationic luminophore and the chiral anion (CA) as chiral source were constructed. The CLIP molecules demonstrate circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with quantum yields (ΦPL) up to 71.5%, dissymmetry factor (gcpp) values of 1.8×10-2 in amorphous state and gcpp up to -0.99 in cholesteric liquid crystal. Results show that the chiroptical properties can be assigned to the chirality transfer from the CAs to the formed twisted dimeric or oligomeric self-assemblies of platinum complex cations. This research presents a new approach for achieving high performance chiral luminescence of amorphous chiral metal complexes, providing a concise model for revealing the chirality transfer in CLIP materials.
40228152	Oxetane Cleavage Pathways in the Excited State: Photochemical Kinetic Resolution as an Approach to Enantiopure Oxetanes.	Chiral spirocyclic oxetanes [2-oxo-spiro(3<i>H</i>-indole-3,2'-oxetanes)] were subjected to irradiation in the presence of a chiral thioxanthone catalyst (5 mol %) at λ = 398 nm. An efficient kinetic resolution was observed, which led to an enrichment of one oxetane enantiomer as the major enantiomer (15 examples, 37-50% yield, 93-99% <i>ee</i>). The minor enantiomer underwent decomposition, and the decomposition products were carefully analyzed. They arise from a photocycloreversion (retro-Paternò-Büchi reaction) into a carbonyl component and an olefin. The cycloreversion offers two cleavage pathways depending on whether a C-O bond scission or a C-C bond scission occurs at the spirocyclic carbon atom. The course of this reaction was elucidated by a suite of mechanistic, spectroscopic, and quantum chemical methods. In the absence of a catalyst, cleavage occurs exclusively by initial C-O bond scission, leading to formaldehyde and a tetrasubstituted olefin as cleavage products. Time-resolved spectroscopy on the femtosecond/picosecond time scale, synthetic experiments, and calculations suggest the reaction to occur from the first excited singlet state (S<sub>1</sub>). In the presence of a sensitizer, triplet states are populated, and the first excited triplet state (T<sub>1</sub>) is responsible for cleavage into an isatin and a 1,1-diarylethene by an initial C-C bond scission. The kinetic resolution is explained by the chiral catalyst recruiting predominantly one enantiomer of the spirocyclic oxindole. A two-point hydrogen-bonding interaction is responsible for the recognition of this enantiomer, as corroborated by NMR titration studies and quantum chemical calculations. Transient absorption studies on the nanosecond/microsecond time scale allowed for observing the quenching of the catalyst triplet by either one of the two oxetane enantiomers with a slight preference for the minor enantiomer. In a competing situation with both enantiomers present, energy transfer to the major enantiomer is suppressed initially by the better-binding minor enantiomer and─as the reaction progresses─by oxindole fragmentation products blocking the binding site of the catalyst.
40228151	Donor and Geometry Optimization: Fresh Perspectives for the Design of Polyoxometalate Charge Transfer Chromophores.	Three linear, dipolar arylimido-polyoxometalate (POM) and one 2-dimensional <i>bis</i>-functionalized arylimido-polyoxometalate charge transfer chromophore, with diphenylacetylene bridges, have been synthesized and studied by spectroelectrochemistry, hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS), and DFT/TD-DFT calculations. The linear systems show that with julolidinyl (Jd) and -NTol<sub>2</sub> donor groups, the alkyne bridge yields high second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) coefficients β (Jd, β<sub>0,<i>zzz</i></sub> = 318 × 10<sup>-30</sup> esu; -NTol<sub>2</sub>, β<sub>0,<i>zzz</i></sub> = 222 × 10<sup>-30</sup> esu), indeed the Jd compound gives the highest NLO activity of any organoimido-POM to date with minimal decrease in transparency. The <i>bis</i>-functionalized 2D (<i>C</i><sub>2v</sub>) POM derivative showed increased activity over its monofunctionalized analogue with no decrease in transparency, although the NLO response was only minimally two dimensional. Spectroelectrochemistry and TD-DFT calculations showed switchable linear optical responses for the monofunctionalized derivatives due to the weakened charge transfer character of the electronic transitions in the reduced state, while TD-DFT also indicated potential for switched NLO responses. These have been demonstrated by electrochemistry-HRS for the Jd compound, but cyclability is limited by relatively poor stability in the reduced state. IR and CV studies for these sterically protected arylimido polyoxometalates indicate that decomposition proceeds via a breakdown of the {Mo<sub>6</sub>} cluster in the reduced state, rather than simple solvolysis of the Mo≡N bond.
40228150	Triarylmethyl Cations as Photocatalysts for Radical-Mediated Cycloaddition Reactions.	We have developed a novel photocatalytic system using readily available triarylmethyl cations for radical-mediated (4 + 2) and (2 + 2) cycloaddition reactions. A variety of substituted triarylmethyl cations were investigated, and the optimal catalyst exhibited high efficiency and broad substrate scope, affording the desired cycloadducts in good to excellent yields with high regio- and diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, the catalyst could be immobilized on a polymer support and reused multiple times without a significant loss of activity.
40228149	Social Support and Life Satisfaction Among Female College Students: Serial Mediation of Grit and Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction.	Social support plays an important role in helping female college students in particular to achieve and feel well in the face of changing social circumstances. The present study aims to delve into the specific mechanisms through which social support contributes to enhancing life satisfaction among female college students. Therefore, a serial mediation model was tested to examine the relationship between social support, grit, basic psychological needs satisfaction, and life satisfaction among female college students. 588 female college students residing in China, with an average age of 19 years (SD = 1.29), participated in this study. The instruments used included the Social Support Scale, the Grit Scale, the Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction Scale, and the Life Satisfaction Scale. Correlation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed to examine the relationships among the variables. The study findings reveal a positive association between higher levels of social support and increased grit, as well as satisfaction of basic psychological needs among female college students. The structural equation modeling confirms the validity of the serial mediation model. This model suggests that social support is a significant predictor of holistic well-being, with its influence on life satisfaction being partially mediated by grit and basic psychological needs satisfaction. The findings underscore the importance of social support as a potential pathway to enhancing life satisfaction through the cultivation of grit and the satisfaction of psychological needs.
40228148	Separating the Role of Gut Enzymatic Transformation in Modulating Internal Exposure to Three Major Phthalates.	The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is crucial in the absorption and metabolism of xenobiotics, including phthalates─widespread environmental contaminants associated with various health risks. Estimating human exposure to phthalates via biomonitoring is challenging due to their complex metabolic pathways, resulting in a mass-balance gap between internal and external exposure. The relative contributions of the GIT and liver to phthalate metabolism remain underexplored. This study investigated the metabolism of three representative phthalate diesters─dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) in GIT. We first incubated these diesters in simulated stomach and small intestine fluids to identify the primary enzyme responsible for their hydrolysis. The kinetics were further investigated under varying pH conditions (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 or 7.5) to mimic the small intestine environment. Next, using a refined human physiologically based toxicokinetic model, we quantified the relative contributions of preabsorption intestinal versus postabsorption hepatic biotransformation to the body burden of phthalates. Our results suggested that DBP and DEHP were extensively metabolized (>90%) in the GIT by lipase, with comparatively lower hepatic involvement, while DEP underwent minimal preadsorption metabolism (13%) in the GIT, highlighting the influence of structure-dependent differences on metabolic rates. This study emphasized the importance of incorporating both intestinal and hepatic metabolism into toxicokinetic analyses. The findings demonstrate the GIT's critical role in limiting phthalate bioavailability, underscoring the need to account for the intestinal first-pass effect in toxicokinetic models to enhance predictions of phthalate pharmacokinetics and health impacts.
40228147	Effects of Surface Plasmon and Catalytic Reactions on Capacitance in Metal-Semiconductor Schottky Diodes.	Capacitors, renowned for their high power and energy density attributed to their rapid discharge capabilities, hold significant promise as energy storage devices. While capacitors with various junctions have been the subject of extensive research, there remains a significant knowledge gap concerning the fundamental photoelectron dynamics within metal-semiconductor (MS) junction capacitance, which is crucial for the development of photodevices. Here, we demonstrate the effects of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on the capacitance behavior of Au/TiO<sub>2</sub> Schottky diodes, one of the MS junction diode systems. We have confirmed that the plasmonic Au/TiO<sub>2</sub> shows substantial photoresponsiveness, with an increase in net total capacitance under stronger plasmonic effects, as confirmed by wavelength- and power-dependent studies. To enhance our understanding of the electron transfer process occurring at the MS junction, we expand our investigation of capacitance within a catalytic reaction environment, specifically focusing on Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub> Schottky diodes. We show the catalytic environment changes capacitance values of the Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>, and more active catalytic reactions decrease net total capacitance due to catalytic electrons interfering with diffusion electrons. The LSPR effect and catalytic reaction significantly impact the net total capacitance with a predominant contribution associated with hot electrons, catalytic electrons, and diffusion effects. These findings provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing efficient optical and catalytic devices across diverse applications.
40228146	Translation of Nickel-Catalyzed C(sp<sup>2</sup>)-C(sp<sup>3</sup>) Cross-Electrophile Coupling to Non-Amide Solvents.	The cross-electrophile coupling of organobromides is widely utilized in organic synthesis but generally requires undesirable amide solvents (e.g., DMF, DMA, and NMP). We report that the combination of a strongly donating, bidentate nitrogen ligand, LiI, and 4-picoline enables coupling in a variety of alcohol, ester, and ethereal solvents at up to 50 g scale. An improved synthesis of the optimal ligand, 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)-2,2'-bipyridine, is also reported on the basis of the reductive homocoupling of 4-dimethylamino-2-chloropyridine.
40228145	Cis-regulatory Alterations in FOXP4 Modulate Esophageal Cancer Susceptibility Induced by Chronic Alcohol Exposure.	Chronic alcohol exposure is a risk factor for developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). To identify alcohol-responsive genes involved in esophageal carcinogenesis, we employed mouse models to systematically investigate alterations in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the esophageal epithelium across different ethanol exposure durations. A key exposure duration, 16 weeks of exposure to 20% ethanol, corresponded with increased expression of 222 genes that correlated with ESCC progression and were enriched in pathways related to epithelial proliferation and oncogenesis. Construction of a comprehensive CRE-gene map in human ESCC enables further evaluation of the role of the alcohol-responsive genes in ESCC susceptibility, identifying promoter and enhancer variants. A three-stage case-control study involving 9,033 ESCC cases and 10,801 controls revealed an enhancer variant, rs10223516, in FOXP4 that was associated with ESCC susceptibility through gene-alcohol interaction. The rs10223516 variant modulated FOXP4 expression through a long-range interaction, with the T allele exhibiting higher enhancer activity. Alcohol drinkers with the TT genotype exhibited a 76% higher risk of developing ESCC than non-drinkers with CC or TC genotype. Functional assays confirmed that the variant enhanced FOXP4 transcriptional activity, and upregulated FOXP4 promoted ESCC development in vivo. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses further demonstrated that FOXP4 enhanced ESCC susceptibility and tumor growth by transcriptionally activating CYP26B1 and MYC. These findings highlight the complex gene-environment interactions between alcohol consumption and epigenetic alterations in esophageal tumorigenesis, offering potential targets for ESCC detection and prevention.
40228144	Trehalose-Releasing Nanogels: Study on Trehalose Release and Insights into Selected Biologically Relevant Aspects.	Trehalose has sparked considerable interest in a variety of pharmaceutical applications as well as in cryopreservation. Recently, there have been growing efforts in the development of trehalose delivery nanocarriers to address the issue of the poor bioavailability of trehalose. The majority of the strategies comprise physical entrapment of trehalose, since its covalent, yet biolabile, conjugation is challenging. Here, we present research on trehalose-releasing nanogels, in which covalent, yet biolabile, conjugation of trehalose was achieved through the co-incorporation of trehalose (meth)acrylate(s) together with hydrophilic primary/secondary acrylamides in one polymeric network. In this case, the primary and secondary amide groups participated in ester hydrolysis in the (meth)acrylate units, making the hydrolysis feasible under physiologically relevant conditions. A set of nanogels with precisely selected compositions were synthesized, characterized, and then studied to evaluate the influence of various structural and environmental factors on the release rate of trehalose. The study also provides insights into some other aspects that are important in view of potential biomedical applications, including specific interactions of nanogels through their terminal α-d-glucopyranosyl moieties from pendant trehalose, protein corona formation, and cellular uptake.
40228143	An Unusual Friedel-Crafts Reaction and Violation of the Markovnikov Rule in the Formation of an Adamantyl Arene.	Yoshihara, Hiroki, Yagi, and Itami utilized an unusual Friedel-Crafts-like alkylation in the synthesis of an adamantane-annulated arene. The precursor was a 3° carbocation, which they proposed undergoes a Wagner-Meerwein shift to a 2° carbocation, which subsequently alkylates a benzene ring. This mechanism was supported by their DFT calculations. However, their choice of the B3LYP functional often finds false transition structures. A more appropriate functional showed that the alkylation occurs via a concerted reaction.

To examine the predictive performance of the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) competing-risks model for the first-trimester prediction of a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate in a large, independent, unselected European cohort and to compare the competing-risks algorithm with previously published logistic-regression models.
40228139	Immunological Tolerance to Luciferase and Fluorescent Proteins using Tol Mice Enables Development of Improved Tumor Models for Investigating Immunity and Metastasis.	There is a continuing need for improved preclinical mouse models of cancer that more accurately predict therapy outcomes for future clinical translation. Luciferase and bioluminescence have long been utilized to generate models conducive to non-invasive imaging to monitor tumor growth, disease progression and response to therapy. However, luciferase, as well as fluorescent reporter proteins, are highly immunogenic, limiting their use in some syngeneic tumor models in immunocompetent mice. Here, we described the utility of transgenic mice engineered to have tolerance to luciferase and several other reporter proteins, known as Tol mice, in cancer immunology research. Tumor cell lines expressing both luciferase and GFP were completely rejected in wild-type mice but maintained robust growth in Tol mice. Additionally, Tol mice allowed the development of an experimental brain metastasis model and a post-surgical resection spontaneous metastasis model. Importantly, even when certain cell lines carrying reporter proteins successfully formed tumors in immunocompetent wild-type mice, underlying immunity existed that could be reinvigorated by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, caution is needed when using such models in wild-type mice as exaggerated effects may be induced by immunotherapy. Tol mice circumvent this problem and will likely widen the number of orthotopic and metastatic tumor models that can be used in immunotherapy studies in both C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice.

40228135	Reconsidering indoor residual spraying coverage targets: A retrospective analysis of high-resolution programmatic malaria control data.	Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the core vector control interventions available to malaria control programs. Normative and scientific guidance has long held that very high IRS coverage (at least 80 to 85% houses sprayed) is necessary to provide community protection, but there is little evidence backing these recommendations, in large part due to the operational and ethical concerns that conducting appropriate trials of differing IRS coverage levels would raise. The present study leverages data from four years of targeted IRS implementation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, to estimate a dose-response curve of IRS coverage. Due to the observational nature of the data, a double robust causal inference technique was utilized. The results suggest that at all spatial scales examined a threshold providing community protection was reached at much lower coverage levels than previously assumed (30 to 50%). Sensitivity analysis corroborated this result across multiple methods, but there was less agreement on whether extremely high coverage ([Formula: see text]85%) has additional benefit. A secondary analysis of the impact of changing operational coverage targets found that significantly reducing coverage targets (to 30 to 60%) could provide nearly the same protection as maintaining the existing 80% target in Bioko. While these findings are limited in strength by the observational nature of the data and may be specific to the context of Bioko Island, they raise important questions for further research on how IRS coverage impacts epidemiological outcomes and on how malaria control programs should set programmatic IRS coverage targets.
40228134	The world through infant eyes: Evidence for the early emergence of the cardinal orientation bias.	The structure of the environment includes more horizontal and vertical (i.e. cardinal) orientations than oblique orientations, meaning that edges tend to be aligned with or perpendicular to the direction of gravity. This bias in the visual scene is associated with a bias in visual sensitivity in adults. Although infants must learn to function in this biased environment, their immature motor control prevents them from consistently orienting themselves, relative to gravity. This study therefore asked whether cardinal orientations dominate human visual experience from early infancy or only from later in development, as motor control improves. We analyze video clips from head-mounted cameras, showing the egocentric perspective of 75 infants (1 to 12 mo) in their home environments in two communities (Indiana, USA vs. Tamil Nadu, India). We measured the distribution of orientations in each frame of these videos and found that horizontal and vertical orientations were overrepresented in infants from both countries. A cardinal orientation bias was evident even in the egocentric view of the youngest infants (3 wk) and became more prominent during the subsequent weeks of development. The early presence of a cardinal orientation bias in infants' visual input may serve as a consistent cue to gravity and ground planes, potentially influencing motor development and contributing to the formation of sensory, perceptual, and cognitive biases.
40228133	Assessing neighborhoods, wealth differentials, and perceived inequality in preindustrial societies.	Humans often live in neighborhoods, nested socio-spatial clusters within settlements of varying size and population density. In today's cities, neighborhoods are often characterized as relatively homogenous and may exhibit segregation along various socioeconomic dimensions. However, even within neighborhoods of similar social or economic status, there is often residential disparity, which in turn impacts perceived inequality. Drawing on the Global Dynamics of Inequality (GINI) project database, we study housing inequality within a sample of neighborhoods using the Gini coefficient of residential unit area and related measures of inequality. We examine patterns of intracommunity inequality within more than 80 settlements from diverse spatiotemporal contexts including some of the earliest cities in Mesopotamia, the Roman Empire, the Classic Maya region, the Central Andes, and the Indus River Basin. Residential disparity differs within and among sectors of these settlements; some neighborhoods exhibit more similarity in residence size, resulting in lower degrees of housing inequality, while other sectors display greater variations in residence size with higher degrees of housing inequality. We observe a meaningful relationship between neighborhood inequality and population size, but not date of foundation or longevity of occupation. The macro-level structural processes associated with varying forms of governance seem to trickle down to the scale of the neighborhood. These findings may help explain why more unequal systems are not necessarily more unstable, as the inequality people experienced in their neighborhoods may generally have been less than that present in the overall settlement.
40228132	Kuznets' tides: An archaeological perspective on the long-term dynamics of sustainable development.	Understanding the relationship between inequality and economic growth is a critical science problem that hinders sustainable development. In 1955, Simon Kuznets hypothesized that rising economic growth raises inequality, which levels off as that growth continues. Kuznets' "curve," which is a cornerstone of development economics, was based on data from a small sample of rich capitalist economies. Here, we draw on the GINI database, which includes area measurements of 53,464 residences from 1,176 settlements dating from 21,000 BC to the present, and published data from the Spatial Analysis in Maya Studies (SAMS) group, to radically reevaluate Kuznets' curve. We use Gini coefficients of residential disparity, a proxy of inequality, and mean residence area, a proxy of productivity, to investigate past sustainable development in the Bronze Age Interaction Zone (BAIZ), the Mundo Maya, and Britain prior to, over the course of, and after the Roman conquest. We interpolate spatial patterns across each zone to statistically evaluate changes in inequality and economic growth. We find a recurring pattern in which phases of sustainable development, a rise in productivity without a rise in inequality, gave way to increasing inequality. These patterns resemble those Branko Milanovic termed "Kuznets' waves," albeit at timescales better described as "tides," which began after the introduction of weight metrology, an early form of economic governance associated with long-distance exchange. We posit that past sustainable development was predicated on balancing reciprocity from the bottom-up with mechanisms like early weight metrology but was repeatedly forestalled as inchoate elites co-opted these mechanisms.
40228131	Economic inequality is fueled by population scale, land-limited production, and settlement hierarchies across the archaeological record.	Defining wealth broadly to include wealth in people, relational connections, and material possessions, we examine the prehistory of wealth inequality at the level of the residential units using the consistent proxy of Gini coefficients calculated across areas of contemporaneous residential units. In a sample of >1,100 sites and > 47,000 residential units spanning >10,000 y, persistent wealth inequality typically lags the onset of plant cultivation by more than a millennium. It accompanies landscape modifications and subsistence practices in which land (rather than labor) limits production, and growth of hierarchies of settlement size. Gini coefficients are markedly higher through time in settlements at or near the top of such hierarchies; settlements not enmeshed in these systems remain relatively egalitarian even long after plant and animal domestication. We infer that some households in top-ranked settlements were able to exploit the network effects, agglomeration opportunities, and (eventually) political leverage provided by these hierarchies more effectively than others, likely boosted by efficient intergenerational transmission of material resources after increased sedentism made that more common. Since population growth is associated with increased sedentism, more land-limited production, and the appearance and growth of settlement hierarchies, it is deeply implicated in the postdomestication rise of wealth inequality. Governance practices mediate the degree of wealth inequality, as do technical innovations such as the use of animals for portage, horseback riding, and the development of iron smelting.
40228130	Changes in agglomeration and productivity are poor predictors of inequality across the archaeological record.	We address three basic issues regarding the long-term dynamics of inequality in society. First, we consider the interpretation of residence sizes in socioeconomic terms by comparing statistical patterns extracted from the Global Dynamics of Inequality (GINI) Project database with those from the 21st-century United States. Second, we examine the degree to which the size and productivity of human networks is systematically related to inequality. Finally, we investigate relationships between productivity and productivity growth distributions for patterns of inequality and development across preindustrial societies. We find that across preindustrial societies residence size distributions provide a reasonable proxy for the distribution of productivity (income, a flow of physical and social resources to the group) and a minimum estimator for the distribution of wealth (a stock of such resources accumulated over time); that scale and productivity affect levels of inequality but account for only a small fraction of the observed variance across societies; and that inequality growth is independent of productivity growth, on average and over time. These findings have important implications for efforts to promote more equitable economic development in the present.
40228129	War both reduced and increased inequality over the past ten thousand years.	Scholars are divided over the long-term effects that war has had on inequality. Some have argued that conflict grows the gap between rich and poor. Others counter that violence levels out wealth differences. The GINI Project Database is a large global sample of archaeological data on house sizes created to investigate what factors influenced economic inequality over long periods of time, including warfare. Over 39,000 individual residential units were coded as having fortifications present or absent, with about a third in fortified settlements (n = 13,372) and two-thirds in unfortified settlements (n = 25,897). We compared residential disparity (differences in residential unit sizes within a settlement) at sites around the world (n = 770) dating as far back as 10,000 y ago. We found strong support for the expectation that conflict was linked with increasing residential disparity (i.e., wealth inequality), specifically when governance was less collective and the main factor limiting agricultural production was available land. However, we also found long periods, especially in the earliest eras represented in the database, when fortified settlements had residential disparity less than or equal to unfortified settlements. These early societies tended to be more collective with available labor limiting agricultural production. We speculate that in these communities, the relative value of coalition building was higher, whereas in cases where conflict was associated with rising residential disparity, elites found a way to leverage their wealth to protect property. These contradictory models help explain why war co-occurs with increasing inequality in some cases and decreasing inequality in others.
40228128	100 generations of wealth equality after the Neolithic transitions.	From Rousseau onward, scholars have identified the transition to sedentary agriculture as crucial to the history of wealth inequality. Here, using the GINI project's global database on disparities in residential size, we examine the effects of important innovations in plant cultivation, animal husbandry, and traction on wealth inequality. Over a series of regional case studies, we find no evidence of major changes in residential disparity before or after these technological innovations became widespread, and where the effects of systemic change are recognizable, they are ambiguous. The introduction of horticulture/farming is accompanied by a slight general increase in inequality, while subsequent innovations tend to have a leveling effect. Although increasing productivity and surplus are critical to generating wealth inequality, nothing in our data suggests that rising productivity alone led to greater wealth inequality.
40228127	SNX10 deficiency impairs sensitivity to anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates via altering HER2 trafficking in HER2-positive breast cancer.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a rapidly developing therapeutic approach in cancer treatment that has shown remarkable efficacy in breast cancer. Despite the promising efficacy of anti-HER2 ADCs, many patients are still experiencing disease progression under treatment. Here, by analyzing the transcriptome data from patient-derived organoid models, I-SPY2 trial, and resistant cell lines, we identified that SNX10 deficiency conferred anti-HER2 ADCs resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. Low levels of SNX10 attenuated HER2 recycling and promoted HER2 trafficking into lysosomes. Furthermore, we found the underlying mechanism of SNX10 in HER2 traffic by regulating the endosomal RAB11A. We propose that SNX10 deficiency contributes to the inhibition of HER2 recycling as well as the decrease of cell-surface HER2 and causes anti-HER2 ADC resistance.
40228126	Iconicity as an organizing principle of the lexicon.	The view that words are arbitrary is a foundational assumption about language, used to set human languages apart from nonhuman communication. We present here a study of the alignment between the semantic and phonological structure (systematicity) of American Sign Language (ASL), and for comparison, two spoken languages-English and Spanish. Across all three languages, words that are semantically related are more likely to be phonologically related, highlighting systematic alignment between word form and word meaning. Critically, there is a significant effect of iconicity (a perceived physical resemblance between word form and word meaning) on this alignment: words are most likely to be phonologically related when they are semantically related and iconic. This phenomenon is particularly widespread in ASL: half of the signs in the ASL lexicon are <i>iconically</i> related to other signs, i.e., there is a nonarbitrary relationship between form and meaning that is shared across signs. Taken together, the results reveal that iconicity can act as a driving force behind the alignment between the semantic and phonological structure of spoken and signed languages, but languages may differ in the extent that iconicity structures the lexicon. Theories of language must account for iconicity as a possible organizing principle of the lexicon.
40228125	The emergence and loss of cyclic peptides in <i>Nicotiana</i> illuminate dynamics and mechanisms of plant metabolic evolution.	Specialized metabolism plays a central role in how plants cope with both biotic and abiotic stresses in order to survive and reproduce within dynamic and challenging environments. One recently described class of plant-specific, ribosomally synthesized, and posttranslationally modified peptides are the burpitides, which are characterized by the installation of distinct sidechain macrocycles by enzymes known as burpitide cyclases. While they are found across many plant families and exhibit diverse bioactivities, little is known about their evolution or how new variants arise. Here, we present the identification of a burpitide cyclase, resurrected from a defunct pseudogene from the model organism <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>, the coyote tobacco. By repairing the pseudogene <i>ΨNatBURP2</i> and expressing it heterologously in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, we successfully reconstituted its original enzymatic activity. As an autocatalytic peptide cyclase, it installs a unique C-C bond between the tyrosine side chain and a specific backbone α-carbon of a heptapeptide core motif, resulting in burpitides dubbed "nanamins." Despite its pseudogenization in <i>N. attenuata</i>, we found that the closely related species, <i>Nicotiana clevelandii</i>, retains the wild-type gene and produces nanamins. Phylogenetic analyses and targeted mutagenesis experiments reveal that this chemotype must have evolved from the duplication and neofunctionalization of a more promiscuous ancestral gene. This work highlights how novel peptide chemotypes may rapidly emerge and disappear in plants, while expanding the molecular toolkit for engineering novel peptides with applications in agriculture and drug discovery.
40228124	A rare variant in <i>GPR156</i> associated with depression in a Mennonite pedigree causes habenula hyperactivity and stress sensitivity in mice.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Risk for MDD is heritable, and the genetic structure of founder populations enables investigation of rare susceptibility alleles with large effect. In an extended Old Order Mennonite family cohort, we identified a rare missense variant in <i>GPR156</i> (c.1599G>T, p.Glu533Asp) associated with a two-fold increase in the relative risk of MDD. GPR156 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor localized in the medial habenula, a region implicated in mood regulation. Insertion of a human sequence containing c.1599G>T into the murine <i>Gpr156</i> locus induced medial habenula hyperactivity and abnormal stress-related behaviors. This work reveals a human variant that is associated with depression, implicates GPR156 as a target for mood regulation, and introduces informative murine models for investigating the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders.
40228123	The multifaceted roles of the transcriptional coactivator TAZ in extravillous trophoblast development of the human placenta.	Insights into the molecular processes that drive early development of the human placenta is crucial for our understanding of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, since defects in maturation of its epithelial cell, the trophoblast, have been detected in the severe forms of these diseases. However, key regulators specifying the differentiated trophoblast subtypes of the placenta are only slowly emerging. By using diverse trophoblast cell models, we herein show that the transcriptional coactivator of HIPPO signaling, TAZ, plays a pivotal role in the development of invasive extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), cells that are essential for decidual vessel remodeling and adaption of maternal blood flow to the placenta. Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) or protein analyses upon TAZ gene silencing or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout in differentiating trophoblast stem cells, organoids, primary EVTs, choriocarcinoma cells, or villous explant cultures unraveled that the coactivator promoted expression of genes associated with EVT identity, motility, and survival. Accordingly, depletion or chemical inhibition of TAZ, interacting with TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1), impaired EVT differentiation, invasion, and migration and triggered apoptosis in the different trophoblast models. Notably, the coactivator also suppressed cell cycle genes and regulators of trophoblast self-renewal and prevented EVTs from cell fusion in organoids and primary cultures. Moreover, TAZ promoted human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) surface expression and increased NUAK1 kinase in EVTs thereby maintaining its own expression. In summary, the transcriptional coactivator TAZ plays a multifaceted role in the development of the EVT cell lineage by controlling different biological processes that initiate and preserve differentiation.
40228122	A plant CLE peptide and its fungal mimic promote arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis via CRN-mediated ROS suppression.	CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-related (CLE) peptides have emerged as key regulators of plant-microbe interactions, including arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Here, we identify <i>Medicago truncatula</i> CLE16 as a positive regulator of AM symbiosis. <i>MtCLE16</i> is expressed in root cells colonized by AM fungi (AMF) and its overexpression within colonized tissues increases arbuscule abundance by finetuning their growth and lifespan. Functional and transcriptomic analyses reveal that MtCLE16 acts via the <i>M. truncatula</i> pseudokinase CORYNE (MtCRN) and suppresses the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in roots, thereby attenuating immune responses and promoting root colonization by mutualistic AM fungi. Notably, AMF also express MtCLE16-like peptides. We show that the <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> MtCLE16-like peptide, RiCLE1, also attenuates ROS and promotes AMF colonization via MtCRN. This finding suggests that RiCLE1 can interfere with the MtCLE16-MtCRN signaling module of host roots to benefit the fungus. Our research uncovers a functional mechanism underpinning cross-kingdom signaling and molecular mimicry in mutualistic plant-microbe interactions.
40228121	A 5-HT-mediated urethral defense against urinary tract infections.	The urethra is considered a passive conduit for urine. Here, we reveal a surprising multicellular signaling pathway guiding the urethra's dynamic response to an invading pathogen. Using a genetic approach in female mice, we deposited uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> into the distal urethra to establish a model of ascending urinary tract infection that progresses to the bladder within 4 h. We show that urethral neuroendocrine cells (UNECs), and the serotonin they synthesize, protect the bladder from bacterial colonization. We tested the hypothesis that serotonin initiates urethral contraction to expel ascending bacteria. We identified transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1, a noncanonical lipopolysaccharide receptor, in human and mouse UNECs and localized the serotonin receptors (HTR) 2B and 3, as well as the calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin 1 (ANO1) to the pacemaker cells of the human and mouse urethra, the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs). HTR2B or ANO1 activation is sufficient for urethral contraction and is required for serotonin-induced mouse urethral contraction. Our results support the hypothesis that the urethra actively surveils its environment and responds to an ascending pathogen by evoking UNECs and ICC to induce urethral contraction and pathogen expulsion.
40228120	Global warming drives a threefold increase in persistence and 1 <sup>°</sup>C rise in intensity of marine heatwaves.	Marine heatwaves are extreme climatic events consisting of persistent periods of warm ocean waters that have profound impacts on marine life. These episodes are becoming more intense, longer, and more frequent in response to anthropogenic global warming. Here, we provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment on the role of global warming on marine heatwaves. To do so, we construct a counterfactual version of observed global sea surface temperatures since 1940, corresponding to a stationary climate without the effect of long-term increasing global temperatures, and use it to calculate the contribution of global air temperature rise on the intensity and persistence of marine heatwaves. We determine that global warming is responsible for nearly half of these extreme events and that, on a global average, it has led to a three-fold increase in the number of days per year that the oceans experience extreme surface heat conditions. We also show that global warming is responsible for an increase of 1 <sup>°</sup>C in the maximum intensity of the events. Our findings highlight the detrimental role that human-induced global warming plays on marine heatwaves. This study supports the need for mitigation and adaptation strategies to address these threats to marine ecosystems.
40228119	Assessing grand narratives of economic inequality across time.	Long-entrenched grand narratives have tied inequality in large human aggregations to generally linear trends, a direct outcome of domestication, then fostered by population growth and/or stepped scalar transitions in the hierarchical complexity of human institutions. This general pattern has been argued to short-circuit or reverse only in the context of cataclysmic disasters or societal breakdowns. Yet, for the most part, these universal deterministic frameworks have been constructed from historical or ethnographic snapshots in time and afford little systematic attention to human institutions or agency. Here, we leverage quantitative, temporally defined archaeological, and ethnographic data from a suite of global regions, most of which transitioned through the process of urbanism and complex hierarchy formation, to examine shifts in degrees of inequality over time. Although broad temporal patterns are evidenced, the regional trends in inequality are neither linear, uniform, nor triggered immediately or mechanically by Malthusian dynamics or scalar increases.
40228118	Targeting the complement lectin pathway with a highly specific MASP-2 inhibitor protects against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.	Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common complication in several clinical scenarios including kidney transplantation. Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteinase (MASP)-2 is essential for activation of the complement lectin pathway, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal IRI and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target. We developed a new, affinity-enhanced MASP-2 inhibitor, EVO24, by directed evolution of the D2 domain of human tissue factor pathway inhibitor. EVO24 was fused with a human IgG1-Fc to create the homodimer EVO24L, which potently and selectively inhibited the lectin pathway in human and mouse serum in vitro. EVO24L was tested in a mouse model of unilateral warm renal IRI. EVO24L administered before and after ischemia significantly protected against IRI, with improved renal function as well as reduced tubular injury and inflammatory cell infiltration at 24 h compared to vehicle-treated mice. Immunofluorescence analyses showed reduced deposition of complement components (C3d, C4d, and C9) and reduced expression of VCAM-1, indicating a decrease in complement activation and endothelial cell activation. Additionally, EVO24L treatment lowered plasma levels of complement C5a, hyaluronan (a marker of endothelial glycocalyx shedding), and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. Our findings indicate that EVO24L inhibits acute inflammatory responses in renal IRI by blocking the lectin pathway, confirming the important role of this pathway in acute ischemic kidney injury and warranting further investigation of EVO24L in clinical settings.
40228117	Housing inequality and settlement persistence are associated across the archaeological record.	Definitions of sustainability commonly stress both systemic continuity and equality over time. However, the degree to which these two sides of sustainability might be related has not been systematically investigated. Recent theoretical and methodological insights have provided archaeologists with new tools for investigating sustainability in premodern societies. Here, we use Gini coefficients on residence size measurements as an estimate of material inequality and information on the persistence of settlements as a measure of continuity. Persistence is derived from the length of time a settlement endured in a particular state, and we assume that higher levels of persistence indicate greater adaptive capacity and resilience. We articulate an approach which allows us to combine these proxies to investigate the relationship between these two sides of sustainability and apply this to a global dataset of settlements from the last 10,000 y. We find that persistence is weakly correlated with material inequality, rather than equality, overall. We also find that this relationship grows stronger as settlement systems increase in scale and is strongest for larger sites in larger systems. This pattern may be the result of both increased functional diversity at a site level and network effects whereby residents of larger settlements were able to claim a larger share of the surplus produced by the settlement system.
40228116	Labor, land, and the global dynamics of economic inequality.	Here, we assess the extent to which land use relating to food acquisition (farming, herding, foraging) and associated value regimes shaped past economic inequality. We consider the hypothesis that land-use systems in which production was limited by heritable material wealth (such as land) sustained higher levels of inequality than those limited by (free) human labor. We address this hypothesis using the Global Dynamics of InequalIty (GINI) project database, estimating economic inequalities based on disparities in residential unit area and storage capacity within sites in different world regions and through time. We find that inequality was significantly greater in land-limited than labor-limited regimes, whether based on residence area or storage capacity, though governance could moderate these differences. Increasing inequality with larger residence and/or site size is associated with underlying shifts from labor- to land-limited economies. Transitions from labor- to land-limited regimes also appear to underlie the development of extended political hierarchies. Increases in inequality after cultivation became common in each hemisphere similarly reflect shifts from labor- to land-limited systems. Land-limited systems in the eastern hemisphere, incorporating animal traction, exhibit an upward trend in inequality over time, while a downward trend in the western hemisphere reflects the lower persistence of land-limited regimes based solely on human labor.

40228114	Temperature thresholds induce abrupt shifts in biodiversity and ecosystem services in montane ecosystems worldwide.	Montane ecosystems are crucial for maintaining global biodiversity and function that sustain life on our planet. Yet, these ecosystems are highly vulnerable to changing temperatures and may undergo critical transitions under ongoing climate change. What we do not know is to what extent montane biodiversity and ecosystem services will respond to local temperature variations in a gradual versus abrupt manner across global environments. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a global synthesis, including 4,462 observations from 290 elevation gradients, to investigate how biodiversity (spanning animals and plants) and ecosystem services (including plant production, soil carbon, and fertility) respond to local temperature variations along elevation gradients. We found that nearly one-third of these gradients exhibited abrupt shifts in multiple biodiversity and ecosystem services in response to local variations in temperature along elevation gradients. More specifically, we showed that once a particular local temperature level (~10 °C for mean annual temperature) was reached, even small increases in temperature resulted in dramatic variations in biodiversity and ecosystem services. We further showed that those abrupt shifts in response to local temperature increases were commonly positive for plant and animal diversity, as well as plant production, while soil carbon and fertility more commonly exhibit negative abrupt trends. Our work, based on the most comprehensive empirical evidence available so far, reveals the pervasive abrupt responses of biodiversity and ecosystem services to local temperature variations in montane ecosystems worldwide, highlighting the highly sensitive nature of montane ecosystems in the context of climate change.
40228113	Molecular design of a therapeutic LSD analogue with reduced hallucinogenic potential.	Decreased dendritic spine density in the cortex is a key pathological feature of neuropsychiatric diseases including depression, addiction, and schizophrenia (SCZ). Psychedelics possess a remarkable ability to promote cortical neuron growth and increase spine density; however, these compounds are contraindicated for patients with SCZ or a family history of psychosis. Here, we report the molecular design and de novo total synthesis of (+)-JRT, a structural analogue of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) with lower hallucinogenic potential and potent neuroplasticity-promoting properties. In addition to promoting spinogenesis in the cortex, (+)-JRT produces therapeutic effects in behavioral assays relevant to depression and cognition without exacerbating behavioral and gene expression signatures relevant to psychosis. This work underscores the potential of nonhallucinogenic psychoplastogens for treating diseases where the use of psychedelics presents significant safety concerns.
40228112	Toward multiscalar measures of inequality in archaeology.	The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure commonly used to characterize distributions of socioeconomic quantities. Archaeologists and social scientists have recently adopted this method to analyze ancient inequality by targeting specific proxy variables (e.g., residential unit size, burial data, etc.). Variations in the Gini are then examined in relation to key factors such as time, geography, and subsistence. Yet, Gini coefficients could be obtained across different scales of aggregation, from small neighborhoods within a larger settlement to an ensemble of multiple settlements that are part of the same polity. These different scales of aggregation represent considerable methodological and theoretical challenges, as larger scales might, for example, imply greater social and economic variation within groups and thus affect the Gini coefficients. Furthermore, these issues can also be exacerbated by the idiosyncrasies and limitations of historical and archaeological datasets. This paper discusses the potential and challenges of measuring Gini coefficients at and above the scale of individual archaeological sites, contrasting different approaches and discussing how each can reveal insights into different patterns of past wealth inequality, addressing methodological, empirical, and theoretical implications arising from the multiscalar nature of human interactions.

40228107	A Photoactivatable Free Mycolic Acid Probe to Investigate Mycobacteria-Host Interactions.	Mycolic acids are long-chain, α-branched, β-hydroxylated fatty acid lipids that populate the outer mycomembrane of mycobacteria, including the pathogen <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Mycolic acids predominantly occur in the form of glycolipids, but nonglycosylated free mycolic acids (fMA), which are generated during mycomembrane remodeling, are major constituents of the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> biofilm extracellular matrix and promote host immune evasion during <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection. However, our understanding of these processes is nascent, and there is limited information about the fMA-protein interactions involved. To facilitate such studies, we synthesized a fMA analogue probe (x-Alk-MA) containing a photo-cross-linking diazirine and a clickable alkyne to enable live-cell capture and analysis of protein interactors. The synthetic strategy featured asymmetric hydrogenation to establish the β-hydroxy group, diastereoselective alkylation to establish the α-branch, and late-stage modification to install the functional tags. In macrophages, x-Alk-MA recapitulated the cytokine response of native MA and selectively photolabeled TREM2, a host cell receptor for fMAs that suppresses macrophage activation and has been implicated in <i>M. tuberculosis</i> immune evasion. The synthetic strategy, chemical probes, and photolabeling methods disclosed herein should facilitate future studies aimed at understanding the roles of fMA in mycobacterial physiology and pathogenesis.
40228106	Species-specific phyllosphere responses to external pH change.	The leaf surface, known as the phylloplane, represents the initial point of contact for plants in their interaction with the aboveground environment. Although prior research has assessed how leaves respond to external pH variations, particularly in the context of acid rain, there remains a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which plants detect, respond to, and mitigate cellular damage. To look at plant responses to external pH changes, we measured the phylloplane pH for five species with variable phylloplane pH that ranged in the dry control. Moreover, we investigated the phylloplane pH in response to three pH treatments (pH 6.5, 4, and 2) and found that plants can modify their phylloplane pH, and this buffering ability is species-specific. Among the species analyzed, only Gossypium displayed a strong buffering ability. For treatments where leaves were exposed to either pH 6.5 or pH 4, Gossypium alkalinized the phylloplane pH slightly higher than the dry control pH. Remarkably, when leaves were exposed to pH 2, Gossypium was able to buffer the pH to 6 within five minutes. Furthermore, our transcriptional analysis indicated that the responses to external pH changes varied among species, highlighting differentially expressed genes associated with calcium (Ca2+) signaling pathways, as well as Ca2+- and H+-ATPases pumps. These findings also suggest that pH stress impacted photosynthesis, and that both wetness and moderate pH shifts may trigger additional abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways.
40228105	Heritability and genomic basis of age-at-maturity in Chinook Salmon.	Intra-population variation in the age at return and reproduction of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), or age-at-maturity, acts as a buffer against stochastic environmental variation. We investigated the genetic component of this trait by estimating heritability of age-at-maturity and the genomic basis of both sex and age-at-maturity in stocks representing the three major lineages of the Columbia River Basin. We found that heritability of age-at-maturity was generally stronger for fathers with male offspring (mean h2 = 0.37, SD = 0.164) than mothers with female offspring (mean h2 = 0.29, SD = 0.077), fathers with female offspring (mean h2 = 0.29, SD = 0.155), or mothers with male offspring (mean h2 = 0.25, SD = 0.100). We identified several regions of the genome that were consistently associated with sex across all three lineages that included expected sex-chromosomes (Chr17, 18), but also putative copies of sex-linked regions in several autosomal chromosomes. Further, large regions of the same two chromosomes (17 and 18) were associated with age-at-maturity in a lineage-specific manner. Patterns of genotype by phenotype with multi-marker haplotypes confirmed the association of SNPs on chromosome 17 with both size (fork length) in natural-origin males from the two interior lineages, and age-at-maturity (ocean-age) in interior ocean-type males, but not in females. Further studies will be necessary to verify other candidate regions and polygenic effects on size and age-at-maturity in this species. While rearing environment and growth play a major role in age-at-maturity, these results provided evidence for genetic heritability and candidate genes associated with this trait that will assist in monitoring genetic variation to maintain life history variation in Chinook Salmon.
40228104	<i>N</i>MR<sup>2</sup>-Based Drug Discovery Pipeline Presented on the Oncogenic Protein KRAS.	Fragment-based drug discovery has emerged as a powerful approach for developing therapeutics against challenging targets, including the GTPase KRAS. Here, we report an NMR-based screening campaign employing state-of-the-art techniques to evaluate a library of 890 fragments against the oncogenic KRAS G12V mutant bound to GMP-PNP. Further HSQC titration experiments identified hits with low millimolar affinities binding within the SI/SII switch region, which forms the binding interface for the effector proteins. To elucidate the binding modes, we applied NMR molecular replacement (<i>N</i>MR<sup>2</sup>) structure calculations, bypassing the need for a conventional protein resonance assignment. Traditionally, <i>N</i>MR<sup>2</sup> relies on isotope-filtered nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments requiring double-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-protein. We introduce a cost-efficient alternative using a relaxation-based filter that eliminates isotope labeling while preserving structural accuracy. Validation against standard isotopically labeled workflows confirmed the equivalence of the derived protein-ligand structures. This approach enabled the determination of 12 <i>N</i>MR<sup>2</sup> KRAS-fragment complex structures, providing critical insights into structure-activity relationships to guide ligand optimization. These results demonstrate the streamlined integration of <i>N</i>MR<sup>2</sup> into a fragment-based drug discovery pipeline composed of screening, binding characterization, and rapid structural elucidation with or without isotopic labeling.

40228101	Unlocking the Potential of Water-Insoluble Natural Polymers: Isolation, Characterization, and 2D NMR Quantification of <i>cis</i>-1,4-Poly-β-myrcene in Chios Mastic Gum.	Natural polymers have garnered attention due to their unique properties, i.e., structural versatility, biocompatibility, and modifiability. Recent efforts focus on sustainable raw materials to develop environmentally friendly processes and products that align with global sustainability goals. Among these, Chios mastic gum, derived from the mastic tree (<i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> var. <i>Chia</i>), is notable for its diverse food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics applications. One of its key components is <i>cis</i>-1,4-poly-β-myrcene, a natural polyterpene polymer, constituting 20-30% of the resin's composition. Despite its potential, the complex composition of Chios mastic gum poses challenges in extracting, isolating, and quantifying its polymeric content. NMR spectroscopy offers a nondestructive approach and may be instrumental in developing standardized methods for quantifying <i>cis</i>-1,4-poly-β-myrcene in Chios mastic gum. Such methods are vital for understanding the resin's composition and exploring potential applications, particularly in sustainable materials and biomedical fields. This study addresses these challenges by producing a <i>cis</i>-1,4-poly-β-myrcene sample as a standard in quantification procedures. Centrifugal partition chromatography, a support-free liquid-liquid chromatography technique, was employed to purify the polymeric fraction. The polymer was then characterized through size exclusion chromatography and NMR methods, including DOSY and quantitative HSQC experiments, to facilitate an accurate analysis and open the door to further applications of this natural polymer.
40228100	Excited-State Absorption: Reference Oscillator Strengths, Wave Function, and TDDFT Benchmarks.	Excited-state absorption (ESA) corresponds to the transition between two electronic excited states and is a fundamental process for probing and understanding light-matter interactions. Accurate modeling of ESA is indeed often required to interpret time-resolved experiments. In this contribution, we present a dataset of 53 ESA oscillator strengths in three different gauges and the associated vertical transition energies between 71 excited states of 21 small- and medium-sized molecules from the QUEST database. In a few cases, we additionally investigated the effect of geometry relaxation on excited-state geometries. The reference values were obtained within the quadratic response (QR) CC3 formalism using eight different Dunning basis sets. We found that the d-<i>aug</i>-cc-pVTZ basis set is always adequate while its more compact double-ζ counterpart, d-<i>aug</i>-cc-pVDZ, performs well in most cases. These QR-CC3 data allow us to assess the performance of QR-TDDFT, with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, using a panel of global and range-separated hybrids (B3LYP, BH&HLYP, CAM-B3LYP, LC-BLYP33, and LC-BLYP47), as well as several lower-order wave function methods, i.e., QR-CCSD, QR-CC2, EOM-CCSD, ISR-ADC(2), and ISR-ADC(3). We show that QR-TDDFT delivers acceptable errors for ESA oscillator strengths with CAM-B3LYP showing particular promise, especially for the largest molecules of our set, and in the Franck-Condon (FC) region. We also find that ISR-ADC(3) exhibits excellent performance in this region. When using excited-state optimal geometries, the relative performance of wave function-based approaches remains consistent with trends observed in the Franck-Condon region. However, for TD(A)-DFT, the accuracy varies more significantly, as the performance of different exchange-correlation functionals significantly depends on the chosen geometry.

40228096	Multiresponsive Zein Nanospheres for Avermectin B<sub>2</sub> Delivery: Enhancing Root-Knot Nematode Control and Safety to Nontarget Organisms.	Root-knot nematodes are globally prevalent plant-parasitic pests, distinguished by their widespread distribution, extensive host range, and challenging control measures. Avermectin B<sub>2</sub>, one of the few effective nematicides available, faces limitations in efficacy and poses environmental concerns due to its eco-unfriendly composition and poor utilization in traditional emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulations. In this study, we developed core-shell structured Ave B<sub>2</sub>-BS@Zein@SC nanospheres, incorporating zein as the carrier, sodium caseinate as the stabilizer, and butyl stearate as the temperature "switch". These nanospheres demonstrated multiresponsive characteristics to temperature, pH, and enzymatic conditions, facilitating rapid pesticide release under elevated temperatures, mildly acidic or alkaline conditions, and in the presence of protease. These controlled-release properties effectively responded to both environmental factors during nematode outbreaks and the intestinal conditions of the nematodes, enhancing pesticide targeting and utilization efficiency. The engineered nanospheres improved the mobility and stability of avermectin B<sub>2</sub> in soil, enabling more comprehensive control of nematodes across broader and deeper soil layers. Additionally, the penetration capability of Ave B<sub>2</sub>-BS@Zein@SC into plant roots effectively eliminated nematodes that had already invaded the root system, thereby strengthening crop protection. Crucially, Ave B<sub>2</sub>-BS@Zein@SC demonstrated enhanced safety for nontarget organisms. This environmentally conscious, and multiresponsive pesticide nanodelivery system presents a promising strategy for sustainable subterranean pest management.

40228090	Targeting CAFs-Mediated Stromal Signaling in a Patient-Derived Organotypic Colorectal Tumor Model.	Colorectal cancer, a significant cause of cancer-related mortality, often exhibits drug resistance, highlighting the need for improved tumor models to advance personalized drug testing and precision therapy. We generated organoids from primary colorectal cancer cells cultured through the conditional reprogramming technique, establishing a framework to perform short-term drug testing studies on patient-derived cells. To model interactions with stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, we combined cancer cell organoids with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a cell type implicated in disease progression and drug resistance. Our organotypic models revealed that CAFs promote cancer cell proliferation and stemness primarily through HGF-MET paracrine signaling and activation of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs). Disrupting these tumor-stromal interactions reduced organoid size while limiting oncogenic signals and cancer stemness. Leveraging this tumor model, we identified effective drug combinations targeting colorectal cancer cells and their tumorigenic activities. Our study highlights a path to incorporate patient-derived cells and tumor-stromal interactions into a drug testing workflow that could identify effective therapies for individual patients.
40228089	Diversity Of ThDP-Dependent Enzymes Forming Chiral Tertiary Alcohols.	Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes are well known biocatalysts for C-C bond-forming reactions. While this enzyme class is mainly investigated for the formation of acyloins of secondary alcohols, recent studies have expanded its scope to utilize ketones as electrophiles in asymmetric carboligation reactions for the formation of tertiary alcohols. Chiral tertiary alcohols are ubiquitous motifs in natural products and important building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive compounds. ThDP-dependent enzymes are emerging as one of the most promising classes of biocatalysts for synthesizing a wide range of products due to the variety of possible substrate combinations, accessible starting materials, high enantioselectivity, and advantageous self-regeneration of the catalytic ThDP cofactor. This review provides an overview of the tertiary alcohol-forming ThDP-dependent enzymes, focusing on the substrate scope, diversity of physiological functions, and future perspectives. Of nine superfamilies of ThDP-dependent enzymes, three (decarboxylases, DC; transketolases, TK; α-ketoacid dehydrogenase superfamily 2, αKADH2) are known to use ketones as acceptor substrates. It is unknown whether other superfamilies of ThDP-dependent enzymes hold similar potential. Inspired by nature, an even broader diversity of classes and substrate specificities is expected in this field.
40228088	Integration of Carboxylate Carbon Dot-Supported Gold Nanoparticles with Boron Nitride Nanosheets for Electrochemical Sensing of Prostate-Specific Antigen via Sandwich Immunoassays.	An electrochemical sandwich immunoassay was fabricated to measure the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biomarker. The PSA immunosensor was developed by altering the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with a nanocomposite comprising carboxyl-functionalized carbon dots that support gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which were then combined with hydroxylated boron nitride nanosheets (HO-BN). This construction possesses distinctive signal enhancement characteristics and was prepared via a facile method. Considering the high biological affinity of AuNPs for biomolecules, carbon dots (CDs) with carboxyl (COOH) groups make a suitable substrate for electrode modification. This alteration allows for the PSA antibody (Ab1) attachment, resulting in a sandwich-like configuration. Additionally, carbon dot-stabilized AuNPs integrated into HO-BN nanosheet nanocomposites considerably boost the electron transfer rate, leading to remarkable potential in sensor applications. By utilizing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antifree PSA antibody (Ab2), a reduction in hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was achieved within the electrochemical cell. This reduction led to increased current, attributed to the increased PSA concentration, which is required for the biosensor analysis to perform properly. The developed immunosensor revealed a linear correlation with PSA concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 3500 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>, achieving a low detection limit of 0.136 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, the PSA aptasensor demonstrates excellent selectivity, remarkable stability, and commendable reproducibility, indicating its significant potential for clinical research and diagnostic applications.
40228087	Regulating the Electronegativity Difference and Piezoelectric Strain of the S-Mo-S Structure via Introducing Mo Vacancies for Boosting Piezo-Photoelectric Activity.	Recently, piezoelectric and photocatalytic processes have shown excellent synergistic effect addressing environmental remediation challenges. Herein, a nanoflower-like Mo vacancy-modulated MoS<sub>2</sub> (V<sub>Mo</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub>) piezo-photocatalyst with different V<sub>Mo</sub> densities has been successfully synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal method. The high V<sub>Mo</sub> density (12%) facilitates the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity but compromises its structural stability, resulting in unsatisfactory piezoelectric activity. Among all V<sub>Mo</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> piezo-photocatalysts, V<sub>Mo</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> with 6% V<sub>Mo</sub> density exhibits the highest piezo-photocurrent density (15.50 μA cm<sup>-2</sup>), the largest potential difference (0.188 V), and the best carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation efficiency (95.81%) in only 10 min under light-ultrasound action, exhibiting a remarkable synergistic effect of the piezoelectric and photocatalytic processes. The synergistic performance originates from the simultaneous modulation of the charge distribution and the self-polarization capability of the S-Mo-S structure by V<sub>Mo</sub>, as confirmed by the molecular theory calculations and finite-element simulation results. This work provides a defect engineering strategy for achieving the synergistic effect of the piezoelectric and photocatalytic processes, which opens a new research avenue for the design and application of the piezo-photocatalyst.
40228086	'I would have blamed myself, but coming back, I can see that it wasn't me': A qualitative, descriptive phenomenological analysis of doctors' reflective processes in recovery from burnout and mental crisis.	Elimination of burnout and work-related mental illness in hospital doctors, at least in the short term, is unrealistic. Supporting doctors' recovery continues to be important. Despite this, the aftermath of work-related mental illness and burnout, is not well understood. Using a descriptive phenomenological method, we describe the experience of coming to terms with mental crisis perceived to be caused or exacerbated by work stress for six senior consultant hospital doctors. Findings show that, in the aftermath of crisis, doctors engaged in two types of reflection: 'situational sense-making' to make sense of their experiences and 'transformative self-reflection', reflection in a deeper way on the experience, themselves and their lives. Transformative self-reflection led to change and in some cases growth. Not all doctors engaged in transformative self-reflection, and the process of recovery was complicated by contextual factors and when support from employers was perceived as absent, poor or acrimonious.
40228078	Refinement and Truncation of DNA Aptamers Based on Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Computational Protocol and Experimental Validation.	Aptamers have proven useful for a wide variety of applications, such as drug delivery systems and analytical reagents for diagnosis or food safety control. Conventional aptamer selection methods typically produce sequences longer than necessary, which are optimized through a postselection trial and error process to obtain the shortest-length sequence that preserves binding affinity. Herein, we describe a general strategy to obtain the tridimensional structure of DNA aptamers using a semiautomated molecular dynamics protocol, which serves as a guide to rationally improve experimentally selected candidates. Based on this approach, we designed truncated aptamers from previously described ligands recognizing different peptides and proteins, which are 20-35% shorter than the original candidates and present similar or even improved binding affinities. Moreover, we also discriminate between energetically similar secondary structures in terms of the energetic scoring of the molecular dynamics trajectories and rationally explain the role of poly thymine spacers in the (de)stabilization of the structure. This work demonstrates how a protocol for generating the aptamers tridimensional structure can accelerate their optimization for obtaining better analytical reagents and therapeutic agents.
40228077	Dipole-Dipole Interaction-Induced Direct Self-Assembly of Ag<sub>2</sub>S Quantum Dots into Supercrystals in Solution.	Long-range ordered supercrystals (SCs) built up by colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) represent a class of novel metamaterials with unique collective properties. While great attention has been paid to the ligand-controlled assembly of NCs, the contribution of the inorganic core is considered limited because of the weak core-core interactions. Here, we report the spontaneous assembly of Ag<sub>2</sub>S quantum dots (QDs) into three-dimensional SCs in solution, driven by pronounced dipole-dipole interactions. Dielectric spectroscopy shows a large permanent dipole moment of 516.7 D in 4.2 nm Ag<sub>2</sub>S QDs, and multiscale molecular simulation proves the dipole-dipole interaction-driven crystallization of Ag<sub>2</sub>S QDs. Moreover, we demonstrate that tuning the dipole-dipole interactions facilitates the formation of diverse nanostructures, including SCs, nanochains, and monodisperse nanoparticles. These findings offer a straightforward strategy for SC synthesis and establish the dipole-dipole interactions as a key driving force of NC self-assembly with broad implications for colloidal nanomaterials and their emergent functionalities.

40228072	Male support, depression, and anxiety in couples undergoing assisted reproductive technologies: a dyadic approach.	Engagement in Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) represents a significant source of stress for infertile couples, particularly for females/women undergoing these techniques, which may exacerbate their mental health and the quality of the marital relationship. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between male partner support in matters related to ART or the pursuit of pregnancy, concerns regarding the impact of infertility on the relationship, and symptoms of anxiety and depression in couples undergoing ART. Path analyses were conducted using the AMOS structural modeling software, applying an Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Model analysis. This approach estimates both the effect of an individual's variable on their own outcome (actor effect) and the effect of the same variable from the perspective of their partner (partner effect) on two outcome variables: symptoms of anxiety and depression. Additionally, analyses of indirect effects between variables were included. The final study sample comprised 96 individuals (48 dyads) from the assisted human reproduction unit of a Spanish hospital. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), two ad hoc items assessing perceived support from the male partner to the female partner, and the subscale Concern about the relationship (Fertility Problem Inventory) were used. The results revealed the presence of actor, partner, and indirect effects in males/men, with both self-reported male support and concerns about the relationship predicting symptoms of anxiety and depression. In females/women, only an actor effect was observed: a lower perceived level of male support was associated with greater concern about the marital relationship. These findings highlight the need for interventions that address both male support (self-reported and partner-perceived) and relationship concerns within psychological care programs for individuals undergoing ART.

40228065	Patient-Reported Outcomes as End Points in Heart Failure Trials.	Heart failure is a growing health-care concern affecting tens of millions of individuals globally. Although traditional therapeutic strategies have focused on reducing the risk for hospitalization and mortality, the importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with heart failure is increasingly being recognized. Regulatory agencies consider PROs part of their evaluation of drugs and devices, and professional society guidelines may recommend interventions that improve PROs. However, for several reasons, the effect of interventions on PROs reported in heart failure trials currently is difficult to interpret. There is no consensus on the timing and frequency of PRO assessments. Moreover, it has been difficult to establish a minimal clinically important difference, that is, the minimal change in a PRO score that is meaningful to a patient. In addition, traditional methods of analyzing and reporting PROs such as comparison of mean differences across groups or responder analysis are prone to statistical artifacts and misinterpretation. This article presents an in-depth discussion of these issues, with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire used as an example, to facilitate the use of PROs in heart failure research, regulatory, and clinical settings.

40228063	Catalytically Active Coacervates Sustained under Out-of-Equilibrium Conditions.	Metabolically active membraneless organelles of extant biology have the capability to maintain their structure under non-equilibrium conditions by leveraging chemical reactions. Herein, we report active coacervates accessed via a mixture of minimal building blocks that featured π-electron rich short peptide, positively charged aldehyde, and a cyclic ketone under non-equilibrium conditions. Peptide bound with the aldehyde by a dynamic covalent bond and demixed to form coacervates through hydrophobic interactions. Importantly, the short-peptide could utilize its free amine (β-alanine) to catalyze C-C bond formation which eventually led to the depletion of one of the building blocks (aldehyde) via aldol reaction; an intrinsic catalytic role that helped the coacervate to suppress Ostwald ripening/coalescence. Notably, under continuous additions (open system) of the depleting precursors, the active coacervates were able to demonstrate spatial stability for longer duration.  This out-of-equilibrium behavior of phase separated droplets in presence of flux of building blocks is reminiscent of the active membraneless organelles seen in contemporary biochemistry.
40228062	Exploring the biological mechanisms of severe COVID-19 in the elderly: Insights from an aged mouse model.	The elderly population, who have increased susceptibility to severe outcomes, have been particularly impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to a global health crisis. However, definitive parameters or mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in elderly people remain unclear. Thus, this study seeks to elucidate the mechanism behind the increased vulnerability of elderly individuals to severe COVID-19. We employed an aged mouse model with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain to mimic the severe symptoms observed in elderly patients with COVID-19. Comprehensive analyses of the whole lung were performed using transcriptome and proteome sequencing, comparing data from aged and young mice. For transcriptome analysis, bulk RNA sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry following protein extraction, digestion, and peptide labelling. We analysed the transcriptome and proteome profiles of young and aged mice and discovered that aged mice exhibited elevated baseline levels of inflammation and tissue damage repair. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, aged mice showed increased antiviral and inflammatory responses; however, these responses were weaker than those in young mice, with significant complement and coagulation cascade responses. In summary, our study demonstrates that the increased vulnerability of the elderly to severe COVID-19 may be attributed to an attenuated antiviral response and the overactivation of complement and coagulation cascades. Future research on antiviral and inflammatory responses is likely to yield treatments that reduce the severity of viral respiratory diseases in the elderly.
40228061	Relating Radical Delocalization, Charge Transfer, and Magnetic Ground State in Acene-Derived Oxyradicals.	At the same time that our capabilities to synthesize open-shell carbon-based materials are rapidly growing with the development of on-surface synthesis under vacuum conditions, interest in π-magnetism is rising due to its excellent prospects for potential applications. As a result, increasing efforts are being focused on the detailed understanding of open-shell carbon nanostructures and all of the parameters that determine their spin densities and magnetic ground states. Here we present a facile route to synthesize different open-shell acene derivatives with closely related structures by the addition of functional groups. A systematic comparison allows us to draw conclusions on the role of the functional groups and their number and distribution, as well as on the role of the radical state delocalization in relation with the presence or absence of charge transfer at interfaces, which consequently affects the molecule's π-magnetism.

In this report, an <i>o</i>-phenylene-bridged tetradented redox-noninnocent bis-azopyridyl ligand [<b>L</b>] and its copper complexes [<b>1</b>] and [<b>2</b>] were synthesized and characterized. The electron transfer events of [<b>L</b>], as well as [<b>1</b>] and [<b>2</b>], were characterized by single-crystal X-ray structure determination, various spectroscopic studies, and DFT calculations. While [<b>1</b>] [[<b>L</b>]Cu(II)Cl<sub>2</sub>] has unreduced [<b>L</b>], [<b>2</b>], [[<b>L</b>]<sup>•-</sup>Cu(I)Cl] contains a one-electron-reduced ligand [<b>L</b>]<sup>•-</sup> , which is antiferromagnetically coupled with the unpaired spin on Cu(II). Reduction of [<b>2</b>] by one electron generated the complex [<b>2</b>]<sup>•-</sup>, which remained in an electronically bistable situation in the form of valence tautomers: [<b>2A</b>]<sup>•-</sup>, [[<b>L</b>]<sup>•-</sup>Cu(I)Cl]<sup>•-</sup> and [<b>2B</b>]<sup>•-</sup>, [[<b>L</b>]<sup>2-</sup>Cu(II)Cl]<sup>•-</sup>. Further one-electron reduction of [<b>2</b>]<sup>•-</sup> generated a mixture of Cu complexes: [<b>2A</b>]<sup>-</sup>, [[<b>L</b>]<sup>2-</sup>Cu(I)]<sup>-</sup> and [<b>2B</b>]<sup>-</sup>, [[<b>L</b>]<sup>3•-</sup>Cu(II)]<sup>-</sup>. Complexes [<b>1</b>] and [<b>2</b>] were examined for the catalytic oxidation of alcohols. The complex [<b>2</b>] was more efficient than [<b>1</b>]. The protocol was highly efficient and versatile with both primary as well as secondary aromatic and aliphatic alcohols. Mechanistic investigations showed that the complex [<b>2</b>] generated [[<b>L</b>]<sup>•-</sup>Cu(I)OCH<sub>2</sub>Ph]<sup>•-</sup> (<b>A</b>) as the active catalyst, which subsequently, through its ligand-based redox events, acted as the catalyst over the course of the reaction.
40228059	Origin of Intramolecular versus Intermolecular C-H Arene Activation Selectivity by Cyclopentadienyl-Triphenylphosphine Iridium.	Photolysis of (η<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>5</sub>)Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>)(H)<sub>2</sub> in benzene generates the 16-electron (16e<sup>-</sup>) complex (η<sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>5</sub>)Ir(PPh<sub>3</sub>) that undergoes competitive <i>intra</i>molecular ortho-metalation with a phenyl group from -PPh<sub>3</sub> and <i>inter</i>molecular C-H activation with benzene. Previous density functional theory (DFT) studies identified the <i>intra</i>molecular π-complex and the <i>inter</i>molecular benzene π-complex intermediates and their corresponding C-H activation transition states. However, neither the mechanism of interconversion between these intermediates nor the origin of <i>intra</i>molecular versus <i>inter</i>molecular pathway selectivity has been established. Here, we characterized the open-shell 16e<sup>-</sup> iridium species and extensively mapped out the energy landscape for <i>intra</i>molecular ortho-metalation of -PPh<sub>3</sub> versus <i>inter</i>molecular benzene C-H activation. Also, we performed DFT-based direct dynamics simulations, and the results suggest that the <i>intra</i>molecular versus <i>inter</i>molecular pathway selectivity is determined dynamically within picoseconds as the 16e<sup>-</sup> iridium species evolves into a coordinatively saturated structure. During this process, the π-complexes are formed concurrently with, instead of prior to, the iridium hydrides, which could not be explained by kinetic models that assume C-H cleavage as the rate-limiting step. These findings demonstrate that dynamics simulations in addition to DFT calculations are needed for a more complete mechanistic understanding of photoinduced C-H activation reactions, of which the product selectivity can be influenced by atomic motion.
40228058	Effect of aqueous washing on chloride reduction and the storage stability on low-quality crude palm oil prior to refining.	The presence of chloropropanols in edible oils is a significant food safety concern. Chloride in crude palm oil (CPO) is a precursor to the formation of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol esters (3-MCPDE) during refining; chloride retention during storage prior to refining remains under investigation. The study examined the impact of different washing treatments and storage duration on total chloride content (TCC), moisture and impurities (M&I), free fatty acid content (FFA), diacylglycerol (DAG), deterioration of bleachability index (DOBI), and iodine value (IV) of CPO. It was demonstrated that washing CPO with distilled water and 3% citric acid (DW+CA) resulted in the highest chloride reduction (37%) after one month of storage. A linear relationship was observed between TCC and FFA levels in the washed CPO, indicating that FFA is a strong predictor of chloride content. The DW+CA treatment also demonstrated a stabilizing effect on FFA levels, potentially mitigating oil deterioration during storage. These findings suggest that implementing DW+CA washing before CPO storage can effectively reduce chloride levels, enhancing the safety and quality of the oil and mitigating the risk of 3MCPDE formation during refining.

40228055	Somatodendritic orientation determines tDCS-induced neuromodulation of Purkinje cell activity in awake mice.	Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) of the cerebellum is a promising non-invasive neuromodulatory technique being proposed for the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how externally applied currents affect neuronal spiking activity in cerebellar circuits in vivo. We investigated how Cb-tDCS affects the firing rate of Purkinje cells (PC) and non-PC in the mouse cerebellar cortex to understand the underlying mechanisms behind the polarity-dependent modulation of neuronal activity induced by tDCS. Mice (n=9) were prepared for the chronic recording of local field potentials (LFPs) to assess the actual electric field gradient imposed by Cb-tDCS in our experimental design. Single-neuron extracellular recording of PCs in awake (n=24) and anesthetized (n=27) mice was combined with juxtacellular recordings and subsequent staining of PC with neurobiotin under anesthesia (n=8) to correlate their neuronal orientation with their response to Cb-tDCS. Finally, a high-density Neuropixels recording system was used to demonstrate the relevance of neuronal orientation during the application of Cb-tDCS in awake mice (n=6). In this study, we observe that Cb-tDCS induces a heterogeneous polarity-dependent modulation of the firing rate of PCs and non-PC in the mouse cerebellar cortex. We demonstrate that the apparently heterogeneous effects of tDCS on PC activity can be explained by taking into account the somatodendritic orientation relative to the electric field. Our findings highlight the need to consider neuronal orientation and morphology to improve tDCS computational models, enhance stimulation protocol reliability, and optimize effects in both basic and clinical applications.

40228045	F-box/WD Repeat-Containing Protein 5 Promotes Breast Cancer Progression by Regulating Ferroptosis via Enhancing Krüppel-like Factor 13 Ubiquitination Through Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase/Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase Pathway.	Breast cancer (BC) is a prevalent malignancy among women. Evidence has indicated that F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 5 (FBXW5) is crucial in oncogenesis and progression. However, the function of FBXW5 in BC remains elusive. This work aims to explore the regulatory mechanisms of FBXW5 in the development of BC. The expression of FBXW5 in pan-cancer and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. FBXW5 level was enhanced in BC tissues. Besides, FBXW5 inhibition significantly decreased cell viability by 49.05% in MDA-MB-231 cells and 62.30% in MCF-7 cells. FBXW5 inhibition significantly inhibited cell proliferation by 66% in MDA-MB-231 cells and 74% in MCF-7 cells. FBXW5 inhibition significantly suppressed cell migration by 77.2% in MDA-MB-231 cells and 82.15% in MCF-7 cells. FBXW5 inhibition significantly inhibited cell invasion by 64.14% in MDA-MB-231 cells and 71.33% in MCF-7 cells. In vivo, FBXW5 depletion reduced tumor weight by 63.39% and tumor volume by 65.17%. Moreover, FBXW5 silencing restrained lung metastases <i>in vivo</i>. Besides, the impact of FBXW5 on the malignant behavior of BC cells was mediated through the regulation of ferroptosis. Mechanically, FBXW5 facilitated Kruppel-like factor 13 (KLF13) degradation by enhancing its ubiquitination. The addition of FBXW5 facilitated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibited ferroptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, which were neutralized by KLF13 overexpression. Besides, the knockdown of KLF13 led to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. KLF13 silencing counteracted the inhibitory effects of FBXW5 depletion on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as its promotion of ferroptosis, effects that were reversed by LY294002. In conclusion, targeting FBXW5 may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for BC by modulating the KLF13/PI3K/AKT axis.
40228044	Personalized customization: Service resource configuration optimization driven by customer requirements accurately.	Proposing an approach of service resource configuration optimization driven by customer requirements to address the issue of service resource configuration optimization in the context of personalized customization. Firstly, the importance judgment matrix, KANO model, and competitiveness evaluation are integrated to evaluate the relative importance of customer requirements. Secondly, the House of Quality (HoQ) and the intermediary variable "technical attributes" are utilized to determine the weight of each service module and its correlation with customer requirements. Afterwards, due to the varying customer requirements, the service candidate itemsets under the same service module will differ. To address this, a "one-to-many" relationship mechanism is introduced between the service module and service candidate itemsets. The service candidate itemsets are determined based on the correlated customer requirements. On this basis, the customer's perceived utility is determined by applying the four types of utility measure functions. The service resource configuration scheme is established by formulating and solving an optimization model. Finally, the viability and efficacy of the approach are demonstrated with an example of living room customization by a customization company, utilizing an improved genetic algorithm (IGA).
40228037	IgStrand: A universal residue numbering scheme for the immunoglobulin-fold (Ig-fold) to study Ig-proteomes and Ig-interactomes.	The Immunoglobulin fold (Ig-fold) is found in proteins from all domains of life and represents the most populous fold in the human genome, with current estimates ranging from 2 to 3% of protein coding regions. That proportion is much higher in the surfaceome where Ig and Ig-like domains orchestrate cell-cell recognition, adhesion and signaling. The ability of Ig-domains to reliably fold and self-assemble through highly specific interfaces represents a remarkable property of these domains, making them key elements of molecular interaction systems: the immune system, the nervous system, the vascular system and the muscular system. We define a universal residue numbering scheme, common to all domains sharing the Ig-fold in order to study the wide spectrum of Ig-domain variants constituting the Ig-proteome and Ig-Ig interactomes at the heart of these systems. The "IgStrand numbering scheme" enables the identification of Ig structural proteomes and interactomes in and between any species, and comparative structural, functional, and evolutionary analyses. We review how Ig-domains are classified today as topological and structural variants and highlight the "Ig-fold irreducible structural signature" shared by all of them. The IgStrand numbering scheme lays the foundation for the systematic annotation of structural proteomes by detecting and accurately labeling Ig-, Ig-like and Ig-extended domains in proteins, which are poorly annotated in current databases and opens the door to accurate machine learning. Importantly, it sheds light on the robust Ig protein folding algorithm used by nature to form beta sandwich supersecondary structures. The numbering scheme powers an algorithm implemented in the interactive structural analysis software iCn3D to systematically recognize Ig-domains, annotate them and perform detailed analyses comparing any domain sharing the Ig-fold in sequence, topology and structure, regardless of their diverse topologies or origin. The scheme provides a robust fold detection and labeling mechanism that reveals unsuspected structural homologies among protein structures beyond currently identified Ig- and Ig-like domain variants. Indeed, multiple folds classified independently contain a common structural signature, in particular jelly-rolls. Examples of folds that harbor an "Ig-extended" architecture are given. Applications in protein engineering around the Ig-architecture are straightforward based on the universal numbering.
40228034	Proton pump inhibitors reduce nivolumab efficacy in unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.

However, there are few reports on their effect on patients with gastric cancer (GC). Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of nivolumab in patients with GC receiving PPI.
40228033	Novel Folate-phenylfuran P-gp Inhibitor Conjugates for Overcoming Multidrug Resistance in MCF-7/ADR Cell.	P-glycoprotein (P-gp) functions as a critical membrane transporter that drives tumor resistance by mediating drug efflux, ultimately contributing to multidrug resistance (MDR). Recently potent inhibitors have shown significant potential in countering chemotherapeutic resistance, particularly in breast cancer. However, P-gp's presence in essential organs complicates clinical applications, underscoring the importance of developing tumor-specific targeting strategies. Given the high-level expression of folate receptors (FR) on the surface of breast cancer cells, this study conjugated a previously developed P-gp inhibitor with folic acid, with the goal of harnessing FR-mediated targeting for enhanced tumor cell specificity. In vitro evaluations revealed that the resultant conjugate maintained substantial resistance reversal efficacy against the MCF-7/ADR breast cancer-resistant cell line, comparable to the standalone inhibitor. The conjugate emerged as a highly potent and safe P-gp inhibitor in xenograft mouse, likely attributable to its enhanced tumor-targeting specificity, exhibiting superior in vivo efficacy when administered in combination with doxorubicin, relative to the original P-gp inhibitor.
40228031	Understanding epigenetic regulation in the endometrium - lessons from mouse models with implantation defects.	Endometrial function, crucial for successful embryo implantation, is significantly influenced by epigenetic regulation. This review investigates the crucial roles of DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and RNA methylation in endometrial receptivity and implantation, based on a survey of recent literature on knockout mouse models with implantation defects. These models illuminate how epigenetic disruptions contribute to implantation failure, a significant human reproductive health concern. DNA methylation and histone modifications modulate endometrial receptivity by affecting gene silencing and chromatin structure, respectively. Chromatin remodeling factors also play a critical role in endometrial dynamics, influencing gene expression. Furthermore, RNA methylation emerges as critical in implantation through transcriptional and translational control. While human studies provide limited epigenetic snapshots, mouse models with suppressed epigenetic regulators reveal direct causal links between epigenetic alterations and implantation failure. Understanding these epigenetic interactions offers potential for novel therapies addressing reproductive disorders.
40228027	Superior Differential Ion Mobility Spectrometry of Pendular Macromolecules Using Low-Frequency Rectangular Waveforms.	Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) can delineate gas-phase ions and probe their geometries. Coupling with electrospray ionization and MS has brought IMS to structural biology, revealing the macromolecular folding and subunit connectivity. However, the orientational averaging of ion-molecule collision cross sections (Ω) in the linear and field asymmetric waveform IMS (FAIMS) diminishes the resolution and structural specificity. In the novel low-field differential (LOD) IMS, a field too weak for ion heating (and thus FAIMS) aligns strong macrodipoles, capturing their magnitudes and directional Ω across the dipole (Ω<sub>⊥</sub>). However, the bisinusoidal waveforms (from FAIMS) have compromised the resolution, measurement accuracy, and correlation to the ion properties. Large ions amenable to LODIMS have low mobility and diffuse slowly, allowing the waveform frequencies down to ∼10 kHz. The low field and frequency permit generating the ideal rectangular waveforms with a flexible frequency and duty cycle by direct switching (impractical for FAIMS) in a miniature low-power format. This new IMS stage is evaluated for the exemplary large protein albumin (66 kDa) previously studied using the bisinusoidal waveform. The flat voltages and greater form factor initiate the differential IMS effect at lower fields, expand the separation space, and enable the quantification of Ω<sub>⊥</sub> values by varying the duty cycle.

40228024	Behind the wall: Macrolithic artifacts as testing tools for activities and social structure on a Middle Chalcolithic site in Central Anatolia.	The main focus of this work is an assemblage of nearly two thousand macrolithic artifacts, weighing more than half a metric ton, retrieved from an excavated area measuring 3,600 m2 of the Middle Chalcolithic site of Güvercinkayası, which dates from the end of the 6th and first half of the 5th millennium cal BCE. The site is ideal for testing different analytical approaches due to the extent of the excavated area, the good preservation of structures and finds, the site layout and the fact that the site is divided into two parts by a fortification wall. Macrolithic artifacts were divided into ten classes according to the method of manufacture, raw materials, shapes and dimensions, and their functional use. Several examples were chosen for use-wear analysis of the active surfaces. The Middle Chalcolithic period in Central Anatolia represents the end of previous Neolithic traditions in architecture and ways of life. Therefore, the main objective of our work is to present the assemblage from this period, and further to test the information potential of these artifacts for studying the activities and social structure of settlements. The shape spectrum of the assemblage largely corresponds to the Neolithic period. It differs mainly in the proportion of some shapes and functional types present. In addition, certain artifacts appear to indicate the existence of some form of counting system or board game. Based on the results of the study of macrolithic artifacts and their statistical and spatial analysis, it is clear that the composition of artifacts and access to raw materials was similar in different parts of the settlement. The inhabitants of the Middle Chalcolithic site created a settlement with a regular layout, which at a certain time was divided into two parts. However, the results of our analyses do not demonstrate any significant patterns that would testify to vertical social stratification of the society living within this settlement.

40228022	Asymmetric Deposits and Crack Formation during Desiccation of a Blood Droplet on an Inclined Surface.	We study the combined effect of varying droplet volume and inclination angles on the desiccation patterns left behind evaporating sessile droplets of human blood. We systematically varied the droplet volume in a range of [1-10 μL] and inclination angles between [0-70°]. Microstructural characterization of the deposits was performed using optical microscopy and surface profilometry. On a horizontal surface, typical deposits of toroidal shape with cracks oriented in radial and azimuthal directions were observed. With an increase in the droplet volume and inclination, the interplay between the gravitational and surface tension effects leads to an asymmetric liquid-vapor interface shape, resulting in a differential evaporative mass flux pattern across the interface. Subsequently, we observe elongation of the overall desiccation patterns along with asymmetric mass deposits between the advancing and receding fronts. As a consequence, the crack morphology on the two fronts exhibits pronounced differences. The distinct regimes of asymmetric mass deposits and crack morphology were quantitatively examined as a characteristic of varying droplet volume and inclinations, parametrized in terms of the mean radial crack spacing and width. These findings are qualitatively analyzed by a first-order theoretical model that is based on the energy conservation principle incorporating the release of mechanical stress energy by contraction of the deposit at the last stage of the desiccation process and the consumed surface energy upon formation of the new surfaces during crack evolution.

40228018	The dynamic shape changes of the tongue base during respiration, chewing and swallowing.	This study aimed to analyze dimensional deformations of the tongue base during respiration, chewing, and swallowing. Eight 7-8-month-old Yucatan minipigs were used. Under deep sedation, eight 2mm ultrasonic piezoelectric (SONO) crystals were implanted in the tongue base forming a cubic-shaped configuration, representing right/left dorsal and ventral lengths, anterior/posterior dorsal and ventral widths, and right/left anterior and posterior thicknesses. Next, 8 pairs of electromyographic (EMG) microelectrodes were inserted into the tongue, jaw, hyoid, pharyngeal, and palatal muscles. SONO and EMG signals during respiration were recorded. Then, minipigs were allowed to wake-up for unrestrained feeding. The feeding sessions were recorded with synchronized EMG and videofluoroscopy to confirm the phases of jaw movement in chewing, and swallowing episodes. Amplitudes, durations, and timings for each dimension of the SONO crystal-circumscribed region were measured from the start of the jaw opening. Findings during respiration showed elongated lengths, anterior widths and anterior thickness (p<0.05). For chewing, the width elongated up to 17% while the length and thickness shortened (12-33% and 10-32% respectively, p<0.05). Onsets of deformational changes in length and thickness occurred 10-30% earlier than in width. The cycle duration was 0.55 ± 0.11seconds chewing, and 0.69 ± 0.16seconds swallowing. During swallowing, the dorsal length (5-12%) and posterior width (10-14%) elongated whereas the posterior thickness (9-15%) and ventral length (4-10%) shortened. Explicit 3D-kinematic patterns in relation to specific functions characterize the tongue base deformation. The findings of this analysis will contribute to a better understanding of the oropharyngeal biomechanics upon abnormal conditions.
40228016	Hemoptysis and Anabolic Steroids: A Case Report of Oxandrolone-Induced Bleeding.	BACKGROUND Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are associated with multiple adverse effects. They can cause thrombotic as well as hemorrhagic manifestations. Oxandrolone is one such AAS that used to be approved by the FDA for treatment of malnutrition and weight loss following severe burn injury, trauma, HIV-related wasting and neuromuscular disorders. It was previously inappropriately used by athletes for muscle build-up. Recently, the FDA withdrew approval over safety and efficacy concerns. CASE REPORT A 20-year-old otherwise healthy man presented with a 4-day history of early-morning hemoptysis. He had recently used oxandrolone for supplementing muscle growth. Hemoptysis was witnessed by hospital staff. Flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy demonstrated easy bleeding without a localized lesion. Hemoptysis progressively declined during hospitalization, and eventually completely resolved. CONCLUSIONS Anabolic androgenic steroids can lead to bleeding manifestations in otherwise healthy patients, which resolve upon cessation of use. A thorough evaluation of all medications, prescribed or otherwise, is particularly important when dealing with unusual presenting symptoms. AAS might not appear on standard medication reconciliation sections in electronic medical records or on basic toxicology screen results. Further research is needed to elucidate factors that can influence bleeding versus thrombotic manifestations.
40228012	Crystal Structure Prediction Using a Self-Attention Neural Network and Semantic Segmentation.	The development of new materials is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate this process. However, accurately predicting crystal structures using deep learning remains a significant challenge due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of atomic interactions and the scarcity of comprehensive training data that captures the full diversity of possible crystal configurations. This work developed a neural network model based on a data set comprising thousands of crystallographic information files from existing crystal structure databases. The model incorporates a self-attention mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy by learning and extracting both local and global features of three-dimensional structures, treating the atoms in each crystal as point sets. This approach enables effective semantic segmentation and accurate unit cell prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that for unit cells containing up to 500 atoms, the model achieves a structure prediction accuracy of 89.78%.
40228011	Unveiling perceptions on academic leadership effectiveness: PLS-SEM, FSQCA, and NCA approaches.	Academic leadership plays a critical role in fulfilling higher education institutions' missions, fostering a competent workforce, and becoming a key driver in unlocking the potential to achieve sustainability goals. Within this context, the leadership effectiveness of academic deans is particularly significant. This study aims to identify the factors influencing the academic leadership effectiveness in public universities in Bangladesh. The study collected data from 318 faculty members of public universities. A combined methodology consisting of Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), and Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) was utilized to analyze the collected data. The PLS-SEM results indicated that vision and goal setting (VG), management of the unit (MU), interpersonal relationships (IR), communication skills (CS), research/professional endeavors (PE), and quality of education in the unit (QEU) significantly influence deans' leadership effectiveness. Further, five necessary and six sufficient conditions were discovered by fsQCA results, which also demonstrated the nonlinear and intricate interaction effects of the factors leading to leadership effectiveness (LE). Importantly, NCA findings revealed that all factors are essential for LE and have meaningful and substantial impact. Also, a minimum of 14.78% VG, 20.75% MU, 23.27% IR, 33.96% CS, 16.98% PE, and 10.06% QEU must be met to accomplish an 80% LE. Therefore, the findings provide useful insights for the higher education sector, university top management, potential academic leaders, and relevant stakeholders to improve leadership effectiveness at the tertiary education level. Moreover, this study is the first to explain the effectiveness of deans' leadership through an expanded methodology that integrates both symmetric and asymmetric methods.

40228009	Highly Stable, Crystalline InGaO Thin-Film Transistors by 7% Lanthanum Incorporation.	The development of high-mobility metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) thin-film transistors (TFTs) is of increasing interest. It is well-known that increasing the indium (In) concentration in MOS enhances the crystal volume fraction and mobility. However, the high carrier concentration resulting from a high In content induces TFT depletion mode and degrades device stability. Here, we introduce the incorporation of lanthanum (La) cation into the high-In-containing indium-gallium oxide (InGaO) films grown by spray pyrolysis at a substrate temperature of 375 °C. As the La ratio increases from 3 to 20%, La-incorporated InGaO (LaInGaO) experiences an elevation in both mass density and optical bandgap, but its crystallinity degrades. The coplanar LaInGaO TFTs, optimized with a La ratio of 7%, exhibit an average threshold voltage (<i>V</i><sub>TH</sub>) of 0.01 V, field-effect mobility of 30.63 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and a subthreshold swing of 0.23 V dec<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, compared to pristine InGaO TFTs, the bias temperature and photostability of 7% LaInGaO TFTs have been enhanced, resulting in shifts of <i>V</i><sub>TH</sub> under positive and negative bias temperature stresses, as well as negative illumination bias stress conditions by 0.2, 0.1, and -1.6 V, respectively. Additionally, the gate driver circuit employing 7% LaInGaO TFTs demonstrates fast rising and falling times of 437.3 and 557.9 ns, respectively. Therefore, the highly reliable 7% LaInGaO TFTs grown by spray pyrolysis can be utilized for large-area, cost-effective TFT electronics.

40227973	Efficient and Accurate Prediction of Double Perovskite Quasiparticle Band Gaps via Machine Learning and a Descriptor.	Perovskites have attracted considerable attention in materials science due to their promising applications in photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Accurate prediction of their electronic band gap is essential for optimizing the performance. Traditional computational methods for band gap prediction often face a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. General density functional theory (DFT) calculations typically underestimate band gap values, while the more accurate quasi-particle method demands substantial computational resources. In this study, a multistep machine learning framework was developed for efficient screening of semiconductor double perovskites. Furthermore, we proposed an interpretable descriptor that can predict quasi-particle band gaps of perovskites with a precision of over 90% accuracy. Using this approach, we screened 4,507 perovskite candidates and identified 94 structures that have suitable band gaps and are lead-free. Among these, six candidate structures were selected for further verification based on their photocatalytic potential and thermal stability.
40227972	Drug Repurposing: Unique Carbon Dot Antibacterial Films for Fruit Postharvest Preservation.	Fruit spoilage caused by oxidation and microbial infection exacerbates resource wastage. Although starch films including chitosan possessed admirable biocompatibility owing to great biodegradability compared with conventional plastics, deficient antibacterial and antioxidant capacity restricted food shelf life. Herein, an environmentally friendly antibacterial film (CS/G-CDs) was constructed by carbon dots derived from <i>Cirsii Herba</i> (CDs), which was formed through high affinity resulting from hydrogen bonding between chitosan molecules and hydroxyl originating from CDs. The prepared CDs presented homogeneous and monodisperse spherical structures with an ultrasmall size, providing favorable conditions for uniform film formation. Encouragingly, the antioxidant capacity of CS/G-CDs increased 5.00-fold, followed by an antibacterial rate of up to 97.0%. Dramatically, CS/G-CDs revealed glorious UV shielding efficacy (99.9% for UVB and 98.2% for UVA), and its preservation time for blueberries was remarkably extended 8 days longer than that of the chitosan film. Overall, Chinese herb-derived antibacterial films exhibited magnified antibacterial/antioxidant properties and great biocompatibility, which provided a promising strategy for sustainable development of packaging materials.
40227971	Functionally Tunable Star-Shaped Multivalent crRNAs for Photocontrol CRISPR/Cas Editing.	Clustered regularly interspaced shortpalindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas)-based genome editing has significantly advanced genetic engineering due to its precision, simplicity, and versatility.  However, achieving precise spatial and temporal control remains challenging, restricting therapeutic and research applications.  Herein, we introduce a novel class of star-shaped, multivalent crRNAs engineered for precise spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas9 and Cas12a editing systems.  These crRNAs are synthesized via single-site chemical modification and can be efficiently purified.  By integrating distinct photo-responsive chemical linkages, we achieved selective activation of crRNA activity upon irradiation with specific wavelengths, enabling orthogonal regulation of multiple genetic targets simultaneously.  This method demonstrated robust OFF-ON switching capabilities in vitro, characterized by minimal leakage and rapid activation.  Importantly, the approach also proved highly effective for temporally controlled gene editing in mammalian cells in vivo, achieving considerable editing efficiency following brief photoactivation.  Due to its target sequence-independent, single-site modification design, this strategy may serve as a universal solution for diverse CRISPR/Cas systems, eliminating cumbersome optimization processes.  Future advancements incorporating long-wavelength responsive and reversible linkers promise further enhancement of tissue penetration and control, significantly broadening the applicability and impact of this approach in biological research and therapeutic interventions.

40227963	The Use of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia's Pedi Crisis 2.0 Mobile Application as an Educational Assessment Tool for Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellows: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Multi-Center Study.	Anesthesiologists manage life-threatening, critical events in a fast-paced, high-distraction atmosphere, with little time to deliberate about treatment options. The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia developed the Pedi Crisis 2.0 Mobile Application to assist in managing critical pediatric perioperative events. We hypothesized that the application could be used as a formal educational assessment tool in pediatric anesthesiology fellowship training and developed a one-hour classroom examination designed to assess the impact of the application on fellows' knowledge of the management of pediatric critical events. We sought to evaluate whether the just-in-time knowledge provided by the application leads to improved testing outcomes compared with baseline knowledge alone.
40227962	Ubiquitination of transcription factors in cancer: unveiling therapeutic potential.	Transcription factors, pivotal in gene expression regulation, are essential in cancer progression. Their function is meticulously regulated by post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination. This process, which marks proteins for degradation, can either enhance or inhibit the function of transcription factors, contingent on the context. In cancers, dysregulated ubiquitination of transcription factors contributes to the hallmark of uncontrolled growth and survival of tumors. For example, tumor suppressors such as p53 might be degraded prematurely due to abnormal ubiquitination, causing genomic instability. On the other hand, oncogenic transcription factors may gain stability via ubiquitination, thus facilitating tumorigenesis. Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) therefore could be a viable therapeutic approach in cancer. Emerging treatments aim to block the ubiquitination of oncogenic transcription factors or to stabilize tumor suppressors. This review underscores the critical impact of transcription factor-altered ubiquitination on cancer progression. Additionally, it outlines innovative therapeutic approaches that involve inhibitors or drugs directed at specific ubiquitin E3 ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs) that regulate transcription factor activity.
40227961	Thrombin Generation in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Patients, a Prospective Single-center Cohort Study.	The objective of this study was to describe thrombin generation in children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Change in the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) across three measurements before and after CPB (after protamine and at chest closure) was the primary outcome. Secondary analyses explored an association between thrombin generation and transfusion requirements and predictors of the thrombin generation decline.
40227960	Impact of Point-of-care allogeneic red blood cell washing on markers of transfusion-related respiratory complications: A phase II randomized clinical trial.	Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) are leading causes of transfusion-related morbidity and mortality. Soluble factors in red blood cell (RBC) supernatant may increase risk for these complications. We hypothesized that point-of-care allogeneic RBC washing may be an effective intervention to mitigate elevations in soluble factors as well as physiologic responses associated with transfusion-associated respiratory complications in the setting of cardiac surgery.
40227959	Development of the Pediatric Scale for Quality of Recovery (PedSQoR).	Measuring the quality of a patient's recovery is vital, and reliable patient-centered outcome metrics are needed for clinical investigations and quality improvement. Currently, assessment tools to measure quality of recovery in pediatric patients are lacking. This study aimed to develop a scale to assess the quality of recovery (QoR) construct in pediatric patients.
40227958	An Atmospheric Chemistry Perspective on Airborne Micro- and Nanoplastic Particles.	Micro- and nanoplastic particles (MNPPs) are emerging pollutants with significant environmental impacts due to their persistence, increasing concentrations, and potential health risks. Most MNPP studies have focused on identifying, quantifying, and assessing their ecotoxicological impacts in water or soil. However, the atmosphere is crucial in transporting and chemically transforming MNPPs. Further, well-established aerosol particle characterization techniques are underutilized and inconsistently applied in existing atmospheric MNPP studies. This perspective synthesizes the existing literature and addresses future research needs unique to atmospheric MNPPs, highlighting the need to bridge the microplastics and atmospheric aerosol communities to better understand their sources, chemical transformations, transport mechanisms, as well as their health effects and ecological impacts, which differ from those in soil and water. Advancing research in these areas requires standardized methods and a multidisciplinary approach to comprehensively assess MNPP interactions across environmental compartments, providing essential insights into their environmental fate and risks.
40227957	Modifications in pedaling kinematics, saddle pressures and comfort in elite cyclists after alterations in saddle height during ventilatory thresholds.	Clear evidence is lacking in cycling biomechanics research regarding the effects of pedaling at various saddle heights (SH) and intensities, hindering full comprehension of bicycle geometry configurations and their impacts on performance and potential injuries. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of changes in SH (freely chosen, +2%, and -2%) at two intensities (First (VT1) and second (VT2) ventilatory threshold) on the pressures exerted on the saddle, the lower-limb kinematics, and perceived comfort. Twenty-four elite cyclists pedaled for 6 min on an ergometer at each of the saddle heights and intensities. The results of the kinematics showed differences (<i>p</i> < 0.05) as a function of the SH in all the variables analyzed. The results of the saddle pressures showed an interaction between SH and saddle zones (<i>p</i> < 0.01) depending on intensity (<i>p</i> = 0.002). There were higher levels of overall perceived comfort in freely chosen SH. In conclusion, higher SH (+2%) produced greater pressures on the saddle, greater extension in the lower extremities, and less comfort for the cyclist. Regarding intensities, VT2 reduces the pressures exerted on the saddle, leading to increased ankle dorsiflexion and decreased hip flexion-extension which negatively impacts cyclist comfort when not pedaling at freely chosen SH.
40227956	Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction on Cobalt-Based Perovskite via Regulating Reaction Pathway through Donation-Back-Donation Modulation.	The electrocatalytic approach of combining N2 and H2O to produce ammonia, known as the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (eNRR), has garnered significant attention due to its environmental benefits and potential for supporting a decentralized agricultural economy. However, the underlying chemistry governing the reaction pathways remains poorly understood, hindering the design of low-cost and efficient eNRR catalysts. Here we report the enhancement of the electrocatalytic eNRR activity of perovskite oxides by tuning the reaction pathway through a "donation-back donation" mechanism. This is achieved by controlling the spin state via adjusting the distribution of d orbital electrons in low-cost transition metals, such as cobalt. Specifically, the cobalt in perovskite SrCoO3 (SC) with a low-spin state demonstrates an 18 times higher ammonia yield rate compared to that in Co3O4 and 1.5 times higher than cobalt in perovskite LaCoO3 (LC). The low spin states of cobalt in SC enable better control of the eNRR reaction pathway over the transformation of *N2H to *NHNH or *NNH2, resulting in alternating hydrogenation in SC rather than distal hydrogenation in LC with a high spin state. The unprecedented improvement in eNRR by regulating the spin state of Co demonstrates the bright of low-cost Co-based electrocatalysts for ammonia production.
40227955	Generative AI in Otolaryngology Residency Personal Statement Writing: A Mixed-Methods Analysis.	Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) interfaces have rapidly integrated into various societal domains.

40227951	Evaluation of quality of life and eating behavior in outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or systemic arterial hypertension: a cross-sectional study.	To evaluate the quality of life and eating behavior of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or systemic arterial hypertension treated at a specialized outpatient service in southern Brazil. The cross-sectional study included adults and elderly individuals previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or systemic arterial hypertension. The WHOQOL-bref instrument was used to obtain quality of life. Eating behavior was assessed using the Three-factor Eating Questionnaire-R21. Multiple linear regression and Spearman's correlation were used to examine the relationship between quality of life and eating behavior. And the Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis and multiple linear regression to verify the relationship between quality of life, behavior, sociodemographic and clinical. E o Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationship between quality of life and eating behavior. A significance level of 5% was adopted for all analyses. A total of 326 participants were included, with a mean age of 57.0 ± 12.2 years, the majority of whom were females (70.9%) and adults (53.4%). Females exhibited worse quality of life, as observed in the domains of 'psychological' (p = 0.000), 'environmental' (p = 0.033), and general quality of life (p = 0.017). In addition, associations were also observed between quality of life and age, education level, and sleep duration. Sleeping less than 8 hours/day was the predictor that most contributed to the decrease in quality of life scores. Cognitive restriction was the dimension of eating behavior with the highest score (44.4); however, only uncontrolled eating (p = 0.000) and emotional eating (p = 0.000) were associated with age. Self-perception of quality of life changed according to gender, age group, sleep duration and eating behavior. The quality of life was inversely correlated with emotional eating and uncontrolled eating.
40227950	Novel molecular mechanisms of immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma: NSUN2-mediated increase of SOAT2 RNA methylation.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly malignancy known for its ability to evade immune surveillance. NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 2 (NSUN2), an RNA methyltransferase involved in carcinogenesis, has been associated with immune evasion and energy metabolism reprogramming. This study aimed to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of NSUN2 in immune evasion and metabolic reprogramming of HCC.
40227949	Dimethyl Itaconate Alleviates Escherichia coli-Induced Endometritis Through the Guanosine-CXCL14 Axis via Increasing the Abundance of norank_f_Muribaculaceae.	Endometritis, a prevalent reproductive system disease with high incidence, leads to reproductive dysfunction in humans and animals, causing huge economic losses. Dimethyl itaconate (DI) has been demonstrated to exert protective effects in multiple inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, the efficacy of DI in preventing endometritis and the role played by the gut microbiota remain unknown. In this study, it is found that DI ameliorated Escherichia coli (E. coli) induced endometritis in mice. The protective effect is abolished by antibiotic-induced depletion of the gut microbiota, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from DI-treated mice to recipient mice ameliorated E. coli-induced endometritis. Integrative multiomics reveals that DI promotes the multiplication of norank_f_Muribaculaceae in vivo, and supplementation of Muribaculum intestinale (DSM 28989), which belongs to the norank_f_Muribaculaceae genus, upregulates the level of guanosine in the uterus. Mechanistically, the protective effect of guanosine in endometritis is mediated by activating the expression of CXCL14 in uterine epithelial cells. Moreover, the antibody-neutralizing experiment of CXCL14 eliminated this protective effect. In conclusion, this study elucidates the significant role of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in the protection of DI against endometritis, and provides new evidence for the regulation of distal organ by the gut microbiota.
40227932	Food intake enhances hippocampal sharp wave-ripples.	Effective regulation of energy metabolism is critical for survival. Metabolic control involves various nuclei within the hypothalamus, which receive information about the body's energy state and coordinate appropriate responses to maintain homeostasis, such as thermogenesis, pancreatic insulin secretion, and food-seeking behaviors. It has recently been found that the hippocampus, a brain region traditionally associated with memory and spatial navigation, is also involved in metabolic regulation. Specifically, hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), which are high-frequency neural oscillations supporting memory consolidation and foraging decisions, have been shown to reduce peripheral glucose levels. However, whether SWRs are enhanced by recent feeding-when the need for glucose metabolism increases, and if so, whether feeding-dependent modulation of SWRs is communicated to other brain regions involved in metabolic regulation-remains unknown. To address these gaps, we recorded SWRs from the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus of mice during sleep sessions before and after consumption of meals of varying caloric values. We found that SWRs occurring during sleep are significantly enhanced following food intake, with the magnitude of enhancement being dependent on the caloric content of the meal. This pattern occurred under both food-deprived and ad libitum feeding conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which are known to regulate food intake, exhibit a robust SWR-triggered increase in activity. These findings identify the satiety state as a factor modulating SWRs and suggest that hippocampal-lateral hypothalamic communication is a potential mechanism by which SWRs could modulate peripheral metabolism and food intake.
40227917	Preservation Rhinoplasty Versus Structural Rhinoplasty in Dorsal Hump Reduction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Studies.	<b>Background:</b> A systematic comparison between the preservation rhinoplasty (PR) and the conventional structural rhinoplasty (SR) technique for hump nose correction is still lacking. <b>Objective:</b> To compare among patients undergoing rhinoplasty for dorsal hump correction using structural versus preservation techniques, as measured by functional and cosmetic patient-reported outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> Comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases using medical subject heading terms. Among patients undergoing dorsal hump reduction, we analyzed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PR and SR to assess functional and cosmetic satisfaction using the Standardized Cosmesis and Health Nasal Outcomes Survey, and the visual analogue scale. <b>Results:</b> Among the 38 studies initially screened, four RCTs with 419 patients met the inclusion criteria. PR showed significant superiority over SR in both functional (standardized mean difference or SMD -0.317 [95% confidence interval or CI -0.509 to -0.124]) and cosmetic (SMD -0.460 [95% CI -0.851 to -0.069]) outcomes. Functional outcomes exhibited low heterogeneity (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%), while cosmetic outcomes showed moderate heterogeneity (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 67%). <b>Conclusion:</b> In this review, the data suggest that PR might provide both functional and cosmetic satisfactions in dorsal hump reduction compared with SR.
40227916	Three-Dimensional CH/π and CH/N Interactions from Quantum-Mechanical and Database Analyses.	Quantum mechanical (QM)-level molecular interaction fields (MIFs) are three-dimensional potential maps that describe the intermolecular interactions surrounding a target molecule, derived through QM calculations. This study employs QM-level MIFs (MIFs(QM)) and analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) to uncover the three-dimensional characteristics of CH/π and CH/N interactions in typical nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds. Our findings confirm the reliability and applicability of MIF(QM) calculations for analyzing CH/π and CH/N interactions. Additionally, we propose approximation functions of MIFs(QM) and demonstrate that the resulting MIFs(func) are effective for studying CH/π and CH/N interactions in protein/ligand systems.
40227915	Differences in lesion development of slow- and fast-growing meat-type chickens after experimental challenge with <i>Enterococcus cecorum</i>.	Field observations suggest genotype-associated differences in susceptibility to infection with <i>Enterococcus cecorum</i> (EC). We hypothesized that slow-growing (SG) chickens show less clinical signs and reduced lesions compared to fast-growing (FG) chickens after experimental challenge with EC. At 1-day post-hatch (dph), 97 FG and 97 SG chickens were randomly assigned to four groups: control, SG (CSG), control, FG (CFG), EC-inoculated, SG (ESG), and EC-inoculated, FG (EFG). After oral inoculation with 10<sup>7</sup> colony forming units EC or mock inoculation with physiological saline, chickens were monitored for clinical signs and samples were collected weekly for further analysis via ELISA, real-time PCR, and flow cytometric analysis. The final necropsy of 40 chickens per group was carried out at 43/44 dph. Clinical signs and pathological findings were observed in a reduced number of chickens in group ESG compared to EFG. Extra-intestinal colonization with EC at 43/44 dph was significantly reduced in group ESG compared to EFG (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Circulating heterophils and monocytes were significantly increased in groups ESG and EFG compared to the control groups (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Additionally, circulating monocytes were increased and heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratios were decreased in SG chickens compared to FG chickens. We may speculate that SG chickens were less affected by the EC-associated disease due to a more efficient innate immune response and may more vigorously control extra-intestinal colonization after translocation from the intestine. Overall, the use of slow-growing chickens may reduce the incidence of the EC-associated disease in meat-type chickens and therefore increase overall health performance.
40227909	DeferredGS: Decoupled and Relightable Gaussian Splatting with Deferred Shading.	Reconstructing and editing 3D objects and scenes both play crucial roles in computer graphics and computer vision. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can achieve realistic reconstruction and editing results but suffer from inefficiency in rendering. Gaussian splatting significantly accelerates rendering by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids. However, Gaussian splatting utilizes a single Spherical Harmonic (SH) function to model both texture and lighting, limiting independent editing capabilities of these components. Recently, attempts have been made to decouple texture and lighting with the Gaussian splatting representation but may fail to produce plausible geometry and decomposition results on reflective scenes. Additionally, the forward shading technique they employ introduces noticeable blending artifacts during relighting, as the geometry attributes of Gaussians are optimized under the original illumination and may not be suitable for novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we introduce DeferredGS, a method for decoupling and relighting the Gaussian splatting representation using deferred shading. To achieve successful decoupling, we model the illumination with a learnable environment map and define additional attributes such as texture parameters and normal direction on Gaussians, where the normal is distilled from a jointly trained signed distance function. More importantly, we apply deferred shading, resulting in more realistic relighting effects compared to previous methods. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeferredGS in novel view synthesis and relighting tasks.

40227907	A Closed-Loop Tactile Stimulation Training Protocol for Motor Imagery-Based BCI: Boosting BCI Performance for BCI-Deficiency Users.	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable users to control and communicate with the external environment. However, a significant challenge in BCI research is the occurrence of "BCI-illiteracy" or "BCI-deficiency", where a notable percentage of users (estimated at 15 to 30%) are unable to achieve successful BCI control. For those users, they are struggling to generate stable and distinguishable brain activity patterns, which are essential for BCI control. Existing neurofeedback training protocols, often rely on the trial-and-error process, which is time-consuming and inefficient, particularly for these low-performing users.
40227906	Effects of Muscle Synergy during Overhead Work with a Passive Shoulder Exoskeleton: A Case Study.	Shoulder exoskeletons can effectively assist with overhead work. However, their impacts on muscle synergy remain unclear. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of muscle synergies during exoskeleton-assisted overhead work.
40227905	Generic Drone Simulator: Design, Development and User Testing in a Virtual Search and Rescue Mission.	This study addresses the need for scenario-specific drone simulators to enhance research, education, pilot training, and performance evaluation across diverse mission contexts. A gamified simulator was developed for the joint master's degree program "Security and Defence" between the Open University of Cyprus (OUC) and the Hellenic Air Force Academy (HAFA), with a focus on Search and Rescue mission training and planning. The simulator balances interface design, physics accuracy, and environmental realism to support specialized professional training and research. A survey-based evaluation involving 57 participants -pilots, engineers, and air traffic controllers -demonstrated the tool's ability to provide realistic experiences for trained pilots and meaningful learning opportunities for novices. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between gaming familiarity, task completion times, and participant expertise.
40227904	A Novel Adaptive Propulsion Enhancement eXperience (APEX) System: Development and Preliminary Validation for Enhancing Gait Propulsion in Stroke Survivors.	This study presents the development and preliminary validation of a novel system, called APEX (Adaptive Propulsion Enhancement eXperience), which aims to enhance gait propulsion in stroke survivors. The APEX system utilizes a dual-belt instrumented treadmill capable of measuring ground reaction forces and modulating belt speed in real time to provide visual biofeedback with dynamic propulsion promotion. We developed two propulsion promotion modes: the propulsion-facilitating mode, which extends ground contact time to elicit intrinsic propulsive effort and the propulsion-augmenting mode, which increases propulsive force by applying controlled external force. Ten chronic-stage stroke survivors (7 females and 3 males; age: 61.40 ± 6.96 years) completed two experimental trials: one with the propulsion-facilitating mode, and the other with the propulsion-augmenting mode. Each trial included a baseline period without assistance (visual biofeedback and propulsion promotion) for 30 steps, a training period with assistance for 100 steps, and a posttraining period without assistance for 30 steps. For each period, outcome measures (propulsive force, impulse, lowerlimb kinematics, and muscle activity) were quantified. Statistical analysis revealed significant improvements in propulsive force, impulse, lower-limb kinematics, and muscle activity during both the training and post-training periods compared to the baseline period, with no significant differences between the training and post-training periods. These findings demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the APEX system in delivering real-time, adaptive training to enhance gait propulsion. Integrating the APEX system into clinical practice has the potential to provide a scalable, patient-specific approach for post-stroke gait rehabilitation.
40227903	SRRNet: Unseen SSVEP Response Regression from Stimulus for Cross-stimulus Transfer in SSVEP-BCIs.	The prolonged calibration time required by steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) poses a significant challenge to real-life applications. Cross-stimulus transfer emerges as a promising solution, wherein a model trained on a subset of classes (seen classes) can predict both seen and unseen classes. Existing approaches extracted common components from SSVEP templates of seen classes to construct templates for unseen classes; however, they are limited by the class-specific activities and noise contained in these components, leading to imprecise templates that degrade classification performance. To address this issue, this study proposed an SSVEP Response Regression Network (SRRNet), which learned the regression mapping between sine-cosine reference signals and SSVEP templates using seen class data. This network reconstructed SSVEP templates for unseen classes utilizing their corresponding sine-cosine signals. Additionally, an SSVEP template regressing and spatial filtering (SRSF) framework was introduced, where both test data and SSVEP templates were projected by task-related component analysis (TRCA) spatial filters, and correlations were computed for target prediction. Comparative evaluations on two public datasets revealed that our method significantly outperformed state-of-the-art methods, elevating the information transfer rate (ITR) from 173.33 bits/min to 203.79 bits/min. By effectively modeling the regression from sine-cosine reference signals to SSVEP templates, SRRNet can construct SSVEP templates for unseen classes without training samples from those classes. By integrating regressed SSVEP templates with spatial filtering-based methods, our method enhances cross-stimulus transfer performance in SSVEP-BCIs, thus advancing their practical applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/MaiXiming/SRRNet.
40227902	DistAL: A Domain-Shift Active Learning Framework with Transferable Feature Learning for Lesion Detection.	Deep learning has demonstrated exceptional performance in medical image analysis, but its effectiveness degrades significantly when applied to different medical centers due to domain shifts. Lesion detection, a critical task in medical imaging, is particularly impacted by this challenge due to the diversity and complexity of lesions, which can arise from different organs, diseases, imaging devices, and other factors. While collecting data and labels from target domains is a feasible solution, annotating medical images is often tedious, expensive, and requires professionals. To address this problem, we combine active learning with domain-invariant feature learning. We propose a Domain-shift Active Learning (DistAL) framework, which includes a transferable feature learning algorithm and a hybrid sample selection strategy. Feature learning incorporates contrastive-consistency training to learn discriminative and domain-invariant features. The sample selection strategy is called RUDY, which jointly considers Representativeness, Uncertainty, and DiversitY. Its goal is to select samples from the unlabeled target domain for cost-effective annotation. It first selects representative samples to deal with domain shift, as well as uncertain ones to improve class separability, and then leverages K-means++ initialization to remove redundant candidates to achieve diversity. We evaluate our method for the task of lesion detection. By selecting only 1.7% samples from the target domain to annotate, DistAL achieves comparable performance to the method trained with all target labels. It outperforms other AL methods in five experiments on eight datasets collected from different hospitals, using different imaging protocols, annotation conventions, and etiologies.
40227901	Uncertainty Propagation from Projections to Region Counts in Tomographic Imaging: Application to Radiopharmaceutical Dosimetry.	Radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs) present a major opportunity to improve cancer therapy. Although many current RPTs use the same injected activity for all patients, there is interest in using absorbed dose measurements to enable personalized prescriptions. However, image-based absorbed dose calculations incur uncertainties from calibration factors, partial volume effects and segmentation methods. While previously published dose estimation protocols incorporate these uncertainties, they do not account for uncertainty that originates from Poisson noise in the projection data that gets propagated through reconstruction algorithms. This effect should be accounted for to adequately estimate the total uncertainty in absorbed dose estimates. This paper proposes a computationally practical algorithm that propagates uncertainty from projection data through clinical reconstruction algorithms to obtain uncertainties on the total activity within volumes of interest (VOIs). The algorithm is first validated on <sup>177</sup>Lu and <sup>225</sup>Ac phantom data by comparing estimated uncertainties from individual SPECT acquisitions to empirical estimates obtained from multiple acquisitions. It is then applied to (i) Monte Carlo and (ii) multi-time point <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE and <sup>225</sup>Ac-PSMA-617 patient data for time integrated activity (TIA) uncertainty estimation. The outcomes of this work are two-fold: (i) the proposed uncertainty estimation algorithm is validated, and (ii) the propagation of VOI uncertainties to TIA uncertainty is validated with Monte Carlo data and applied to patient data. The proposed algorithm is made publicly available in the open-source image reconstruction library PyTomography and in the SPECT reconstruction extension of 3D Slicer.
40227900	ReorderBench: A Benchmark for Matrix Reordering.	Matrix reordering permutes the rows and columns of a matrix to reveal meaningful visual patterns, such as blocks that represent clusters. A comprehensive collection of matrices, along with a scoring method for measuring the quality of visual patterns in these matrices, contributes to building a benchmark. This benchmark is essential for selecting or designing suitable reordering algorithms for revealing specific patterns. In this paper, we build a matrix-reordering benchmark, ReorderBench, with the goal of evaluating and improving matrix-reordering techniques. This is achieved by generating a large set of representative and diverse matrices and scoring these matrices with a convolution- and entropy-based method. Our benchmark contains 2,835,000 binary matrices and 5,670,000 continuous matrices, each generated to exhibit one of four visual patterns: block, off-diagonal block, star, or band, along with 450 real-world matrices featuring hybrid visual patterns. We demonstrate the usefulness of ReorderBench through three main applications in matrix reordering: 1) evaluating different reordering algorithms, 2) creating a unified scoring model to measure the visual patterns in any matrix, and 3) developing a deep learning model for matrix reordering.
40227899	NeRFFaceShop: Learning a Photo-realistic 3D-aware Generative Model of Animatable and Relightable Heads from Large-scale In-the-wild Videos.	Animatable and relightable 3D facial generation has fundamental applications in computer vision and graphics. Although animation and relighting are highly correlated, previous methods usually address them separately. Effectively combining animation methods and relighting methods is nontrivial. In terms of explicit shading models, animatable methods cannot be easily extended to achieve realistic relighting results, such as shadow effects, due to prohibitive computational training costs. Regarding implicit lighting representations, current animatable methods cannot be incorporated due to their inharmonious animation representations, i.e., deforming spatial points. This paper, armed with a lightweight but effective lighting representation, presents a compatible animation representation to achieve a disentangled generative model of 3D animatable and relightable heads. Our represented animation allows for updating and control of realistic lighting effects. Due to the disentangled nature of our representations, we learn the animation and relighting from large-scale, in-the-wild videos instead of relying on a morphable model. We show that our method can synthesize geometrically consistent and detailed motion along with the disentangled control of lighting conditions. We further show that our method is still compatible with morphable models for driving generated avatars. Our method can also be extended to domains without video data by domain transfer to achieve a broader range of animatable and relightable head synthesis. We will release the code for reproducibility and facilitating future research.
40227898	Tomography of Quantum States From Structured Measurements via Quantum-Aware Transformer.	Quantum state tomography (QST) is the process of reconstructing the state of a quantum system (mathematically described as a density matrix) through a series of different measurements, which can be solved by learning a parameterized function to translate experimentally measured statistics into physical density matrices. However, the specific structure of quantum measurements for characterizing a quantum state has been neglected in previous work. In this article, we explore the similarity between highly structured sentences in natural language and intrinsically structured measurements in QST. To fully leverage the intrinsic quantum characteristics involved in QST, we design a quantum-aware transformer (QAT) model to capture the complex relationship between measured frequencies and density matrices. In particular, we query quantum operators in the architecture to facilitate informative representations of quantum data and integrate the Bures distance into the loss function to evaluate quantum state fidelity, thereby enabling the reconstruction of quantum states from measured data with high fidelity. Extensive simulations and experiments (on IBM quantum computers) demonstrate the superiority of the QAT in reconstructing quantum states with favorable robustness against experimental noise.
40227897	CharacterFactory: Sampling Consistent Characters with GANs for Diffusion Models.	Recent advances in text-to-image models have opened new frontiers in human-centric generation. However, these models cannot be directly employed to generate images with consistent newly coined identities. In this work, we propose CharacterFactory, a framework that allows sampling new characters with consistent identities in the latent space of GANs for diffusion models. More specifically, we consider the word embeddings of celeb names as ground truths for the identity-consistent generation task and train a GAN model to learn the mapping from a latent space to the celeb embedding space. In addition, we design a context-consistent loss to ensure that the generated identity embeddings can produce identity-consistent images in various contexts. Remarkably, the whole model only takes 10 minutes for training, and can sample infinite characters end-to-end during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate excellent performance of the proposed CharacterFactory on character creation in terms of identity consistency and editability. Furthermore, the generated characters can be seamlessly combined with the off-the-shelf image/video/3D diffusion models. We believe that the proposed CharacterFactory is an important step for identity-consistent character generation. Code and Gradio demo are available at: https://qinghew.github.io/CharacterFactory.
40227896	A Contrastive-Learning Framework for Unsupervised Salient Object Detection.	Existing unsupervised salient object detection (USOD) methods usually rely on low-level saliency priors, such as center and background priors, to detect salient objects, resulting in insufficient high-level semantic understanding. These low-level priors can be fragile and lead to failure when the natural images do not satisfy the prior assumptions, e.g., these methods may fail to detect those off-center salient objects causing fragmented objects in the segmentation. To address these problems, we propose to eliminate the dependency on flimsy low-level priors, and extract high-level saliency from natural images through a contrastive learning framework. To this end, we propose a Contrastive Saliency Network (CSNet), which is a prior-free and label-free saliency detector, with two novel modules: i) a Contrastive Saliency Extraction (CSE) module to extract high-level saliency cues, by mimicking the human attention mechanism within an instance discriminative task through a contrastive learning framework, and ii) a Feature Re-Coordinate (FRC) module to recover spatial details, by calibrating high-level features with low-level features in an unsupervised fashion. In addition, we introduce a novel local appearance triplet (LAT) loss to assist the training process by encouraging similar saliency scores for regions with homogeneous appearances. Extensive experiments show that our approach is effective and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular SOD benchmarks.
40227895	ILAM: Cross-Fusion of Latent and Attention Features for Explainable Medical Image Classification.	Accurate and interpretable AI models play a critical role in medical image analysis. However, despite advancements in explainable AI (XAI), existing methods struggle with inconsistent interpretability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Integrated Latent and Attention Mapping (ILAM) framework, which enhances both classification accuracy and explainability by fusing local and global feature representations. ILAM integrates a custom-designed Autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), where the AE learns fine-grained local features through unsupervised patchwise image reconstruction in the latent space. These local features are then fused with global representations extracted by ViT, creating a hybrid model that improves both performance and post hoc interpretability. To refine explainability, ILAM incorporates a modified attention rollout mechanism, which recursively aggregates latent feature representations and attention weights to produce precise and stable activation maps. We evaluate ILAM on three publicly available medical imaging datasets-BreakHis, Chest X-Ray, and Retinal, demonstrating its superior performance over transformer-based models such as ViT, DeiT, CvT, and SwinT. ILAM consistently generates detailed and reliable activation maps, providing clearer visualizations of critical image regions influencing model decisions. By effectively combining local and global feature fusion, ILAM establishes itself as a robust and interpretable framework for medical image classification.
40227894	A Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction Method Based on Atomic 3D Position Encoding and Elastic Message Passing Graph Neural Network.	Drug-drug interaction (DDI) refers to the inhibitory or enhancing effects between different drugs. Existing DDI prediction methods primarily use graph neural networks (GNNs) to directly represent drug molecular features. However, they often ignore the 3D structures of different atoms within drug molecules and the impact of noise in GNNs on DDI prediction. Consequently, the accuracy of GNN-based DDI prediction remains unsatisfactory. To address these limitations, this study proposes a DDI prediction method based on atomic 3D position encoding and an elastic message passing graph neural network (A3DPE-EMPGNN). Firstly, we construct an atomic feature network based on an attention mechanism and a message passing neural network. This network leverages 3D position encoding based on the molecular centroid to learn the features of different atoms and their associated chemical bonds, thereby constructing a graph-based molecular representation. Secondly, we design a molecular feature network that incorporates an attention mechanism, utilizing multi-head attention to capture interaction information between different drug molecules. Thirdly, we employ an adversarial attack detection and defense strategy, integrating supervised and contrastive loss learning to optimize the model and enhance its robustness while performing DDI prediction. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of A3DPE-EMPGNN on two real-world datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that our method achieves over 98% accuracy across ACC, AUC, AP, and F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art GNN-based models.
40227893	HiTrace: Hierarchical Class Tracing Approach for Open-Set Recognition on Skin Lesions.	In the constantly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), identifying unknown or novel classes, known as Open-set Recognition (OSR), is critical for ensuring the reliability of AI models in various applications, especially in the vital field of medical diagnostics. This study introduces a novel approach to advance OSR through the proposed hierarchical class tracing approach, HiTrace, for skin lesion classification. HiTrace incorporates three key components that tackle the complex challenges in OSR: the Hierarchy-Aware Prototype (HAP) learning for an efficient training strategy, the Distribution Enhancement (DE) module for optimized post-processing feature adjustment, and the Potential Class Tracing Algorithm (PCTA) for a hierarchical classification decision-making process. HiTrace leverages a hierarchical taxonomy to simplify the identification of new skin conditions, reducing the need for extensive manual annotation and addressing the limitations of existing methods. This study also introduces two novel evaluation metrics, the Hierarchical Open-set Classification Score (HOC-Score) and Major-Type Accuracy for Open-set samples (MTACC-O), which provide robust criteria for assessing a model's performance in classifying closed-set, in-taxonomy, and out-of-taxonomy results. Notably, the experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in the PAD-UFES-20 and ISIC 2019 datasets, with relative improvements of 15.3% and 21.1% in HOC-Score and 12.3% and 5.8% in MTACC-O, respectively, without compromising on competitive closed-set performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present a three-stage analysis (i.e., closed-set, in-taxonomy, and out-of-taxonomy classification results) of OSR applied to a practical medical field. This comprehensive approach represents an influential stride in enhancing patient care through the early detection and treatment of skin diseases, paving the way for future research and development in medical diagnostics and beyond.

40227891	Urolithin-A Derivative UAS03 Improves Cognitive Deficits and Memory by Activating Nrf2 Pathways to Alleviate Oxidative Stress and Neuroinflammation.	Neuroinflammation is a key factor in age-related cognitive decline and memory impairment. UAS03, a potent synthetic analogue of Urolithin-A, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This investigation examined the neuroprotective effect of UAS03 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation, and its associated cognitive impairments, memory deficits, and depression-like behaviors. Intracerebroventricular administration of LPS (12 μg/kg) was performed to induce neuroinflammation in mice, followed by a 7 day treatment with UAS03 at 10 and 30 mg/kg doses. Mice were evaluated for depressive and anxiety-like behavior, spatial memory, and learning functions using a series of neurobehavioral test paradigms. Histopathological and molecular analyses were conducted using hematoxylin-eosin and cresyl violet staining, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and Western blotting techniques. We have found that, UAS03 significantly enhanced cognitive and memory functions impaired by LPS while concurrently reducing depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the compound attenuated neuronal damage and decreased the expression of IBA-1 and GFAP in hippocampal region. Through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, UAS03 effectively mitigated markers of oxidative stress and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and COX-2. Cumulatively, this study provides compelling evidence that UAS03 exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating essential pathways involved in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms, suggesting its potential as a preventative measure against age-related cognitive decline and memory impairments associated with neuroinflammation.

40227889	Many-Body Basis Set Amelioration Method for Incremental Full Configuration Interaction.	Incremental full configuration interaction (iFCI) is a polynomial-cost electronic structure method that systematically approaches the FCI limit by employing the method of increments to solve the Schrödinger equation through a many-body expansion. This article introduces the many-body basis set amelioration (MBBSA) method, which is designed to allow iFCI to be applicable to larger atomic orbital basis sets. MBBSA uses a series of inexpensive iFCI calculations to approximate the correlation energy that would be found using a more expensive, highly accurate iFCI calculation. When compared to standard iFCI computations on smaller molecules in triple-ζ and larger basis sets, MBBSA provides approximations to the total and relative energies within chemical accuracy. MBBSA exhibits a reduced cost of between 60 and 92% when compared to standard iFCI calculations, with larger systems experiencing the largest benefit. Tests of MBBSA on two reactions that involve highly correlated systems, the automerization of cyclobutadiene and a Criegee intermediate reaction, show that MBBSA has practical utility for studying realistic chemistries.
40227888	The multiclass ARKA framework for developing improved q-RASAR models for environmental toxicity endpoints.	The continuous quest for the quick, accurate, and efficient methods for filling the gaps in the toxicity data of commercial chemicals is the need of the hour. Thus, it has become essential to develop simple and improved modeling strategies that aim to generate more accurate predictions. Recently, quantitative Read-Across Structure-Activity Relationship (q-RASAR) modeling has been reported to enhance the external predictivity of QSAR models. However, the cross-validation metrics of some q-RASAR models show compromised values compared to those of the corresponding QSAR models. We report here an improved q-RASAR workflow coupled with the Arithmetic Residuals in <i>K</i>-groups Analysis (ARKA) framework. This improved workflow (ARKA-RASAR) considers two important aspects: the contribution of different QSAR descriptors to different experimental response ranges, and the identification of similarity among close congeners based on both the selected QSAR descriptors and the contribution of different QSAR descriptors to different experimental response ranges. A simple, free, and user-friendly Java-based tool, Multiclass ARKA-v1.0, has been developed to compute the multiclass ARKA descriptors. In this study, five different toxicity datasets previously used for the development of QSAR and q-RASAR models were considered. We developed hybrid ARKA models that consist of a combination of QSAR descriptors and ARKA descriptors. These hybrid feature spaces were used to compute RASAR descriptors and develop ARKA-RASAR models. We used the same modeling strategies used to develop the previously reported QSAR and q-RASAR models for a fair comparison. Additionally, these modeling algorithms are straightforward, reproducible, and transferable. A multi-criteria decision-making statistical approach, the Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD), indicated that the ARKA-RASAR models are the best-performing models, considering training, test, and cross-validation statistics. The least significant difference procedure ensured that the SRD values were significantly different for most models, presenting an unbiased workflow. True external validation using a set of pesticide metabolites and predicting their early-stage acute fish toxicity using relevant ARKA-RASAR models was also carried out and yielded encouraging results. The promising results and the ease of computation of ARKA and RASAR descriptors using our tools suggest that the ARKA-RASAR modeling framework may be a potential choice for developing highly robust and predictive models for filling the gaps in environmental toxicity data.

Bioinformatics, genetic, and biochemical studies revealed that SpmM1-catalyzed carboxyl <i>O</i>-methylation enabled the common precursor of SPMs and IDMs to flux into the spiro-forming pathway to generate SPMs.
40227882	The unfolded protein response is a potential therapeutic target in pathogenic fungi.	Pathogenic fungal infections cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The frequent emergence of multidrug-resistant strains challenges existing antifungal therapies, driving the need to investigate novel antifungal agents that target new molecular moieties. Pathogenic fungi are subjected to various environmental stressors, including pH, temperature, and pharmacological agents, both in natural habitats and the host body. These stressors elevate the risk of misfolded or unfolded protein production within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which, if not promptly mitigated, can lead to the accumulation of these proteins in the ER lumen. This accumulation triggers an ER stress response, potentially jeopardizing fungal survival. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a critical cellular defense mechanism activated by ER stress to restore the homeostasis of protein folding. In recent years, the regulatory role of the UPR in pathogenic fungi has garnered significant attention, particularly for its involvement in fungal adaptation, regulation of virulence, and drug resistance. In this review, we comparatively analyze the UPRs of fungi and mammals and examine the potential utility of the UPR as a molecular antifungal target in pathogenic fungi. By clarifying the specificity and regulatory functions of the UPR in pathogenic fungi, we highlight new avenues for identifying potential therapeutic targets for antifungal treatments.
40227881	Repurposing of the RIPK1-Selective Benzo[1,4]oxazepin-4-one Scaffold for the Development of a Type III LIMK1/2 Inhibitor.	Benzoxazepinones have been extensively studied as exclusively selective RIP kinase 1 inhibitors. This scaffold binds to an allosteric pocket created by an αC-out/DFG-out conformation. This inactive conformation results in a large expansion of the kinase back pocket, a conformation that has also been reported for LIM kinases. Scaffold hopping is common in the design of orthosteric kinase inhibitors but has not been explored in the design of allosteric inhibitors, mainly due to the typically exclusive selectivity of type III inhibitors. Here, we hypothesized that the shared structural properties of LIMKs and RIPKs could lead to novel type III LIMK inhibitors using the benzoxazepinone scaffold. We report the discovery of a novel LIMK1/2 inhibitor that relies on this scaffold-based approach. The discovered compound <b>10</b> showed low nanomolar potency on LIMK1/2 and exceptional selectivity, as confirmed by a comprehensive selectivity panel with residual RIPK activity as the only off-target. The study provides one of the few examples for scaffold hopping for allosteric inhibitors, which are usually associated with exclusive target selectivity.
40227880	A Joyful Journey: Tungsten(VI) and Tungsten(V) Fluorides Meet N-Heterocyclic Carbenes and Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes.	The first complexation of tungsten(VI) fluoride with N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and a cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (cAACMe) is reported, which led to the complexes [(NHC)WF6] (NHC = IiPrMe, 1; BIiPr, 2; IMes, 3; IDipp, 4; and SIDipp, 5) and [(cAACMe)WF₆] 6. Solid-state structural analysis reveals distorted mono-capped trigonal prismatic geometries for 2 and 3, whereas 6 adopts a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination. Reduction of 1-6 with 0.5 equivalents of TMS-pyMe-TMS afforded rare tungsten(V) fluoride complexes [(NHC)WF₅] (NHC = IiPrMe, 7; BIiPr, 8; IMes, 9; IDipp, 10 and SIDipp, 11). Reduction of 6 with TMS-py-TMS yielded the dinuclear, fluoride-bridged complex [(cAACMe)WF₅]₂ 12. Subsequent addition of a second equivalent cAACMe to 12 gave the mononuclear bis-carbene complex [(cAACMe)₂WF₅] 13. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and EPR spectroscopy confirm a predominantly metal-centered d¹ radical in both 12 and 13. These findings expand the scope of tungsten fluoride chemistry by providing rare examples of tungsten(VI) and tungsten(V) complexes stabilized by soft carbon-donor ligands, paving the way for further exploration.

40227877	Does Concomitant Psychostimulants Mitigate Second-Generation Antipsychotics-Associated Weight Gain? An Observational Study Based on Electronic Medical Records Data.	<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Weight loss is a well-documented adverse effect of psychostimulants. Given their frequent coprescription with second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) in pediatric patients, this study aims to examine whether concomitant use of psychostimulants mitigates SGA-associated weight gain in children and adolescents. <b><i>Method:</i></b> This study utilized the IQVIA Ambulatory electronic medical record-U.S. database (2016-2021) to identify patients aged 6-17 years who initiated an SGA. Those who started psychostimulants within 7 days of SGA initiation and maintained ≥90 days of use were classified as concomitant users, while those who initiated psychostimulants later with ≥90 days of overlap were add-on users. Patients never prescribed psychostimulants were SGA-only users. After adjusting for the baseline covariates using propensity scores, 6- and 12-month body mass index (BMI) <i>z</i>-score trends following psychostimulant initiation were compared between (1) concomitant and SGA-only users and (2) add-on and SGA-only users, using a linear mixed-effects regression model. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The results of linear mixed effect regression models indicate that concomitant users experienced a 0.0143 less monthly BMI <i>z</i>-score increase (<i>p</i> = 0.0063) compared with the SGA-only users over the 6 months following psychostimulant initiation. Similarly, add-on users had a significantly lower rate of weight gain compared with SGA-only users (<i>β</i> = -0.0463, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). When the follow-up period was extended to 12 months, the sensitivity analyses for both concomitant and add-on users were consistent with their primary analyses. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Concomitant and add-on psychostimulants appear to mitigate SGA-associated weight gain in children and adolescents. Further investigation is needed to understand their effectiveness and safety relative to other interventions for antipsychotic-associated weight gain.

40227875	Functional hydrogels for accelerated wound healing: advances in conductive hydrogels and self-powered electrical stimulation.	Compared to traditional dressings, hydrogel dressings not only protect the wound surface and prevent bacterial infection but also possess excellent moisturizing properties, which can provide an optimal moist environment for wound healing, and exhibit good biocompatibility, making them considered the best wound treatment materials. This review focuses on the research status and application progress of various functional hydrogel dressings, such as hemostatic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and conductive hydrogels. It proposes the combination of conductive hydrogels with flexible solar cells to form self-powered devices. Compared to traditional externally powered devices, this approach can reduce carbon footprints by utilizing clean energy, aligning with carbon neutrality policy requirements. Additionally, it eliminates the need for frequent battery replacement or power connections, effectively saving labor and operational costs. Self-powered devices can convert solar energy into electrical energy, which is conducted to the wound site through hydrogels, generating continuous electrical stimulation (ES). This electrical stimulation guides the directional migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts toward the center of the wound; activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway to accelerate the cell cycle process, and upregulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, thereby inducing endothelial cell proliferation and lumen formation. These multiple mechanisms work synergistically to promote wound healing. Finally, the review provides an outlook on the emergence and applications of multifunctional hydrogels and stimuli-responsive hydrogels, highlighting common challenges in the future development of hydrogels, such as weak mechanical strength and poor long-term stability, as well as feasible solutions to these issues.
40227874	A defective carbonized wood membrane as a free-standing three-dimensional anode host for high-performance Zn-ion batteries.	Three-dimensional (3D) porous carbons as the host matrix of Zn anodes have been proven to be effective in suppressing Zn dendrite formation during the cycling of aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs), but the complex fabrication process and the lack of sufficient active sites for Zn nucleation still limit their practical applications. Herein, we developed a free-standing 3D carbon-based Zn anode (Zn/HDCW) by controllably electrochemically depositing Zn within a highly defective, hierarchically porous carbonized wood (HDCW) membrane obtained <i>via</i> the CO<sub>2</sub> thermal etching of carbonized wood (CW). The HDCW features not only numerous open aligned microchannels and excellent wettability for fast electrolyte transport but also abundant carbon defects for effectively binding with Zn<sup>2+</sup>, enabling uniform plating and stripping of Zn and thus greatly suppressing the formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, the Zn/HDCW-based symmetric cell exhibits long-term cycling stability nearing 2700 h at 1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with low voltage hysteresis. Furthermore, the Zn/HDCW anode offers the corresponding aqueous Zn/HDCW-MnO<sub>2</sub>/HDCW full cell with remarkable rate capability and cycling stability, delivering a stable capacity of 170.8 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> after 600 cycles with a unit coulombic efficiency and an excellent capacity retention of 100%. This work provides a new insight into the development of 3D porous carbon-based Zn anodes for high-performance ZIBs.
40227873	An effective approach to obtain functional poly-β-peptides for combating drug-resistant bacterial infections.	The high mortality of drug-resistant bacterial infections, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, highlights an urgent demand for promising antimicrobial strategies. Host defense peptide (HDP)-mimicking poly-β-peptides have demonstrated significant potential in combating drug-resistant bacterial infections, with their antimicrobial activity closely dependent on their side-chain structures. However, the restricted structural diversity of poly-β-peptides necessitates efficient synthetic methods to expand their diversity, particularly positively charged side-chain structures. This study presents a water-tolerant approach that facilitates the controllable synthesis of poly-β-peptides with different chain lengths and structurally diverse side chains, including primary amines, tertiary amines, as well as alkyl, aryl, and methoxy groups. This approach serves as an HDP-mimicking discovery platform to obtain the optimal poly-β-peptide, AOc<sub>0.8</sub>HNL<sub>0.2</sub>, which exhibits broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and high selectivity against drug-resistant bacteria. The antibacterial mechanism studies reveal that AOc<sub>0.8</sub>HNL<sub>0.2</sub> disrupts the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. <i>In vivo</i> evaluations substantiate the therapeutic potential of AOc<sub>0.8</sub>HNL<sub>0.2</sub> in treating drug-resistant bacterial infections with no observable toxicity. This study underscores the potential of this convenient synthetic strategy as a promising platform for developing antimicrobial poly-β-peptides to combat the growing threat of drug-resistant bacterial infections.
40227872	Extrudable Thermosets Based on Dynamic Covalent Polymers.	Dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) have attracted considerable attention for fabricating self-healing, recyclable, adaptive, and malleable thermosets. However, their processing has largely depended on compression moulding, which requires extended time due to the crosslinked nature of these materials. This limitation poses significant challenges for applications in continuous processes like extrusion, a technique highly valued in industry for producing long, uninterrupted products. Recently, continuous processing methods for DCPs have emerged, offering potential to streamline their production by providing scalability and consistency-factors that could transform sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods. Yet, developing extrudable DCPs remains a complex task, demanding the precise design of dynamic crosslinks with rapid kinetics, high thermal stability, and cost-effectiveness, all while ensuring compatibility with suitable molecular backbones. In this review, we summarize the key requirements for designing extrudable DCPs and discuss recent advancements in continuous processing techniques aligned with various design strategies. We also highlight the challenges and outline future directions for optimizing high-performance DCP extrusion, aiming to offer a valuable resource for researchers and industry professionals looking to leverage these techniques.
40227871	Dynamic Interplay between Deformability and Activity in Cell Entry of Soft Active Nanoparticles.	Deformability has been recognized as a prime important characteristic influencing cellular uptake. But little is known about whether it controls cell-nanoparticle interfaces driven out of equilibrium. Here, we report on soft elastic active nanoparticles whose deformability due to the rigidity regulates the nonequilibrium interaction and dynamics in their endocytosis process. Simulations demonstrate a definitely nonmonotonic feature for the dependence of uptake efficiency on nanoparticle rigidity, in striking contrast to their passive counterpart. There exists a minimum activity for certain cellular uptake, which turns to a larger rigidity for a more vertical orientation of the nanoparticle. We analyze these results by developing analytical theories that reveal the physical origin of various energetic contributions and dissipations governed by the dynamic interplay between nanoparticle deformability and activity. Altogether, the present findings provide new insights into the nonequilibrium physics at cellular interfaces and might be of immediate interest to designing soft systems for the desired biomedical applications.
40227869	Antimicrobial peptides and their application to combat implant-associated infections - opportunities and challenges.	Despite minimally invasive surgeries and advancements in aseptic techniques, implant-associated infections are a significant complication in post-surgical implantation of medical devices. The standard practice of systemic antibiotic administration is often ineffective due to the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance, poor antibiotic penetration into biofilms, and low antibiotic bioavailability at the infected site. Infected implants are typically salvaged by tissue resection and antibacterial reinforcements during revision surgery. Towards this end, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics to combat infections. Herein, a comprehensive overview of antimicrobial peptides, their structure and function, comparison with conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial properties, mechanisms of action of AMPs, and bacterial resistance to AMPs in relation to antibiotics are discussed. Furthermore, stimuli-responsive AMP delivery and contact killing <i>via</i> AMP coatings on implant surfaces are deliberated. We discuss various methods of AMP immobilization and coatings on implant materials through physico-chemical coating strategies. The review also addresses the clinical status and current limitations of AMP coatings such as proteolytic instability and potential cytotoxicity. Finally, we conclude with future directions to develop small, effective AMP mimetics and encapsulation of AMPs within nanocarriers to improve antimicrobial properties and design-controlled release systems for sustained antimicrobial activity.

Despite the development of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach, no drug candidate has successfully progressed beyond clinical phase II, highlighting the need for a novel chemotype with improved in vivo potency, pharmacokinetics and safety. In this study, we discovered a phenylacetylpiperidine-based compound, <b>77</b> (lab code: <b>DJ-89</b>; IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.51 nM), through strategic scaffold hopping from previously reported styrene-based sEH inhibitors. Resolving the cocrystal structure and mode-of-action studies revealed a distinct profile compared to well-known sEH inhibitors <b>TPPU</b> and <b>EC5026</b> (IC<sub>50</sub>: 44, 19 nM). Notably, <b>77</b> demonstrated additional interactions with sEH compared to <b>TPPU</b>, and uniquely enhanced anti-inflammatory factors, including EET levels and IL-10, a capability not observed with <b>EC5026</b>. Moreover, <b>77</b> showed excellent pharmacokinetics and safety, positioning it as a promising candidate for treating both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, leveraging phenylacylpiperidine scaffolds in sEH-targeted therapies.

40227862	The In Situ Assembly of an Equipotential Cathode for Nitrite Enrichment Enabling Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to N<sub>2</sub>.	Electrocatalytically reducing NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to N<sub>2</sub> is of great significance for environmental remediation and global nitrogen cycling. However, it is currently hindered by low N<sub>2</sub> selectivity since adsorbate N-intermediates are hard to migrate and couple each other during the N-N coupling step. Herein, an in situ assembly strategy was taken to attach Pd@Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles with CuO nanowire arrays to form an equipotential cathode CuO-Pd@Cu<sub>2</sub>O, which optimized N<sub>2</sub> selectivity to 91%, much higher than that of directly loaded Pd-Cu cathode (55%). Theoretical calculations combined with in situ spectroscopies demonstrated that the equipotential cathode can shield the electric field and enrich NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> intermediate inside. Meanwhile, a unique reaction pathway was revealed that the enriched NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> can directly couple with *N and also tune the Pd d-band center, avoiding the hurdles in N-N coupling. The approach here provides a new perspective in cathode design and a mechanistic understanding for the N-N coupling reaction.

This qualitative study aimed to identify service needs and barriers and facilitators to treatment among violently injured patients and their caregivers (e.g., parent, partner) to improve access to and quality of care. Participants included 14 violently injured patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma center (M<sub>age</sub> = 28 years, 92.8% Black, 92.8% male) and eight of their caregivers (M<sub>age</sub> = 44 years, 100.0% Black, 100.0% female). Semistructured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and deidentified. A team of three coders analyzed the data using thematic analysis. Results indicated that desired in-hospital services included social and emotional support, financial support, and support for caregivers. Desired postdischarge services included financial support and services to promote physical and emotional recovery. Patients often mentioned needing mental health services for their caregivers, whereas caregivers frequently discussed the need for financial assistance and services to support patients' physical recovery after discharge. Common facilitators for engaging in mental health treatment included support from hospital staff, family, and friends in navigating mental health service systems. Reported barriers to engaging in mental health services were a lack of readiness and limited resources. The findings highlight the critical need to integrate comprehensive care programs within trauma centers to support violently injured patients and their caregivers, reduce barriers to postinjury mental health care, and enhance access to mental health treatment.
40227860	Atomic Synergy Catalysis Enables High-Performing Aqueous Zinc-Iodine Batteries.	Aqueous zinc-iodine batteries (AZIBs) are attractive energy storage systems with the features of low cost, sustainability, and efficient multielectron transfer mechanism. However, the I<sub>2</sub> cathodes face obstacles due to the sluggish redox kinetics and severe shuttle effect. Herein, the atomically dispersed selenium single atoms (Se SAs) are embedded in ZIF-8-derived nitrogen-doped carbon. This design not only triggers the rapid redox conversion of I<sub>2</sub> but also enhances the anchoring of polyiodides, thereby enabling the excellent lifespan and rate capability of the Zn-I<sub>2</sub> battery. Specifically, the Se SAs and N dopants on carbon achieve a rapid I<sub>2</sub>/I<sup>-</sup> couple conversion reaction via modulation of the conversion energy barrier, as revealed by in situ results coupled with density functional theory analysis. This work demonstrates the application of atomic synergy in facilitating the reversible conversion of iodine species and provides valuable insights into designing efficient I<sub>2</sub> hosts for next-generation AZIBs.
40227859	Effective Complexation of Tris-Ligand with CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O in an Aqueous Solution: Suppressing Electrochemical Formation of CoO<sub><i>x</i></sub>.	In this report, we have demonstrated an effective complexation of <b>TrisH</b><sub><b>3</b></sub> (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) ligand with Co(II) when it is added to a sodium acetate containing aqueous solution of CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O, leading to the formation of a Co(II)-coordination complex, [Co<sup>II</sup>(TrisH<sub>2</sub>)(TrisH<sub>3</sub>)(CH<sub>3</sub>COO) (H<sub>2</sub>O)] (<b>CoT</b>), in the resultant solution at a pH value of 8.6. We could characterize the <b>CoT</b> complex in its solution state by diverse spectral analyses followed by its validation using computational (density functional theory (DFT)) studies. The Job plot from UV-visible data indicates a 2:1 Tris/Co coordination complex in the aqueous solution of <b>TrisH</b><sub><b>3</b></sub> and CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O. Interestingly, this complex (<b>CoT</b>) in its solution state inhibits the formation of CoO<sub><i>x</i></sub> during electrochemical studies, whereas the aqueous solution of CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O <i>per se</i> generates CoO<sub><i>x</i></sub> <i>in situ</i>. The relevant electrochemical and spectroscopic studies, including controlled experiments, have been performed in this work.
40227857	Moiré Potential Independent of Moiré Size Down to a Few Nanometers in Sliding Ferroelectrics.	Sliding ferroelectricity represents a way to realize atomically thin ferroelectric materials. Due to the moiré pattern formed during the stacking process, the alternating ferroelectric domain network provides an attractive superlattice of electrostatic potential to modulate the electronic structures of another material sitting on it. The relationship between the ferroelectric potential magnitude and the moiré size, however, has been controversial in the literature. In addition, how strong the potential remains for domain sizes down to the 10 nm range is unclear. In this study, we use contact-mode scanning tunneling microscopy with high spatial and energy resolution to show that the moiré potential is independent of the domain size ranging from hundreds to several nanometers. We also show that the electrostatic potential is determined solely by the specific materials used to fabricate the stack. This study provides important information for sliding ferroelectrics and can foster their application in modulating other materials.
40227856	Photoredox Catalysts Based on N-(Hexyl)benzothioxanthene-3,4-dicarboximide for Photopolymerization and 3D Printing under Visible Light.	Photoredox catalytic systems are widely used in free radical polymerization as an important photoinitiating approach. However, many reported photoredox catalytic systems are limited by their low stabilities, high excitation powers, and low initiating efficiencies upon excitation in the visible region. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to develop efficient photoinitiating systems for photopolymerization under visible light. In this work, three new effective photosensitizers from N-(hexyl)benzothioxanthene-3,4-dicarboximide derivatives namely 2-hexyl-1H-thioxantheno[2,1,9-def]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione (BTXI), 5-bromo-2-hexyl-1H-thioxantheno[2,1,9-def]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione (BTXI-Br) and 2-hexyl-1H-thioxantheno[2,1,9-def]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione 6,6-dioxide (BTXIO), were designed by density functional theory calculation and synthesized as photoredox catalysts for visible light induced photopolymerization. When combined with initiators such as oxidants i.e. bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)iodonium hexafluorophosphate or sulfonium salts (i.e., thianthrenium salts, phenoxathiinium salt, phenothiazinium salt, dibenzothiophenium salt) and the reductant ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate to form three-component initiating systems, they showed good to high performance in visible light photo polymerizations with LED@405nm and LED@450nm. In addition, these photoinitiating systems enable the successful digital light processing and direct laser writing of 3D structures with high resolution, demonstrating a promising strategy for 3D printing applications.

40227852	Near-Zero Thermal Expansion in Coordination Polymer Cd(1,2,4-triazole)2(H2PO4)2.	Zero thermal expansion is a rare but desirable physical property for materials. Here, we report an unprecedented near-zero thermal expansion (nZTE) behavior in a two-dimensional coordination polymer (CP) Cd(1,2,4-triazole)2 (H2PO4)2 (Cd-Tz) across a broad temperature range of 25 K - 400 K. Using multi-temperature high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we investigated the structural dynamics of the wine-rack-like framework of Cd-Tz and compared it with that of positive thermal expansion (PTE) CPs Zn-Tz and Mn-Tz with similar framework topology. We show that nZTE in Cd-Tz is a consequence of two monotonic and opposing trends with PTE (αa, αc ~ 22 MK-1) in the ac plane and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the b direction (αb ~ -47 MK-1). A new mechanism for the uniaxial NTE is established based on concerted out-of-plane single atom libration of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine-rack motifs. X-ray electron density analysis and modelling of low-temperature vibrational anharmonicity reveals the role of Cd-triazole bonds and hydrogen bonds in promoting the single atom libration. Tuning the metal-ligand bonding strength through minor substitution of Zn/Mn (~8/12%) in the Cd-Tz lattice results in a prominent shift from nZTE to NTE behavior in the solid solution phases.
40227851	Distinct antibiotic treatment regimens differentially affect colonization resistance against multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice.	Besides its live-saving properties, antibiotic treatment affects the commensal microbiota facilitating colonization with potentially harmful microorganisms. Here we tested how commonly applied antibiotics induced gut microbiota changes and predisposed to intestinal carriage of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR Psae) upon exposure. Therefore, mice received either vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin plus sulbactam (A/S) or no antibiotics via the drinking water and were perorally challenged with a clinical MDR Psae isolate after antibiotic withdrawal. Whereas 100% of A/S and 55% of ciprofloxacin pretreated mice harbored Psae in their feces seven days post-challenge, intestinal Psae carriage rates were 20.0% and 26.3% in vancomycin pretreated and untreated mice, respectively. Microbiota analyses revealed that immediately before MDR Psae challenge, A/S pretreated mice displayed the lowest total bacterial, lactobacilli and Clostridium leptum fecal loads compared to other cohorts. Seven days following Psae exposure, however, higher numbers of apoptotic colonic epithelial cells were observed in A/S pretreated versus untreated mice that were accompanied by more enhanced innate and adaptive immune cell responses and nitric oxide secretion in colonic and ileal biopsies in the former versus the latter. In conclusion, distinct gut microbiota shifts following A/S pretreatment facilitate pronounced intestinal MDR Psae colonization and pro-inflammatory immune responses upon oral exposure.

40227847	Cool Fat, Hot Topic: A Systematic Review on Cryopreservation of Adipose Tissue.	Autologous fat grafting is increasingly used in plastic, reconstructive, and esthetic surgery. Cryopreservation offers a promising solution for the long-term storage of adipose tissue, enabling multiple grafting sessions while minimizing patient discomfort associated with repeated liposuction for fat harvesting. This systematic review aims to analyze the current literature focusing on factors that influence the outcome of cryopreservation, including the use of cryoprotectants, the cooling and warming rate, the storage temperature, and the enrichment of cryopreserved fat grafts. A systematic search of the PubMed/MEDLINE database up to November 2024 was performed, including original preclinical and clinical studies written in English describing the cryopreservation of unprocessed or mechanically processed adipose tissue (macrofat, microfat, or nanofat). Eligible articles needed to describe the applied cryopreservation protocol, at least the storage temperature. Studies on cryopreservation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), stromal vascular fraction, microvascular fragments, and other isolated components of adipose tissue were excluded. Data on cryoprotectants, cooling and warming rates, storage temperature, and eventual supplementation or enrichment of frozen fat were collected. Of the 679 records identified, 59 met the inclusion criteria. Adipose tissue cryopreservation at -80°C with a cryoprotectant, controlled slow cooling, and fast warming represented the most often applied protocol with encouraging outcomes in maintaining tissue survival and histological structure. Several studies indicated that the supplementation of frozen adipose tissue with ASCs improves tissue survival. Taken together, existing studies present diverse, and to some extent, conflicting results regarding cryopreservation protocols and their effects on adipose tissue viability. Hence, the ideal cryopreservation protocol for autologous fat remains to be established. Moreover, tailored protocols may be necessary for the cryopreservation of fat derivatives, such as nanofat.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology with the potential to enhance the functionality of SR and promote user acceptance by further improving human-robot interaction.
40227845	A finite element study of the biomechanics of aging osteocyte model.	Aging lacuna-canalicular system (LCS) has osteocyte size reduction, cell process number loss, and canaliculus blockage. This study built four osteocyte aging models for various aging features. These models have processes, collagen hillocks, and primary cilia mechanoreceptors for signal comparison. A triaxial displacement load on the piezoelectric bone matrix was utilized to explore mechanical signal changes in the absence of different processes, canaliculi blockage, and the effects of aging on osteocyte mechanoreceptor signals. Osteocyte age doesn't affect piezoelectric effect electric field strength. The aging model flows slower than the normal model. Blocking canaliculi raises fluid pressure. Aging osteocytes lack processes, reducing primary cilia and process stress-strain. Osteocyte volume reduction and canaliculi blockage exacerbate this alteration.

The laser-induced emission experiments demonstrated in this study encourage further development of solution-processed fabrication of a colloidal silicon quantum dot laser.
40227842	Pleiotropy increases parallel selection signatures during adaptation from standing genetic variation.	The phenomenon of parallel evolution, whereby similar genomic and phenotypic changes occur across replicated pairs of populations or species, is widely studied. Nevertheless, the determining factors of parallel evolution remain poorly understood. Theoretical studies have proposed that pleiotropy, the influence of a single gene on multiple traits, is an important factor. In order to gain a deeper insight into the role of pleiotropy for parallel evolution from standing genetic variation, we characterized the interplay between parallelism, polymorphism, and pleiotropy. The present study examined the parallel gene expression evolution in 10 replicated populations of <i>Drosophila simulans</i>, which were adapted from standing variation to the same new temperature regime. The data demonstrate that the parallel evolution of gene expression from standing genetic variation is positively correlated with the strength of pleiotropic effects. The ancestral variation in gene expression is, however, negatively correlated with parallelism. Given that pleiotropy is also negatively correlated with gene expression variation, we conducted a causal analysis to distinguish cause and correlation and evaluate the role of pleiotropy. The causal analysis indicated that both direct (causative) and indirect (correlational) effects of pleiotropy contribute to parallel evolution. The indirect effect is mediated by historic selective constraint in response to pleiotropy. This results in parallel selection responses due to the reduced standing variation of pleiotropic genes. The direct effect of pleiotropy is likely to reflect a genetic correlation among adaptive traits, which in turn gives rise to synergistic effects and higher parallelism.

40227832	Accounting for the vibrational contribution to the configurational entropy in disordered solids with machine learned forcefields: a case study of garnet electrolyte Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>.	Accounting for lattice vibrations to accurately determine the phase stabilities of site-disordered solids is a long-standing challenge in computational material designs, due to the high computational cost associated with sampling the vast configurational space to obtain the converged thermodynamic quantities. One example is the garnet electrolyte Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, the high-temperature and high-ion-mobility cubic phase of which is disordered in its Li<sup>+</sup> site occupations, such that both the vibrational and configurational entropic contributions to its phase stability cannot be ignored. Understanding the subtle interplay between vibrational and configurational entropies in this material will therefore play a critical role in the rational manipulation of dopants and defects to stabilise cubic Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> at room temperature for practical applications. Here, by developing machine learned forcefields based on an equivariant message-passing neural network SO3KRATES, we follow a strict statistical thermodynamic protocol to quantify the phase stability of cubic Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> through structural optimisations, as well as molecular dynamics simulations at 300 and 1500 K, for a total of 70 120 configurations of cubic Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. Although this only covers a tiny fraction of the configurational space (∼7 × 10<sup>34</sup> configurations in total), we are able to deterministically show that the vibrational contributions to the total configurational free energy at 1500 K are significant (on the order of 1 eV per atom) in correctly ordering the stability of the cubic Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> over its tetragonal counterpart, thanks to the high data efficiency, accuracy, stability and good transferability of the transformer-based equivariant network architecture behind SO3KRATES. Therefore, our work opens up new avenues to accelerate the accurate computational designs of disordered solids, such as solid electrolytes, for technologically important applications.
40227831	Enhanced antimicrobial protection through surface immobilization of antibiotic-loaded peptide multicompartment micelles.	The escalating global threat of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, driven by biofilm formation on medical device surfaces, prompts the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. To address this growing challenge, we develop rifampicin-loaded multicompartment micelles (RIF-MCMs) immobilized on surfaces, offering a dual-functional approach to enhance antimicrobial efficacy for localized therapeutic applications. We first optimize the physicochemical properties of RIF-MCMs, and subsequently coat the optimal formulation onto a glass substrate, as confirmed by quartz crystal microbalance and atomic force microscopy. Surface-immobilized RIF-MCMs facilitate sustained antibiotic release in response to biologically relevant temperatures (37 °C and 42 °C). In addition, their heterogeneous distribution enhances the surface's roughness, contributing to the antibacterial activity through passive mechanisms such as hindering bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. <i>In vitro</i> antimicrobial testing demonstrates that RIF-MCM-modified surfaces achieve a 98% reduction in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> viability and a three-order-of-magnitude decrease in colony formation compared to unmodified surfaces. In contrast, RIF-MCMs exhibit minimal cytotoxicity to mammalian cells, making them suitable candidates for medical device coatings. Our dual-function antimicrobial strategy, combining sustained antibiotic release and enhanced surface roughness, presents a promising approach to locally prevent implant-associated infections and biofilm formation.

Herein, we report an aerobic palladium-catalyzed aza-Wacker cyclization to produce spirocyclopentene-3,2'-indolines with vicinal stereocenters. Using 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene (dppbz) and pyridine as ligands, we achieved a ligand-modulated diastereodivergent synthesis, producing <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-spirocyclopentene-3,2'-indolines with exceptional yields and diastereoselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that selective aza-Wacker cyclization proceeds through distinct <i>trans</i>- and <i>cis</i>-aminopalladation mechanisms.

Here, we report the synthesis and properties of two types of azulene fused, <i>seco</i>-hexabenzocoronene-based nanographenes. The X-ray crystallographic analysis indicated their nonplanar structures with highly torsional periphery in the solid structures. The typical narrow highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) energy gaps, long-wavelength absorption, and <i>anti</i>-Kasha emissions were investigated by experimental and computational studies. Interestingly, these nanographenes exhibited a pronounced photothermal effect.
40227822	Quantitative evaluation of accelerated transdermal drug delivery by electroosmosis <i>via</i> frustoconical porous microneedles.	Electroosmosis-based transdermal drug delivery <i>via</i> frustoconical porous microneedles (F-PMNs) is studied by quantitative fluorescence analysis of the drug models penetrated into excised pig skin. An array of 300 μm height F-PMN made of poly-glycidyl methacrylate is modified by a grafted thin film of anionic poly (2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) or a cationic poly-(3-acrylamidopropyl trimethylammonium) (PAPTAC) to generate electroosmotic flow (EOF) upon application of current through the needles. Owing to the synergy of the EOF-promoted transport and the expansion of the stratum corneum with the frustoconical protrusions, the penetration rates of rhodamine B (479 Da) and FITC-dextran (4 kDa and 10 kDa) are found to be accelerated by more than 10 times. In addition, the F-PMNs modified with PAMPS and PAPTAC show similar delivery rates in opposite directions, enabling the possible dual-mode delivery from both anode and cathode in an integrated iontophoresis device.

40227795	Assessing microplastics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and other contaminants of global concern in wadable agricultural streams in Iowa.	Microplastics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and pesticides may lead to unintended environmental contamination through many pathways in multiple matrices. This statewide, multi-matrix study of contaminants of global concern (CGCs) in agricultural streams across Iowa (United States) is the first to examine multiple CGCs in water, bed sediment, and fish to understand their occurrence in small streams located in regions of intense agriculture activity. Iowa plays a pivotal role in agriculture, with more than 85% of Iowa's landscape devoted to agriculture, making it an ideal location for determining the prevalence of CGCs to provide critical baseline exposure data. Fifteen sites were sampled across a range of predominant land uses (<i>e.g.</i>, poultry, swine); all sites had detections of microplastics in all matrices. Concentrations of PFAS varied but were detected in water and sediment; all fish had detections of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), a type of PFAS. More than 50% of water and bed sediment samples had detections of ARGs. The most frequently detected PPCP was metformin. No sites had a cumulative exposure activity ratio greater than 1.0 for chemical exposures; 13 sites were above the 0.001 precautionary threshold. Toxicity quotients calculated using Aquatic Life Benchmarks were below the 0.1 moderate risk threshold for chemical exposures for all but one site. For fish, all sites exceeded the moderate and high-risk thresholds proposed for microplastic particles for food dilution (both chronic and acute exposures) and all sites exceeded the microplastic moderate threshold proposed for chronic tissue translocation, and two sites exceeded the threshold for acute tissue translocation.
40227790	Interlayer Manipulation for Accelerating Ion Diffusion Kinetics in Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>X</sub> MXene Fiber toward Enhanced Supercapacitance with High Rate Capability.	Polymer incorporation has been proven effective to enhance the mechanical strength of MXene fibers via interfacial cross-linking, yet the simultaneous improvement in electrochemical performance, particularly output capacitance and high rate capability, remains a challenge, and the major obstacle is identified as the sluggish ion diffusion kinetics. Herein, interlayer manipulation in Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>X</sub> fiber is proposed, and the roles of substitutional groups in celluloses are examined. The addition of cellulose can obviously improve the spinnability of MXene dope and effectively bridge the adjacent Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>X</sub> nanosheets via hydrogen bonds. Moreover, hydroxyethyl cellulose with a suitable group size and moderate adsorption ability is preferred for diminishing the steric effect and facilitating rapid proton transport. Simultaneous improvements in capacitance (1531 F cm<sup>-3</sup> at 2 A cm<sup>-3</sup>) and strength (∼76 MPa) are achieved for the optimized M-HEC-1.0% fiber together with a superior high rate capability retaining 89.2% at 15 A cm<sup>-3</sup>.
40227776	A Systematic Review of Spectroscopic Techniques for Detecting Milk Adulteration.	Milk adulteration is a crucial worldwide concern that endangers food safety and public health, as it involves the deliberate tampering with milk by adding foreign substances or removing essential nutrients, often to boost profits or hinder microbial growth. Traditional detection methods frequently lack the sensitivity and speed required to identify adulterants within milk's complex matrix. This systematic review critically examines the application of spectroscopic techniques for detecting milk adulteration, focusing on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy, Mass Spectrometry, Laser-Based Techniques, Dielectric Spectroscopy, and X-Ray Spectroscopy. Each technique's principles, advantages, limitations, and specific applications in identifying adulterants, such as water, urea, melamine, added sugars, fats, preservatives, and heavy metals are discussed. The review highlights how these methods offer rapid, non-destructive, and sensitive analysis, enhancing the ability to detect adulterants at molecular levels. Despite advancements, challenges persist, including the complexity and natural variability of milk composition, high costs of advanced equipment, need for specialized expertise, and lack of standardized protocols. Future directions emphasize developing portable and cost-effective spectroscopic devices, integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning for advanced data analysis, and fostering international collaboration to establish standardized methodologies and comprehensive spectral databases. By addressing these challenges, spectroscopic techniques can be more widely implemented, ultimately safeguarding public health, ensuring the integrity of dairy products, and maintaining consumer trust in the global food supply chain.

40227758	Economic Optimization Through Adherence to Best Practice Guidelines: A Decision Analysis of Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury Care Pathways in Australia.	Traumatic spinal cord injuries (TSCIs) have significant health, economic, and social effects on individuals, families, and society. In this economic analysis modeling study, we used record-linked administrative patient data from New South Wales, Australia, to construct a decision tree model to compare the economic cost of acute care for patients with TSCI under current clinical pathways with an optimal care (consensus guidelines-informed) modeled pathway. The optimal care pathway included direct transfer to a specialist SCI Unit (SCIU) or indirect transfer to SCIU within 24 h of injury, surgical intervention within 12 h of injury, and subsequent inpatient rehabilitation. Propensity score matching with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to reduce potential confounding from baseline differences in patient characteristics. A generalized linear model regression with gamma distribution and log link, weighted with IPTW scores, was used for cost and length of stay (LoS) estimations to reduce any residual bias. Sensitivity analyses quantified the sensitivity of the findings to key model parameters. From the healthcare payer perspective, our economic analysis found acute TSCI care at an SCIU was more expensive, with delayed patient transfer pathways, surgery, and timing of surgery driving higher per-patient costs ($14,322 at specialist centers). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) using 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations showed the modeled optimal pathway as the expensive option in the majority (86%) of stimulations. However, the modeled direct transfer care pathway demonstrated economic improvements compared to current care pathways, despite a higher upfront cost ($25,428 per patient), the modeled pathway reduced the episode LoS by 5 days (23 days vs. 28 days) on average, generating system-level savings of $20,628 per patient. In PSA, increasing the proportion of patients directly transferred to SCIU by 25%, the optimized pathway was preferred in 28.3% of the simulations. Furthermore, adopting this pathway lowered the incremental per patient cost to $17,157 while preserving a 5-day LoS benefit compared to current pathways (22 days vs. 27 days), which could generate potential savings of $3,471 per patient. Our findings show that guideline-based acute care management is initially resource-intensive but efficient in terms of patient LoS, with a higher proportion of direct transfers resulting in cost savings of $3,471 per patient, which represent system-level benefits from adopting the modeled pathway, rather than episode-level savings. Following consensus guidelines for acute care can provide an economically sustainable approach to resource-intensive patient needs while improving outcomes, as demonstrated in previous studies. In summary, while more intensive, adhering to clinical guidelines of direct transfer to SCIU demonstrates value for patients and health systems. Standardization to optimize time to surgery can achieve improved outcomes through earlier access to rehabilitation and substantial care efficiencies. These findings highlight the economic case for adherence to best practice care guidelines at the healthcare system level to inform future healthcare planning for patients with TSCI.

40227755	Core-Twisted, Cationic Perylene Diimides; Homochiral Dimerisation and Chiroptical Anion Sensing.	Core-twisted perylene diimides are chiral organic dyes that may be exploited for self-assembled chiroptical materials or for the enantioselective recognition and sensing of chiral substrates. Discrete self-assembled dimers and host-guest complexes of core-twisted perylene diimides are important for furthering our understanding of this supramolecular chemistry, yet they are rare because the twisted perylene core significantly weakens intermolecular π-π interactions with the PDI's π-surface. To address this challenge, we have installed hydrogen bond donor groups in the PDI's bay positions, which directs the formation of a robust, co-facial and homochiral intermolecular PDI dimer. The structure of this discrete dimer is distinct to previous aggregates of non-planar PDIs that utilise the imide position for hydrogen bonding. We also uncover the potential of core-twisted, dicationic PDIs for the enantioselective recognition and chiroptical sensing of chiral anions and investigate the basis of this response via chiral complementarity in the discrete host-guest complex.

40227732	Detection of NSCLC biomarker miRNAs <i>via</i> localized catalytic hairpin self-assembly and laser-induced fluorescence on a microfluidic platform.	This study introduces an innovative microfluidic platform integrating localized catalytic hairpin assembly (LCHA) amplification with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), for sensitive detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) biomarkers miRNA-20a and miRNA-223. The enzyme-free LCHA strategy leverages two hairpin probes (Hp1/Hp2) anchored on a DNA tetrahedron framework, where spatial confinement enhances reaction kinetics by elevating local probe concentrations. Hp2 is dual-labeled with 6-FAM and BHQ-1 for fluorescence quenching control. Target miRNA initiates a cascade reaction through magnetic bead-conjugated capture probes (MBCP): miRNA binding triggers structural unfolding of Hp1 on DTP, which subsequently activates Hp2 to separate 6-FAM from BHQ-1, restoring detectable fluorescence. The self-recycling amplification is achieved <i>via</i> trigger release from MBCP. Magnetic separation replaces capillary electrophoresis, while microfluidic mixing intensifies LCHA efficiency. Demonstrating high specificity, the assay achieves detection limits of 3.96 fmol (miR-20a) and 3.75 fmol (miR-223). The modular design, synergizing spatial confinement and magnetic manipulation, not only offers a robust NSCLC diagnostic tool but also holds adaptability for detecting other disease-related miRNAs through customizable probe engineering.

40227708	The use of adapted motorized vehicles with controlled acceleration: Focus on child's acceptance.	Mobility is essential for the development of children with disabilities. The Adapt Project uses motorized adapted cars to promote independent movement and positively impact child development. To evaluate whether the perception of acceleration influences children's initial adaptation to the device. This case study involved an initial intervention and a three-month follow-up after delivering the adapted car. First, the child was evaluated using the car without and with acceleration control, assessed with the FLACC and ALP scales. Second, follow-up sessions were conducted with active maternal participation. Third, qualitative interviews were conducted, and the QUEST 2.0 scale was applied to assess satisfaction. Rapid acceleration movements increased pain perception, while slow movements minimized discomfort. The child progressed from level 1 to levels 3 and 4 on the ALP scale, and the QUEST 2.0 scale demonstrated high satisfaction (4.91), highlighting safety, comfort, and technical support, after 3 months of usage. Adaptations to the device and family engagement were essential for device acceptance and motor-cognitive development. Acceleration control improved comfort and safety, enabling greater autonomy and interaction, emphasizing the importance of user-centered approaches in assistive technologies.

40227702	Oral supplementation with Sucrosomial® Iron improves the iron status of preterm piglets delivered by cesarean section.	Premature infants are more likely to develop iron deficiency caused by an inadequate iron storage due to shortened pregnancy. Sucrosomial® Iron (SI) is an oral iron formulation of ferric pyrophosphate with high bioavailability and tolerability. This research compared the iron status of preterm and full-term piglets and evaluated the effects of SI on iron homeostasis in the early postnatal period. Eighteen preterm piglets (born <i>via</i> cesarean section on gestation day 109) and twelve full-term piglets (natural birth) were divided into five groups (<i>n</i> = 6 piglets per group): full-term/preterm piglets without iron supplementation, full-term/preterm piglets supplemented with SI (2 mg Fe per piglet per day, days 4-10), and preterm piglets supplemented with ferrous sulfate (2 mg Fe per piglet per day, days 4-10). Samples were collected on day 11. Preterm piglets showed poor growth and low total body iron content, and they developed iron deficiency anemia, as indicated by decreased red blood cell indices and plasma iron parameters. The iron deficiency was partially improved by SI supplementation. Interestingly, higher hepatic and splenic non-heme iron content, accompanied by increased tissue and plasma ferritin, were found in preterm piglets compared to full-term piglets. SI also contributed to tissue iron accumulation in preterm piglets. Functional iron deficiency and iron accumulation in tissues make the regulation of iron metabolism in preterm piglets different from that in full-term ones. SI can alleviate the negative effects of iron imbalances caused by premature birth by regulating the hepcidin-ferroportin axis. In addition, SI did not induce inflammatory or oxidative responses, and its effects are comparable to those of the classic iron supplement, ferrous sulfate. These results indicate that SI is a promising iron supplement for improving the iron status of premature infants.

40227670	Sake lees extract obtained using a novel continuous phase-transition extraction method: evaluation of its bioactive composition, anti-aging efficacy and mechanism.	For the high-value utilization of sake lees (SL), it is essential to explore its potential as a resource for anti-aging bioactives. However, the efficient extraction of SL, the compositional benefits provided, and the resulting anti-aging efficacy <i>in vivo</i> remain to be explored. Thus, a novel continuous phase-transition extraction (CPE) method, an amino acid analyzer, LC-MS, and GC-MS, as well as a classic anti-aging model of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) were adopted. The results showed that compared to ultrasound-assisted extraction, the total amino acid content of SL extract (SLE) obtained using 80% ethanol in CPE increased by 39.64%, with a notable enhancement in the <i>in vitro</i> scavenging ability of free radicals (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In SLE, the hydrophobic, acidic, and basic amino acids with antioxidant activity accounted for 77.11% of total amino acids. New potential anti-aging compounds were identified, including Lys-Gln, Leu-Arg-Lys, and sphinganine. In particular, 4 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> SLE not only promoted a 19.32% increase in the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i> by enhancing oxidative stress and neuroprotective effects but also ameliorated age-related phenotypes like motoricity and age pigment. Further exploration revealed that the efficacy of SLE is mediated by SKN-1/Nrf2 and HSF-1 pathways, which can be confirmed by the upregulation of key genes, such as <i>skn-1</i> and <i>hsf-1</i>, especially by inducing a 72.73% increase in nuclear transfer of the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2. Taken together, SLE obtained by CPE was abundant in bioactives and contains novel components, thus exerting prominent anti-aging effects <i>in vivo</i>. This study provides a new way to obtain anti-aging active substances efficiently, which is beneficial for application in the fields of health foods and cosmetics.

40227648	Dynamic Prediction of Drug-Target Interactions via Cross-Modal Feature Mapping with Learnable Association Information.	Predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is essential for advancing drug discovery and personalized medicine. However, accurately capturing the intricate binding relationships between drugs and targets remains a significant challenge, particularly when attempting to fully leverage the vast correlation information inherent in molecular data. This complexity is further exacerbated by the structural differences and sequence length disparities between drug molecules and protein targets, which can hinder effective feature alignment and interaction modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a model named LAM-DTI. First, drug and target features are extracted from the original molecular sequence data using a multilayer convolutional neural network. To address the sequence length discrepancy between drug and target features, we apply a connectionist temporal classification module to generate normalized feature sequences. Building on this, we introduce a learnable association information matrix as a flexible intermediary, which dynamically adjusts to capture accurate DTI association information, thereby enhancing cross-modal mapping within a unified latent space. This progressive mapping strategy enables the model to form an interaction projection between drugs and targets, effectively identifying critical interaction regions and guiding the capture of complex interaction-related features. Extensive experiments on three well-known benchmark data sets demonstrate that LAM-DTI significantly outperforms previous models.
40227643	Conversion to Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease Dementia Related to Apathy, <i>APOE</i> Genotype and Antidepressant Use.	ObjectiveApathy and <i>APOE</i> ε4 genotype are risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). Antidepressant use is known to induce apathy. This study aimed to examine associations between <i>APOE</i> ε4, apathy, and antidepressant use with progression from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairments (MCI), and MCI to ADD.MethodsParticipants aged 55-90 were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants were CN or had MCI at baseline and had completed at least 3 consecutive study visits. The NPI and NPI-Q apathy subscales were used to index the presence of apathy. Antidepressants used by participants included SSRIs, SNRIs, and AYTADs. Cox proportional hazards analyses examined the combined effects of apathy, <i>APOE</i> ε4 genotype, and antidepressant use on conversion from CN to MCI and from MCI to ADD.ResultsApathy and <i>APOE</i> ε4 were associated with increased risk of conversion along the CN-MCI-ADD continuum. Antidepressant use was associated with progression from MCI to ADD, and progression from CN to MCI in non-apathetic <i>APOE</i> ε4 carriers.ConclusionOur findings support apathy and <i>APOE</i> ε4 as robust predictors of conversion to MCI and ADD, and demonstrate novel associations between antidepressant use and conversion. Future research should explore whether antidepressant use in MCI and ADD causes apathetic symptoms or serves to index apathy/depression severity.
40227623	Controlled release mechanism of drugs from onion-like dendrimersomes: insight from dissipative particle dynamics simulations.	Compared with current lipid nanoparticle delivery systems, a new drug delivery system that can simultaneously achieve high stability toward temperature and time, and controllable release of drugs will be smart and next-generation. However, designing such systems for the complex human body environment remains a daunting challenge. Herein, we use highly stable multilayer dendrimersomes as a model to study the mechanism of controlled release of drugs through stimulus-response by dissipative particle dynamics simulations. The results show that when the dendrimersomes remain intact, the release of encapsulated hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and neutral drugs is minimal. Once the amphiphilic dendrimers in the dendrimersomes are decomposed beyond a threshold by cleaving the linkers connecting hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments, which can be achieved by exogenous perturbations, a significant or complete release of the drugs occurs. The introduction of liquid flow will remarkably enhance the release capability of drugs in decomposed dendrimersomes. These insights into the controlled release of drugs at the microscopic level offer helpful guidance for the development of advanced drug delivery vehicles.
40227609	The Role of ETS2 in Macrophage Inflammation.	Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are rising globally yet widely effective therapies remain elusive. Most treatments have limited efficacy, significant potential side effects, or eventually lose response, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. We recently discovered that ETS2, a transcription factor, functions as a master regulator of macrophage-driven inflammation-and is causally linked to the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory diseases via human genetics. The pleotropic inflammatory effects of ETS2 included upregulation of many cytokines that are individually targeted by current disease therapies, including TNFα, IL-23, IL1β, and TNF-like ligand 1A signaling. With the move toward combination treatment-to maximize efficacy-targeting ETS2 presents a unique opportunity to potentially induce a broad therapeutic effect. However, there will be multiple challenges to overcome since direct ETS2 inhibition is unlikely to be feasible. Here, we discuss these challenges and other unanswered questions about the central role that ETS2 plays in macrophage inflammation.
40227581	Development of Poly(ether sulfone)/Poly(vinyl alcohol)/Magnesium-Doped Carbon Quantum Dot Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering.	Bone tissue engineering plays a critical role in overcoming the limitations of traditional bone grafts and implants by enhancing bone integration and regeneration. In this study, we developed a novel membrane scaffold comprising poly(ether sulfone) (PES), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and magnesium-doped carbon quantum dots (CQDs.Mg) for potential bone tissue engineering applications. Four distinct scaffold formulations (PE-CM0, PE-CM2, PE-CM3, and PE-CM4) were developed using a film applicator machine. The morphology and porosity of the scaffolds, characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), revealed increased porosity with higher CQDs.Mg content. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the successful integration of functional groups from each component. Water contact angle (WCA) measurements indicated improved hydrophilicity with the addition of CQDs.Mg, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. Mechanical testing demonstrated that the scaffolds maintained adequate tensile strength and flexibility, with PE-CM3 and PE-CM4 exhibiting superior properties. Swelling assays indicated enhanced water absorption with increased CQDs.Mg content, while 14-day degradation studies showed excellent structural stability. Biocompatibility was also assessed using L929 and NIH3T3 cell lines, with cytotoxicity assays demonstrating nearly 100% cell viability across all samples. These findings suggest that the PES/PVA/CQDs.Mg scaffolds exhibit a promising combination of mechanical robustness, hydrophilicity, and biocompatibility, making them strong candidates for bone tissue engineering applications.

40227571	Pupil and Eye Blink Response Abnormalities During Emotional Conflict Processing in Late-Life Depression.	IntroductionThis study aims to investigate the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system (LC-NE) function in late-life depression (LLD) patients by examining task-evoked pupil dilation in the emotional face-word Stroop task, given the recently established coupling between task-evoked pupil dilation and LC-NE activation.Materials and MethodsUsing video-based eye-tracking and principal component analysis, we explored task-evoked pupil responses and eye blinks in LLD patients (N = 25) and older healthy controls (CTRL) (N = 29) to determine whether there were alterations in pupil responses and eye blinks in LLD compared to CTRL.ResultsLLD patients exhibited significantly different pupil and eye-blink behavior compared to CTRL, with dampened task-evoked pupil dilation associated with emotional congruency and valence processing mediated by the sympathetic system compared to CTRL. Eye-blink rates associated with emotional valence were also altered in LLD compared to CTRL Moreover, Geriatric Depression Scale-15 scores in LLD correlated with emotional congruency effects revealed by task-evoked pupil dilation.ConclusionThe findings demonstrate that LLD patients display altered pupil behavior compared to CTRL. These altered responses correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms, indicating their potential as objective biomarkers for use in large at-risk populations for LLD.
40227567	Power mobility driving assessments used in research with adults in residential care: A scoping review.	Powered mobility devices (PMD) are an alternative form of functional mobility commonly used in residential care settings. Several PMD assessments exist and are used to assess an individual's safety and independence with functional mobility using a PMD. However, little is known regarding what PMD assessments are most commonly used in residential care. This scoping review aimed to investigate power mobility driving assessments utilized most in residential care settings for adult PMD users. Fourteen articles met the criteria for analysis, which included nine different assessments that assess PMD use in residential care. Of the articles included in the analysis of PMD assessments in residential care settings, the most consistently used assessment was the Power-mobility Indoor Driving Assessment (PIDA; <i>n</i> = 9, 64.28%). Only two other assessments were used in more than one research study: The Wheelchair Skills Test Questionnaire (WST-Q; <i>n</i> = 4, 28.57%), and the Nursing Home Life-Space Diameter (NHLSD; <i>n</i> = 2, 14.29%). Overall, the scoping review concludes that the PIDA is the most common PMD assessment used in research in residential care settings.
40227565	Passive Hindlimb Cycling Enhances Tolerance of Cardiac Electrical Conduction in Rats with Spinal Cord Injuries.	High-level spinal cord injury (SCI) often disrupts supraspinal control of sympathetic input to the heart. The resulting imbalance in the autonomic nervous system increases the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias. It was previously demonstrated that passive hindlimb cycling (PHLC) effectively maintains or improves bodily function including cardiovascular performance following SCI. However, it remains unclear whether the exercise can affect cardiac electrical disorders. To address this specific question, we complemented a complete SCI at a high-thoracic level in rats and then performed PHLC for 5 or 10 weeks. Naive rats or those receiving injury alone served as controls. Subsequently, a telemetric transmitter was implanted to record blood pressure and electrocardiogram. In 24-h resting recordings, cycling training did not influence SCI-induced hypotension but significantly reduced the events of spontaneous autonomic dysreflexia. When colorectal distension was employed to artificially trigger autonomic dysreflexia, a fewer number of severe arrhythmias (e.g., atrioventricular block, premature ventricular contraction single, and sinus pause) were found in animals with 10-week PHLC compared with injury controls. As a stress test, a series of increasing concentrations of dobutamine was administered to stimulate cardiac sympathetic activity. Consequently, various types of arrhythmias occurred in animals with SCI alone, whereas very few were detected in animals obtaining exercise training for 10 weeks. Furthermore, pharmacological intervention disclosed that exercise appeared to reduce unopposed parasympathetic tone that arose post to injury. Thus, the results suggest that activity-based training for the long term improves autonomic balance to enhance tolerance of cardiac electrical conduction following SCI.

40227562	Protective Effects of Melatonin and Bee Pollen on Hematotoxicity and Hepatorenal Toxicity Induced by Long-Term Intake of Gabapentin in Female Albino Rats.	Gabapentin (GBN) is an anti-seizure medication that is also used to treat nerve pain and other diseases. However, its misuse is currently a growing worry, as it may pose a significant health danger. The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of melatonin (MEL) and bee pollen (BP) as antioxidants against GBN-induced hematotoxicity and hepatorenal toxicity in female Albino rats. In this study, fifty-six adult female albino rats were divided into seven groups (n = 8 each), served as control, GBN, MEL, BP, MEL + GBN, BP + GBN, and MEL + BP + GBN treated groups. Results showed that oral administration of GBN resulted in a hematological toxicity as confirmed by a significant reduction in RBCs, Hb concentration, Ht%, MCV, MCH, platelets as well as altering of leukocyte profiles, WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. The biochemical results of liver and kidney functions showed a significant decrease in serum glucose, total protein, triglycerides, urea and uric acid. However, a significant increase in albumin, cholesterol, creatinine as well as ALP, AST, and ALT liver enzymes compared to the control was found. The oral administration of MEL and BP 12 h before GBN mostly ameliorates the altered hematological and biochemical parameters as well as hepatic and renal histopathological architecture to normal levels. In conclusion, Pre-treatment with MEL and BP, individually or together provided protection against the GBN induced changes in the blood parameters as well as hepatorenal structure and function.
40227561	Morphine Contributes to Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells by Blocking COX-2 Methylation via Regulating the miR-23a-3p/DNMT3A Feedback.	To investigate the effects and mechanisms of morphine on epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The levels of miR-23a-3p, DNMT3A, and COX-2 in tumor tissues from metastatic TNBC patients treated with morphine were assessed using qRT-PCR. Functional assays assessed morphine's impact on TNBC cell malignancy. Dual luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays investigated the interaction between miR-23a-3p and DNMT3A. miR-23a-3p inhibitor and DNMT3A siRNA were transfected into TNBC cells. Protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. Methylation status of miR-23a-3p and COX-2 was assessed via methylation-specific PCR. Rescue experiments were performed to research whether morphine modulates EMT in TNBC through COX-2 methylation regulation via the miR-23a-3p/DNMT3A feedback loop. The effects of morphine on TNBC in nude mice xenotransplantation were studied. In metastatic TNBC patients treated with morphine, miR-23a-3p and COX-2 expression were elevated, and DNMT3A levels were reduced. In TNBC cells, morphine enhanced migration, invasion, and EMT, and suppressed apoptosis. It upregulated miR-23a-3p and COX-2; downregulated DNMT3A; and inhibited methylation of miR-23a-3p and COX-2. miR-23a-3p directly inhibited DNMT3A expression. In morphine-treated TNBC cells, silencing DNMT3A reduced methylation of miR-23a-3p and COX-2. miR-23a-3p inhibitor suppressed migration, invasion, and EMT, and promoted apoptosis; however, these effects were reversed by DNMT3A silencing. In vivo, morphine promoted tumor EMT and metastasis in TNBC; reduced miR-23a-3p and COX-2 methylation; and decreased DNMT3A expression. Morphine accelerated EMT in TNBC by inhibiting COX-2 methylation through the miR-23a-3p/DNMT3A loop.

40227559	Radon-thoron exhalation and emanation determinations from mylonitic rock samples collected in north Abu Rusheid, Egypt.	Mylonitic rocks in north Abu Rusheid, Egypt, contain naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs), making them potential sources of indoor radon (Rn) and thoron (Tn) exposure when used as building materials. Furthermore, they pose occupational exposure risks for miners. Rn mass exhalation rate (RnEX), Tn mass exhalation rate (TnEX), Rn emanation fraction (RnEM), and Tn emanation fraction (TnEM) were evaluated simultaneously in 27 mylonitic rock samples collected from three trenches (TCHA, TCHB, and TCHC) in the area. The powder sandwich technique has been carried out using a RAD7 detector to assess RnEX and TnEX. Additionally, gamma spectroscopy was used to evaluate RnEM and TnEM parameters. The RnEX and TnEX values varied from 0.10 to 1.13 and 83 to 5757 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, while the RnEM and TnEM values ranged from 0.055 to 0.182 and 0.017 to 0.078, respectively. The activity concentrations of <sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>232</sup>Th varied from 127 to 1524 and 96 to 2420 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and the mean values exceeded the worldwide average values of 33 and 45 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Positive correlations between <sup>226</sup>Ra and RnEX, and <sup>232</sup>Th and TnEX were observed among the trenches. However, no systematic relations were identified between <sup>226</sup>Ra and RnEM, <sup>232</sup>Th and TnEM, or <sup>226</sup>Ra and <sup>232</sup>Th, which could be attributed to geological factors. The findings of this study highlighted the potential radiation hazards associated with mylonitic rock use in construction and mining, emphasizing the need for radioprotection measures.

The 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) was licensed for prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants and children on the basis of immunogenicity compared with PCV13. We aimed to evaluate PCV20 immunogenicity compared with PCV10 (Synflorix; PhiD-CV) because both vaccines demonstrated lower immunogenicity than PCV13. Nevertheless, PCV10 was highly effective against vaccine-serotype pneumococcal disease in post-licensure studies. Since no study has directly compared PCV20 versus PCV10, we conducted an indirect comparison.

40227556	Glioma-derived SPARCL1 promotes the formation of peritumoral neuron-glioma synapses.	Gliomas are the most common type of primary malignant brain tumor with high degree of malignancy and rapid progression, and patients often have complications such as epilepsy and cognitive impairment. Thus, identifying related therapeutic targets, prolonging patient survival time and improving patient quality of life are urgently needed. Recent studies have shown that glutamatergic neurons around tumors and glioma cells form synapses, neuron-glioma synapses (NGSs), which have electrophysiological properties and participate in the proliferation, infiltration and invasion of tumors. Therefore, we aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying NGS formation.

40227553	Targeting Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) for DNA repair mechanism through QSAR-based virtual screening and MD simulation.	Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a key enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, crucial for maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA breaks. In cancers with mutations in DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, PARP-1 activity becomes essential for tumor cell survival, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention. This study employs QSAR modeling, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify potential PARP-1 inhibitors. A dataset of inhibitors was analyzed using 12 molecular fingerprint descriptors to develop robust QSAR models, with the optimal model based on the CDK descriptor achieving R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96, Q<sup>2</sup>_CV = 0.78, and Q<sup>2</sup>_Ext = 0.80. The model was applied to virtually screen three chemical libraries-ZINC, FDA, and NPA-identifying promising candidates for PARP-1 inhibition. Molecular docking revealed that compounds ZINC13132446, Z2037280227, and NPC193377 have strong binding affinity for the PARP-1 active site. MD simulations and MM-PBSA confirmed the stability of these complexes, with Z2037280227 and NPC193377 exhibiting the most stable interactions. These results underscore the potential of targeting PARP-1 as a therapeutic strategy for cancers with homologous recombination deficiencies, including prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer, particularly in patients with DNA repair deficiencies.
40227552	Emotional Prosody Recognition in Autism Spectrum Disorder Without Intellectual Disability: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Emotional prosody recognition is vital for social interaction and has become a key focus in autism research. However, findings regarding emotional prosody recognition in individuals with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability (ASD-without-ID) remain inconsistent. This study aims to address this inconsistency through a systematic review and meta-analysis, exploring potential factors that may account for the inconsistent results. A search across four major electronic databases identified 29 eligible studies comparing emotional prosody recognition in ASD-without-ID and typically developing (TD) participants. We identified several participant- and methodology-related moderators across these studies. Using a random-effects model, we found a moderate-to-large pooled effect (Hedges' g = - 0.65) for emotional prosody recognition in ASD-without-ID participants, which remained stable after adjusting for publication bias through the trim-and-fill method. Emotional complexity and participant age significantly moderated the heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies. The results indicate moderate differences in the recognition of basic emotions through prosody between individuals with ASD-without-ID and TD individuals, with more pronounced differences for complex emotions. The findings emphasize the distinct developmental trajectories of ASD-without-ID individuals. We highlight the need for further investigation into the underlying factors and mechanisms affecting emotional prosody recognition in this population, including meta-analyses examining the moderate effects of various IQ measures and studies involving speakers of tonal languages.

40227543	Glycerophospholipid and Sphingosine- 1-phosphate Metabolism in Cardiovascular Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.	Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, driven by factors such as dysregulated lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Recent studies highlight the critical roles of both glycerophospholipid and sphingosine- 1-phosphate metabolism in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders. However, the contributions of glycerophospholipid-derived metabolites remain underappreciated. Glycerophospholipid metabolism generates bioactive molecules that contribute to endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation, and cardiac cell injury while also modulating inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Meanwhile, sphingosine- 1-phosphate is a bioactive lipid mediator that regulates vascular integrity, inflammation, and cardiac remodeling through its G-protein-coupled receptors. The convergence of these pathways presents novel therapeutic opportunities, where dietary interventions such as omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and pharmacological targeting of sphingosine- 1-phosphate receptors could synergistically mitigate cardiovascular risk. This review underscores the need for further investigation into the interplay between glycerophospholipid metabolism and sphingosine- 1-phosphate signaling to advance targeted therapies for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease.
40227542	Structural analysis of anti-cancer drug compounds using distance-based molecular descriptors and regression models.	Molecular descriptors encapsulate the key structural information of molecules, which is crucial for elucidating molecular behaviors. They have proven invaluable in quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) analysis. Such studies involve rigorous scientific investigations into the relationship between molecular structure and diverse physicochemical properties, revealing the underlying principles governing structure-property correlations. This facilitates predictive modeling and rational design across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Cancer is a lethal disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. This study aims to develop regression models for predicting physicochemical properties of novel anti-cancer drugs targeting blood and skin cancers. Utilizing distance-based indices, we construct models based on the structural properties of drug compounds. Comparative analysis with existing QSPR models employing degree and reverse degree parameters demonstrates significantly enhanced predictive capabilities of our proposed models.

This work aimed to design and validate a GIQoL.
40227536	Healthcare Professionals and Unregulated Commercial Surrogacy in China: Ethical and Legal Challenges.	Recent reports from 2023 and 2024 have brought to light alarming instances of healthcare professionals in China being involved in commercial surrogacy arrangements. These cases reveal the dual roles these professionals play: active facilitation, which includes actions such as selling fraudulent birth certificates that contribute to baby trafficking, and passive involvement, where routine medical care is provided to surrogate mothers without full awareness of the surrogacy context. Current regulations in China broadly prohibit surrogacy-related medical activities but fail to differentiate between healthcare professionals who actively facilitate surrogacy arrangements and those who fulfil their professional obligations to patients. Drawing on professional ethics outlined in the revised 2021 Medical Practitioners Law of the People's Republic of China and recent developments in modern slavery scholarship that emphasize the critical role of healthcare professionals in identifying and preventing exploitation, this paper argues that China has an opportunity to clarify and broaden the role of healthcare professionals in the context of surrogacy. Healthcare professionals should not be prohibited from providing medical care to surrogate mothers, provided they are not actively facilitating surrogacy arrangements. Simultaneously, they should be empowered to act as gatekeepers against exploitation. This would be an important step toward enhancing the current regulatory framework, ensuring better protections for children and women involved in surrogacy.

Additionally, TTFields can increase blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, further supporting their application in CNS malignancies. This review aims to summarize the advances and mechanisms of TTFields in CNS tumor treatment while addressing its current limitations and challenges.
40227533	A Comparative Study of Diamond Nucleic Acid Dye and SYBR Green I in Detecting Plasmodium falciparum.	Plasmodium falciparum detection to ensure complete elimination is an important task that many countries still have to accomplish. The elimination requires constant strategic efforts and mass testing of drugs in the laboratories. Antimalarial investigations in in-vitro conditions rely on enzymatic assays and nucleic acid determination by SYBR™ Green I dye-based fluorescence assay. SYBR™ Green I dye is currently used by many laboratories, but it is expensive. In this study, an effort was made to use a cost-effective Diamond™ nucleic acid dye to determine IC<sub>50</sub> values of the antimalarial standard drugs with the comparative analysis with SYBR™ Green I dye. The study suggested that the IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained from the two dyes were comparable and concentration-dependent with all the standard antimalarial drugs. Further, the investigation also revealed that the sensitivity of the standard dye concentration is respective to the percentage of parasitemia at different stages of the parasites. The study revealed that diamond nucleic acid dye can be used as an alternate dye for in-vitro investigations of antimalarial drugs for checking malaria parasite growth at a very low cost. The study suggests diamond nucleic acid dye can be used in in-vitro assays to investigate and determine the growth of Plasmodium parasites.

40227529	100% Conversion of CO<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub> with Non-Precious Co@ZnO Catalyst in Hot Water.	The combination of solar energy and natural hydrothermal systems will innovate the chemistry of CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation; however, the approach remains challenging due to the lack of robust and cost-effective catalytic system. Here, Zn which can be recycled with solar energy-induced approach was chosen as the reductant and Co as catalyst to achieve robust hydrothermal CO<sub>2</sub> methanation. Nanosheets of honeycomb ZnO were grown in situ on the Co surface, resulting in a new motif (Co@ZnO catalyst) that inhibits Co deactivation through ZnO-assisted CoO<sub>x</sub> reduction. The stabilized Co and interaction between Co and ZnO functioned collaboratively toward the full conversion of CO<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>4</sub>. In situ hydrothermal infrared spectroscopy confirmed the formation of formic acid as an intermediate, thereby avoiding CO formation and unwanted side reaction pathways. This study presents a straightforward one-step process for both highly efficient CO<sub>2</sub> conversion and catalyst synthesis, paving the way for solar-driven CO<sub>2</sub> methanation.

40227526	What do users in a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) forum think about the treatments they tried: Analysing treatment sentiment using machine learning.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogenous condition that is estimated to effect up to 21% of reproductive aged people with ovaries. In previous work, a dataset of PCOS features was derived from approximately 100,000 PCOS subreddit users via machine learning. In this study, an exploration of treatment response within the PCOS subreddit was undertaken with the derived dataset. The treatment or symptom features in the dataset had sentiment labels indicating when a treatment was perceived to improve or worsen a condition or symptom. When different features were mentioned within two sentences of each other without conflicting sentiment, it could be assumed that they were related. This assumption allowed for a broad analysis of the perceived effect of popular treatments on the most frequently mentioned symptoms. In general, lifestyle changes and supplements were the most positively regarded, while contraceptives were frequently associated with considerable negative sentiment. For PCOS weight loss, unspecified dieting (RR 5.19, 95% CI 3.28-8.19, n = 99) and intermittent fasting (RR 33.50, 95% CI 8.54-131.34, n = 69) were the most successful interventions. Inositol was associated with a large range of favourable outcomes and was one of the few treatments associated with improved mental health [depression (RR 4.25, 95% CI 1.72-10.51, n = 21), anxiety (RR 5.83, 95% CI 2.76-12.35, n = 41) and mood issues (RR 25.00, 95% CI 3.65-171.10, n = 26)]. Combined oral contraceptive pills as a whole were strongly associated with adverse effects such as worsening depression (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.25, n = 33), anxiety (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.36, n = 23), fatigue (RR 0, n = 45) and low libido (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.24, n = 30). However, combined contraceptives with anti-androgenic progestins were associated with more favourable experiences. This study demonstrates the utility of machine learning to derive measurable patient experience data from an internet forum. While patient experience data derived using machine learning is not a substitute for traditional clinical trials, it is useful for mass validation and hypothesis generation. This paper may serve as the first exploration into this category of clinical internet forum research.
40227525	Integrating Hard Silicon for High-Performance Soft Electronics via Geometry Engineering.	Soft electronics, which are designed to function under mechanical deformation (such as bending, stretching, and folding), have become essential in applications like wearable electronics, artificial skin, and brain-machine interfaces. Crystalline silicon is one of the most mature and reliable materials for high-performance electronics; however, its intrinsic brittleness and rigidity pose challenges for integrating it into soft electronics. Recent research has focused on overcoming these limitations by utilizing structural design techniques to impart flexibility and stretchability to Si-based materials, such as transforming them into thin nanomembranes or nanowires. This review summarizes key strategies in geometry engineering for integrating crystalline silicon into soft electronics, from the use of hard silicon islands to creating out-of-plane foldable silicon nanofilms on flexible substrates, and ultimately to shaping silicon nanowires using vapor-liquid-solid or in-plane solid-liquid-solid techniques. We explore the latest developments in Si-based soft electronic devices, with applications in sensors, nanoprobes, robotics, and brain-machine interfaces. Finally, the paper discusses the current challenges in the field and outlines future research directions to enable the widespread adoption of silicon-based flexible electronics.

40227523	Investigation impact of (Ni, Cu) co-doping on the electronic, optical, magnetic, and I-V characteristics of GaP nanosheets.	The impact of the combination of transition metals on the electronic, optical, magnetic, and I-V characteristics of GaP nanosheet was carried out by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) with nonequilibrium green's function calculations. The band energy results of the GaP structure showed a semiconductor feature with a direct band gap of 1.29 eV. The electronic structures and the density of Ni- and Cu-doped states and (Ni-Cu) co-doped GaP were investigated. It exhibited that the impurity states are crucial in their impact on modifying the electronic properties of the system as the electron transfer rate can be enhanced. On the other hand, a pristine and Cu-doped GaP nanosheet represents a nonmagnetic semiconductor due to the polarized DOS in both spins' directions displaying similarity. At the same time, the polarized DOS of Ni-doped GaP nanosheet displays a ferromagnetic phase. For (Ni-Cu) Co-doped GaP nanosheet, the resulting material shows the total density of states for both spin states is different and implies the presence of magnetic moments. The optical results showed that the Cu-doped GaP displays a shift in the absorption edge compared to pristine GaP. Also, the co-doped system displays a smoother absorption spectrum with reduced intensity in the peak region, indicating a combined effect of both dopants. The Ni-doped GaP displays the highest conductivity with the current reaching around ± 100,000 nA. This suggests that Ni has a more significant effect in enhancing charge transport.

40227520	Semaglutide Plus Metformin Versus Metformin Alone For Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain In Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.	To determine whether combination therapy (semaglutide + metformin) is more efficacious than monotherapy (metformin alone) in reducing the risk of antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This was a single-center, retrospective study evaluating patients ≥ 18 years of age receiving care at Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MEDVAMC) from January 2021 to December 2022. Subjects were identified by use of antipsychotic (quetiapine, risperidone, paliperidone, olanzapine, clozapine) with concomitant use of monotherapy or combination therapy. Key exclusion criteria included other medications impacting weight, unstable medical illness, active substance use disorder, and dual antipsychotic use. The primary endpoint was defined as weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline. Secondary outcomes included BMI % difference and HbA1c difference from baseline. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. 31 patients were evaluated in each group for the final analysis. 38.7% (12/31) of patients in the monotherapy group achieved the primary outcome of weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline vs. 61.29% (19/31) in the combination group (p = 0.04). For secondary outcomes, the BMI % difference from baseline in the monotherapy group was -3.88% vs. -5.58% in the combination group (p = 0.129). The monotherapy group had a difference in HbA1c % from baseline of 0.14% vs -0.9% in the combination group (p = 0.007). Among T2DM patients on antipsychotics, more patients in the combination group achieved weight loss ≥ 5% within the study period compared to metformin monotherapy. Future research should account for non-diabetic patients, assess lifestyle factors, and exclude other psychotropic medications that may affect weight.

40227518	lncRNA PAN3-AS1 Modulates Cilium Assemble Signaling Pathway Through Regulation of RPGR as a Potential MS Diagnostic Biomarker: Integrated Systems Biology Investigation.	Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune condition of the central nervous system (CNS), can lead to demyelination and axonal degeneration in the brain and spinal cord, which can cause progressive neurologic disability. MS symptoms include dysautonomia and progressive decline in motor abilities. In this investigation, we performed an integrated bioinformatics and experimental approach to find the expression level and interaction of a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), PAN3-AS1, in MS samples. Microarray analysis was performed by R Studio using GEOquery and limma packages. lncRNA-mRNA RNA interaction analysis was performed using the lncRRIsearch database. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by KEGG and Reactome online software through the Enrichr database. Protein-protein interaction analysis was performed by STRING online software. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed by Enrichr database. Based on microarray analysis, lncRNA PAN3-AS1 has a significantly low expression in MS samples compared to the control (logFC - 1.2, adj. P. Val 0.03). qRT-PCR results approved bioinformatics analyses. ROC analysis revealed that PAN3-AS1 could be considered a potential diagnostic biomarker of MS. Based on lncRNA-mRNA interaction analysis, lncRNA PAN3-AS1 regulates the expression level of RPGR. RPGR and its protein interactome regulate the cilium assembly, chaperon-mediated autophagy, and microarray biogenesis. lncRNA PAN3-AS1, as a significant low-expressed lncRNA in MS samples, could be a potential diagnostic MS biomarker. PAN3-AS1 might regulate the expression level of cilium assembly and chaperon-mediated autophagy. Dysregulation of PAN3-AS1 might affect the expression of RPGR and its protein interactome.
40227517	A flexible Bayesian g-formula for causal survival analyses with time-dependent confounding.	In longitudinal observational studies with time-to-event outcomes, a common objective in causal analysis is to estimate the causal survival curve under hypothetical intervention scenarios. The g-formula is a useful tool for this analysis. To enhance the traditional parametric g-formula, we developed an alternative g-formula estimator, which incorporates the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees into the modeling of the time-evolving generative components, aiming to mitigate the bias due to model misspecification. We focus on binary time-varying treatments and introduce a general class of g-formulas for discrete survival data that can incorporate longitudinal balancing scores. The minimum sufficient formulation of these longitudinal balancing scores is linked to the nature of treatment strategies, i.e., static or dynamic. For each type of treatment strategy, we provide posterior sampling algorithms. We conducted simulations to illustrate the empirical performance of the proposed method and demonstrate its practical utility using data from the Yale New Haven Health System's electronic health records.
40227516	Effects of photobiostimulation and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy associated with gingival grafts for root coverage: three-arm randomized clinical trial.	To compare the effects of different laser therapies as adjuncts to root coverage of multiple gingival recessions (MGR) through a three-arm parallel study. Fifty-four patients with MGR underwent standardized treatment with subepithelial connective tissue graft of 1 mm. The patients were divided into three groups: control group (C)-scaling only + sham (n = 18), antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) group (n = 18): toluidine blue O 10 mg/ml acidic pH + InAlGaP laser 660 nm; 100 mW, 2.32 W/cm<sup>2</sup>; 3 J, 30 s/tooth, (23 J/cm<sup>2</sup>/point), and photobiostimulation therapy (PBM) group (n = 18): InAlGaP laser 660 nm; 100 mW, 2.32 W/cm<sup>2</sup>; 7 J, 70 s/flap, 161 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (23 J/cm<sup>2</sup>/point), a total of eight applications, each 48 h, within a 14-day period. Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), and quality of life questionnaires (OHIP- 14) were collected up to 12 months. A total of 180 gingival recessions were treated, with the PBM group exhibiting superior outcomes in terms of complete root coverage (CRC) at 6 and 12 months. Complementary clinical outcomes showed no significant differences among groups. The PBM group achieved the highest frequency of completely covered teeth (100%) at six months, compared to the other groups (p: 0.021 PBM vs. APDT and p: < 0.001 PBM vs. C). Despite the study's limitations, the PBM group exhibited more favorable outcomes in CRC and demonstrated superior results in PROMs. The findings suggest that PBM may have contributed to accelerating root coverage outcomes, with positive effects observed as early as 3 months postoperatively and the results were sustained at 6 and 12 months. NCT03462368.
40227515	Muscle-Inspired Anisotropic Aramid Nanofibers Aerogel Exhibiting High-Efficiency Thermoelectric Conversion and Precise Temperature Monitoring for Firefighting Clothing.	Enhancing the firefighting protective clothing with exceptional thermal barrier and temperature sensing functions to ensure high fire safety for firefighters has long been anticipated, but it remains a major challenge. Herein, inspired by the human muscle, an anisotropic fire safety aerogel (ACMCA) with precise self-actuated temperature monitoring performance is developed by combining aramid nanofibers with eicosane/MXene to form an anisotropically oriented conductive network. By combining the two synergies of the negative temperature-dependent thermal conductive eicosane, which induces a high-temperature differential, and directionally ordered MXene that establishes a conductive network along the directional freezing direction. The resultant ACMCA exhibited remarkable thermoelectric properties, with S values reaching 46.78 μV K<sup>-1</sup> and κ values as low as 0.048 W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> at room temperature. Moreover, the prepared anisotropic aerogel ACMCA exhibited electrical responsiveness to temperature variations, facilitating its application in intelligent temperature monitoring systems. The designed anisotropic aerogel ACMCA could be incorporated into the firefighting clothing as a thermal barrier layer, demonstrating a wide temperature sensing range (50-400 °C) and a rapid response time for early high-temperature alerts (~ 1.43 s). This work provides novel insights into the design and application of temperature-sensitive anisotropic aramid nanofibers aerogel in firefighting clothing.
40227514	Exo- and endoscopic two-step approach for anterior foramen magnum meningiomas: How I do it.	Anterior foramen magnum (AFM) meningiomas are difficult to treat because they are situated in anatomically complex regions. One of the most common approaches for AFM meningiomas is the far lateral approach. We describe our exo- and endoscopic two-step approach (EETA) through suboccipital craniotomy. An exoscope is used to remove the tumour's lateral part, whereas an endoscope is used to remove the residual tumour in the exoscope's blind spots, including the brainstem's ventral side. EETA is a viable option for treating AFM meningiomas because it provides an adequate surgical field of view and is minimally invasive.
40227513	Telemedicine in ophthalmology.	Since its beginnings in the 1970s, telemedicine has advanced extensively. Telemedicine is now more accessible and powerful than ever thanks to developments in medical imaging, Internet accessibility, advancements in telecommunications infrastructure, exponential growth in computing power, and related computer-aided diagnoses. This is especially true in the field of ophthalmology. With the COVID 19 pandemic serving as a catalyst for the widespread adoption and acceptance of teleophthalmology, new models of healthcare provision integrating telemedicine are needed to meet the challenges of the modern world. The demand for ophthalmic services is growing globally due to population growth, aging, and a shortage of ophthalmologists. In this review, we discuss the development and use of telemedicine in the field of ophthalmology and shed light on the benefits and drawbacks of teleophthalmology.
40227512	Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis pathogenesis alters along animal age: impact of S100B expression.	Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the leading inflammatory and non-traumatic cause of disability in young adults, with late-onset MS emerging in middle-aged patients often resulting in poorer treatment responses and worse prognoses. The calcium-binding protein S100B is elevated in MS patients, and its targeting has shown promise in reducing disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models. However, most studies on MS pathology have focused on young animal models, leaving a gap in understanding the effects of age and S100B ablation on disease progression throughout the lifespan. This study aimed to characterize EAE in mice of different ages, examining demyelination, inflammation, and immune responses to determine whether S100B ablation could mitigate MS pathogenesis across the lifespan. EAE was induced in six cohorts of C57BL/6 mice: young adults (3 months), older adults (6 months), and middle-aged (12 months), including corresponding S100B knockout (KO) groups, followed for 23 days. Upon sacrifice, spinal cords were assessed via immunohistochemistry and Real-Time qPCR, while splenocytes were analyzed for immune cell characterization. Results indicated a more severe disease course in 12-month-old mice, marked by increased gliosis, inflammation, and impaired microglial phagocytic activity. Notably, S100B absence reduced gliosis and inflammatory markers across all ages, with 12-month-old S100B KO mice showing increased regulatory T cells. These findings highlight the exacerbating role of age and elevated S100B in MS progression, underscoring the importance of identifying age-specific MS markers and therapeutic targets.

The selection of functional materials for low-power memristors is discussed, including ion transport materials, phase change materials, magnetoresistive materials, and ferroelectric materials. Two common types of memristor arrays, 1T1R and 1S1R crossbar arrays are introduced, and physical diagrams of edge computing memristor chips are discussed in detail. Potential applications of low-power memristors in advanced multi-value storage, digital logic gates, and analogue neuromorphic computing are summarized. Furthermore, the future challenges and outlook of neuromorphic computing based on memristor are deeply discussed.
40227505	Cenobamate: A Review in Focal-Onset Seizures.	Cenobamate (Ontozry<sup>®</sup>) is a once-daily oral antiseizure medication (ASM) approved in the EU for the adjunctive treatment of focal-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults with epilepsy that have not been adequately controlled despite previous treatment with ≥ 2 anti-epileptic drugs. In clinical studies, its short-term use significantly reduced seizure frequency and was associated with significantly higher odds of achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in seizure frequency in adults with uncontrolled focal-onset seizures despite treatment with 1-3 concomitant ASMs. Seizure freedom rates were also improved. All these benefits were sustained over up to 48 months. Cenobamate was generally well tolerated across both the short- and longer-term (up to 94 months) clinical studies, with its low starting dosage (12.5 mg/day) and slow (12-week) titration schedule appearing to result in fewer severe treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the titration period. Somnolence, dizziness and fatigue were the most frequently reported TEAEs. The effectiveness and adverse events of cenobamate in real-world studies were consistent with those seen in the clinical studies. Thus, cenobamate continues to represent a useful adjunctive treatment option in adults with uncontrolled focal-onset seizures.
40227504	Comparison of artificial intelligence applications and commercial system performances using selected ANA IIF images.	Accurate and accessible classification of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) through indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) imaging is crucial for diagnosing autoimmune diseases. However, many laboratories, particularly those with limited resources, lack access to expensive commercial systems for automated analysis. This study evaluates the performance of an application developed by expert physicians using an artificial intelligence application (Microsoft Azure) to classify ANA IIF images. The results are compared with EuroPattern to assess the potential of AI in assisting laboratory experts, especially in resource-limited settings. A total of 648 ANA IIF images from the EuroPattern archive were used to train an AI model across nine classes with varying fluorescence intensities (+ to + + + +). Testing was conducted with 96 images, ensuring clarity by excluding mixed patterns. Microsoft Azure's Custom Vision service was employed for labeling and prediction. Expert evaluations, EuroPattern results, and AI classifications were compared. Both EuroPattern and the Azure-based AI model achieved 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in positive and negative discrimination. EuroPattern had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.979, and the Azure-based AI model had an ICC of 0.948, indicating slightly lower performance. EuroPattern outperformed the Azure-based AI model in recognizing homogeneous, speckled, centromere, and dense fine-speckled patterns. The Azure-based AI model performed better in identifying cytoplasmic reticular/AMA-like patterns. The results suggest that AI-based image analysis tools, such as Azure, can be valuable for diagnostics in resource-limited labs. However, further testing with larger datasets and routine patient samples is needed to confirm their effectiveness in real-world clinical settings.
40227502	RAF1 promotes anlotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer by inhibiting apoptosis.	Anlotinib is an effective treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but resistance to it often develops during therapy. RAF1, a serine/threonine kinase involved in cancer progression, has limited research in NSCLC, particularly regarding anlotinib resistance.
40227501	The First Step is the Hardest: A Mixed Methods Single-Case Experimental Design Study of a VR-Enhanced Training Program in a Forensic Youth Care Setting.	Street Temptations is a virtual reality-enhanced training program developed as an add-on intervention for adolescents with disruptive behavior problems. Using mentalization as a primary treatment mechanism, the program aims to address cognitive distortions and increase motivation for behavior change. This study provides an initial evaluation of Street Temptations in a forensic youth care setting, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data within an A-B-A' single-case experimental design. Throughout a baseline, intervention, and follow-up phase, adolescents completed daily measurements on cognitive distortions and motivation for behavior change. Secondary outcomes were assessed before baseline, after intervention, and after follow-up, which included mentalization and perspective-taking. Qualitative data were collected after the intervention through separate interviews with adolescents and Street Temptations therapists. A total of 8 adolescents were included in the study, 5 of whom dropped out, leaving 3 who provided sufficient data for visual inspection of the outcomes. The observed patterns suggested an increase in adolescents' awareness of others' perspectives during participation in Street Temptations, potentially indicating a positive effect on cognitive distortions. However, daily assessments did not show an increase in adolescents' motivation for behavior change. Positive effects of Street Temptations and virtual reality, as well as areas for improvement, were highlighted in all interviews. Recommendations for further development and implementation are discussed. Overall, this study provides preliminary support for the use of Street Temptations as an add-on intervention in forensic youth care.
40227500	Impact of agricultural systems on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi community composition in robusta coffee roots in the Democratic Republic of congo.	Robusta coffee, grown by 25 million farmers across more than 50 countries, plays an important role in smallholder farmers' livelihoods and the economies of many low-income countries. Coffee establishes a mutualistic symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); however, the impact of agricultural practices and soil characteristics on AMF diversity and community composition is not well understood. To address this, we characterised the AMF community composition of robusta coffee in part of its region of origin, the Democratic Republic of Congo. AMF diversity and community composition were compared between coffee monoculture, agroforestry systems and wild robusta in its native rainforest habitat. Using Illumina sequencing on 304 root samples, we identified 307 AMF operational taxonomic units (OTUs), dominated by the genera Glomus and Acaulospora. OTU richness did not vary across the three studied systems, yet large differences in community composition were found. Many unique OTUs were only observed in the coffee in the rainforest. In general, lower available soil phosphorus (P) and lower soil bulk density increased AMF diversity, yet higher available soil P and pH increased AMF diversity in the wild forest coffee. Shifts in AMF community composition across coffee systems were driven by canopy closure, soil pH, available soil P and soil bulk density. Our study is the first to characterise mycorrhizal communities in wild robusta coffee in its region of origin and shows that even low-input agricultural practices result in major AMF community shifts as compared to a natural baseline.
40227499	Practical approach to using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for pre-surgical planning in complex paediatric congenital heart disease.	Decision-making in complex congenital heart disease (CHD) is challenging and requires the integration of anatomic and physiological data. Recent advances in cross-sectional imaging, particularly cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have refined this process. In addition to anatomic detail, MRI provides quantitative physiological data on cardiac function and flows through volumetry and phase contrast assessment. This review outlines the current scope for cardiac MRI and aims to provide a practical framework for using the data in four structural anomalies: borderline left ventricle, double outlet right ventricle, congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve.
40227498	Molecular landscape of clear cell renal cell carcinoma: targeting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma and is characterized by a complex molecular landscape driven by genetic and epigenetic alternations. Among the crucial signaling pathways implicated in ccRCC, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a significant role in tumor progression and prognosis. This review delves into the molecular basis of ccRCC, highlighting the genetic and epigenetic modifications that contribute to its pathogenesis. We explore the significance of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, focusing on its role in disease development, particularly the nuclear transport of β-catenin and its activation and downstream effects. Furthermore, we examine the role of antagonist genes in regulating this pathway within the context of ccRCC, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets. Dysregulation of this pathway, which is characterized by abnormal activation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, plays a significant role in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. We explore the intricate molecular aspects of ccRCC, with a particular emphasis on this topic, underscoring the role of the pathway and emphasizing the importance and relevance of antagonist genes. Understanding the intricate interplay between these molecular mechanisms is crucial for developing innovative strategies to improve ccRCC treatment and patient outcomes.
40227496	Imaging of acute small bowel pathologies in oncology patients in the ER part I: the role of Computed Tomography (CT) for the evaluation of Tumor and infections.	Acute abdominal complaints constitute up to 40% of all emergency department (ED) presentations in oncology patients due to a multitude of causes. Small bowel pathologies present a diagnostic challenge due to their diverse range and frequently overlapping clinical presentation. In oncology patients, structural changes resulting from tumor growth, surgery and treatment effects can further complicate the diagnostic process. Due to a weakened immune system, oncology patients are also highly susceptible to infections of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Traditional computed tomography (CT) scans are used as the gold standard diagnostic modality. However, three-dimensional (3D) postprocessing techniques including maximal intensity projection (MIP), volume rendering (VR) and cinematic rendering (CR) have been employed to aid image evaluation. For a balanced and organized approach to describe diagnostic challenges in this complex population, we have divided the pictorial essay into two parts. The first part focuses on tumor- and infection-associated causes, as summarized below in the visual abstract. The second part will address treatment-related complications, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, graft-versus-host disease and post-surgical complications.
40227495	Importance of Health Economics and Outcomes Research in the Product Lifecycle.	Health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) has become an integral part of healthcare systems, through its ability to authentically demonstrate the value of the product. HEOR provides healthcare stakeholders with important insights to make informed decisions regarding healthcare delivery. This review aims to highlight the pivotal role of HEOR across the product lifecycle and the value of integrating HEOR activities during the various phases of drug development. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly realizing that the integration of HEOR activities from early phases of product development through product launch, also during the postmarketing phase, to generate real-world evidence (RWE) can be crucial for their product's continued commercial success. HEOR helps validate the value of a pharmaceutical product, enabling its success in distinct regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) landscapes across varied geographies. Regardless of several challenges in data collection and analysis, technological advancements facilitate opportunities to improve the value of HEOR. With rising demands for robust clinical evidence by global regulators and economic evidence by HTA agencies and payers, HEOR will become even more crucial in establishing long-lasting value of a pharmaceutical product for all stakeholders, including regulators, patients, prescribers, and payers.
40227492	Femoral bone growth predictions based on personalized multi-scale simulations: validation and sensitivity analysis of a mechanobiological model.	Musculoskeletal function is pivotal to long-term health. However, various patient groups develop torsional deformities, leading to clinical, functional problems. Understanding the interplay between movement pattern, bone loading and growth is crucial for improving the functional mobility of these patients and preserving long-term health. Multi-scale simulations in combination with a mechanobiological bone growth model have been used to estimate bone loads and predict femoral growth trends based on cross-sectional data. The lack of longitudinal data in the previous studies hindered refinements of the mechanobiological model and validation of subject-specific growth predictions, thereby limiting clinical applications. This study aimed to validate the growth predictions using magnetic resonance images and motion capture data-collected longitudinally-from ten growing children. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to refine model parameters. A linear regression model based on physical activity information, anthropometric data and predictions from the refined mechanobiological model explained 70% of femoral anteversion development. Notably, the direction of femoral development was accurately predicted in 18 out of 20 femurs, suggesting that growth predictions could help to revolutionize treatment strategies for torsional deformities.
40227491	CaMKIIα-NpHR-Mediated Optogenetic Inhibition of DRG Glutamatergic Neurons by Flexible Optic Fiber Alleviates Chronic Neuropathic Pain.	Glutamatergic neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRGg) exert a significant effect on peripheral nociceptive signal transmission. However, assessing the explicit modulatory effect of DRGg during chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) with neuromodulation techniques remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we inhibited DRGg by optogenetic stimulation and examined whether it could alleviate CNP and associated anxiety-related behaviors in a chronic compressed DRG (CCD) rat model. The CCD pain model was established by inserting an L-shaped rod into the lumbar 5 (L5) intervertebral foramen, and either AAV2-CaMKIIα-eNpHR3.0-mCherry or AAV2-CaMKIIα-mCherry was injected into the L5 DRG. Flexible optic fibers were implanted to direct yellow light into the L5 DRG. Pain and anxiety-related behavioral responses were assessed using mechanical threshold, mechanical latency, thermal latency, and open field tests. In vivo single-unit extracellular recording from the DRG and ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamus was performed. CNP and anxiety-related behavioral responses along with increased neural firing activity of the DRG and VPL thalamus were observed in CCD animals. Enhanced expression of nociception-influencing molecules was found in the DRG and spinal dorsal horn (SDH). In contrast during optogenetic stimulation, specific DRGg inhibition markedly alleviated the CNP responses and reduced the DRG and VPL thalamic neural hyperactivity in CCD animals. Inhibition of DRGg also reduced the active expression of nociceptive signal mediators in the DRG and SDH. Taken together, our findings suggest that CaMKIIα-NpHR-mediated optogenetic inhibition of DRGg can produce antinociceptive effects in CCD rats during peripheral nerve injury-induced CNP condition by altering peripheral nociceptive signal input in the spinothalamic tract.
40227490	2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of cardiomyopathies : Statement of endorsement by the NVVC.	This article contextualises the 2023 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies for clinical practice in the Netherlands. The guideline addendum provides additional recommendations for situations where the ESC guidelines may not fully align with Dutch clinical practice. By endorsing the ESC guidelines through this addendum, the Netherlands Society of Cardiology (Nederlandse Vereniging Voor Cardiologie) supports its members in adhering to evidence-based management strategies for cardiomyopathies. As Dutch cardiologists generally adopt the ESC guidelines quickly, this contextualisation is essential for effective application thereof within the Dutch healthcare setting.
40227489	Evaluation of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with erythrosine and blue light emitting diode for inactivation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.	This study aims to analyze the effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans using erythrosine as a photosensitizer and a blue light emitting-diode as a light source. Inoculum samples of A. actinomycetemcomitans with PBS were used in each of the groups, being the control group (C); light group (L) corresponding to light emitting-diode irradiation for 300 s; photosensitizing group (0) without irradiation; and the aPDT groups with different irradiation times (aPDT20) with 20s of irradiation; (aPDT40) with 40s of irradiation; (aPDT60) with 60s of irradiation; (aPDT180) with 180s; and (aPDT300) with 300s. Samples were used to determine colony forming units (CFU). Aliquots of 10 µL were plated through six serial dilutions on brain-heart infusion agar in Petri dishes. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for a period of up to 24-48 h under microaerophilic conditions to evaluate the total bacteria recovered. After this period, CFUs were counted, and the data was subjected to one-way analysis of variance. When aPDT was performed for 180 and 300 s, the mean log10 (CFU/ml) was equal to 0. In the aPDT60 group, a significant yet incomplete microbial reduction was observed. SEM images confirmed that membrane integrity was maintained, indicating that aPDT induced cellular alterations without causing membrane disruption. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy employing erythrosine as a photosensitizer and blue light emitting-diode light-curing unit for composite resin polymerization used in dental practices demonstrated significant antimicrobial efficacy against A. actinomycetemcomitans, a principal pathogen in periodontitis, under the evaluated experimental conditions.
40227488	Transplantation of Exercise-Enhanced Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improves Obesity and Glucose Tolerance via Immune Modulation in Adipose Tissue.	Exercise-conditioned mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may modulate immune responses and improve white adipose tissue (WAT) function. While MSCs are known to reduce inflammation, it remains unclear if exercise-stimulated MSCs can improve obesity-related dysfunctions. This study is the first to explore how exercise-conditioned MSCs may influence adipose tissue inflammation and remodeling in the context of obesity. MSCs were isolated from exercised- and sedentary donor mice, then cultured in vitro. After culture, MSCs were assessed for differentiation capacity and cytokine gene expression, including Il10, as indicators of immune modulation. Exercise-conditioned MSCs were then transplanted into obese recipient mice. Following transplantation, immune cell profiles, inflammatory markers, and adipocyte morphology in recipient WAT were analyzed. Flow cytometry was used to quantify macrophage subtypes (pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory), and histological analysis was performed to measure changes in adipocyte size. Exercise-activated MSCs showed a ± 35% increase in Il10 expression and a ± 20% enhancement in differentiation capacity compared to controls, indicating improved immunomodulatory potential. In recipient mice, transplantation led to a ± 25% reduction in pro-inflammatory macrophages (CD86<sup>+</sup> CD206<sup>-</sup>) and a 15% decrease in adipocyte size within WAT. Additionally, WAT in treated mice showed balanced inflammatory profiles and reduced adipose hypertrophy, suggesting restored immune balance and metabolic health. These findings suggest that exercise-modified MSCs exhibit enhanced immunomodulatory and metabolic regulatory properties. This study provides evidence that exercise enhances MSC characteristics, potentially improving their capacity to modulate adipose tissue immune balance and metabolic function in obesity. Exercise-conditioned MSCs may serve as a foundation for future strategies that integrate exercise-induced stem cell modifications to modulate obesity-related metabolic dysfunction.
40227487	Decellularized Porcine Aorta as a Scaffold for Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Tissue Engineering.	Tissue engineering has been an integral part of regenerative medicine. Functional biomimetic structures were assembled by combining appropriate scaffolds with specific cells. The decellularization of animal tissue preserved the natural biochemical components and structural properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of specific organs, thereby providing a suitable niche for tissue-specific cell differentiation and growth. In this study, the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the porcine aorta was obtained through trypsin-based decellularization. The resulting porcine aortic ECM retained a favorable collagen composition, exhibited no cytotoxicity, and demonstrated chemophilic properties for mesenchymal stem cells. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hiMSCs) were transplanted onto the decellularized porcine aortic ECM, where successful differentiation into a mature cartilage layer was observed. These findings suggested that the porcine aortic ECM could serve as a potential scaffold with tubular and linear structures for tissue engineering applications. Functional human iMSCs (induced-mesenchymal stem cells) were generated from human iPSCs (induced-pluripotent stem cells) and analyzed for differences compared to primary MSCs via RNA-seq. The hiMSCs were applied to decellularized porcine aortic ECM (extracellular matrix), demonstrating chondrogenic differentiation and confirming the usability of xenogeneic ECM.
40227486	General surgery residents have better technical skills and less stress performing complex drills in open fashion over robotic approach.	Despite growing diversity of surgical approaches, surgical residents must learn the breadth of general surgery in a finite time. Accordingly, there is increasing demand for the development of standardized, proficiency-based training curricula to help teach novice surgeons the necessary technical skills quickly. The aim of this study was to evaluate resident performance and opinion of an open versus robotic approach after completion of a robotic training curriculum.
40227485	Biophysical modeling and artificial intelligence for quantitative assessment of anastomotic blood supply in laparoscopic low anterior rectal resection.	Fluorescence imaging is critical for intraoperative intestinal perfusion assessment in colorectal surgery, yet its clinical adoption remains limited by subjective interpretation and lack of quantitative standards. This study introduces an integrated approach combining fluorescence curve analysis, biophysical modeling, and machine learning to improve intraoperative perfusion assessment.
40227484	Effects of training in pairs versus training alone on reaching proficiency in minimally invasive Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass on a virtual reality trainer in medical students: a randomized-controlled trial.	Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is the standard approach in bariatric surgery. The most common bariatric procedures are sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y-Gastric Bypass (RYGB). Simulation training, including virtual reality (VR), is useful when learning MIS. Training in pairs has proven beneficial in acquiring basic MIS skills. However, this has not been tested on more complex procedures such as MIS RYGB. The study aimed to assess the learning effects of training MIS RYGB on a VR trainer in pairs compared to solo training.
40227483	Impact of self-expandable metallic prosthesis on lymph node dissemination in obstructive left-sided colorectal cancer.	The introduction of self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) insertion in obstructive colorectal cancer (CRC) has been associated with an increased risk of tumor perforation, potentially leading to peritoneal dissemination, tumor cell spread via lymphatic vessels, perineural invasion, and peripheral bloodstream. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of SEMS placement on CRC lymph node metastasis.
40227482	Emerging trends and future outlook on chromium removal in the lab, pilot scale, and industrial wastewater system: an updated review exploring 10 years of research.	Chromium (Cr) is widely recognized as a carcinogenic metal, and numerous technologies have been studied on a lab scale to manage the pollution caused by Cr contamination in wastewater. However, the removal of Cr presents several challenges and limitations in industrial wastewater management. These issues highlight the ongoing need for research to discover more efficient methods for remediating Cr from wastewater. The proposed review summarizes the current limitations, gaps, and state-of-the-art technologies on Cr removal in industrial wastewater systems over the past 10 years. It aims to lay the groundwork for future research and innovation in Cr remediation for industrial applications. The review emphasizes that conventional physicochemical techniques are often insufficient and highlights the necessity of implementing advanced integrated systems. The limitations related to industrial scaling up are also deeply investigated. Special attention is given to differentiating research conducted at laboratory, pilot, and industrial levels. The findings reveal that limited research has been conducted on an industrial scale, with most investigations focusing on treating tannery and electroplating wastewater. A few studies have also been reported on wastewater from textile, mining, steel mills, pigments, and wood processing. Despite the existence of high-performance systems demonstrated in lab-scale studies, only a handful of treatment techniques have effectively removed Cr at an industrial scale. Nevertheless, innovative breakthroughs in advanced integrated systems show promise for improved performance in the future.
40227481	Unraveling Electron Transfer in the Oxidation of Yttrium Metal Atoms: Dual Pathways from Reactive and Nonreactive Imaging.	The intricate mechanisms underlying electron transfer and structural evolution are essential to understanding the oxidation dynamics of transition metal atoms; however, accurately measuring the mechanisms remains challenging. In this study, utilizing laser ablation-crossed beam and time-sliced ion velocity imaging techniques, we identified two distinct electron transfer mechanisms in the reactions of Y and O<sub>2</sub> based on reactive and nonreactive scattering measurements across varying collision energies. (1) Low-barrier end-on pathway: Electron transfer occurs through a collinear Y-O-O geometry with a low activation barrier, evidenced by rebound scattering of YO products at low collision energy and backward scattering of Y reactants at higher energies. (2) High-barrier side-on pathway: Electron transfer proceeds through a side-on geometry, presenting a higher activation barrier that facilitates the formation of long-lived O-Y-O intermediates, which is characterized by the backward-forward peaking angular distribution of YO products and broad energy distributions of O<sub>2</sub> reactants at high collision energy.
40227480	Portland cement concrete reinforced with irradiated rayon fiber from textile industry waste.	This study was performed to assess the impacts of rayon fibers and gamma radiation as a modification tool for fiber strength enhancement in fiber-reinforced concrete. The available data on irradiated rayon fiber is inadequate to recognize the impact of gamma radiation on fiber and its application in fiber-reinforced concrete. Three individual fiber modification techniques were used including gamma radiation, chemical grafting, and radiation-induced chemical grafting. To evaluate optimum strength, various concentrations of radiation dosage (10, 50, 150, and 300 kGy) were applied to rayon fiber. It has been observed that gamma radiation provides optimum strength to fiber at 10 kGy radiation dosage. Various advanced techniques (scanning electron microscopic image, differential scanning calorimetry test, differential thermal analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis) were performed to characterize rayon fiber. The experimental work was performed on M- 25 grade concrete. Different concentrations of irradiated fiber percentages (0.5, 1.0, and 2%) were added to develop fiber-reinforced concrete. Fresh and mechanical tests were conducted. The optimal percentage of irradiated rayon fiber addition to the concrete was 1%, which provides 15.2% and 18.5% increments in compressive and flexural strength compared to traditional concrete. The inclusion of irradiated rayon fibers as reinforcement material had a positive impact, adding value to textile industry waste.
40227479	Itaconic acid production from corn stover hydrolysates for a newly isolated Aspergillus terreus through adaptive evolution.	Itaconic acid can be produced using lignocellulosic biomass; however, the inhibitors from pretreatment process of biorefinery are toxic to the fermenting strains. Here, with 35.70 ± 0.69 g/L (0.19 ± 0.05 g/L·h and 73.84 ± 0.01%) itaconic acid from shake flask fermentation of synthetic medium (SM), a newly isolated Aspergillus terreus just produced 1.01 ± 0.01 g/L itaconic acid from corn stover hydrolysates (CSH) for the serious block of aldehyde inhibitors and acetic acid. Convincingly, 25.34 ± 3.94 g/L (0.13 ± 0.02 g/L·h and 37.92 ± 3.89%) itaconic acid was achieved from the detoxified CSH (with residual 0.49 g/L acetic acid) using 4.0% activated charcoal. 21.64 ± 2.42 g/L (0.05 ± 0.01 g/L·h and 26.96 ± 7.81%) itaconic acid was further achieved from CSH for the adapted A. terreus with better degradation ability of furanic aldehydes and phenolic aldehydes. Furthermore, the 108 mutation sites of nine genes from adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) for A. terreus were further uncovered through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis, and thus would be responsible for the improved fermentability of itaconic acid from CSH. The current work broke the bottlenecks in itaconic acid fermentation directly from CSH through improving A. terreus using directed evolution technique, and thus would provide a strain biocatalyst A. terreus and establish the alternative strategy to efficiently produce itaconic acid using corn stover.
40227478	Seroprevalence of bovine viral diarrhea in Camelus dromedarius from Tunisia.	Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD) is a highly contagious viral disease primarily affecting cattle. with emerging evidence of its spread to dromedary camels. This study evaluates the seroprevalence of BVD Pestivirus and identifies associated risk factors in Tunisian one-humped dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius). A total of 470 serum samples were randomly collected from dromedaries across eight governorates in southern and central Tunisia, screening them using a using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The overall seropositivity rate was 23.6% (95% CI: 20-27%), with 111 camels testing positive for BVD antibodies. A multivariate analysis revealed three significant risk factors: younger camels (< 5 years old) showed higher seropositivity, camels in close contact with other ruminants had increased seroprevalence, and infection rates peaked during the summer. These findings suggest that Tunisian one-humped dromedaries are at risk of BVD Pestivirus, impacting epidemiologic dynamics among local livestock. Therefore, incorporating dromedaries into control strategies is crucial to reduce the economic impact of this disease at both local and continental levels.
40227476	Camellia nitidissima Chi extract ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute ulcerative colitis in mice by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory activation.	Camellia nitidissima Chi (CNC), whose main composition was gallic acid, catechin, procyanidin-gallate, apigenin-pentosyl-glucoside, vitexin, cyanidin-3-o-glucoside, myricitrin-glucoside, gallocatechin-gallate, epicatechin and rutin, posses sound anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. This study aimed to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of the alcoholic extract of CNC on dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis. CNC effectively maintained weight and colon length, and significantly ameliorated colonic histopathological damage. Furthermore, CNC mitigated colitis-induced oxidative stress and exhibited anti-inflammatory properties in UC mice by reducing levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA), decreasing the production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In addition, CNC downregulated the protein expression levels of TLR4, p-NF-κBP65, and p-IκBα of the inflammation-related TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways. Validation of the molecular docking results also revealed that rutin, the most abundant compound in CNC, interacts with TLR4 and NF-κB protein mainly through hydrogen bonds. CNC also promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium while reducing the number of Enterococcus, E. coli, Bacteroides, and Peptococcus in mice to improve the intestinal environment and alleviate colitis. CNC inhibited TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways to relieve inflammation and oxidative damage on UC, is a potential development of natural medicine for UC.
40227475	Clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with follicular lymphoma in Colombia: a real-world evidence cohort study.	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common mature B lymphoid neoplasm. Understanding its epidemiology and clinical features is crucial for developing healthcare strategies, especially in low-and middle-income countries. This retrospective study analyzed clinical features, treatment patterns and outcomes of FL patients in a Colombian Health Maintenance Organization from 2018 to 2023. Statistical analyses were descriptive; survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 406 patients were included (mean age: 55.7 ± 13.8 years; 59.4% women). 79% of patients were classified as Ann Arbor stage III-IV, and 35% as high-risk in the FLIPI score. Most frequent first line (1 L) treatments were R-CHOP (63.5%) and R-CVP (10.8%), with 77.3% of patients achieving complete response (CR). Progression to second line (2L) therapy occurred in 30% of patients; 82% achieved CR. Most frequent 2L treatments were radiotherapy (23%), obinutuzumab-based regimens (18%) and R-Bendamustine (18%). Five-year progression-free survival was 70.4%, and overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 92% and 85%, respectively. A lower risk of death was observed in patients with low-intermediate FLIPI compared to patients with high FLIPI (HR = 0.23; 95%CI: 0.11-0.49). Patients with progression in the first 24 months (POD24) had a higher risk of mortality (HR = 6.54; 95%CI = 2.73-15.43). We report an approximation of the current status of FL in Colombia. Findings showed high response rates to initial treatment and prolonged overall survival. The presence of a high FLIPI score and POD24 were associated with an increased risk of mortality.
40227474	Geranylgeranylacetone as Prevention for Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation (GENIALITY).	Interestingly, 30-50% of patients undergoing elective cardiothoracic surgery develop postoperative AF (PoAF). Unfortunately, preventive PoAF therapy is still suboptimal. In our previous studies, we showed that oral Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) administration increased cardioprotective heat shock protein (HSP) protecting against AF onset and progression in clinically relevant animal model studies.
40227473	Opioid-Sparing Effects of Erector Spinae Plane Block in Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting with Median Sternotomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

40227471	Occurrence, partitioning behavior, and ecological risk assessment of octylphenol and nonylphenol in surface waters and sediments of Terengganu Rivers, Malaysia.	The occurrence, partitioning behavior, and ecological risk assessment of octylphenol (OP) and nonylphenol (NP) were investigated in the surface water and sediment of three rivers in Terengganu, Malaysia, to understand the fate and ecological risk of these chemicals in aquatic ecosystems. Target chemicals were extracted using solvent extractant and cleaned up via solid-phase extraction. This is followed by analysis via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and verification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). OP was consistently higher in both surface water and sediment, while NP was predominantly found in sediment with minimal detection in surface water. Concentrations in sediment (OP, 0.19-30.88 ng/g dw; NP, 0.38-84.42 ng/g dw) and in surface water (OP, 0.0019-0.0077 ng/mL; NP, 0.0007-0.0023 ng/mL) suggest strong adsorption from water to sediment due to the hydrophobic effects of these compounds. The partitioning behavior of OP was evaluated using two indicators: (1) the sediment-water partition coefficient (K<sub>d</sub>) and (2) the carbon-normalized partition coefficient (K'<sub>oc</sub>). The results indicated that OP is readily adsorbed and released from sediment, with log K<sub>d</sub> values ranging from 3.06 to 3.57 and log K'<sub>oc</sub> values from 3.00 to 3.97. A significant positive correlation was observed between physical water parameters (temperature, salinity, and pH), whereas a significant negative correlation was found between these parameters and the concentrations of OP and NP in sediment. The ecological risk assessment showed that OP in water posed a low risk, while OP and NP in sediment presented varying risks, ranging from low to high risk between 2018 and 2019. This baseline information on the partitioning behavior is invaluable for predicting the environmental fate of these compounds in sediment-water interactions in Malaysia and for assessing the ecological risks they may pose to aquatic organisms.

40227468	Medical handovers: tacit consensus on interaction.	Recent studies on handover communication highlight the role of the incoming physician in preventing misunderstandings that contribute to medical errors. However, existing research often only provides abstract recommendations for increasing their participation, without specifying where and how this should occur. This paper applies discourse theory and methods to identify where the incoming physician's active involvement is interactionally appropriate and can be integrated naturally and effectively. Twelve handovers between six pairs of resident physicians were recorded in a simulated ICU setting at a teaching hospital and analyzed using a combination of genre theory and conversation analysis. By first identifying the "moves" that constitute the handover genre, we pinpointed places where active participation by the incoming physician is expected and facilitates effective communication. While the tasks and focus points and the questions and consultation moves clearly invite such participation, the clinical situation move requires more negotiation, as the outgoing physician maintains control over the conversational floor, making it less immediately accessible for the incoming physician to contribute. The four remaining moves exhibit a more monologic pattern, where both participants display interactional behavior signaling that active input from the incoming physician is not anticipated. Our findings suggest that medical professionals share an implicit understanding of when participation is appropriate, shaped by conventions of the handover genre itself. By reconstructing these tacit rules through genre theory and conversation analysis, we provide insights that can inform training methods, ensuring that recommendations for active participation by the incoming physician align with the structured expectations of clinical practice.

40227466	Silver Chloride Precipitation-limiting Factor for Accurate Silver Determination in Ag-accumulating Mushrooms After Nitric Acid Digestion.	Wild-growing mushrooms (macromycetes, macrofungi) are capable of accumulating high amounts of trace elements, including noble metals. In a series of analytical experiments, this study focused on the problem of correct determination of Ag mass fractions in the biomass of Ag-accumulating mushrooms, Ag-hyperaccumulators in particular. A unique experimental setup enabled to compare Ag determination in selected mushroom samples first by the non-destructive neutron activation analysis (INAA) utilizing <sup>110</sup>Ag isotope, second by the high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS) after HNO<sub>3</sub> hotplate and microwave digestions. Furthermore, Ag-spiking experiments were conducted with three mushroom species containing 860, 6200, and 21,000 mg Cl kg<sup>-1</sup> in dry mass and Ag was determined by HR-ICP-MS after HNO<sub>3</sub> hotplate digestion of the samples. Finally, ten replicates of Ag-hyperaccumulating Amanita strobiliformis were analyzed by two variants of INAA utilizing <sup>108</sup>Ag in the first step and <sup>110 m</sup>Ag isotope in the second step. In addition, four additional digestion procedures followed by HR-ICP-MS and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements of Ag were performed on this A. strobiliformis sample. Analytical quality was controlled by using NIST Standard Reference Materials 1566b (Oyster Tissue) and 2781 (Domestic Sludge). The results of all experiments revealed that correct determination of Ag in mushrooms is not always possible using standard digestion procedures because of precipitation of insoluble AgCl which was documented by scanning electron microscopy and confirmed by the X-ray diffraction analysis.
40227465	Defect Engineering in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Optical Properties of Stable Defect Complexes Arising from Boron Interstitials.	Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide-band-gap semiconductor that is promising as a host material for solid-state quantum technologies through defect engineering. It has been shown that boron atoms can be removed from the lattice upon irradiation by electrons or light ions, creating boron vacancies and boron interstitials. While the optical properties of boron-vacancy-derived defects have been studied extensively, little is known about the optical properties of boron-interstitial-derived defects. In this work, we use state-of-the-art first-principles calculations to predict the electronic and optical properties of boron interstitials (B<sub>int</sub>) and defect complexes comprising B<sub>int</sub> and substitutional carbon impurities at boron and nitrogen sites (C<sub>B</sub> and C<sub>N</sub>). These carbon impurities can be present in as-grown hBN and can also be introduced intentionally. We demonstrate that these complexes are expected to be stable at room temperature. Our GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations show that B<sub>int</sub>-C<sub>B</sub> and B<sub>int</sub>-C<sub>N</sub> have low-energy optical transitions that are isolated in energy, making them suitable as single-photon emitters. Together with constrained density functional theory calculations to capture the red shift due to emission, we predict that B<sub>int</sub>-C<sub>B</sub> and B<sub>int</sub>-C<sub>N</sub> have zero phonon lines at ∼2.0 eV and ∼2.6 eV, respectively. Defects involving B<sub>int</sub> are likely to be the source of blue emitters recently observed in regions several microns away from ion-irradiated parts of hBN. Our work sheds light on these recent experiments and introduces a fresh perspective to the field of quantum emitters in hBN─we show that defects related to B<sub>int</sub> are potential single-photon emitters that can be intentionally created in hBN.

Social and economic disadvantages are believed to correlate with women's mental health during the pandemic. However, studies mainly show the prevalence of mental health problems among women during COVID- 19 across the globe while the covariates are not extensively reported. Moreover, the literature on mental health is believed to be overlooked in the developing countries.
40227452	Whether pistil show diversity in bisymmetric and zygomorphic flowers in Fumarioideae (Papaveraceae): especially focus on stigma development, structure and secondary pollen presentation.	Pistils of Fumarioideae (Papaveraceae) show diversity in morphology, whether it is involved in the formation of flower symmetry is unclear for pistil morphogenesis and ovule development characteristic are poorly known. In this study, seven species of Fumarioideae were studied under SEM, LM and TEM, six developmental stages can be recognized: pistil initiation, circular bulge fusion, ascidiate structure formation, stigma and ovary differentiation (including ovule initiation), pistil development (including stigma specialization and ovule development) and pistil maturation. All syncarpous pistils were fused by two carpels, and stigmas in different shape were all derived from the two horns which formed by dorsal suture extension, e.g. two-lobed deeply, two-lobed deeply with four papillae, boat-shaped with four papillae; and style bend to the spurred-petal at later developmental stages in Corydalis edulis and Fumaria officinalis. During flowering, stigmas were wrapped by "pollen container" formed by two inner petals (expect Hypecoum erectum); the pollen-receptive surfaces of stigma is concentrated or compartmentalized, and is covered with papillae cells which have a large vacuole, abundant mitochondria and plastids, and cell wall was covered by a lot number of secretions. In addition, ovule number in ovary of Fumarioideae varied from few (only one ovule developed normally in F. officinalis) to 200, and the square, banded and near-triangular funicle appendage structures are found in Lamprocapnos spectabilis, Dactylicapnos torulosa and C. edulis. The correlation between pistil development and flower symmetry and the function of secondary pollen presentation on stigma were discussed in this study.
40227451	Integrated Thermoelectric Generation System for Sustainable All-Day Power Supply Based on Solar Energy and Radiative Cooling.	Thermoelectric generators have a promising application in the field of sustainable energy due to their ability to utilize low-grade waste heat and their high reliability. The sun radiates a large amount of energy to the earth, yet most of which is wasted. Efficient utilization of solar energy can be achieved by integrating a solar absorber, phase change material, and Fresnel lens with thermoelectric generators. In this work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes are mixed with polydimethylsiloxane as a solar absorber and achieve up to 99% absorption of sunlight. Meanwhile, the solar absorber as a radiative cooler also exhibits high emissivity in the atmospheric window, and a cooling effect of 7.3 K from the ambient temperature can be realized at night. Paraffin wax as a phase change material realizes heat storage during the day and release at night. The Fresnel lens realizes a high degree of convergence of sunlight over a large area, obtaining a higher output performance at a lower cost. The multienergy integrated and synergistic thermoelectric generation system achieves an output power density of 4.1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> during the day and a peak power density of 0.2 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> during the night, which can meet the demand for ab uninterrupted power supply to electronic devices. This work realizes the efficient utilization of solar energy and provides an option for thermoelectric application.
40227446	Aptamer-regulated colorimetric and electrochemical dual-mode sensor for the detection of uranyl ions utilizing AuNCs@COF composite.	Uranium is the core material for the development of the nuclear industry, but its irreversible radiation damage poses a significant threat to human health. In this context, an innovative dual-mode colorimetric and electrochemical sensor was developed for the detection of uranyl ions (UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>), utilizing a covalent organic framework@gold nanoclusters (AuNCs@COF) composite. The synthesis of AuNCs@COF was simple, and the incorporation of AuNCs imparted the composite with exceptional peroxidase-like catalytic activity and enhanced electrochemical properties. By regulating the adsorption and desorption of aptamers on the AuNCs@COF surface, both peroxidase-like activity and conductivity were modulated, enabling the detection of UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> utilizing colorimetric and electrochemical dual signals. Under optimal conditions, the sensor revealed a broad linear detection range and a low detection limit, with ranges of 1.36 × 10<sup>-10</sup>-1.36 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/L for colorimetric detection and 5.0 × 10<sup>-10</sup>-2.5 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/L for electrochemical detection, achieving detection limits for these two methods of 107 pmol/L and 347 pmol/L, respectively. Unlike other single-mode sensors for UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> detection, this dual-mode sensor demonstrated superior sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability. Furthermore, the results of spiked recovery experiments in real water samples highlight the promising potential of this dual-mode sensor for environmental water monitoring applications.
40227442	Muscle length influences active joint position sense at the shoulder, but conditioning contractions do not.	Active shoulder joint position sense (JPS) is more accurate at higher angles of humerothoracic elevation. During active JPS testing, the extensor/antagonist muscles of the shoulder undergo repeated passive lengthening and do not contract to bring about shoulder extension. This may alter muscle spindle sensitivity at different angles of humeral elevation leading to angle related reduction in repositioning error. The purpose of this study is to examine active shoulder JPS when shoulder extensor muscles when were exposed to either a low-level contraction or full range of motion movement in an active angle reproduction JPS protocol. Fifteen participants completed the study. Participants completed the shoulder JPS protocol using three target angles (30°, 60°, and 90°) under three conditions: standard, range of motion exposure (fROM) between trials, and antagonist contraction (aCON) between trials. There was a significant interaction between conditions and angles (p = 0.002). JPS error decreased at higher elevations in the standard condition (p = 0.014) and aCON conditions (p = 0.035). The effect was absent in the fROM condition, where error across all target angles was consistent with the higher error at 30°. The outcomes suggest that change in the antagonist's muscle length and muscle spindle slackness are significant contributors to shoulder JPS.
40227439	[Importance of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for the management of neuroendocrine tumours].	Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare, heterogeneous neoplasms that often express somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). This allows targeted peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) for NETs. PRRT is currently indicated as second- or third-line therapy for metastatic or unresectable, progressive, SSTR-positive NETs of grade (G) 1 or 2. Adequate bone marrow reserves as well as renal and hepatic function are required for PRRT. The most commonly used radiopharmaceutical for PRRT is <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-TATE. PRRT prolongs progression-free and overall survival, reduces or stabilises tumour burden, and improves tumour symptoms and quality of life. Adverse events associated with PRRT are mostly mild and transient. Haemato- and nephrotoxicity are the most common toxicities following PRRT. The NETTER‑2 and COMPOSE trials are investigating PRRT with <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-TATE/-TOC in G2 and G3 gastroenteropancreatic NETs.
40227438	Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Engineered Cell Membrane-Coated Nanoparticles Promote Dual-Targeted mRNA-Based Cancer Gene Therapy.	Gene therapy using mRNA has facilitated progress in cancer therapy. However, its application is hindered by a limited tumor-targeted delivery approach, leading to off-target effects and safety concerns. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) molecules enable T cells to recognize specific antigens in a major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted manner. CAR approaches provide an "off-the-shelf" solution for introducing additional targeting functionality to a cell membrane. Cancer cell membrane-coated nanoparticles with homotypic tumor-targeted properties provide a readily accessible platform for gene engineering and membrane extraction. Herein, we demonstrate a CAR-inspired cancer cell membrane-coated platform for delivering an mRNA formulation through a dual tumor-targeted mechanism. The simplified human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific CAR molecule (comprising an extracellular HER2-binding domain, a hinge, and a transmembrane domain) was engineered on the cell membrane of cancer cells to establish CAR-CT26 cells. The extracted CAR-CT26 membrane (CARM) was subsequently coated onto the lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA surface to form a CARM@LNP-mRNA complex. <i>In vitro</i>, the CARM-coated nanoparticles exhibited enhanced mRNA transfection efficiency toward CT26 cells overexpressing target HER2 antigens. Systemic administration of the CARM@LNP-mRNA formulation resulted in stronger tumor-targeting ability and tumor suppression in HER2+ CT26 subcutaneous tumors and peritoneal cavity metastasis models than that observed with the CT26 cell membrane-coated version. Our data suggest that CARM@LNP is a feasible choice for mRNA-based gene therapy. These results provide evidence for the systemic administration of CARM@LNP-mRNA as a promising tumor-targeted therapeutic strategy.
40227437	A systematic review and meta-analysis: relationship between residual feed intake and traits related to methane emissions in cattle.	The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the relationship between RFI (residual feed intake) and traits related to methane emissions in cattle. Searches were performed in PubMed and Web of Science using keywords in English. The selected studies compared traits related to methane emissions between animals with divergent RFI and/or the correlation between traits related to methane emissions and RFI. Meta-analysis was performed for traits showing three or more uncorrelated results. After application of the exclusion and inclusion criteria, 27 studies were included in the present review. Meta-analysis of the comparison of means was possible for seven traits and meta-analysis of phenotypic correlations for three traits. CH<sub>4</sub> emission (g/day) was significantly lower in negative RFI animals and was positively correlated with RFI, indicating that animals with lower dry matter intake without affecting production traits (low RFI) emit less CH<sub>4</sub> into the environment. However, the results for the other traits evaluated were inconclusive due to insufficient data for meta-analysis. Meta-analyses clearly demonstrated that cattle with lower RFI emit less enteric methane. The primary reason why more efficient animals emit less enteric methane appears to be the reduced availability of substrate for fermentation. Therefore, genetic selection of cattle for feed efficiency, beyond reducing feed costs within the production system, plays a critical role in promoting environmentally sustainable production.

We aimed to investigate the association between AmygA and cardiovascular events in patients with CS.
40227434	Identification of Novel Cyclobutane-Based Derivatives as Potent Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Allosteric Inhibitors for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Drug Discovery.	Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become a leading cause of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, there are no efficient drugs for NASH therapy. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is a crucial enzyme regulating lipid metabolism that is considered as a potential target for NASH treatment. Allosteric inhibitors target nonfunctional sites, which tend to be highly variable in protein families; thus, allosteric inhibitors are explored as an important source of drug candidates. Herein, several hotspot residues are initially identified by utilizing molecular dynamic simulation, MM-GBSA calculation, and alanine mutation. Then, focusing on the interaction with hotspot residues, several cyclobutane-based ACC allosteric inhibitors are designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. Among them, <b>B1</b> demonstrates potent ACC inhibitory activity <i>in vitro</i>, a higher distribution in liver than in other tissues, and a potent therapeutic effect for NASH <i>in vivo</i>, making it a promising candidate for the treatment of NASH.
40227432	Calculating a Phase Diagram of a Simple Water Model Using Unsupervised Machine Learning on Simulation Data.	We use unsupervised machine learning to construct a phase diagram of a simple 2D rose water model. The machine learning method that we use is a combination of dimensionality reduction methods and clustering algorithms. Two different data sets from the same simulations are used as input data for machine learning. These are angular distribution functions and a set of different thermodynamic, dynamic, and structural properties. To evaluate the efficiency of the method, the machine learning results are compared to manually determined phase diagrams. We show that the methods successfully predict the phase diagram of the rose water model. Furthermore, the phase diagrams obtained from the two data sets are in semiquantitative agreement with each other. Four different solid phases, one liquid phase, and one gaseous phase were determined. The method we have presented is straightforward and easy to implement. It requires almost no prior knowledge of the system to obtain a phase diagram. The method can also be used to distinguish between the different parts of the same phase that have different properties or a sufficiently different structure, and in this way find local differences and anomalies.
40227431	Phase 2 Open-label, Single-arm, Multi-center Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Camostat Mesylate in Patients with Protein-losing Enteropathy After Fontan Operation.	Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is a serious complication after the Fontan operation with limited treatment options. This phase 2, multi-center, open-label trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Camostat Mesylate (CM), a serine protease inhibitor, as adjunctive therapy for PLE. Nineteen patients aged 4 years and older with PLE after the Fontan operation were enrolled. CM was administered for six months in addition to their individualized conventional treatments. Assessments were made at 1, 3, and 6 months of CM administration, and at one month after CM discontinuation. Outcomes evaluated were the changes in serum albumin level, stool alpha-1 antitrypsin, and clinical symptoms such as, diarrhea, edema, weight change, and ascites. Of the 19 patients enrolled, 4 voluntarily withdrew consent, and the data from the 15 patients who completed the study were analyzed. Their median age was 15.0 years (interquartile range, 12.0-21.5) and the median time between the Fontan surgery and PLE diagnosis was 2.4 years. Serum albumin levels increased from 2.2 to 2.5 g/dL (p = 0.183), while stool alpha-1 antitrypsin levels significantly decreased from 215.6 to 75.5 mg/dL (p = 0.016) over six months. Patients with baseline diarrhea showed notable improvements: serum albumin increased from 1.8 to 2.4 g/dL (p = 0.138) and stool alpha-1 antitrypsin decreased from 220.3 to 75.5 mg/dL (p = 0.075) over 6 months. No serious adverse events occurred. CM demonstrated significant reductions in gastrointestinal protein losses, particularly in patients with baseline diarrhea. Trial registration NCT05474664.
40227430	Comment on "Severity of Congenital Heart Defects Affects Long-Term Somatic Development".	Congenital heart defects (CHD) have a significant effect on long-term physical development, with the severity of the disease playing a key role in growth challenges. While earlier studies have pointed out the importance of surgical treatments, nutritional support, and socioeconomic factors in influencing growth outcomes, there's still a need for deeper exploration to fine-tune these insights. By comparing various surgical approaches-like early versus late repairs and single-stage versus multi-stage procedures-we could better understand their unique impacts on growth. Moreover, taking a closer look at nutritional strategies, such as high-calorie formulas and enteral feeding, might shed light on how to alleviate growth issues. Socioeconomic differences also play a part in growth setbacks, but by adjusting for SES-related factors in our statistical analyses, we can better gauge their true effects. Tackling these issues through focused research could lead to improved personalized growth monitoring and intervention plans for CHD patients. This correspondence builds on these ideas and highlights the importance of future research to investigate the modifiable factors that affect growth outcomes.

40227424	Identification of circular RNAs as biomarkers for pupal age estimation and postmortem interval in forensically important Sarcophaga peregrina (Diptera: Sarcophagidae).	Accurate estimation of the pupal age in necrophagous flies is vital for determining the postmortem interval (PMI) in forensic entomology. Differential expression of genes (DEGs) exhibits temporal fluctuations across the developmental stages of these flies. This study evaluates circular RNAs (circRNAs) as novel molecular markers and develops a model for predicting pupal development time based on circRNA expression. Transcriptomic analysis of Sarcophaga peregrina pupae at various stages identified four circRNAs (circRNA_0037, circRNA_0531, circRNA_3373, circRNA_2847) showing significant expression differences. Using real-time quantitative PCR and regression analysis, we constructed a model to estimate development time, which accurately predicts intra-puparial periods. Additionally, we examined circRNA degradation patterns in pupae under lethal conditions and identified a clear degradation trend in circRNA_2847, suggesting its potential use for estimating the PMI. This study introduces new molecular markers and insights for estimating necrophagous fly pupal age.

40227403	Understanding the Endo- and Exo-mechanisms Involved in the Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Levan and Inulin Polymers.	This study explores the endo-levanase from <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> (LevB1), providing new insights into how this enzyme selectively hydrolyzes levan chains. By analyzing the first resolved crystal structure of LevB1, conducting detailed simulations, and comparing it to other endo- and exo-fructanases, we identified key factors underlying its specificity. Experiments designed to explore this specificity revealed the critical role of three minus and three plus subsites in determining the enzyme's endo-specificity. We identified six specific subsites essential for the enzyme's ability to cleave levan chains at random internal linkages (endo-specificity) rather than at defined fructosyl nonreducing ends (exo-specificity). This research underscores the importance of enzyme-fructan interaction stability during the catalytic reaction in this process, highlighting the need for dynamic modeling to fully capture enzyme specificity, as conventional docking alone cannot fully explain the stability and motion of carbohydrate chains in the catalytic site. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors that influence endo- and exo-cleavage specificity in levan and inulin polymers, with broader implications for fructan metabolism and, eventually, the industrial production of fructose and/or fructo-oligosaccharides.
40227389	The relationship between the skin microbiome and probiotics in the healing of burn injuries.	The relationship between the skin microbiome and probiotics in the healing of burn injuries has garnered significant attention in recent years. Burn injuries disrupt the delicate balance of the skin microbiome, leading to complications in the healing process. Probiotic therapies have emerged as promising interventions to restore microbial balance, inhibit biofilm formation, and accelerate tissue repair. Probiotics may also mitigate the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections, which is a major concern in burn units. By enhancing immune responses and stimulating the production of antimicrobial peptides, probiotics can effectively combat bacterial colonization and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains. A combination of probiotics with other therapies, such as phages or nanoparticles, holds significant promise for enhancing burn healing. This approach can effectively treat burn wounds by promoting wound healing synergy, preventing infection, modulating the immune response, and disrupting biofilms. Overall, the relationship between the skin microbiome and probiotics in burn wound healing has substantial potential to advance the field of burn wound management.

40227386	Identification of Recurrence-associated Gene Signatures and Machine Learning-based Prediction in IDH-Wildtype Histological Glioblastoma.	Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with frequent recurrence, yet the molecular mechanisms driving recurrence remain poorly understood. Identifying recurrence-associated genes may improve prognosis and treatment strategies. We applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to transcriptomic data from IDH-wildtype histological GBM in the CGGA-693 (n = 190) and CGGA-325 (n = 111) cohorts to identify recurrence-associated genes. These genes were validated using RT-qPCR and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (GSE174554, GSE131928). Their associations with immune cell composition were analyzed. Finally, we evaluated 113 machine learning algorithms to develop a multi-gene predictive model for GBM recurrence, with model performance assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and confusion matrix analysis. We identified eight recurrence-associated genes (CERS2, EML2, FNBP1, ICOSLG, MFAP3L, NPC1, ROGDI, SLAIN1) that were significantly differentially expressed between primary and recurrent GBM. The scRNA-seq analysis revealed cell-type-specific expression patterns, with eight genes predominantly enriched in oligodendrocytes, malignant GBM subtypes, and immune cells. Immune cell deconvolution showed significant alterations in macrophage polarization and NK cell activation in recurrent GBM. Machine learning analysis demonstrated that random forest (RF) was the most effective model, achieving AUC values of 0.998, 0.968, and 0.998 in the training, CGGA-693 validation, and CGGA-325 validation cohorts, respectively, suggesting high predictive accuracy. This study identifies novel recurrence-associated molecular signatures and establishes a machine learning-based predictive model in IDH-wildtype histological GBM.
40227385	Clinical characteristics and management of gunshot wound injuries to the peripheral nerves.	Peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) secondary to gunshot wounds (GSW) are a unique category of neurologic injury that can cause morbidity in young, otherwise healthy individuals, occurring in 25-36% of GSWs. The management of these injuries is understudied and varies throughout the literature. To characterize the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of peripheral nerve injury secondary to GSWs through a retrospective review of a single urban Level 1 trauma center's experience. Charts were reviewed from 2009 to 2021 for demographics, clinical characteristics, injury patterns, and treatment. Statistical analysis included chi-square testing for dichotomized variables with resultant odds ratios and measures of central tendency for all variables. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software (Boston, MA). 49 patients were included for analysis. The average age was 28.6 years old, 83.7% of patients were male, 79.6% were Black, and 74.1% were insured by Medicaid. 79.9% of patients had motor deficits, 73.5% had sensory deficits, and 61.2% had a combination. These deficits were not predictive of the need for peripheral nerve surgery (PNS) (p = 0.99). Median nerve injury was most predictive of requiring surgery with 67% requiring surgery compared to 10.6% of patients with other nerve injuries (67% versus 10.7, p < 0.014). Patients were more like to receive antibiotics if they had retained bullet fragments present (p < 0.001). Cefazolin was the most commonly administered antibiotic (65.31%). If PNS was indicated, it occurred on average 161.63 days post-injury. 46.93% had chronic pain, though there was no statistical difference in the development of chronic pain between upper versus lower extremity injuries (p = 0.99). PNIs secondary to GSW are heterogenous injuries due to the variability in the mechanism of injury, associated deficits, interventions required, and potential for recovery.
40227384	Survey on Japanese emergency physicians' awareness of advanced mechanical circulatory support upgrade therapy for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest receiving extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.	Destination therapy (DT) using an implantable left ventricular assist device (i-LVAD) in Japan has expanded treatment options for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) receiving extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). However, achieving hemodynamic stabilization and improved peripheral organ perfusion is essential. In patients with OHCA, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices may be inadequate in some cases, necessitating surgical MCS. Despite the growing importance of MCS upgrading, awareness among Japanese emergency physicians remains unclear. We aimed to assess awareness of advanced MCS upgrading strategies in refractory patients after ECPR. A nationwide survey of 293 emergency and critical care centers in Japan assessed awareness of i-LVAD therapy after ECPR. The questionnaire collected data on demographics, LVAD strategy recognition, MCS upgrade practices, and barriers. Of 90 facilities (31%) that responded, 87 (30%) consented to using their responses in the analysis. Awareness of DT was 59.8%. Notably, 66.7% and 70.1% of the respondents recognized that MCS upgrading could lead to i-LVAD treatment and heart transplantation, respectively. The major barrier to MCS upgrade therapy was the facility's inability to implement it. DT awareness was similar between IMPELLA-registered and non-registered facilities, but i-LVAD indication recognition was higher in IMPELLA-registered facilities (78.0% vs. 51.4%, P = 0.009). The low survey response rate suggests limited MCS upgrade awareness among Japanese emergency physicians. Although facilities recognize pathways to i-LVAD and transplantation, barriers to their implementation persist. IMPELLA-registered facilities showed higher i-LVAD indication recognition, reflecting their accessibility to LV unloading devices and connections with backup hospitals.
40227383	PET tracer development for imaging α-synucleinopathies.	Abnormal α-synuclein aggregation is a key neuropathological hallmark of α-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and several other neurological disorders, and closely contributes to pathogenesis. The primary characteristics of α-synucleinopathies are selective targeted neurodegeneration and the accumulation of Lewy pathologies. Specifically, α-synuclein positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers target the fibrillar forms of the protein, thus enhancing early diagnosis and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness for various α-synucleinopathies. Therefore, in vivo detection of α-synuclein aggregates using targeted radiolabeled probes would aid in drug development, early diagnosis, and ongoing disease monitoring. As such, no promising α-synuclein biomarkers suitable for clinical applications have been reported. PET is a valuable non-invasive technique for imaging drug distribution in tissues and receptor occupancy at target sites in living animals and humans. Advances in PET biomarkers have significantly enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying PD. This review summarizes recent ongoing efforts in the development of selective PET tracers for α-synuclein and discusses future perspectives.
40227382	Neuropeptide Signaling in Glioblastoma: A Comprehensive Review of the Current State and Future Direction.	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by complex pathophysiology and significant clinical challenges. Emerging research emphasizes the crucial role of neuropeptides in GBM and its influence on tumor progression, immune modulation, and therapy resistance. This review highlighted the importance of neuropeptides and their receptors in maintaining brain homeostasis and the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment. We discussed new therapeutic frontiers, including neuropeptide receptors as therapeutic targets, renin-angiotensin system, peptide receptor modulation, targeted cytotoxic analogs (such as Bombesin and Somatostatin), and advances in targeted radiotherapy. The review highlighted the potential of neuropeptide-based targeted therapies to improve GBM patient outcomes and suggests future research directions. This underscores the importance of targeting neuropeptide-related pathways for innovative therapeutic strategies in GBM, aiming to enhance patient prognosis and effective treatment.

40227379	Racial Inequality in the Prevalence of Symptom-Based Depression Versus Self-Reported Medical Diagnosis in Brazil.	A cross-sectional study was conducted with Brazilian adults from the 2019 Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde (PNS 2019; National Health Survey, in English) who self-declared race/skin color white or black (n = 87,187), to investigate racial inequality in the prevalence of symptom-based versus self-reported depression. Symptom-based depression was screened using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cutoff ≥ 10), while medical diagnosis was self-reported. Prevalence of agreement (presence of medical diagnosis among those with symptoms) and disagreement (absence of medical diagnosis among those with symptoms) were compared according to race/skin color. The Odds Ratio (OR) for the association between both depression indicators and race/skin color were estimated by Logistic regression adjusted by socioeconomic variables. The black population had a higher prevalence of symptom-based depression than medical diagnosis (11.0% versus 8.6%; 2.5 percentual points (pp)), with greater differences among younger adults (6.0 pp), without a partner (3.6 pp), with lower income (3.9 pp), education (3.0 pp), less developed regions (north: 3.6 pp; northeast: 4.2 pp) and those with recent access to medical care (4.5 pp). The white population had a higher prevalence of medical diagnosis than symptom-based depression (10.6% versus 12.5%; -1.9 pp), with greater differences between those with higher income (-7.4 pp), education (-4.5 pp) and from south region (-6.0 pp). Disagreement was higher among black individuals while agreement was higher among white, with significant inequality among women for both agreement (33.5% in black versus 41.7% in white) and disagreement (66.5% in black versus 58.3% in white). The black population had a lower chance of having medical diagnosis of depression (OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.70-0.84) than white, regardless of socioeconomic variables. Racial inequality was identified in the prevalence of symptom-based versus self-reported depression, with greater inequality among women and those with lower income and education.

40227371	[How to: correctly read scientific articles : Research design and methodology].	Criteria for assessment of the significance of scientific articles are presented. The focus is on research design and methodology, illustrated by the classical study on prehospital volume treatment of severely injured individuals with penetrating torso injuries by Bickell et al. (1994). A well-thought out research design is crucial for the success of a scientific study and is documented in a study protocol beforehand. A hypothesis is a provisional explanation or prediction and must be testable, falsifiable, precise, and relevant. There are various types of randomization methods, with the randomized controlled trial being the gold standard for clinical interventional studies. When reading a scientific article it is important to verify whether the research design and setting align with the research question and whether potential sources of error have been considered and controlled. Critical scrutiny should also be applied to references, the funding and expertise of the researchers.

Recognition and support of these consequences while investigating underlying etiology is essential.
40227364	Effects of infrapatellar straps on lower limb muscle synergies during running.	Infrapatellar straps are commonly recommended for treating and preventing running-related knee injuries, and their effects have been investigated at the level of individual muscles. However, the use of straps may influence the neuromuscular control strategies of the knee, and the nervous system controls numerous muscles modularly through muscle synergy. This study aimed to investigate the effects of infrapatellar straps on muscle synergies during running. Kinematic, kinetic, and electromyography data from seventeen participants were recorded during running at self-selected speeds, both with and without infrapatellar straps. Muscle synergies were extracted from electromyography data using non-negative matrix factorization, including the number of modules, dynamic motor control index (DMC), muscle activation combinations, and temporal activation coefficients. Knee flexion angles and extension moments were estimated using OpenSim. Although wearing infrapatellar straps did not affect the number of modules or DMC, knee extensor weightings in the modules associated with the stance phase were reduced with the straps. Additionally, peak temporal activation in the propulsion phase was delayed when wearing the straps. Knee extension moments during the stance phase decreased significantly. While infrapatellar straps did not affect muscle synergy modularity, they altered activation patterns and weightings, suggesting that straps may help reduce quadriceps muscle forces.
40227363	Confocal micro-X-ray fluorescence and total reflection X-ray fluorescence analyses of Ryugu sample in a laboratory environment.	This study analyzed Ryugu samples utilizing confocal micro-X-ray fluorescence (CM-XRF) and total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF), in which information of elemental mapping as well as the content of trace elements could be obtained separately, and respectively. In CM-XRF, polycapillary lenses are placed in front of the X-ray tube and detector, and elemental information in the overlapping region of both focus points was obtained. Three-dimensional elemental distributions could be obtained by scanning a sample; the Ryugu sample was placed on an Al plate with one center, and the images of Fe, Ni, Cr, and Ca were obtained. The outlines of these elements were almost equivalent; however, as the energy of Ca Kα was low, its intensity in the elemental mapping was weak. Non-destructive TXRF measurements were performed to measure the trace elements in the Ryugu sample. We then performed quantitative analysis and determined the concentrations of trace elements such as Ga, Ge, and Se. The concentrations of these elements are higher than those in the CI chondrites. Therefore, we verified that the 3D elemental distributions and quantitative measurements in the Ryugu sample were performed without destruction.
40227361	Reliability and validity of a full-body function Get-Up test in older adults.	Identifying deficiencies in physical function in older adults is critical to evaluate important health outcomes like sarcopenia, but current protocols are expensive and require complex equipment. This study evaluates the reliability and validity of an inexpensive, simple new Get-Up test in older adults. It involves participants moving quickly from standing upright, to lying flat, then rising to a standing position unassisted. A total of 293 relatively healthy older adults without severe health conditions (e.g., cardiovascular, psychological, degenerative, or physical impairments) completed the Get-Up test twice for familiarization and twice for timed trials on two separate days alongside numerous validated clinical tests commonly used to assess strength, function, and fitness in older adults. ANOVA with post-hoc analysis and intraclass correlation (0.928 (95% CI [0.914, 0.940])) indicated strong reliability, with the second timed trial comparable to trials on a separate day. The Get-Up test was significantly (p <.0001) negatively correlated with all referenced measures of strength (Biodex peak torque, r = -.41, 1-repetition maximum, r = -.26, handgrip, r = -.38) and function (Short Physical Performance Battery, r = -.49, gait speed, r = -.39) and significantly (p <.0001) positively correlated with fitness (400-m walk, r =.70), which strongly predicted Get-Up test performance, suggesting good validity. Poor performance was associated with baseline sarcopenia prevalence (bottom tertile vs. top tertile: odds ratio 3.99 (95% CI 1.64-9.67)) and sarcopenia incidence after 1-year follow-up (hazard ratio 3.47 (1.10, 10.98)), suggesting potential to evaluate sarcopenia. This simple and safe Get-Up test requires minimal equipment, personnel, and expertise, yet it has good reliability and validity as a potential novel tool for full-body physical function in older adults that is associated with sarcopenia prevalence and incidence.

We analyzed the patterns of vascular injury encountered in our experience and gauged the impact of time delay and the nature of injury on our post-surgical outcomes.
40227359	ADAMTS18 deficiency leads to abnormal brain methylation metabolism, dysregulated neuroinflammatory response, and unsound blood-brain barrier structure in mice.	ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family is a group of secretory proteases involved in the maintenance of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and neuronal disease. ADAMTS18 is a member of this family and has been linked to the integrity of the human brain's white matter. However, the cellular and molecular basis of ADAMTS18 in brain metabolism and homeostasis remains unclear. In this study, a total of 47,719 genes were identified in 8 independent wild type (WT) and Adamts18 knockout (KO) mouse brain samples using brain transcriptomic analysis. The abundance of 100 genes in brain was significantly different between WT and KO mice. ADAMTS18 deficiency resulted in decreased S-adenosine homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) levels, impaired brain methyl cycle metabolism and dysregulation of neuroinflammatory-related factors (e.g., Lrg1, and Lcn2) in mouse brain. The number and branching complexity of microglia in brain tissue of Adamts18 KO mice were significantly reduced. Adamts18 KO mice also showed poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Mechanically, ADAMTS18 deficiency resulted in significant downregulation of Il- 34, Csf1r, Cx3cl1, Cx3cr1, Fn, Tgfb1, Tgfbr2, Smad4 and Sall1 genes related to microglia expansion, migration, characteristic development and maintenance. BBB integrity related markers Glut1, Plvap, Zo- 1, Occludin or Aqp- 4 were partially dysregulated in the brain tissue of Adamts18 KO mice and significantly deteriorated after LPS stimulation. Collectively, these results shed light on the significance of ADAMTS18 in brain methyl cycle metabolism, neuroinflammatory regulation and BBB structure maintenance.
40227358	Event-related potential in juvenile obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of error- and correct-related negativity.	The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative wave observed in electroencephalography (EEG) following errors in certain neurocognitive tasks, such as the Flanker task. This wave has been found to be heightened in individuals suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in several adult studies and meta-analyses. Therefore, the ERN may serve as a relevant neurobiological marker for OCD. However, the ERN exhibits some developmental aspects. Considering this, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies examining the ERN in children and adolescents with OCD. We identified nine studies that compared ERN amplitude during a Flanker task between youth with OCD and matched controls. Our meta-analysis revealed that ERN amplitude was elevated in juvenile OCD patients compared to controls. We did not find that age, task accuracy, or sex moderated the difference between patients and controls. In conclusion, our meta-analysis confirmed that the ERN observed during the Flanker task may be a relevant biological marker for OCD in children and adolescents.
40227357	Intelligent Point-of-Care Biosensing Platform Based on Luminescent Nanoparticles and Microfluidic Biochip with Machine Vision Algorithm Analysis.	Realizing the point-of-care tumor markers biodetection with good convenience and high sensitivity possesses great significance for prompting cancer monitoring and screening in biomedical study field. Herein, the quantum dots luminescence and microfluidic biochip with machine vision algorithm-based intelligent biosensing platform have been designed and manufactured for point-of-care tumor markers diagnostics. The employed quantum dots with excellent photoluminescent performance are modified with specific antibody as the optical labeling agents for the designed sandwich structure immunoassay. The corresponding biosensing investigations of the designed biodetection platform illustrate several advantages involving high sensitivity (~ 0.021 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>), outstanding accessibility, and great integrability. Moreover, related test results of human-sourced artificial saliva samples demonstrate better detection capabilities compared with commercially utilized rapid test strips. Combining these infusive abilities, our elaborate biosensing platform is expected to exhibit potential applications for the future point-of-care tumor markers diagnostic area.
40227355	Study of sampling phases for body odor sampling prior to analysis by TD-GC×GC/ToFMS.	Body odor consists of a complex matrix of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which has garnered increasing interest in fields like medicine for its potential in disease diagnosis. However, the field of body odor analysis is advancing slowly, partly due to a lack of standardized methodologies. Although gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is widely used for VOC analysis, there is a broad range of sampling and extraction methods, leading to different or even sometimes contradictory results. To move toward standardized procedures, this study compares five sampling phases for direct body odor sampling in terms of analytical cleanliness and VOC trapping/release efficiency: gauze, glass beads, PowerSorb<sup>®</sup>, Getxent<sup>®</sup> microtubes, and passive sampling pillows (PSP). Thermodesorption was employed to simplify the protocol and minimize contamination or sample loss, which often occurs during multistep processes. Given the matrix's complexity and the need to detect trace-level compounds, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC/ToFMS) was used to achieve high sensitivity and peak capacity. PSP and PowerSorb<sup>®</sup> demonstrated the best performance, with mean recovery yields of 95% and 71%, respectively, and 22% and 10% variability, ensuring good repeatability. These findings, initially obtained under simulated conditions with a synthetic mixture, were validated with real body odor samples, with an optimal sampling duration estimated between 30 min and 1 h. This study not only highlights these effective sampling solutions but also emphasizes the risks associated with using sorbent phases that lack adequate analytical cleanliness (i.e., clean blank) such as gauze.
40227354	Aptamer-based microfluidics for the detection of cancer biomarkers.	Early diagnosis of cancer is a major concern in clinical medicine. Recently, aptamer-based microfluidics have offered promising platforms for the sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers. This review summarizes the application of aptamer sensors in the microfluidic platform for cancer biomarker analysis. The materials for microfluidic aptamer biosensor fabrication, unique design based on microposts, materials for enhanced detection capability, and the application principle of combining with other detection methods are introduced in detail, so as to demonstrate its development potential in cancer diagnosis and personalized therapy. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for developing miniaturized diagnostic platforms are discussed.
40227352	Management of Carbapenem Resistant Gram-Negative Infections.	Due to increasing carbapenem usage, resistance to gram negative bacteria is steadily going up in India. Resistance is often enzyme-mediated and transmissible horizontally by plasmids. Use of invasive lines, procedures, prior antibiotic exposure, recent hospitalization, ICU stay, colonization and severity of illness are important risk factors for infections with these bacteria. Before starting therapy, it is important to distinguish colonization from true infection. Early targeted therapy using rapid diagnostic methods is important to ensure optimal outcomes. A growing body of literature recommends the use of novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors over polymyxins in the management of these infections. Treatment strategies for carbapenem resistant Enterobacterales differs from non-Enterobacterales and is discussed in detail in this review. Infection control and antimicrobial stewardship are crucial preventive measures to curb the emergence of further resistance.

40227350	Exploring the potential of essential oils against airborne fungi from cultural heritage conservation premises.	The activity of six essential oils was investigated against eight fungal isolates (four Aspergillus and four Penicillium species) isolated from cultural heritage conservation premises in Serbia. To analyze the chemical composition of essential oils (EOs), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was employed. The antifungal activity of selected EOs was investigated using microdilution and microatmosphere methods while the commercial biocide benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was used as a control. Furthermore, molecular docking was used as an efficacious in silico method for the determination of interaction between dominant EO compounds and enzyme CYP51, essential for fungal ergosterol synthesis. It was demonstrated that BAC, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Gaultheria procumbens EOs had the strongest antifungal activity, which is in concordance with the results of molecular docking. Namely, the highest energy of enzyme-cofactor interaction was obtained for eugenol (the dominant component of Syzygium aromaticum and C. zeylanicum EOs). Moreover, it was found that the most resistant fungal isolates were A. flavus and A. niger, while A. sydowii and P. citrinum were the most susceptible. The results of our study point to the possibility of using studied environmentally friendly biocides of biological origin for the preservation of historical monuments and artifacts.
40227349	Rabies virus, Bartonella koehlerae and Leishmania infantum coinfection in a black Myotis (Myotis nigricans) from southeastern Brazil.	The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of important zoonotic agents in Brazil in urban bats and to evaluate the existence of coinfections in bats diagnosed with rabies. In 2021, organ samples from 52 bats from urban areas in southeastern Brazil were used to diagnose rabies and other zoonoses occurring in the region. The positive samples were sequenced, characterized and included in GenBank. A co-infection involving the rabies virus, Bartonella koehlerae, and Leishmania infantum was identified in a Black Myotis bat collected from a household in São Manuel, a city endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. Phylogenetic analysis showed similarity between the RABV sequence obtained and reference sequences from humans and wild canids, as well as confirming the identity of the Bartonella and Leishmania species detected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a bat co-infected with rabies virus, B. koehlerae, and L. infantum. The co-infection of three important pathogens in a Black Myotis highlights the multifaceted role of neotropical bats as reservoirs of zoonotic agents. This unprecedented finding reinforces the potential of these animals to contribute to the transmission dynamics of viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens, and the importance of molecular surveillance in bats.

40227341	Exploring the influence of water micro assemblies on protein folding, enzyme catalysis and membrane dynamics.	Water is central to biological processes not only as a solvent, but also as an agent shaping macromolecular behavior. Insights into water micro assemblies (WMA), defined by transient regions of low-density water (LDW) and high-density water (HDW), have highlighted their potential impact on biological phenomena. LDW, with its structured hydrogen bonding networks and reduced density, stabilizes hydrophobic interfaces and promotes ordered molecular configurations. Conversely, HDW, with its dynamic and flexible nature, facilitates transitions, solute mobility and molecular flexibility. By correlating experimental observations with simulations, we explore the influence of WMA on three key biological processes. In protein folding, LDW may stabilize hydrophobic cores and secondary structures by forming structured exclusion zones, while HDW may introduce dynamic flexibility, promoting the resolution of folding intermediates and leading to dynamic rearrangements. In enzyme catalysis, LDW may form structured hydration shells around active sites stabilizing active sites over longer timescales, while HDW may support substrate access and catalytic flexibility within active sites. In membrane dynamics, LDW may stabilize lipid headgroups, forming structured hydration layers that enhance membrane rigidity and stability, while HDW may ensure the nanosecond-scale flexibility required for vesicle formation and fusion. Across these tree processes, the WMA's energy contributions, timescales and spatial scales align with the forces and dynamics involved, highlighting the role of LDW and HDW in modulating cellular interactions. This perspective holds implications for the design of lab-on-chip devices, advancements in sensor technologies, development of biomimetic membranes for drug delivery, creation of novel therapeutics and deeper understanding of protein misfolding diseases.
40227339	Dietary propylene glycol mitigates cold stress and improves physio-metabolic responses in Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) fingerlings reared at low temperature.	A 60-day feeding trial was carried out to determine the effect of propylene glycol (PG) on feed intake and growth in Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (striped catfish) reared at low temperature (18.0 ± 1.0 °C) re-circulatory aquaculture system (RAS) with a flow rate of 1.6 L min<sup>-1</sup>. Six isonitrogenous (370.0 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) and isocaloric (17.22 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup> dietary energy) practical diets were designed and prepared with varying levels of PG, viz., control (0 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> PG), T<sub>2.5</sub> (2.5 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> PG), T<sub>5.0</sub> (5.0 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> PG), T<sub>7.5</sub> (7.5 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> PG), T<sub>10.0</sub> (10.0 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> PG), and T<sub>12.5</sub> (12.5 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> PG) diet. Fish were fed twice daily till satiation. The result showed that dietary supplementation of propylene glycol showed significantly higher feed intake in the treatment groups than in control (p < 0.05). The highest feed intake, growth rate, and feed conversion were observed in T<sub>10.0</sub> group (p < 0.05). However, these did not vary within T<sub>2.5</sub>, T<sub>5.0</sub>, and T<sub>7.5</sub> fed groups (p < 0.05). The highest protease and amylase activities were found in fish fed with 10.0 and 10.0-12.5 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> PG fed group (p < 0.05). However, lipase activity showed an increasing trend with the PG supplementation (p < 0.05). Metabolic enzymes and oxidative stress enzymes activities were highest in T<sub>10.0</sub> group fed with 10.0 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> PG. Serum total protein and albumin were also increased with PG supplementation and exhibited maximum values at 10.0 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> PG supplementation. These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with propylene glycol at a dose of 7.5-10.0 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> can improve feed intake, growth, feed conversion, and metabolic activities in P. hypophthalmus fingerlings raised at low temperature.

40227334	The dominant negative mutation of PAX9 in nonsyndromic tooth agenesis.	Paired box 9 (PAX9) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of human dentition. Although various mutations in the PAX9 gene have been identified to date, the mechanisms by which these mutations cause non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) remain not fully understood. To study the pathogenesis of NSTA, we investigated a Chinese NSTA family.
40227332	Seventeen-year outcome of surgical management of severe early onset kyphoscoliosis in a patient with arthrochalasia-type Ehlers-Danlos.	We report on the surgical management of severe early onset kyphoscoliosis in a 5-year-old patient with the rare arthrochalasia subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, who we have followed for 17 years post-operatively. Successful correction of the deformity with an excellent outcome was achieved with minimal morbidity using MAGEC™ (MAGnetic Expansion Control) growth rods instead of traditional growth rods, undertaken with the close involvement of plastic surgical colleagues. Our patient suffered only one minor surgical complication (thought to be allergic rather than traumatic in origin), despite having skin so fragile that rubbing his skin with a disinfectant wipe was sufficient to cause skin breakdown. The non-invasive lengthening that the MAGEC rods allowed enabled us to avoid repeated open surgeries which would have had a high risk of complications, most notably wound breakdown with poor healing, and we advocate their use in similar cases.

40227329	[New systemic treatment approaches for malignant eyelid tumors].	Malignant tumors of the eyelids represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Modern treatment approaches, such as targeted treatment and immunotherapy are becoming increasingly more important, particularly in advanced and metastatic stages; however, these can cause side effects such as fatigue, skin reactions and gastrointestinal complaints, which require close monitoring. An effective treatment option for advanced, metastasized or inoperable basal cell carcinoma is the well-manageable oral treatment with hedgehog inhibitors; however, these innovative, systemic treatment approaches require an individually adapted management, which is determined by an interdisciplinary tumor board and accompanied by a specialized, multiprofessional team to ensure optimal patient care.

40227325	Black scholarship on HIV and health: Configuring public health for Black emancipation.	The burden of Canada's HIV epidemic has fallen disproportionately on Black communities. Canadian public health authorities and research institutions have been generally impervious to calls for responses that mobilize and support Black community expertise and leadership, and focus on the needs and circumstances of those communities. A group of Canadian scholars and community health practitioners came together in 2022 as the Interim Committee on HIV among Black Canadian Communities (ICHBCC) to develop the Black HIV Manifesto and advocate for transformative responses to HIV on the basis of the manifesto. The ICHBCC conceived and championed the Special Section on HIV, Health, and Black Canadian Communities published in the current issue of the Canadian Journal of Public Health. This special section brings together Black scholars who report and discuss their research with Black communities. We expect that the special section will engage Black scholars and other Black stakeholders to strengthen the knowledge base on HIV among Black Canadian communities, which in turn will inform new avenues for transformative policy, programs, community engagement, and advocacy in response to HIV. Furthermore, we hope that the special section initiates scholarly and community interest in Black emancipation as the conceptual basis for public health scholarship and practice to promote health equity and justice.

40227318	Synthesis, structure, spectral and redox properties of 3-pyrrolyl BODIPYs containing one to eight bromides at the pyrrole carbons.	We report the regioselective bromination of <i>meso</i>-aryl 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY by introducing one to eight bromides at the pyrrole carbons of three pyrrole rings by treating <i>meso</i>-aryl 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY with <i>N</i>-bromosuccinimide/Br<sub>2</sub> in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> under mild reaction conditions. The crystal structures of five of these pyrrole-brominated <i>meso</i>-aryl 3-pyrrolyl BODIPYs indicated that the appended pyrrolyl group underwent distortion from the 12-atom mean plane of the BODIPY, and a maximum distortion of 40° was observed for octabrominated <i>meso</i>-aryl 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY. Upon increasing the number of bromides from one to eight at the pyrrole carbons of <i>meso</i>-aryl 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY, the following key observations were made: (i) the absorption bands experienced a bathochromic shift up to the introduction of five bromides, followed by a hypsochromic shift from six to eight bromides, indicating that the magnitude of the absorption band shifts was non-additive; (ii) the fluorescence band experienced bathochromic shifts along with a decrease in quantum yield and singlet state lifetime; (iii) the electrochemical studies indicated that brominated 3-pyrrolyl BODIPYs were electron deficient and underwent easier reductions with an increase in the number of bromides at the pyrrole carbons of 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY. A linear additive relationship was noted between <i>E</i><sub>1/2red</sub> and the number of bromide groups at the pyrrole carbons of 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY and (iv) the halogenated 3-pyrrolyl BODIPYs were highly efficient in generating singlet oxygen. A linear relationship was observed between the singlet oxygen quantum yields and the number of bromides at the pyrrole carbons of 3-pyrrolyl BODIPY. Furthermore, DFT and TD-DFT studies supported these experimental observations.
40227317	Electric field-induced modulation of VX nerve agent binding on h-BN nanotubes: a computational perspective.	The interaction of toxic nerve agent VX with BN nanotube and nanocage is investigated in the presence of static electric field along perpendicular direction utilizing density functional theory (DFT). Accordingly, a static electric field (SEF) of strength 0.010 a.u and 0.020 a.u is passed along + Y and - Y axis and the effect on adsorption is analyzed. Upon interaction with VX, it was observed that the application of SEF in the + Y direction led to an increase interaction distance, whereas -Y SEF resulted in a decreased interaction distance between the nanotube and target gas. Among the observed complexations + Y SEF enhanced the sensing property of the nanotube by decreasing its E<sub>ads</sub> and increasing its electronic responses. Moreover, the study also confirms that BN nanotube in + Y SEF has a short recovery time of 0.37 s in average and hence can perform as an effective sensor for the detection of VX.
40227316	Deregulated mRNA and microRNA Expression Patterns in the Prefrontal Cortex of the BTBR Mouse Model of Autism.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Since no single gene variant accounts for more than 1% of the cases, the converging actions of ASD-related genes and other factors, including microRNAs (miRNAs), may contribute to ASD pathogenesis. To date, few studies have simultaneously investigated the mRNA and miRNA profiles in an ASD-relevant model. The BTBR mouse strain displays a range of behaviors with ASD-like features but little is known about the protein-coding and noncoding gene expression landscape that may underlie the ASD-like phenotype. Here we performed parallel mRNA and miRNA profiling using the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of BTBR and C57BL/6 J (B6) mice. This identified 1063 differentially expressed genes and 48 differentially expressed miRNAs. Integration of mRNA and miRNA data identified a strong inverse relationship between upregulated (DEGs) and downregulated miRNAs, and vice versa. Pathway analysis, taking account of the inverse relationship between differentially expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs highlighted significant shared enrichment in immune signaling, myelination, and neurodevelopmental processes. Notably, miRNA changes were predicted to affect synapse-related functions but we did not find enrichment of protein-coding genes linked to cellular components or biological processes related to synapses in the PFC of BTBR mice, indicating processes may evade miRNA control. In contrast, other miRNAs were predicted to have extensive relationships with DEGs suggesting their role as potential hub coordinators of gene expression. Profiling findings were confirmed via qRT-PCR for representative protein-coding transcripts and miRNAs. Our study underscores the complex interplay between gene expression and miRNA regulation within immune and inflammatory pathways in the BTBR model, offering insights into the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of ASD. These results support the value of the BTBR mouse model and identify strategies that could adjust molecular pathways for therapeutic applications in ASD research.
40227313	Roles of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 in Muscle Wasting and Osteopenia in Mice with Hyponatremia.	Hyponatremia is associated with sarcopenia and osteoporosis in elderly individuals. Skeletal muscle releases myokines, which affect distant organs, including bone. However, the detailed mechanisms by which hyponatremia influences muscle and bone remain unclear. We herein investigated the effects of hyponatremia on muscle, bone, and myokines linking muscle to bone in mice treated with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) or furosemide, which induce hyponatremia. Muscle mass and bone mineral density (BMD) were analyzed 8 weeks after the administration of dDAVP or furosemide. dDAVP significantly reduced grip strength, but did not affect tissue weights of gastrocnemius or soleus muscles of mice. Furosemide significantly decreased muscle mass, tissue weights of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and grip strength in mice. dDAVP and furosemide decreased trabecular BMD, trabecular bone volume, and cortical BMD at the femurs. Among myokines linking muscle to bone, hyponatremia reduced expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 in gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and serum IGF-1 levels in mice. In simple regression analyses, serum IGF-1 levels were positively related to muscle IGF-1 expression, trabecular bone volume, and cortical BMD in mice. The administration of sodium chloride solution to mice ameliorated the decreases in grip strength, muscle mass, trabecular bone volume, cortical BMD, and the levels of muscle and circulating IGF-1 in furosemide-treated mice. The present study demonstrated that hyponatremia induces muscle and bone loss as well as a decrease in muscle IGF-1 expression in mice. The present findings suggest that IGF-1 might be related to muscle wasting and bone loss induced by hyponatremia in mice.
40227311	Network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis, and experimental validation to reveal the target and pharmacological mechanism of DHDK in treating breast cancer.	Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Currently, most treatments involve combinations of multiple therapies. However, existing drug therapies remain limited by side effects and drug resistance. (1E,4E)- 1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)hepta- 1,4-dien- 3-one (DHDK) is a safer, potential targeted drug with strong anti-cancer activity, derived from mistletoe. However, few studies have explored its related treatment mechanisms. This study combined network pharmacology, bioinformatics, molecular docking, and experimental verification to elucidate the mechanism of action of DHDK in treating breast cancer. The SwissTargetPrediction database, Therapeutic Target Databases, and Comparative Toxicogenomics Databases were used for drug target identification. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was employed for differential gene screening. The GeneCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, and Therapeutic Target Databases (TTD) were utilized to identify DHDK's breast cancer treatment targets. Nexus genes were identified using Cytoscape software after protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) Resource were conducted to investigateunderlying mechanisms. Target were identified through molecular docking, and the selected signaling pathway was validatedby qPCR. Comprehensive analysis yielded possible targets and mechanisms: DHDK binds to JAK1, inhibiting the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in downstream target proteins, recruiting and phosphorylating the transcription factor STAT, downregulating STAT1, and further inhibiting the downstream effector BCL2, ultimately inhibits the anti-apoptotic effect of tumor cells. Therefore, DHDK is a highly promising targeted anti-cancer drug. Clinical trial number: not applicable.
40227310	Targeting ferroptosis: a novel pathway in oral, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers.	Malignancies of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx rank as the seventh most prevalent cancers globally, characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Despite advancements in conventional therapies, these cancers often demonstrate recurrence and treatment resistance. This review investigates ferroptosis, an iron-dependent regulated cell death mechanism, as a novel therapeutic target to overcome resistance and recurrence in these cancers. A narrative review study was conducted using online databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search incorporated keywords such as "ferroptosis", "oral squamous cell carcinoma", "oropharyngeal cancer", "hypopharyngeal cancer", "laryngeal cancer", "iron metabolism", and "lipid peroxidation". Studies focusing on molecular mechanisms, ferroptosis regulation, and therapeutic applications were included. Key findings highlighted the involvement of genes like CA9, CAV1, and SLC7 A11 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), contributing to progression and resistance. Ferroptosis inducers such as resveratrol and quercetin effectively promoted ferroptosis in OSCC by targeting pathways like p53/SLC7 A11. In hypopharyngeal and oropharyngeal cancers, agents like ascorbic acid and RSL3 enhanced lipid peroxidation, while laryngeal cancers showed resistance through molecules like SLC3 A2 and KPNA2, which could be counteracted with targeted therapies. Nanotechnology-based approaches, including photodynamic therapy and nanofiber membranes, offer potential for localized and effective ferroptosis induction. Ferroptosis holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for treating head and neck cancers by addressing treatment resistance and recurrence. Future research should focus on optimizing combination therapies, understanding molecular heterogeneity, and translating preclinical findings into clinical applications to improve patient outcomes.
40227309	Taurine alleviates colitis by regulating oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, ER stress, and apoptotic pathways.	Colitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the colon, characterized by oxidative stress, ER stress, and apoptosis, which leads to severe tissue damage. Existing treatments are associated with significant side effects, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic agents. Taurine is a commonly consumed bioactive sulfur-containing amino acid, recognized for its cyto-protective property. In this study, we are using a male Wistar rat model for 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and treated them with taurine. Colitis development was indicated by repeated loose bloody stools, reduced appetite, and weight loss. Macroscopic examination revealed an inflamed colon surface with ulcerations, while histopathology showed a destroyed crypt structure and damage to the epithelial and mucosal layers in the colitis-affected rats. However, taurine administration reverses such adverse effects of colitis. Taurine significantly mitigates the oxidative stress by upregulating the level of anti-oxidant molecules, such as CAT, GST and SOD, which were significantly down-regulated in colitis. In addition, increased levels of inflammatory molecules (TNF-α, IL- 1β, IL- 6, MCP- 1, ICAM- 1, and VCAM- 1) in colitis were reduced by taurine supplementation. Furthermore, we observed taurine alleviates colitis induced up-regulation of important endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers like, CHOP, GRP78, calpain 1, and caspase 12. We have also demonstrated that taurine supplementation reverses colitis induced apoptosis by assessing the modulation of apoptotic markers (Bax, Bcl- 2, caspase 9 and caspase 3). Furthermore, no instances of toxicity from taurine were observed. Thus, taurine shows a potential to be utilized as a therapeutic agent for colitis with further detailed investigation.
40227308	Protective effects of Tanshinone IIA preconditioning against hypobaric hypoxia-induced lung injury in a rat model.	Tanshinone IIA (Tan-IIA), derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat cardiovascular diseases and pulmonary hypertension. This study investigates the potential of Tan-IIA preconditioning as a protective strategy against hypoxia-induced lung injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 ± 25 g) were divided into four groups: normoxia, normoxia with Tan-IIA, hypobaric hypoxia, and hypobaric hypoxia with Tan-IIA. Tan-IIA was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg body weight one hour before exposure to hypobaric hypoxia (simulated altitude of 25,000 feet for 48 h). Pulmonary edema was assessed by measuring transvacuolar leakage of sodium fluorescein dye and lung water content. Exposure to hypoxia triggered redox imbalances, inflammation, and changes in levels of nitric oxide (NOx), endothelin- 1, and Na/K ATPase, which contributed to pulmonary edema. Tan-IIA preconditioning, particularly at 20 mg/kg, was effective in reversing these disturbances. Tan-IIA modulated the expression of key signaling molecules, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38, as well as downstream activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) subunits (Jun and Fos), thus reducing inflammation. Its protective effects were partly due to increased NO levels and decreased endothelin, which lowered pulmonary vasoconstriction and permeability, respectively. Additionally, enhanced Na/K ATPase expression via hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1) and AP- 1 pathways promoted alveolar fluid clearance, while interactions between nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and c-Jun highlighted the anti-oxidative properties of Tanshinone IIA. These findings demonstrate that Tanshinone IIA preconditioning protects against hypoxia-induced lung injury by mitigating pulmonary leakage. This highlights its potential therapeutic application in hypoxic lung conditions.
40227307	Lipoic acid as a protective agent against lipopolysaccharide and other natural toxins: a comprehensive review.	Alpha-lipoic acid, also known as lipoate or lipoic acid (LA), is naturally present in the mitochondria of cells, where it functions as a cofactor for dehydrogenase enzyme complexes. It has also been reported that LA is a potent antioxidant. Not only does it scavenge free radicals directly, but it can also regenerate other essential cellular antioxidants. LA exhibits various anti-inflammatory effects and offers protection to mitochondria. Numerous studies have assessed the potential protective effects of LA against natural toxins, including lipopolysaccharides, galactosamine, mycotoxins, snake venoms, and toxins derived from cyanobacteria and plants. In general, the results of these studies indicate that LA can be effective in mitigating various toxicities, primarily due to the previously mentioned capabilities. Furthermore, novel mechanisms have been proposed for LA against specific toxins, for example, direct inactivation of secretory phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> in some snake venoms or enhancement of p-glycoprotein activity to prevent saxitoxin entry into the neuronal cells. However, the gaps in the available data from most animal experiments conducted to date have resulted in insufficient evidence to justify further clinical evaluations of the effects of LA on human poisoning cases. Consequently, more extensive research is required to address these gaps and fully realize the therapeutic potential of this valuable substance.
40227306	Effects of empagliflozin and its combination with docetaxel on LNCaP and DU- 145 prostate cancer cell lines: cytotoxicity and molecular pathway analysis.	Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have gained attention for their potential therapeutic applications in cancer treatment. Recent Mendelian randomization and observational analyses support the protective role of SGLT2 inhibition in reducing prostate cancer risk. Additionally, SGLT2 expression in prostate cancer patient samples has been confirmed through immunohistochemistry. The therapeutic potential of empagliflozin, a selective SGLT2 inhibitor, in treating prostate cancer, either alone or with chemotherapeutic agents like docetaxel, remains largely unexplored. This study investigated the cytotoxic and synergistic effects of empagliflozin in combination with docetaxel in LNCaP and DU- 145 prostate cancer cells. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay, and synergy was evaluated using the Chou-Talalay method. Western blot analysis was conducted to examine the effects of empagliflozin, alone and in combination with docetaxel, on key molecular targets, including p-AMPKα, p-p70S6 K1, p-PRAS40, and p-Akt. Empagliflozin exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects in both LNCaP and DU- 145 cells, with a higher potency observed in DU- 145 cells. When combined with docetaxel, empagliflozin demonstrated synergistic activity, as indicated by combination index values < 1. Empagliflozin upregulated p-AMPKα and downregulated p-p70S6 K1 and p-PRAS40. The combination with docetaxel further enhanced these effects. Notably, empagliflozin alone downregulated p-Akt in LNCaP cells but not in DU- 145 cells, highlighting cell-line-specific differences. Empagliflozin reduces prostate cancer cell viability and enhances the cytotoxic effects of docetaxel, suggesting a promising combination strategy for prostate cancer therapy. Additional in vivo studies and clinical trials are needed to assess the translational relevance of these findings.
40227305	Quercetin loaded-magnetic zeolite nano-composite material and evaluate its anti-cancer effect.	Quercetin (QUR) is a major flavonoid that is abundantly present in the human diet, and has various therapeutic effects, including anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. Of note, high doses of free QUR can be dangerous to normal cells. Furthermore, a considerable amount of free QUR would be metabolized until reaching cancerous cells. On one hand, chemotherapy drugs have some side effects towards normal cells. Besides, nano zeolite clinoptilolite (NZ-CP), a drug delivery system (DDS), has high specific surface area and is non-toxic. By applying magnetic zeolite nano-composite (MZNC), purposeful mobility of high doses of QUR, considering acidic microenvironment of tumor, is possible. The aim of this work is to evaluate and compare the anti-cancer impacts of QUR-loaded MZNC with doxorubicin (DOX) as an anti-cancer drug on HepG2 cell line as a human cancer cell line. Various concentrations of NZ-CP at different times to evaluate its safety in normal cells were assessed. Also, to assess the cell survival of the HepG2 cell line, various amounts of QUR-loaded MZNC, DOX, and NZ-CP within cell viability assay were investigated. Based on results of normal cells assay, it was revealed that NZ-CP has no toxicity toward normal cells. Furthermore, according to evaluations of cell viability assay, it was determined that specific concentrations (100 and 200 mg/L) of QUR have a similar anti-cancer effect to DOX. Eventually, it was exhibited that NZ-CP has capability of controlled QUR release until reaching cancerous cells demonstrating its aptitude for drug delivery.
40227301	Establishment of an embryonic cell line of Grapholita molesta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and in vitro replication of Cydia pomonella granulovirus in it.	The oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a major pest of fruit trees worldwide. In this study, an embryonic cell line QAU-Gm-E-L of the oriental fruit moth was successfully established. The cells grew adherently, round cells and spindle cells accounted for 43.0% and 42.2% of the total population, respectively, and rod-shaped cells accounted for 14.8%. The amplified mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I subunit (CoI) gene fragment was 651 bp in length, and its similarity with the CoI gene of the oriental fruit moth was 100%. The chromosomes of QAU-Gm-E-L cells were granular or short rod-shaped. Its number varied from 66 to 444, indicating that aneuploidy occurred. The observations were consistent with the chromosome characteristics of lepidopteran insect cell lines. The population doubling time of QAU-Gm-E-L cells was 27.64 h. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmed that the number of copies of Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) gradually increased in QAU-Gm-E-L cells with inoculation time. The electron microscopy observations results showed that occlusion bodies (OBs) of CpGV could be formed in the cells at 4 d post-infection; a large number of OBs were seen in the cells at 8 d post-infection. Hence, the QAU-Gm-E-L cells can support the in vitro replication and proliferation of CpGV, and it will provide an ideal material for the molecular biology research of oriental fruit moth and CpGV.
40227299	Multidimensional landscape changes contribute significantly to vegetation distribution: The evidences from the Luo River Watershed in the eastern part of the Qinling Mountains, China.	Assessment of vegetation characteristics plays an important role in monitoring ecosystem health and restoration status, and it is necessary to consider the response characteristics of vegetation assessment indicator (VAI) to multidimensional landscape structure. Therefore, this research constructed a framework for analyzing landscape structure from two dimensions of landscape element and landscape pattern, selected fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and net primary productivity (NPP) as VAI, determined the response degree and spatial correlation of VAI to landscape structure by using geographical detector and bivariate Moran's index, and finally obtained the change threshold of VAI based on the constraints of landscape pattern by building a cubic polynomial. FVC and NPP were significantly higher from 2001 to 2021, with the expansion of the high-value areas. Cropland and woodland were the dominant landscape elements. The spatial explanatory power of landscape element for VAI was better than that of landscape pattern characteristics, while the combined factors in landscape structure all explained VAI better than univariate. The response of FVC to landscape structure was more significant compared to NPP. The high value areas of FVC tended to occur in natural landscape elements. FVC showed spatial correlation and clustering characteristics with both PD and LPI. One or more thresholds existed in the response of FVC to changes in landscape pattern. The research results have important reference value in the optimization of landscape structure and vegetation restoration, and can provide practical guidance for the sustainable development of the ecosystem.

Endovascular treatment (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with mild symptoms (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score of ≤ 5) has a specific concern about early neurological deterioration (END) after the procedure, but its significance remains unclear. This study aims to examine the prognostic impact and characteristics of END in this patient population.
40227292	Ethical and equity challenges in employment: Perspectives of international nursing graduates.	BackgroundAustralia faces a critical shortage of nurses, yet international nursing graduates (INGs) encounter significant barriers to securing employment after graduation. Current policies often prioritize domestic graduates, creating systemic disadvantages for INGs, particularly those on temporary visas. This inequity raises ethical concerns and undermines Australia's ability to fully utilize its nursing workforce, potentially compromising the quality of healthcare services.AimThis study explores the lived experiences of INGs regarding employment challenges in Australia, critically examining the ethical and equity implications of existing practices.Research Design A qualitative study employing a combined phenomenological and exploratory approach was conducted. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis framework.Participants and Research ContextTwelve international nursing students in their final semester of the Bachelor of Nursing program at two metropolitan universities in Australia participated in semi-structured interviews.Ethical ConsiderationsEthical approval was obtained from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (MUHREC-44400) and the University of Technology Sydney (ETH24-10028). Informed consent was obtained from all participants, who were assured of their right to confidentiality and to withdraw from the study at any time.ResultsFive overarching themes emerged: (1) Economic Disparity and Ethical Considerations, (2) Systemic Discrimination and Inequality, (3) Mental Health and Well-being, (4) Policy and Regulatory Barriers, and (5) Lack of Cultural Inclusion and a Sense of (Un)Belongingness.ConclusionsThe findings highlight urgent ethical concerns and equity challenges that demand comprehensive reforms to create a more inclusive and ethically sound environment for INGs in Australia. These reforms necessitate policy changes to address discriminatory practices and visa restrictions, enhanced institutional support to facilitate INGs' transition into the workforce, and a commitment to cultural competence and inclusion at all levels of the healthcare system. Addressing these systemic barriers is not only a matter of fairness and justice but is also crucial for ensuring a robust and ethically sustainable healthcare workforce in Australia.
40227286	Achieving High Loading Capacity of Perovskite Nanocrystals in Pore-Reamed Metal-Organic Frameworks for Bright Scintillators.	Lead halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) scintillators featuring a fast decay and a high radiation hardness have garnered significant attention. A high PNC loading is essential to ensure a strong X-ray absorption for scintillator applications, but concentrated PNCs tend to aggregate in the solid state, resulting in significant emission quenching. Employing a dispersion medium offers a promising strategy to produce high-loading PNC solids without agglomeration. Herein, we synthesize CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> PNC/metal-organic framework (MOF) nanostructures to achieve high-loading PNCs within MOF hosts. The macroporous cavities of hierarchically porous (HP) MOFs can host more PNCs than the confined nanometer-scale spaces of microporous MOFs. Additionally, the surface-rich structure of MOFs aids in dispersing PNCs, effectively reducing aggregation-induced emission quenching. We find that HP-MOFs can achieve a high PNC loading ratio of 75%, as well as the less-aggregated PNCs. As a result, the PNC/HP-MOF scintillator exhibits a 2.3 times higher light yield than that of the PNC scintillator, primarily resulting from the enhanced luminance efficiency of well-dispersed PNCs. The bright and fast features of nanostructure scintillators enable static and dynamic X-ray imaging for industrial inspection applications. These findings highlight that constructing a high-loading nanostructure is crucial for advancing the X-ray imaging applications of PNC scintillators.
40227285	Polysaccharides from Ganoderma lucidum attenuate cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice by inhibiting oxidative stress and modulating mitochondrial dynamics via the Nrf2/antioxidative axis activation.	Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics imbalance are key contributors to AD pathogenesis. GLPS, an extract from Ganoderma lucidum spores, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. However, the roles of GLPS in regulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics in AD remain poorly understood. Here, the underlying mechanisms of neuroprotective effects on cognitive dysfunction in 5 × FAD mice were explored. C57BL/6 mice served as WT controls, while 5 × FAD mice were divided into an AD group and an AD + GLPS group. The mice in AD + GLPS group were administered daily GLPS (25 mg/kg) by i.p. injection for two months, while WT and AD mice received an equivalent volume of normal saline. The results indicated that GLPS markedly improved cognitive function and decreased p-tau and Aβ levels in 5 × FAD mice. Moreover, GLPS alleviated oxidative stress by increasing SOD levels and decreasing MDA concentrations. It also inhibited excessive mitochondrial fragmentation by decreasing the expression of p-Drp1 and Fis1, while increasing the levels of Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 in 5 × FAD mice. Mechanistically, GLPS activated Nrf2, leading to a marked upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, including HO- 1, NQO1, and SOD2 in 5 × FAD mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that GLPS ameliorates cognitive deficits in 5 × FAD mice by reducing oxidative stress and modulating mitochondrial dynamics through Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzyme activation.
40227267	Biomarker Preservation in Antarctic Sandstones after Prolonged Space Exposure Outside the International Space Station During the ESA EXPOSE-E Lichens and Fungi Experiment.	A primary aim of current and future space exploration missions is the detection and identification of chemical and biological indicators of life, namely biomarkers, on Mars. The Mars Sample Return NASA-ESA program will bring to Earth samples of martian soil, acquired from up to 7 cm depth. The ESA Rosalind Franklin rover will search for signs of life in the subsurface (down to a depth of 2 meters), given the highly radioactive conditions on Mars' surface, which are not ideal for life as we know it and for the preservation of its traces. In the frame of the Lichens and Fungi Experiment, small fragments of Antarctic sandstones colonized by cryptoendolithic microbial communities were exposed to space and simulated martian conditions in low Earth orbit for 18 months, aboard the EXPOSE-E payload. Through the use of Raman and infrared spectroscopies, as well as a metabolomic approach, we aimed to detect organic compounds in a quartz mineral matrix. The results show that pigments, such as melanin, carotenoids, and chlorophyll, lipids, and amino acids, maintained their stability within minerals under simulated martian conditions in space, which makes them ideal biomarkers for the exploration of putative life on Mars.
40227252	Effect of preconception <i>SOD2</i> gene variants and air pollution on gestational length: evidence from a mother-baby cohort.	To explore the relationship between air pollution, preconception <i>SOD2</i> gene variations, and gestational length. A study was conducted on 1,846 mother-baby pairs in Henan Province. Air pollutant was gathered from environmental monitoring stations. Peripheral blood was collected from pregnant women before pregnancy and genotyped to minimize the interference of prenatal air pollution on <i>SOD2</i> gene variations. Multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze the relationship between air pollution and gestational length, with an interaction term (SNP × air pollutant) included to explore the gene-environment interactions. After adjusting for covariates, it was found that exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and inhalable particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) was associated with decreased gestational length, while nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) exposure was associated with increased gestational length (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, mothers carrying the A allele of <i>SOD2</i> rs4880 had an increment of 0.17 weeks in gestational length compared to those carrying the G allele (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Interactions on gestational length between <i>SOD2</i> gene polymorphisms (rs4880, rs5746136, and rs2758352) and exposure to CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and PM<sub>10</sub> were observed. These findings suggest that <i>SOD2</i> gene variations may influence the association between prenatal air pollution and gestational length.
40227250	Rapid Fluorochromic Sensing of Tertiary Amines and Opioids via Dual-Emissive Ground and Excited Charge-Transfer States.	The recognition and differentiation of organic amines are crucial for applications in drug analysis, food spoilage, biomedical assays, and clinical diagnostics. Existing luminescence-based recognition methods for amines predominantly rely on fluorescence quenching, limiting the scope of sensitive and selective detection. Here, we present a fluorochromic approach for rapidly distinguishing different organic amines based on their unique excited-state and ground-state interactions with a naphthalimide derivative under ultraviolet light. Our findings reveal that the photoluminescence quantum yield and emission color are significantly influenced by the substituent group and the molecular flexibility of the amine. Specifically, primary amines, together with other common lone-pair donors, such as alcohol, ether, thiol, thioether, and phosphine, did not exhibit photoluminescence changes, while secondary amines exhibited only weak emission. For tertiary amines, however, bright green photoluminescence activation was rapidly produced for molecules containing at least one methyl group; red-shifted yellow emission was observed for ones with bulkier side groups other than methyl; and for conformationally locked bicycloamines, no emission was observed. In addition, this fluorochromic process of the naphthalimide derivative not only depends on tertiary amine substituent groups but also shows distinctly different ground- and excited-state photoluminescence dynamics in time-resolved spectroscopy. Based on these differences, a qualitative method is developed for visual recognition of natural and synthetic opioids, including heroin, fentanyl, and metonitazene, which is more facile and rapid compared to current methods such as the Marquis reagent kit, and could facilitate onsite testing, real-time monitoring, and streamlined workflows in both laboratory and field settings.
40227246	Clinically significant drug-drug interactions involving opioid analgesics used for pain treatment in patients with cancer: update of a systematic review.	Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are among factors that may affect efficacy and safety of opioid treatment. Data on clinically manifested DDIs are scarse, and recommendations that might guide physicians are presently lacking. The aim of this study was to update a systematic review (2015) on studies reporting clinically significant DDIs involving opioids used for pain treatment in adult patients with cancer.
40227232	Enteric glia regulate Paneth cell secretion and intestinal microbial ecology.	Glial cells of the enteric nervous system (ENS) interact closely with the intestinal epithelium and secrete signals that influence epithelial cell proliferation and barrier formation in vitro. Whether these interactions are important in vivo, however, is unclear because previous studies reached conflicting conclusions (Prochera and Rao, 2023). To better define the roles of enteric glia in steady state regulation of the intestinal epithelium, we characterized the glia in closest proximity to epithelial cells and found that the majority express the gene Proteolipid protein 1 (<i>PLP1</i>) in both mice and humans. To test their functions using an unbiased approach, we genetically depleted PLP1<sup>+</sup> cells in mice and transcriptionally profiled the small and large intestines. Surprisingly, glial loss had minimal effects on transcriptional programs and the few identified changes varied along the gastrointestinal tract. In the ileum, where enteric glia had been considered most essential for epithelial integrity, glial depletion did not drastically alter epithelial gene expression but caused a modest enrichment in signatures of Paneth cells, a secretory cell type important for innate immunity. In the absence of PLP1<sup>+</sup> glia, Paneth cell number was intact, but a subset appeared abnormal with irregular and heterogenous cytoplasmic granules, suggesting a secretory deficit. Consistent with this possibility, ileal explants from glial-depleted mice secreted less functional lysozyme than controls with corresponding effects on fecal microbial composition. Collectively, these data suggest that enteric glia do not exert broad effects on the intestinal epithelium but have an essential role in regulating Paneth cell function and gut microbial ecology.
40227231	Heterostructure and atomic doping engineering in 3D Co<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>@Cr-NiFe LDH/CF nanosheet arrays for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution.	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is usually considered a major obstacle to electrochemical water splitting, primarily because of its sluggish kinetics. Developing an effective and durable catalyst for the OER is indispensable for overcoming this challenge. In this study, a three-dimensional nanomaterial with a unique heterostructure (Co<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>@Cr-NiFe LDH/CF) was obtained by the deposition of Cr-doped double hydroxide (Cr-NiFe LDH) on Co<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> nanosheet arrays grown on copper foam (Co<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>/CF). In particular, the catalyst had a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a low overpotential of just 257 mV, a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 10.21 s<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 300 mV and a Tafel slope of merely 72 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. This indicated that Co<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>@Cr-NiFe LDH/CF exhibited outstanding catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the catalyst exhibited stability for a duration of 40 h at a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The study introduces an innovative approach for the superior design of an OER catalyst and offers a significant reference for investigation within the realm of renewable energy.

We aimed to elucidate ER-low tumor biology.
40227227	Prophage-encoded <i>Hm-oscar</i> gene recapitulates <i>Wolbachia</i>-induced male-killing in the tea tortrix moth <i>Homona magnanima</i>.	<i>Wolbachia</i> are maternally transmitted bacterial symbionts that are ubiquitous among arthropods. They can hijack host reproduction in various ways, including male-killing (MK), where the sons of infected mothers are killed during development. The recent discovery of MK-associated <i>Wolbachia</i> genes, i.e., <i>oscar</i> in <i>Ostrinia</i> moths and <i>wmk</i> in <i>Drosophila</i> flies, stimulates our interest in the diversity and commonality of MK mechanisms, which remain largely unclear. We recently discovered that a <i>Wolbachia</i> symbiont of the moth <i>Homona magnanima</i> carries an MK-associated prophage region encoding homologs of <i>oscar</i> (<i>Hm-oscar</i>) and <i>wmk</i> (<i>wmk-</i>1-4). Here, we investigated the effects of these genes in the native host. Upon transient overexpression, <i>Hm-oscar</i>, but not <i>wmk</i>, induced male lethality in <i>H. magnanima</i>, in contrast to our observations in <i>Drosophila</i>, where the <i>wmk</i> homologs, but not <i>Hm-oscar</i>, killed the males. <i>Hm-oscar</i> disrupted sex determination in male embryos by inducing a female-type <i>doublesex</i> splicing and impaired dosage compensation, recapitulating the <i>Wolbachia</i> phenotype. Cell-based transfection assays confirmed that <i>Hm-oscar</i> suppressed the function of <i>masculinizer</i>, the primary male sex determinant involved in lepidopteran dosage compensation. Our study highlights the conserved roles of <i>oscar</i> homologs in <i>Wolbachia</i>-induced lepidopteran MK and argues that <i>Wolbachia</i> have evolved multiple MK mechanisms in insects.
40227224	De Novo Design of Parallel and Antiparallel A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub> Heterohexameric α-Helical Barrels.	The de novo design of α-helical coiled-coil peptides is advanced. Using established sequence-to-structure relationships, it is possible to generate various coiled-coil assemblies with predictable numbers and orientations of helices. Here, we target new assemblies, namely, A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub> heterohexamer α-helical barrels. These designs are based on pairs of sequences with three heptad repeats (<b><i>abcdefg</i></b>), programmed with <b><i>a</i></b> = Leu, <b><i>d</i></b> = Ile, <b><i>e</i></b> = Ala, and <b><i>g</i></b> = Ser, and <b><i>b</i></b> = <b><i>c</i></b> = Glu to make the acidic (A) chains and <b><i>b</i></b> = <b><i>c</i></b> = Lys in the basic (B) chains. These design rules ensure that the desired oligomeric state and stoichiometry are readily achieved. However, controlling the orientation of neighboring helices (parallel or antiparallel) is less straightforward. Surprisingly, we find that assembly and helix orientation are sensitive to the length of the overhang between helices. To study this, cyclically permutated peptide sequences with three heptad repeats (the register) in the peptide sequences were analyzed. Peptides starting at <b><i>g</i></b> (<b><i>g</i></b>-register) form a parallel 6-helix barrel in solution and in an X-ray crystal structure, whereas the <b><i>b</i></b>- and <b><i>c</i></b>-register peptides form an antiparallel complex. In lieu of experimental X-ray structures for <b><i>b</i></b>- and <b><i>c</i></b>-register peptides, AlphaFold-Multimer is used to predict atomistic models. However, considerably more sampling than the default value is required to match the models and the experimental data, as many confidently predicted and plausible models are generated with incorrect helix orientations. This work reveals the previously unknown influence of the heptad register on helical overhang and the orientation of α-helical coiled-coil peptides and provides insights for the modeling of oligopeptide coiled-coil complexes with AlphaFold.
40227221	Highly Efficient Charge Transfer between Water and Two-Dimensional Materials with Polar Bonds.	Charge transfer at solid-liquid interfaces is pivotal in biochemical processes, catalysis, and electrochemical devices. However, understanding the charge transfer mechanism at the nanoscale solid-liquid interface remains highly challenging. Here, we conduct ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate interfacial charge transfer between water and the two most common two-dimensional materials: graphene with nonpolar C-C bonds and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with polar B-N bonds. It is counterintuitive to find that the charge transfer between water and hBN is approximately 1 order of magnitude higher than that between water and graphene despite the fact that graphene is semiconducting and hBN is insulating. Our further analyses attribute this phenomenon to a higher tendency of water molecules to point a hydrogen atom toward the hBN surface compared to the graphene surface, although they have similar crystallographic structures. This single hydrogen-down water configuration on the hBN surface prompts electron delocalization from hBN and facilitates electron migration to water. Moreover, the polar B-N bonds in hBN result in a strong orbital overlap between nitrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms of water. A similar charge transfer enhancement is also observed between water and two-dimensional gallium nitride (GaN) and aluminum nitride (AlN), which also own polar bonds, and a positive correlation between the charge transfer and the bond polarity is demonstrated. Further simulations indicate that the friction coefficient of water on graphene and hBN surfaces positively correlates with the amount of charge transfer. These findings suggest that materials with polar bonds like hBN can serve as promising materials for biochemical sensors and energy conversion devices.
40227208	A Prospective Study Consortium for the Discovery and Validation of Early Detection Markers for Ovarian Cancer ("PREDICT") - Baseline findings for CA125.	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a lethal malignancy. CA125, the "best" available marker for detecting EOC, has insufficient sensitivity and specificity for earlier-stage disease and is not a meaningful screening tool, motivating the search for further biomarkers. Cancer biomarker discovery is enhanced by "omics" technologies. Discovery studies for EOC biomarkers should be conducted in pre-diagnosis blood samples from prospective cohorts to maximize likelihood of identifying markers that can detect disease before usual diagnosis and in earlier disease stage, while reducing methodologic biases.

40227200	Clinical Context Shapes the Relationship Between Genomic Alterations and Response to AR Inhibitors and Chemotherapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.	Many preclinical hypotheses, including reciprocal feedback activation between AR-PI3K pathway in PTEN loss and ASI-induced "BRCAness" regardless of BRCA1/2 status, have struggled to translate into clinical benefit for metastatic prostate cancer patients. This gap in translatability, particularly in mCRPC, may stem from a limited understanding of prostate cancer evolution. A key challenge is how early-stage tumor genetics correlate with mCRPC. By examining clinical, genomic, and molecular changes over time, we aim to refine clinical trial design.
40227194	Explicating the implicit: An Australian medical student's reflection on the Perspectives of Psychiatry Program for International Learners (PoPPIL).	BackgroundMedical schools are essential in promoting psychiatry as an appealing career, especially amid workforce shortages and prevailing negative perceptions that deter interest in the field. Research suggests that increasing mentorship opportunities and access to enrichment programs and electives can significantly improve attitudes towards psychiatry, encouraging more to consider it as a career path.ObjectiveTo reflect on an Australian medical student's experience in the Perspectives of Psychiatry Program for International Learners (PoPPIL) at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, demonstrating how the program, based on its structured multi-perspective framework, serves as an example of an enrichment activity that aligns with these recommendations.ConclusionThe PoPPIL serves as a compelling model for integrating enrichment activities and mentorship within psychiatric education. Participants engage in discourse-driven learning, encouraging reflection on diagnostic formulations and explication of inherent reasoning processes. By establishing its foundations on an adaptable, conceptually sound framework, the PoPPIL aims to facilitate the development of psychiatrists who are holistic and integrative in their daily practice. Integrating educational opportunities such as these into Australia's psychiatric curricula may prove advantageous for future generations.
40227193	Oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 regulates self-reactive CD8+ T cells in CNS autoimmunity.	In chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), tissue-resident self-reactive T cells perpetuate disease. The specific tissue factors governing the persistence and continuous differentiation of these cells remain undefined but could represent attractive therapeutic targets. In a model of chronic CNS autoimmunity, we find that oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33, an alarmin, is key for locally regulating the pathogenicity of self-reactive CD8+ T cells. The selective ablation of IL-33 from neo-self-antigen-expressing oligodendrocytes mitigates CNS disease. In this context, fewer self-reactive CD8+ T cells persist in the inflamed CNS, and the remaining cells are impaired in generating TCF-1low effector cells. Importantly, interventional IL-33 blockade by locally administered somatic gene therapy reduces T cell infiltrates and improves the disease course. Our study identifies oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 as a druggable tissue factor regulating the differentiation and survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cells in the inflamed CNS. This finding introduces tissue factors as a novel category of immune targets for treating chronic CNS autoimmune diseases.
40227192	Enhanced TLR7-dependent production of type I interferon by pDCs underlies pandemic chilblains.	Outbreaks of chilblains were reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the essential role of type I interferon (I-IFN) in protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and the association of chilblains with inherited type I interferonopathies, we hypothesized that excessive I-IFN responses to SARS-CoV-2 might underlie the occurrence of chilblains in this context. We identified a transient I-IFN signature in chilblain lesions, accompanied by an acral infiltration of activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Patients with chilblains were otherwise asymptomatic or had mild disease without seroconversion. Their leukocytes produced abnormally high levels of I-IFN upon TLR7 stimulation with agonists or ssRNA viruses-particularly SARS-CoV-2-but not with DNA agonists of TLR9 or the dsDNA virus HSV-1. Moreover, the patients' pDCs displayed cell-intrinsic hyperresponsiveness to TLR7 stimulation regardless of TLR7 levels. Inherited TLR7 or I-IFN deficiency confers a predisposition to life-threatening COVID-19. Conversely, our findings suggest that enhanced TLR7 activity in predisposed individuals could confer innate, pDC-mediated, sterilizing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with I-IFN-driven chilblains as a trade-off.
40227189	Personalized neoadjuvant chemotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers - shaping imprecision to be precise.	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can down-size or down-stage tumors, minimize post-surgical recurrence risk, or even replace surgery when deployed appropriately for patients with gastrointestinal cancers. However, accomplishing these goals is rate-limited by all-comer treatment protocols, median arm-based comparisons in clinical trials, and the persisting omission of precision approaches for cytotoxic agents. Despite heterogeneity in benefit from standard-of-care regimens, mounting biological data support the presence of actionable sensitivities or potentially targetable dependencies in most tumors. Conceptually, such tumor vulnerabilities could be a gamechanger. In treatment-resistant malignancies (biliary tract cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), individualized neoadjuvant treatment may increase the curative surgery frequencies that currently only occur in a minority of patients. For more treatment-sensitive gastrointestinal cancers, tailored chemotherapy strategies might reduce the need for high-intensity regimens, minimize post-surgical morbidity and allow dose de-escalation for selected patients without compromising oncological outcomes. Personalizing chemotherapy strategies remains inferential from comparing outcomes of molecularly distinct patients receiving a single treatment, or unselected patients (with comparable baseline characteristics) on different regimens. We discuss the critical importance of harnessing tumor biology to develop and implement predictive signatures for personalized neoadjuvant chemotherapy (alone or in combination with other modalities). This includes exploiting transcriptomics to retrospectively understand the molecular basis of treatment outcomes from patient biopsies, identifying existing agents to replace or supplement current standard-of-care for those unlikely to respond, and matching novel preclinical treatments to potential responder patients. Deploying mechanistically distinct cytotoxic regimens against gastrointestinal tumors with unique predispositions for DNA damage tolerance is a necessity for boosting neoadjuvant outcomes.
40227187	Evaluating the Public Relationships of Registered Dietitians with Government, Food Industry, and Universities Regarding Knowledge Transfer.	<b>Purpose:</b> The nutritional quality of the food supply is influenced by actions from the government, the food industry, and universities. Considering the potential of registered dietitians (RDs) to transfer nutrition knowledge, this study aimed to assess the positivity of the relationships between RDs and these actors to improve knowledge transfer initiatives for the benefit of food nutritional quality. <b>Methods:</b> Using a descriptive and correlation research design, 68 RDs, members of the <i>Ordre des diététistes-nutritionnistes du Québec</i> (dietitians in the Province of Québec, Canada), evaluated their relationships with the government, the food industry, and universities in a web-based survey. <b>Results:</b> Overall, RDs rated their relationships with universities more positively than with government or industry, which were similarly rated (<i>p</i> < 0.001). More specifically, RDs working in clinical nutrition rated all dimensions of their relationships with the actors in general less favourably than RDs in other sectors (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> To support the successful transfer of knowledge regarding the nutritional quality of foods, these findings suggest that RDs should be encouraged to attempt to develop more positive relationships with government and industry, while maintaining their positive relationships with universities. Future research could further examine the clinical RD subgroup as well as the reasons for these results by conducting in-depth interviews or group discussions.

40227185	Benchmarking Vibrational Spectra: 5000 Accurate Eigenstates of Acetonitrile Using Tree Tensor Network States.	Accurate vibrational spectra are essential for understanding how molecules behave, yet their computation remains challenging, and benchmark data to reliably compare different methods are sparse. Here, we present high-accuracy eigenstate computations for the six-atom, 12-dimensional acetonitrile molecule, a prototypical, strongly coupled anharmonic system. Using a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm with a tree-tensor-network-state (TTNS) ansatz, a refinement using TTNSs as basis set, and reliable procedures to estimate energy errors, we compute up to 5,000 vibrational states with error estimates below 0.0007 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Our analysis reveals that previous works underestimated the energy error by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Our data serve as a benchmark for future vibrational spectroscopy methods, and our new method offers a path toward similarly precise computations of large, complex molecular systems.
40227184	"But Then They Don't Use the Same Money to Give Us Services": Attitudes and Perspectives on Dementia Care Community-Based Research in Hispanic Communities.	Core cultural values, along with commonly held beliefs about dementia, influence the caregiving roles assumed by Hispanic/Latino caregivers. Further, cultural values inform the utilization of available supportive programs and may influence participation in community-based dementia-support interventions. This paper discusses attitudes and perspectives on participating in community-based dementia-support interventions using a focus group methodology of Hispanic/Latino staff (<i>n</i> = 5). Findings from longitudinal focus groups (<i>n</i> = 3) with Hispanic/Latino staff, serving predominantly Hispanic/Latino populations, are presented. Findings highlight the value of research funding to support immediate care-related needs over future-focused research. They also emphasize the importance of culturally appropriate terminology and the centrality of cultural values that align with dementia-support research to effectively engage Hispanic/Latino populations. As supportive interventions for dementia caregivers are developed and implemented in real-world settings, including and aligning with cultural elements (i.e., family-oriented, family relationships) may encourage greater participation of Hispanic/Latino caregivers in research.
40227182	Ethical reflections of healthcare staff on 'consentless measures' in somatic care: A qualitative study.	BackgroundMany patients in medical wards lack decision-making capacity and cannot provide valid consent. As a result, nurses and other healthcare professionals often face a dilemma: whether to neglect the medical needs of such patients, or provide healthcare interventions without obtaining valid consent. Previous studies have indicated that many interventions are provided without consent; however, there is insufficient knowledge about how staff in this context reason about the ethical dilemmas they encounter.AimTo explore the ethical reasons provided by nurses and other healthcare professionals in medical wards for and against providing healthcare interventions without patients' consent.Research designThe study employed a qualitative explorative design. Eight focus group interviews were held with 37 staff across five different professions, mainly nurses, at two Swedish hospitals. The material was subjected to qualitative analysis, following a Reflective Thematic Analysis framework.Ethical considerationsEthical approval for this study was obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. All participants were informed orally and in writing about the study's aims and its voluntary nature. No sensitive personal information was registered. Participants provided their oral consent to participate before the interviews took place.Findings/ResultsThematic analysis resulted in four main themes: <i>Coercion is a bad word</i>; <i>Reasons to accept coercion</i>; <i>Coercion is part of ward culture,</i> and <i>Unacceptable coercion.</i>ConclusionsParticipants overwhelmingly supported the current use of 'consentless measures' at the investigated wards. Most situations described either needed no justification, according to participants, or could be easily justified by reference to the benefit of the patient, the patient's poor decision-making capacity, or the benefit of others. A range of implicit, contextual, and institutional justifications were also given. Suboptimal ward culture was considered a prime driver of consentless measures and a force that compromises nurses' agency in the patient encounter.
40227181	Phase Modulation of 2D Semiconducting GaTe from Hexagonal to Monoclinic through Layer Thickness Control and Strain Engineering.	Phase engineering offers a novel approach to modulate the properties of materials for versatile applications. Two-dimensional (2D) GaTe, an emerging III-VI semiconductor, can exist in hexagonal (<i>h</i>) or monoclinic (<i>m</i>) phases with fascinating phase-dependent properties (e.g., isotropic or anisotropic electrical transport). However, the key factors governing GaTe phases remain obscure. Herein, we achieve phase modulation of GaTe by tuning two previously overlooked factors: layer thickness and strain. The precise layer-controlled synthesis of GaTe from a monolayer (1L) to >10L is achieved via molecular beam epitaxy. A layer-dependent phase transition from <i>h</i>-GaTe (1-5L) to <i>m</i>-GaTe (>10L) is unambiguously unveiled by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, driven by system energy minimization according to density functional theory calculations. Local phase transitions from ultrathin <i>h</i>-GaTe to <i>m</i>-GaTe are also obtained via introduced tensile strain. This work clarifies the factors influencing GaTe phases, providing valuable guidance for the phase engineering of other 2D materials toward the desired properties and applications.

In this study, we developed a photoredox-catalyzed defluorinative cross-coupling method for trifluoroketones and alkyl boronic acids. The reaction afforded a series of novel α,α-difluoroketone derivatives, and <i>in vitro</i> fungicidal activity revealed that some of these compounds exhibited moderate to excellent activity against <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> and <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. In particular, compound <b>3d</b> showed an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.27 μg/mL against <i>B. cinerea</i> and can be used as a fungicidal lead compound for further optimization.

40227167	Tuning of Thermal Back Reactivity of Aza-Diarylethene Photoswitches by Introducing Benzazole Groups.	Molecular photoswitches have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in materials science and life science. In this study, we synthesize a series of aza-diarylethenes incorporating benzazole groups as the nitrogen atom source for 6π azaelectrocyclization and investigate their photochromic behaviors. Compounds 1-3, bearing benzothiazole, benzoxazole, and benzimidazole groups, exhibit thermally reversible type photochromism with thermal back reaction half-lives (t1/2) ranging from milliseconds to seconds at 293 K. Additional derivatives 4-6 with benzothiophene-S,S-dioxide at the ethene bridge moiety, further expand the range of thermal back reactivity, with t1/2 values extending up to tens of minutes. Quantum chemical calculations confirm that the variation in thermal back reactivity is governed by the energy difference between open- and closed-ring isomers, in accordance with the Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle. These findings provide a molecular design strategy for controlling the thermal back reactivity of aza-diarylethenes, enabling further development of functional photochromic materials.
40227166	Efficacy and Toxicity Analysis of Selective BET Bromodomain Inhibitors in Models of Inflammatory Liver Disease.	BET bromodomain inhibitors demonstrate significant promise as anti-inflammatory agents. However, clinical data demonstrated that nonselective BET bromodomain inhibitors led to significant dose-limiting toxicity in clinical settings. Here, we use three orally bioavailable inhibitors, <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, that are either BRD4-D1 selective or pan-D1-biased + BRD4-D2, for assessing their cellular and in vivo efficacy and safety profile compared to known BET inhibitors in two inflammatory disease models. Our results show that pan-D1-biased + BRD4-D2 inhibitor, <b>3</b>, is as efficacious as pan-BET inhibitor, I-BET151, in reducing inflammation in both models, whereas pan-D2 inhibitors are less effective. BRD4-D1 selective inhibitors are also efficacious; however, inhibitors with improved cellular engagement will be necessary to better assess their effects. Finally, BRD4-D1 selective inhibitors are better tolerated in a preclinical thrombocytopenia model than <b>3</b>, while gastrointestinal toxicity may be a BRD4-driven effect.

Uncertainty regarding the self and fear of self have been independently identified as relevant to both obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and eating disorders (EDs). The present study aimed to examine self-ambivalence (an indicator of uncertainty regarding the self often characterized by conflicting self-beliefs) as a potential transdiagnostic factor associated with both OCD and EDs and to determine whether differences in the thematic content of the feared self may be linked to the experience of symptoms of one disorder over another despite common co-occurrence and shared processes.

40227159	Migratory Suicide in the Province of Quebec, Canada (1890-1940): The Importance of Movement and the Post-Death Cost of Exclusion.	While suicide tourism or the death of persons who end their life while 'out of town' has been explored, there are no works that focus specifically on migratory suicide-that is, on persons ending their life without assistance after travelling, to a place where they are (1) not residents and (2) have no communal ties, for the purpose of doing so. We here explore migratory suicide's occurrence and the lives ended as a result in the province of Quebec, Canada, during the years 1890-1940. The historical tendency of Quebec coroners to attribute suicides to impermanent forms of mental deterioration is found to be less pronounced in instances of migratory suicide, though the number of related farewell letters exceeded the provincial norm. The importance of movement and conditions of exclusion in facilitating death by suicide and influencing post-death protections are emphasized.
40227157	Deciphering probiotic potential: a comprehensive guide to probiogenomic analyses.	In recent years, the study of probiotics has advanced significantly, driven by growing interest in their potential health benefits and applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Probiotics are claimed to enhance gut health, modulate immune responses, improve digestion, synthesize beneficial compounds for the host, and even impact mental health through the gut-brain axis. However, traditional <i>in vitro</i> methods for identifying probiotics have limitations, such as low reproducibility in phenotypic screening, limited capacity to discover new strains, restricted evaluation of safety, and inefficiencies in fully understanding the biological properties responsible for health-promoting effects. Advancements in genomic analysis technology have provided a cost-effective approach to further explore probiotic strains and enhance understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving their beneficial effects in hosts. Here, we describe a comprehensive workflow for probiogenomic analysis aimed at establishing a gold-standard pipeline for screening probiotic potential based on genome sequencing. This pipeline encompasses steps from acquiring genomes to screening for safety-related features, genomic plasticity, and probiotic markers through whole-genome sequencing. In addition, this study outlines the respective methodological approaches and provides the most comprehensive database documented to date, comprising 243 genes potentially associated with probiotic function.
40227156	Genetic Diagnosis and Combinational Treatment With Pharmacomechanical Thrombectomy and Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt for Non-cirrhotic and Non-malignant Portal Vein Thrombosis.	ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the potential role of the whole-exome sequencing (WES) technique in screening pathogenic genes of non-cirrhotic and non-malignant portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and the clinical efficacy of AngioJet-assisted pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) to treat this disease.Methods16 patients with acute non-cirrhotic and non-malignant PVT were retrospectively analyzed. 14 patients received genetically diagnosed using the WES technique, ten patients received PMT with or without TIPS and 6 cases received anticoagulation alone. Changes in clinical symptoms, and recanalization of the portal vein (PV) were also recorded.Results4 patients (28.6%) had JAK2 V617 F mutation, 4 patients (28.6%) had PROC mutations, 3 patients (21.4%) had SERPINC1mutations. Among patients treated with anticoagulation alone, 5 patients (83.3%, 5/6) developed cavernous transformation of PV and one patient with JAK2 V617 F mutation achieved complete recanalization of PV. One patient treated with PMT without TIPS developed PV cavernous transformation, eight patients (80%) treated with PMT and TIPS achieved complete or partial recanalization of PV. Three patients who developed intestinal necrosis all had SERPINC1 mutations and one of them died of intestinal necrosis. No recurrence was found during follow-up (1-36 months).ConclusionsThe WES technique offers a promising way to screen for thrombophilia in patients with non-cirrhotic and non-malignant PVT. Patients with SERPINC1 mutations are more inclined to develop intestinal necrosis than others. PMT combined with TIPS provides a safe and effective therapeutic alternative.
40227155	Perceived discrimination and anxiety sensitivity in terms of alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, and drinking coping motives among racially/ethnically minoritized college students.	<b>Introduction:</b> Across the college student population within the United States (U.S.), alcohol misuse is a problematic addictive behavior. However, there is limited knowledge about the social determinants of health and individual difference factors related to alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, and coping motives for drinking among racial/ethnic minority college students. The present study investigated the singular and interactive effects of perceived racial/ethnic discrimination and anxiety sensitivity in relation to alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, and coping motives for drinking among racial/ethnic minority university students. <b>Methods:</b> Participants included 734 (82.30% female, <i>M<sub>age</sub></i> = 21.85 years, <i>SD</i> = 4.53 years) university students. <b>Results:</b> Results demonstrated that perceived racial/ethnic discrimination and anxiety sensitivity were each statistically significant predictors for alcohol-related problems and coping motives for drinking, but not alcohol consumption. <b>Discussion</b>: This work highlights the importance of considering social determinants of health and anxiety sensitivity in efforts to better understand alcohol-related problems among minority university students.

40227153	Asymmetry and Spillover Effects in the Relationship Between Stock Markets and Mental Health: An Alternative Approach.	Despite the arguments made by prospect theory, there is a lack of studies investigating asymmetric effects in the relationship between stock markets and mental health. We use the UK based Understanding Society panel dataset between 2010 and 2023 to investigate if stock market fluctuations have an asymmetric impact on mental health, and if there are mental health spillover effects on investors' household members, providing the first paper to investigate this relationship using an asymmetric fixed effects model for panel data. We find that a decreasing stock market index has a stronger impact on mental health than an increasing one, supporting prospect theory. We also suggest that prospect theory does not hold for males in explaining the relationship between stock market fluctuations and mental health. Finally, we provide novel evidence for a mental health spillover effect of negative 52-week returns on investors' household members.
40227152	Enhancing Electrical Insulation and Thermal Conductivity in Polymer Through Constructing Energy-Dissipation Organic Electron Acceptor/Inorganic Filler.	To address the issue that both electrical insulation and thermal transport performance of materials are hard to enhance synchronously, a trap-barrier synergistic strategy is proposed and utilizes the organic electronic acceptor 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic anhydride (NDA) to modify the inorganic filler Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (AO), resulting in the formation of AO@NDA, referred to as the "energy dissipator." It restricts carrier mobility and dissipates carrier energy through the synergistic effect of trap-barrier interactions, thereby enhancing the breakdown strength of the composites. In addition, it is further enhanced the long-term effectiveness of the energy dissipator by modifying its chemical activity, based on the molecular design of NDA. The results demonstrate that the introduction of the energy dissipator significantly improves the electrical insulation properties of the composites. For example, the breakdown strength of SG filled with 15 wt.% AO@NDA reaches to 18.7 kV mm<sup>-1</sup>, which is added up to 11.7% compared to AO/SG at the same loading. Moreover, the high-temperature electrically insulating properties of SG composites are also outstanding due to their preeminent thermal stability and transport performance. This work will present a novel, effective, and scalable approach for the field of power equipment packaging materials.

This study aimed to determine the minimally detectable changes (MDCs) and minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) of auditory-perceptual ratings of voice quality using the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) scales (i.e., Overall Severity, Roughness, Breathiness, Strain).
40227149	Customized Design of Biobased Elastomeric Antioxidative Interphase for High-Voltage Ni-Rich Cathodes.	High-voltage (≥4.5 V) Ni-rich cathodes can help advance the development of the next generation of high-energy lithium-ion batteries. However, the high voltage used in Ni-rich cathodes deteriorates the cycling performance due to the structural disintegration of polycrystalline particles and electrolyte decomposition. Herein, a robust protective layer with high-voltage tolerance is applied to the surface of Ni-rich cathodes to address these challenges. The protective layer consists of a crosslinked bio-based elastomer (CBE) whose main chain is connected by saturated bonds, which confers high-voltage tolerance. CBE is an elastic material with viscoelastic properties, allowing it to serve as an energy dissipation layer that mitigates strain accumulation and preserves the structural integrity of the coated Ni-rich cathode. CBE also shows high polarity and rapid lithium-ion transport capabilities due to the presence of oxygen-containing components, which ensures tight wrapping of Ni-rich cathodes and improves their interfacial reaction kinetics. As anticipated, the 4.5 V Li||LiNi<sub>0.6</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> batteries exhibit an initial capacity of 176.7 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> and a capacity retention rate of 79.5% after 400 cycles. This study underscores the critical role of a customized protective layer in stabilizing Ni-rich cathodes at high voltages.

40227147	Fusion of Four Aromatic Rings via an Atom-Mutual-Embedding Strategy to Form a Tetrahexacyclic System.	Skeletal manipulation of aromatic compounds has emerged as a potent tool in synthetic chemistry, but simultaneous multiring manipulation remains largely unexplored due to the inherent complexities of ring and site selectivity. Herein, we report an unprecedented multiring skeletal manipulation that fuses four 5-membered aromatic rings, comprising two organic and two metal-containing aromatic systems, into a novel metal-bridged 6/6/6/6-membered ring scaffold. The sequential ring fusion is accomplished through an atom-mutual-embedding strategy; this strategy entails the stepwise insertion of two nitrogen atoms into separate metal-carbon bonds and simultaneously integrates a metal atom as a bridge across two isoxazole moieties. The presence of a central metal atom is crucial for ensuring precise substrate alignment and enhancing both the ring and site specificity. The resulting tetrahexacyclic products exhibit remarkable stability and superior near-infrared (NIR) functional properties, surpassing those of the precursor compounds. This work not only establishes a conceptual foundation for designing versatile substrate molecules amenable to intricate editing but also contributes to the rational and performance-targeted manipulation of molecular architectures.
40227146	Combining the Risk: The Poly-Environmental Risk Score and Psychotic Symptoms in Adolescents.	Psychotic symptoms are common in adolescents and predictive of psychiatric disorders. Numerous risk factors have been shown to precede psychiatric disorders. However, investigating individual risk factors does not account for the cumulative effect these risk factors may have. Therefore, we combined well-researched environmental risk factors for psychotic disorder in a composite measure: the poly-environmental risk score (PERS).

40227142	Comparing Functional Trend and Learning among Groups in Intensive Binary Longitudinal Eye-Tracking Data using By-Variable Smooth Functions of GAMM.	This paper presents a model specification for group comparisons regarding a functional trend over time within a trial and learning across a series of trials in intensive binary longitudinal eye-tracking data. The functional trend and learning effects are modeled using by-variable smooth functions. This model specification is formulated as a generalized additive mixed model, which allowed for the use of the freely available mgcv package (Wood in Package 'mgcv.' https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/mgcv.pdf, 2023) in R. The model specification was applied to intensive binary longitudinal eye-tracking data, where the questions of interest concern differences between individuals with and without brain injury in their real-time language comprehension and how this affects their learning over time. The results of the simulation study show that the model parameters are recovered well and the by-variable smooth functions are adequately predicted in the same condition as those found in the application.
40227141	Transition to motherhood: stability and change in attachment representations from pregnancy to 5 years.	This paper reports on Adult Attachment Interviews (AAIs) obtained from a low-risk sample of 51 pregnant women expecting their first child who were interviewed again when the child was five years of age. This is the first report of test-retest results that extends over five years that includes the transition to motherhood. Results suggest significant levels of continuity at the level of AAI classifications with three-way stability being 90% and two-way stability being 88%. When change was observed, it was more likely to be a move toward rather than away from security. At the level of dimensional scores, significant changes indicated a softening stance with higher coherence ratings, lower idealization scores, and less insistence on an inability to recall. This move toward a significantly more balanced state of mind regarding attachment was most evident among those mothers who maintained or became autonomous-secure.
40227140	Effectiveness of Co-Creation for Chronic Disease Management: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.	ObjectiveCo-creation is crucial for fostering active patient engagement in health management. However, the efficacy of co-creation in chronic disease management varies, and there is a lack of detailed description regarding co-creation practice. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of co-creation on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness, detailing its implementation.Data SourcePubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Web of Science.Study Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaWe included peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials, published in English, that analyzed the effects of co-creation on physical health, participation outcomes, psychological health, self-efficacy and cost-effectiveness.Data ExtractionTwo researchers independently screened the articles and assessed the quality of the 16 included studies using a pre-prepared checklist.Data SynthesisMeta-analyses were conducted to summarize the characteristics, outcomes, and risk of bias of the included studies.ResultsThe results showed that co-creation significantly enhanced patients' physical health (<i>P</i> = 0.006) and participation outcomes (<i>P</i> = 0.009). Subgroup analysis revealed that co-creation combined with theory was better than co-creation without theory in improving physical health (<i>P</i> = 0.007). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding psychological health, self-efficacy and cost-effectiveness (<i>P</i> = 0.29) (<i>P</i> = 0.11) (<i>P</i> = 0.50).ConclusionCo-creation effectively improved patients' physical health and participation outcomes, without affecting psychological health, self-efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. Social determinants were found to play a more crucial role in influencing physical health of patients. Additionally, age disparities might impact the cost-effectiveness of co-creation. Future research should explore the influence of intergenerational co-creation on health promotion.
40227139	An Original Positive-Up-Negative-Down Protocol for Electrical Characterization of Antiferroelectric Materials.	This work introduces the AFE-PUND measurement method, an original positive up negative down (PUND) protocol intended to accurately study antiferroelectric (AFE) thin-film behavior. As for its FE counterpart, the AFE-PUND method isolates switching currents from nonswitching contributions, enabling a precise extraction of saturation polarization and coercive fields from hysteresis loop curves. In this paper, AFE-PUND was deployed on AFE ZrO<sub>2</sub> films of varying thicknesses. The results reveal that saturation polarization increases with film thickness, indicating enhanced domain stability, while endurance cycles showcase the wake-up effect and its eventual fatigue-induced degradation in thicker films. Similarly, coercive fields decrease with thickness, reflecting reduced switching barriers and a sharper transition between the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. AFE-PUND establishes itself as an extremely valuable method for advancing the understanding and optimization of AFE materials.
40227138	Advancing CO<sub>2</sub> Conversion with Cu-LDHs: A Review of Computational and Experimental Studies.	Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) are versatile materials with tuneable properties. They show promising electro- and photo-catalytic activity in the activation and conversion of CO<sub>2</sub>. Their unique properties make LDHs pivotal materials in emerging sustainable strategies for mitigating the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, the intricate structure-property relationship inherent to LDHs challenges their rational design. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of both experimental and computational studies about LDHs for photo- and electro-catalytic conversion of CO<sub>2</sub>, mainly focusing on Cu-based systems due to their superior performance in producing C<sub>2</sub> products. We present a background framework, describing the essentials computational and experimental tools, designed to support both experimentalists and theoreticians in the development of tailored LDH materials for efficient and sustainable CO<sub>2</sub> valorisation. Finally, we discuss future potential advancements, emphasizing the importance of new synergistic experimental-computational studies.
40227137	Validation of polar verity sense for heart rate monitoring during school-based high-intensity interval training in adolescents.	The polar verity sense (PVS) is a user-friendly heart rate monitoring tool for field-based research compared to Polar H10. However, its validity in the real world (e.g., school settings) among children and adolescents is yet to be determined. Thirty-nine adolescents (12.2 ± 0.4 years, 25 males) participated in a 6-min resistance-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session. Heart rate was simultaneously measured by PVS and Polar H10 (criterion measure). Validation metrics included within-participant correlation, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error and Bland-Altman plots. Overall, PVS showed very strong within-participant correlation (r = 0.93, p < .001) with Polar H10. The mean absolute and percentage error was 4 b·min-1 and 2.8%, respectively. The correlation between PVS and Polar H10 decreased (r = 0.84, p < .001) for data above the HIIT intensity threshold (≥80% maximal heart rate) but maintained a strong relationship. The validity of PVS remained similar when accounting for sex, body mass index, waist circumference or cardiorespiratory fitness. PVS demonstrated strong agreement with Polar H10 in monitoring heart rate during HIIT in adolescents within a school setting. Therefore, it is valid to replace traditional inconvenient chest strap heart rate monitors with a practical and ergonomic armband PVS, which could largely enhance the feasibility of HIIT fidelity monitoring.
40227136	An overview of balloon pulmonary angioplasty for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.	Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a severe and progressive condition caused by unresolved pulmonary arterial obstructions, leading to secondary microvasculopathy and poor hemodynamics. Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the first-line treatment for operable patients. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) has emerged as a promising treatment option for patients considered inoperable due to distal lesions, comorbidities, or residual pulmonary hypertension (PH) after PEA. Following the development of the BPA in safety and efficacy, it has been widely adopted and utilized across the globe.

Solid organ transplant recipients have an increased risk of developing actinic keratosis. Recent studies show greater effectiveness when combining daylight photodynamic therapy with a posterior LED illumination for their treatment in immunocompetent patients. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of combining daylight photodynamic therapy and LED illumination versus daylight photodynamic therapy alone for the treatment of actinic keratosis in solid organ transplant recipients.

40227132	Clinical Benefit, Trials, and Regulatory Approval of Oncology Indications Under Multiple Expedited Programs for Drug Marketing in China, 2018-2024.	Following the implementation of drug regulatory reforms in China, expedited programs have been established to accelerate drug development, review, and approval for marketing. This study examined a sample of 302 oncology indications approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to explore the relationship between indication characteristics, pivotal clinical trial features, clinical benefit, and the cumulative number of expedited program designations. Furthermore, the study evaluated the actual execution of these expedited programs in China by assessing the clinical development time and review time of the approvals for oncology indications. Indications that received a higher cumulative number of expedited program designations generally exhibit higher innovation, lower pivotal clinical trial quality, greater clinical benefit, and reduced clinical development time and review time. Within these expedited programs, the implementation of Conditional Approval (CA) was pivotal in shortening the clinical development time, while Priority Review (PR) contributed to a reduction in review time. However, no significant impact of Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) on the drug development process was observed. The simultaneous implementation of multiple expedited programs has been shown to be more effective in decreasing both clinical development and review times. While the implementation of expedited programs in China has yielded preliminary outcomes, it is imperative for regulatory authorities to further refine the legal and regulatory frameworks associated with these programs, addressing any deficiencies arising from their implementation.
40227131	Addressing Phonological Deficit in Primary Progressive Aphasia With Behavioral Intervention and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation.	Despite recognition of the underlying phonological impairment observed in the logopenic and nonfluent variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), there is relatively little treatment research directed toward strengthening phonological skills. In this study, we focused on remediating phonological deficits in logopenic and nonfluent PPA. Specifically, we hypothesized that behavioral intervention intended to strengthen phonological manipulation skills and sound-letter correspondences-coupled with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-would improve language abilities, especially in the written modality.
40227130	Evaluation of Benzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-ones as Downstream Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors.	Epigenetic targeting of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway has emerged as a possible strategy to combat HH pathway-driven cancers. In this study, we report on benzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-ones as downstream Hedgehog pathway inhibitors. We find that benzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-one 1 has sub-micromolar potency in a variety of Hedgehog pathway cell models, including those with constitutive activity through loss of Suppressor of Fused. Compound 1 furthermore reduces cellular and ciliary GLI levels, and, like the BET bromodomain inhibitor HPI-1, increases the cellular levels of BRD2. To directly assess the ability of compound 1 to bind to BET bromodomains in cells without the need of synthetic modifications, we develop a competition assay against degrader HPP-9, the action of which was dose-dependently outcompeted by compound 1. Indeed, compound 1 reduces the viability of GLI-driven lung cancer cells and medulloblastoma spheroids, with a potency similar to its inhibitory effect on the HH pathway. Taken together, our studies highlight the potential of the benzo[cd]indol-2(1H)-one scaffold for epigenetic targeting of the HH pathway.

40227128	Zwitterionic Internalizable Peptide-Drug Conjugates: Tumor-Selective Ultrafast Uptake and Transcytosis for Enhanced Antitumor Therapy.	Here a novel class of zwitterionic internalizable peptide (ZIP)-drug conjugates is presented. The conjugates incorporate γ-glutamyl-α-aminobutyrylamino-functionalized lysine peptides as the ZIP backbones and disulfide-linked camptothecin (CPT) as the toxic payload. The ZIPs significantly enhance the water solubility of CPT without compromising its cytotoxicity. Cellular uptake profiling shows ultrafast internalization of the conjugates in tumor cells within 5 min. Mechanistic studies reveal that they enter cells via lipid raft-mediated pathways, involving both energy-driven active transport and membrane fluidity-dependent passive uptake. Furthermore, these conjugates exhibit robust transcytosis abilities across dense cell monolayers and tumor spheroids. These characteristics confer prolonged blood circulation, enhanced tumor accumulation, and deep tumor penetration on the conjugates, which result in potent in vivo antitumor activity and minimal systemic toxicity. This study underscores the potential of the conjugates for safer and more effective cancer therapies and presents ZIPs as a new category of molecularly defined delivery tools for biomedical applications.

40227126	Probing into Intraband Transitions Enabled Charge Carrier Dynamics of THz Response Generated in Graphene/MoS<sub>2</sub> Heterostructures.	The engineering of terahertz phonons is challenging due to difficulties in achieving sub-nanometer material precision and in facilitating efficient phonon coupling at terahertz frequencies region. The effective generation, detection, and manipulation of terahertz phonons via the integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures can enable new designs for next-generation optoelectronic quantum devices, offering new avenues for thermal engineering in the terahertz regime. Here, optical pump terahertz probe and terahertz time-domain experiments are used to reveal the behavior of charge carrier transfer in real time at heterostructure interfaces of single-layer graphene and monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> upon photoexcitation and plausible mechanism has been put forward. Moreover, a temperature-dependent terahertz response of GM heterostructure along with experimental observation is explored in detail with considered appropriate theoretical models. These insights can prove valuable for designing the next generation of optoelectronic applications with stacked 2D heterostructures within the terahertz bandwidth.
40227125	Single-Molecule Junctions Formed Using Different Electrode Metals Under an Inert Atmosphere.	The properties of single-molecule junctions, electronic devices approaching the limits of miniaturization, have typically been probed using inert gold electrodes. However, a complete understanding and the ultimate technological exploitation of molecular devices may only be realized if they can be readily evaluated using non-gold electrode metals - a task broadly impeded by the rapid oxidation of such materials in the air. This study demonstrates that single-molecule junctions can be formed using seven metals (gold, silver, copper, platinum, zinc, nickel, and cobalt) under an inert atmosphere inside a glovebox. The characteristic conductance features of atomic-sized junctions are first identified for each metal at room-temperature and ambient pressure, a guiding signature of nanoscale electrode formation. It is then shown that the conductance of single-molecule junctions comprising four different components does not strongly correlate with electrode work function. Snapback measurements reveal that the size of the nanogap opened upon breaking atomic point contacts exponentially correlates with the material's melting point, a proxy for the metal diffusion constant. Together, this work exposes exciting new opportunities to experimentally probe the influence of electrode metal on the formation, stability, and function of these nanoscale structures, a critical step toward the practical utilization of molecule-based nanoelectronic circuitry.

40227121	3D Printed Flexible Zinc-Ion Battery for Real-Time Health Monitoring Devices.	The growing need for multifunctional wearable electronics for mobile applications has triggered the demand for flexible and reliable energy storage devices. 3D printing technology has emerged as a promising and attractive method for manufacturing these devices. This study presents the design and fabrication of a flexible quasi-solid-state Zn-ion battery using the direct-writing 3D printing technique. A conductive silver paste with high conductivity was printed onto a PET substrate to serve as the current collector. The cathode was fabricated from carbon-coated MnO<sub>2</sub> nanorods produced using hydrothermal methods, while the anode consisted of commercial zinc powder. The cathode and anode slurries exhibiting excellent viscoelasticity were 3D printed on the current collector. To complete the flexible quasi-solid-state zinc-ion battery, a PVA gel electrolyte was printed onto the PET substrate. This battery delivered an initial capacity of 267.3 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and maintained a capacity of 189.7 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 500 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, the 3D printed battery successfully powered a portable human heart rate sensor, showcasing the potential of 3D printing technology as an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and scalable solution for wearable energy storage devices.
40227119	From Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> to Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>: Understanding Discharge Product Decomposition in Li-CO<sub>2</sub> Batteries.	Rechargeable lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO<sub>2</sub>) batteries are promising for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and energy storage. However, the high decomposition potential and sluggish kinetics of the discharge product Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> limit their practical development. Recent studies have identified Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as an alternative with superior electrochemical decomposition properties. While the nucleation mechanism of Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> has been well-studied, its decomposition mechanism remains unclear. This work comprehensively examines the physical and chemical differences between Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Both compounds exhibit insulating electronic structures, with rapid lithium diffusion occurring in the presence of lithium vacancies. Bonding analysis reveals that the C-C covalent bonds within the C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> groups are key to differentiating the two compounds. The weakly bonded C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> group lowers the decomposition potential of Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, allowing its chemical release as CO<sub>2</sub> without an energy barrier after delithiation. Climbing image nudged elastic band calculations show that the sluggish decomposition of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> results from the cooperative dissociation of two CO<sub>3</sub> groups. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that CO<sub>3</sub> dissociates slowly after delithiation, while C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> dissociates simultaneously with delithiation, leading to fast and continuous decomposition of Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This study offers mechanistic insights into the decomposition of Li-CO<sub>2</sub> discharge products and guides strategies to enhance Li-CO<sub>2</sub> battery performance.
40227118	Structural Mechanisms of Forced Unfolding of Double-Stranded Fibrin Oligomers.	Fibrin forms a polymeric scaffold of blood clots, which are subjected to deformation in their dynamic environment. The extensible fibrin network allows fibers to stretch without breaking, but the mechanisms of their forced elongation are not understood. We combined atomic force microscopy, computer simulations, and Machine Learning to explore the nanomechanics of double-stranded cross-linked fibrin oligomers (FO). From the experimental force-extension profiles, the median 63 pN unfolding force and median 8.1 nm peak-to-peak distance with corresponding 56 pN and 11.4 nm interquartile ranges indicate substantial scatter due to ∼3-5 nm extension fluctuation of the triple α-helical coiled-coils. From simulations, unraveling of FO is determined by coupled dissociation of the D:D interface, γ-nodules unfolding, and reversible unfolding-refolding of the coiled-coils. These can occur as single structural transitions (60% of the time) or mixed transitions (40% of the time), with an alternating order of strands in which unfolding transitions occur, i.e., if the previous transition takes place in one strand, the next transition occurs in the other strand. The double-stranded FO are less extensible but stiffer and more stable compared with the single-stranded oligomers. These findings provide important insights into the biomechanics and dynamic structural properties of fibrin necessary to understand the (sub)molecular origin of fibrin extensibility.
40227117	Cost and Efficiency of Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy: Endoscopy Suite Versus Outpatient Surgery Center.	Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is used to identify airway obstruction patterns in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This procedure is typically performed in either the traditional operating room (OR) or an outpatient surgery center (SC). There is limited data regarding the cost and efficiency of DISE in the endoscopy suite (ES). This study compares the cost, efficiency, and safety of DISE performed in the ES compared to the SC.
40227116	The risk of type 2 diabetes among older Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander colorectal cancer survivors:a population-based study using SEER-Medicare database.	While colorectal cancer (CRC) survival rates are improving, the risk of incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) among Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (ANHPI) ethnic groups is poorly understood. This study aims to identify high-risk groups and quantify the risk across different periods.

40227113	Toothpicks and toy football players: frictional jamming causes locomotion of vertically-shaken assymetrical objects.	In a vertically shaken vertical round container of loosely packed nominally-vertical toothpicks, the toothpicks gradually progress horizontally. This vibration-driven locomotion is also observed in vintage toy football players on a buzzing support and in modern "Bristlebots" which are toothbrush heads with phone buzzers mounted on top. In all these cases the objects, or their lower parts, have a slant. With experiments, simulations and simple approximate theories we identify the two key features of horizontal locomotion induced by vertical-shaking: (1) the normal-force dependence of Coulomb friction and (2) some, but not too much, rotational freedom of the slanted legs. The small rotational freedom causes the necessary elastic or inertial anisotropy of the slanted objects. On the other hand, the slight restriction on rotation keeps the orientation near this anisotropic state. A key factor is jamming, which tends to occur if the slant of the principal axes of the contact mass or stiffness matrix is less than the friction angle <i>ϕ</i><sub>f</sub> ≡ arctan(<i>μ</i>), where <i>μ</i> is the friction coefficient.
40227112	Recent implementations of data-independent acquisition for cancer biomarker discovery in biological fluids.	Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide and accurate biomarkers for early detection and disease monitoring are needed to improve outcomes. Biological fluids, such as blood and urine, are ideal samples for biomarker measurements as they can be routinely collected with relatively minimally invasive methods. However, proteomics analysis of fluids has been a challenge due to the high dynamic range of its protein content. Advances in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry-based proteomics can address some of the technical challenges in the analysis of biofluids, thus enabling the ability for mass spectrometry to propel large-scale biomarker discovery.
40227111	Water-Stable MIL-MOFs Developed Through a Novel Sacrifice-Protection Strategy Inspired by Butterfly Wings' Scales for Long-Term Turn-On Fluorescence Sensing of H<sub>2</sub>S.	Metal-organic frameworks, which are the desired candidates for biosensing application due to their tunable properties, are significantly hindered by their rapid degradation in aqueous solutions, as well as the loss of their inherent fluorescence. Most studies aim to improve the hydrophobicity of materials by modifying their contact angle, thereby enhancing water stability. However, water droplets poorly adhere to the surface of hydrophobic materials, limiting their application for direct contact and detection in aqueous environments. Drawing inspiration from the sacrificial protection mechanism of butterfly wings used to evade predation and entanglement, a universal approach is successfully developed to protect water-sensitive MIL-MOFs from water molecule attack while preserving good hydrophilicity. Using the organic ligand 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid (bpydc) as sacrificial protection scales, the MIL-125-NH<sub>2</sub>-bpydc demonstrated broad pH structural stability (pH 2-12) and fluorescence stability increased by 10.17 time in aqueous solutions, achieving the highest performance in MILMOFs. The MIL-125-NH<sub>2</sub>-bpydc is biocompatible enabling it to perform long-term fluorescence imaging in living cells and zebrafish, further detecting hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in the aqueous and biological systems via turn-on fluorescence emission. This study offers a novel and universal sacrifice-protection strategy for the design and development of the luminescent biocompatible MOFs tailored for biosensing applications.

40227109	Self-reported Nickel Allergy among Schoolchildren: Trends in Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Atopic Comorbidity.	Nickel allergy is common among children. The present study investigated prevalence trends of self-reported nickel allergy, risk factors, and atopic comorbidity among children. Eight-year-old children from Norrbotten County, Sweden, were recruited in 1996 (n = 3,430), 2006 (n = 2,585), and 2017 (n = 2,785). Self-reported nickel allergy decreased from 7.7% (2006) to 6.1% (2017; p = 0.024) and was significantly more common among girls. In 1996, only children with atopic dermatitis answered questions on nickel allergy. Among children with atopic dermatitis, no significant decrease was seen over the years 1996 to 2017. Ear piercing (odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-2.68 and OR 5.57, 95% CI 3.71-8.38) and female sex (OR 4.05, 95% CI 2.68-6.13 and OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.09-2.74) were risk factors for self-reported nickel allergy in 2006 and 2017, respectively. Self-reported nickel allergy was significantly more prevalent among children with atopic dermatitis than without in 2006 (12.3% vs 6.4%; p < 0.001) and 2017 (11.5% vs 5.1%; p < 0.001), and among children with allergic rhinitis in 2017 (8.6% vs 4.7%; p = 0.015). In conclusion, we found a decreasing prevalence of self-reported nickel allergy, but not among children with atopic dermatitis. Ear piercing and female sex were strongly associated with nickel allergy. Our findings also suggest that nickel allergy is associated with atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis.

40227106	Colony morphotype variation in <i>Burkholderia:</i> implications for success of applications and therapeutics.	The <i>Burkholderia</i> genus includes both environmental and pathogenic isolates known for their phenotypic plasticity and adaptability. <i>Burkholderia</i> spp. are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, often requiring prolonged therapies during infection. A key feature of <i>Burkholderia</i> spp. is colony morphotype variation (CMV), which allows for rapid adaptation to environmental changes and influences virulence, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenicity by impacting the expression of key virulence factors such as lipopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA, efflux pumps, and flagella. While alternative treatments, such as vaccines and phage therapies, hold promise, CMV has the potential to undermine their efficacy by modifying essential therapeutic targets. Despite its importance, the prevalence and underlying mechanisms of CMV remain poorly understood, leaving critical gaps in our knowledge that may hinder the development of sustainable solutions for managing <i>Burkholderia</i> infections. Addressing these gaps is crucial not only for improving infection management but also for enabling the safe reuse of <i>Burkholderia</i> in biotechnology, where their plant growth-promoting and bioremediation properties are highly valuable. Our goal is to raise awareness within the scientific community about the significance of CMV in <i>Burkholderia</i>, highlighting the urgent need to uncover the mechanisms driving CMV. A deeper understanding of CMV's role in virulence and resistance is essential to developing robust, long-term therapeutic strategies.
40227105	Recent advances of asymmetric catalytic transformations of alkylidene Meldrum's acid derivatives.	Amongst the electron-deficient alkene derivatives, as molecular platforms widely used in organic synthesis, the readily available alkylidene Meldrum's acid derivatives hold a unique place due to the high electrophilicity and chemical versatility of the 1,3-dioxan-4,6-dione moiety. This short review intends to give an overview of recent advances in the asymmetric catalytic transformation of alkylidene Meldrum's acids into valuable chiral heterocycles, evolving from seminal investigations into C-C bond construction from the alkene moiety, to more recent enantioselective C-N and C-S bond formation, vinylogous processes, and the exploitation of the reactivity of the 1,3-dioxan-4,6-dione moiety to develop efficient annulation sequences.

Emerging evidence indicates that the treatment duration of pegylated interferon-α and HBsAb may predict relapse in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who achieved clinical cure. However, the host immunological mechanisms contributing to clinical relapse remain poorly characterized.
40227096	The global prevalence and impact of steatotic liver disease and viral infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Steatotic liver disease (SLD) affects ~30% of adults worldwide. The global population is continuously threatened by epidemic and endemic viral diseases. This study aims to thoroughly examine the interaction between SLD and major viral diseases.
40227095	Assessing Nonbonded Aggregates Populations: Application to the Concentration-Dependent IR O-H Band of Phenol.	In this work, we present two alternative computational strategies to determine the populations of nonbonded aggregates. One approach extracts these populations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, while the other employs quantum mechanical partition functions for the most relevant minima of the multimolecular potential energy surfaces (PESs), identified by automated conformational sampling. In both cases, we adopt a common graph-theory-based framework, introduced in this work, for identifying aggregate conformations, which enables a consistent comparative assessment of both methodologies and provides insight into the underlying approximations. We apply both strategies to investigate phenol aggregates, up to the tetramer, at different concentrations in phenol/carbon tetrachloride mixtures. Subsequently, we simulate the concentration-dependent OH stretching IR region by averaging the harmonic Infrared (IR) spectra of aggregates using the populations predicted by each strategy. Our results indicate that the populations extracted from MD trajectories yield OH stretching signals that closely follow the experimental trends, outperforming the spectra from populations obtained by systematic conformational searches. Such a better performance of MD is attributed to a better description of the entropic contributions. Moreover, the proposed protocol not only successfully addresses a very challenging problem but also offers a benchmark to assess the accuracy of the intermolecular force fields.
40227094	Influence of Surface-Active Molecules in Solution on Charge Transfer Due to a Water-Air Contact Line Moving over a Hydrophobic Surface.	Charge transfer due to a water-air contact line moving over a fluoropolymer hydrophobic surface is investigated for an aqueous solution containing surface-active molecules. It is found that anionic (SDS) and neutral (Triton X-100) surfactants exhibit a two-stage charge transfer reduction with concentration. At low concentrations, a layer of surfactant molecules accumulates near the hydrophobic surface and partially quenches the charge transfer. Surprisingly, after this first stage, the charge transfer remains nearly constant or weakly increasing, while the concentration of surfactants increases several orders of magnitude. Eventually, for large enough concentrations, the charge transfer continues to decrease, eventually resulting in almost zero charge transfer before reaching the critical micelle concentration. For the cationic surfactant (CTAB), the behavior is entirely different and a single quenching mechanism can explain the observed reduction in charge transfer due to positively charged surface-active molecules forming a layer that electrostatically screens the water-induced negative charge residing on the hydrophobic interface. A similar behavior is observed for poly(vinyl alcohol), which is attributed to its known and strong interaction with the hydrophobic surface used in this study.
40227093	A nationwide study of primary biliary cholangitis prevalence, geographic distribution, and health care providers.	Prevalence estimates of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in the United States have evolved with the introduction of newer real-world data capture approaches. Little is known about the geographic distribution of PBC in the United States and the health care provider (HCP) landscape for patients with PBC. This real-world study aimed to estimate the prevalence of PBC in the United States, assess regional variability in its prevalence, and describe HCPs for patients with PBC.
40227092	Conception and synthesis of sequence-coded morpholinos.	Solid-phase morpholino chemistry was explored as a new route to synthesize abiological sequence-defined oligomers. Two comonomers 0 and 1 containing (i) a chlorophosphoramidate reactive function, (ii) a trityl-protected morpholine and (iii) a coding substituent (H or CH3 for 0 and 1, respectively) on the morpholine ring were first synthesized and characterized. This binary alphabet was afterwards tested for the synthesis of digitally-encoded oligomers with different length and sequences. The oligomers were prepared on a modified polystyrene resin, cleaved and characterized by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. When using a repetitive cycle containing only morpholino coupling and trityl deprotection steps, the formed oligomers were not uniform. Thus, an additional capping step was added. In these conditions, uniform coded sequences were prepared in most cases. Furthermore, the oligomers were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. In the studied collision-induced dissociation conditions, the repeat units of the oligomers undergo two main-chain fragmentations and full sequence coverage was observed for all studied sequences. Therefore, the binary messages stored in the oligomers could be decoded and retrieved in all cases.
40227091	Enabling Robotic Capsule Endoscopy Through Effective in-Body Capsule Localization.	A critical problem for wireless capsule endoscopy is to be able to correlate a received image with a location, in order to more precisely locate a pathological condition (such as a lesion, or a tumor) inside the gastrointestinal tract and guide a potential subsequent surgical intervention. We treat the problem of determining the location and orientation parameters of a wireless capsule endoscope inside the human gastrointestinal tract through magnetic techniques. Considering the emerging trend in wireless capsule endoscopy towards remotely maneuverable robotic devices (also known as robotic capsule endoscopy), solving the problem of fast, accurate localization of the capsule becomes even more critical. It is also vital that the performance of different localization algorithms be characterized effectively in a repeatable manner in a controlled environment. Towards this goal, we present a design for a novel cyber-physical system to characterize the magnetic localization performance in robotic capsule endoscopy. We present some sample results for localization performance. The results indicate that highly accurate in-body localization of the capsule (with approximately 3.1 mm localization and 2.2° orientation error) is possible.
40227090	Dyspnea Among Mechanically Ventilated Patients: A Systematic Review.	Dyspnea is a common and distressing symptom; yet, how frequently and intensely mechanically ventilated patients experience dyspnea remains unclear.

We also identified factors associated with dyspnea in the short-term and long-term and potential management strategies.
40227089	Designing CuO@rGO-MoS<sub>2</sub> Nanocomposite with Bird's-Nest Like Structure as Peroxymonosulfate Activator for the Efficient Degradation of Rhodamine B.	A straightforward, single-stage hydrothermal approach was utilized to synthesize a unique CuO@rGO-MoS<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite, featuring a nest-mimicking architecture. It has highly efficient heterogeneous catalyzed property that can catalyze and activate the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by means of radical (•OH, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>•-</sup>, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>) and nonradical (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) pathways to generate ROS for the rapid degradation of the organic dye rhodamine B (Rh.B). Graphene oxide, which has high specific surface, serves as an excellent carrier which achieves a homogeneous dispersion of the main catalyst component and gives a series of oxygen-containing functional groups that become active centers for nonradical route activation. Through experimental and DFT calculation, it was revealed that MoS<sub>2</sub> as a cocatalyst accelerated the redox cycle of the Cu active center during the activation of PMS via catalysis, further enhancing the catalytic activity of the nanocomposites. And thus the CuO@rGO-MoS<sub>2</sub>/PMS system with bird's-nest like structure achieves rapid degradation of Rh.B in a short period, and the decomposition efficiency of Rh.B reaches 99% within 30 min duration of the reaction. Besides, this system exhibits excellent resistance to environmental interference, demonstrating commendable degradation efficiency across broad pH spectrum (pH 5-11) and high levels of common interfering ions (Cl<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, etc.). To conclude, this study tried to propose and validate a catalyst design idea based on catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate by selecting appropriate main catalysts, cocatalysts, and catalyst carriers to achieve improved catalytic performance and stability of the catalysts, and the synthesized catalysts CuO@rGO-MoS<sub>2</sub> by this design strategy have shown good degradation performances in real wastewater.

40227087	Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in the Midwest: prevalence among vectors and medical provider awareness.	True bugs of the subfamily Triatominae may carry the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Endemic to South and Central America, the protozoan has been found in triatomines throughout the southern United States of America, yet it is unclear how far north Trypanosoma cruzi occurs in Triatoma species. The objective of this research was to determine if triatomines in the St. Louis metropolitan area carry this protozoan and to assess professionals across the One Health spectrum for knowledge of the vectors and Chagas disease. Triatomine bugs were collected using a variety of methods, and then processed using PCR and gel electrophoresis to determine if they were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi. In addition, a phone call survey measured knowledge of Chagas disease. Eleven Triatoma sanguisuga and one Triatoma lecticularia specimens were collected between July 2022 and October 2023. One triatomine collected was too desiccated to determine the species. Of the thirteen total specimens, 6 (46%) were positive for T. cruzi. The phone call survey yielded a response rate of 81% among 97 attempted calls. The professionals interviewed included 23 veterinarians, 19 pharmacists, 14 vector control specialists, 11 public health officials, 9 physicians, and 3 wildlife biologists. Of the 79 participants, 64% were unfamiliar with Chagas disease. This preliminary study showed that T. cruzi is prevalent among triatomines in the Midwest and that education across the One Health professional spectrum may increase knowledge among professionals.

We report the case of a 25 kg male with aortic isthmus atresia and small femoral arterial access. A BeGraft covered stent was percutaneously implanted after perforating the atretic segment. This case demonstrates the feasibility and safety of transcatheter treatment using the Bentley stent, which enables smaller femoral access compared to other balloon-expandable stent platforms.
40227084	Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 in people of Black ethnicities living with HIV in the United Kingdom.	BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected people of Black ethnicities, however, there are limited data on the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection in these populations, and none in those with HIV.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study in people of Black ethnicities with HIV in the UK. Participants were assessed for functional impairment, frailty, respiratory symptoms, anxiety and depression; they were also asked to rate aspects of their physical and mental health on a scale from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent), both at enrolment and prior to the pandemic. We report associations with COVID-19 history and recovery status.ResultsWe enrolled 183 participants between June 2021 and October 2022, 131 (72%) of whom reported COVID-19. A history of COVID-19 was associated with a reduced ability to carry out usual activities (OR 2.54 [1.03-6.21], <i>p</i> = 0.04), an increase in pain, tiredness and breathlessness, and overall decline in physical health. Of those with a history of COVID-19, 111 (85%) reported to have fully recovered. Those who had not fully recovered reported poorer functional status (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and had higher generalised anxiety scores (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Objective measures of physical function were similar in those who reported no COVID-19, COVID-19 with full recovery, and COVID-19 with incomplete recovery.ConclusionsIn this cohort of Black people with HIV, participants with a history of COVID-19 reported a reduced ability to carry out activities of daily living and various other health issues. Although most people reported full recovery from COVID-19, self-reported limitations in functional status and anxiety were common sequelae.
40227083	Single-cell profiling reveals monocyte heterogeneity and association with liver fibrosis in patients with chronic HBV.	Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection results in persistent liver inflammation, which ultimately leads to liver fibrosis and increases the risk of cirrhosis. Recruitment of circulating monocytes to the liver is an essential aspect that exacerbates liver fibrosis; however, the mechanism underlying their dysregulation, which contributes to this progression, remains unclear.
40227082	Using Internet of Things to Deal with Pandemic: A Use Case Based Framework.

40227081	Navigating coagulation: Key markers in the first 24 hours of pediatric ECMO.	BackgroundAnticoagulation in pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) presents unique challenges due to developmental hemostasis, coagulation factor production, and response to anticoagulants. This process requires close monitoring to prevent bleeding and thrombotic events. Limited data exist on how traditional coagulation tests correlate with these complications in this population in the first 24 h after ECMO cannulation.MethodsThis institutional review board-approved retrospective review was conducted on 126 children requiring ECMO between January 2017 and March 2022. Pre- and post-cannulation partial thromboplastin time (PTT), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), hemoglobin, platelet count, and fibrinogen were collected. Also measured were initial activated clotting time (ACT), time to reach target ACT post-heparin bolus (≤250 s), initial unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusion rate, and post-cannulation antithrombin III activity (ATIII).ResultsCompared to those who did not experience complications, patients who experienced bleeds showed a longer time until target ACT was reached (<i>p</i> = 0.003), prolonged post-cannulation PT and INR (<i>p</i> = 0.002 for both), lower pre- and post-cannulation fibrinogen levels (<i>p</i> = 0.008 and <i>p</i> = <0.001, respectively), and lower post-cannulation platelet counts (<i>p</i> = 0.035). However, those who experienced thrombotic complications showed only higher pre-cannulation fibrinogen levels (<i>p</i> = 0.017).ConclusionsOur data shows that fibrinogen is an important parameter which defines the risk of early bleeding or thrombotic complications during the first 24 hours of ECMO cannulation. Attention to these baseline and immediate post-cannulation laboratory values may be important to determine initial bolus dosing and adjustment of anticoagulation in these patients. Continued multi-center collaboration to determine the utility of incorporation of other coagulation studies, like anti-factor Xa and viscoelastic assays, is needed.
40227080	Staying in a punishing place: online narratives about pregnancy and abortion in pre-liberalisation Ireland.	Restricted abortion access impinges on the human rights and health of a significant number of women globally. The reproductive justice framework, as well as recent calls for the normalisation of abortion, encourage examination of the deleterious effects of abortion restrictions. This study explores the self-generated, online narratives of women who experienced crises in pregnancy while living in a restrictive context, namely pre-2019 Ireland, and who did not travel for abortion care. Mental health and emotional experiences are a specific focus. From an archived version of posts in 2018-19 to the <i>In Her Shoes - Women of the Eighth</i> Facebook page (<i>N</i> = 728), 96 personal narratives were sampled. Narratives that did not feature travel for abortion care (<i>n</i> = 25) were selected for thematic analysis, which was completed by a single researcher in 2024. Themes that emerged included waiting for intervention as a form of mental torture, fear during self-managed abortion, attempts to self-induce abortion driven by despair, and variation in the extent to which proceeding with the pregnancy was a choice. Most women who stayed in place had been constrained by circumstances in deciding to do so. These results enrich understanding of the negative effects of restrictive contexts on women's emotional wellbeing. They also draw attention to those who are effectively trapped in restricted contexts and overlooked when the literature narrowly focuses on outward travel from restrictive contexts for abortion care.
40227077	Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease: From understudied disorder to the poster child of genetic medicine.	Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) constitutes an inborn disorder arising due to mutations in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a secreted protease inhibitor produced primarily in hepatocytes. It leads to diminished serum AAT levels, and this loss-of-function predisposes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung emphysema. The characteristic Pi*Z mutation results in hepatic Z-AAT accumulation. In its homozygous form (Pi*ZZ genotype), it is responsible for the majority of severe AATD cases and can cause both pediatric and adult liver disease, while the heterozygous form (Pi*MZ) is considered a disease modifier that becomes apparent primarily in the presence of other comorbidities or risk factors. In the current review, we collate conditions associated with AATD, introduce typical AAT variants, and discuss our understanding of disease pathogenesis. We present both cross-sectional and longitudinal data informing about the natural disease history and noninvasive tools that can be used for disease stratification as well as a basis for disease monitoring. Given that AATD-associated liver disease is highly heterogeneous, we discuss the risk factors affecting disease progression. While the loss-of-function lung disease is treated by weekly intravenous administration of purified AAT, recombinant modified AAT and oral protease inhibitors are currently in clinical trials. Among the liver candidates, small interfering RNA fazirsiran efficiently suppresses AAT production and is currently in phase 3 clinical trial, while several other genetic approaches, such as RNA editing, are at earlier stages. In summary, AATD represents a systemic disorder increasingly seen in the hepatologic routine and requiring thorough interdisciplinary care, since the currently ongoing clinical trials often address only one of the organs it affects.
40227074	Improved π-Conjugation Structure of Vacuum-Processable Organic Semiconductor Mediated from Molecular Crystal Templates.	Highly π-conjugated self-assembly of organic semiconductors near gate dielectrics is important for achieving high performance in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). This paper reports that a preexisting <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-ditridecyl-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI-C<sub>13</sub>) monolayer (ML) on a polymer-passivated silicon oxide dielectric stimulates the 2D crystal growth of the same ad-molecules during subsequent film deposition, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of the π-conjugated structure with suppressed grain boundaries. The crystal template-mediated PTCDI-C<sub>13</sub> films could develop layered crystallites with highly intermolecular ordering of edge-on semiconductor molecules perpendicular to the substrate. The crystal reorganization of PTCDI-C<sub>13</sub> deposited on the ML-thick crystal template drove the 2D crystal growth of a semiconductor on a heterointerface instead of 3D crystal growth. The charge carrier mobility along the template-mediated crystal grains within a 40 nm-thick film was up to 2.70 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, 4 times higher than the 0.68 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in the ordinary polycrystalline domains developed directly at a heterointerface. Thus, using the predeposited crystal templates may be a good strategy to control the crystal structure and obtain high-quality organic thin films by vacuum deposition or orthogonal solvent film procedures.

We sequenced the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA genes and transcripts to assess entire (DNA) and active (RNA) soil bacterial communities in four different Indonesian land use systems (jungle rubber, rubber, oil palm, and rainforest). <i>Acidobacteriota</i> and <i>Planctomycetes</i> were dominant, with higher relative abundances at active community level.
40227072	PKPD modeling of the inoculum effect of combined ceftazidime/avibactam and colistin against KPC-3 <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> isolate.	The inoculum effect (IE) characterizes a decrease in the antimicrobial effect of antibiotics with increasing inoculum. To face antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic combinations are progressively used. In this context, the effect of combination may be affected by IE, especially drugs for which an IE has been described. The objective was to characterize the IE of a carbapenemase (KPC-3) <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> isolate on the combination of ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) and colistin (CST). <i>In vitro</i> time-kill curves with single and combined drugs were performed at four different inocula. The IE of each drug was described using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, and interactions on IE were investigated with the general pharmacodynamic interaction model when drugs were combined. The IE was assessed by evaluating the significance of the parameters associated with the IE model compared to the no IE model and by comparing the CFU counts over time predicted with the IE model vs the no IE model. Rapid bacterial killing was observed at 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL. For both 5·10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL inocula, initial decays followed by re-growth were observed with drugs alone, while the combination prevented the emergence of resistance. Eradication was never achieved at 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL. The IE was best modeled as a reduction of CZA maximum bactericidal effect and as an increase in CST EC<sub>50</sub> with increasing inoculum. However, no interaction between IEs was significant, meaning that CST did not modify the IE of CZA and inversely. IE may be important at least as demonstrated by <i>in vitro</i> antibiotic combination studies.

The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) combined with the Green's function <i>GW</i> method has been successfully transformed into a robust computational tool to describe light-matter interactions and excitation spectra for molecules, solids, and materials from first principles. Due to its ability to accurately describe charge transfer and Rydberg excitations, <i>GW</i>-BSE is already an established and cost-efficient alternative to time-dependent density functional theory. This raises the question whether the <i>GW</i>-BSE approach can become a more general framework for molecular properties beyond excitation energies. In this Mini-Review, we recapitulate recent endeavors along this point in terms of both theoretical and practical developments for quantum chemistry, physical chemistry, and related fields. In doing so, we provide guidelines for current applications to chemical challenges in collaboration with experimentalists as well as to future developments to extended the <i>GW</i>-BSE toolkit.
40227070	A dissolving microneedle patch enables minimally invasive riboflavin delivery and enhances corneal crosslinking in keratoconus therapy.	Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) is an effective surgical approach to halt the progression of keratoconus. A key challenge lies in maintaining epithelial integrity while achieving sufficient stromal riboflavin (RF) concentration to ensure CXL efficacy. Additionally, the efficacy of CXL under RF-mediated cross-linking still has room for improvement. In this study, we developed a silk fibroin methacryloyl (SFMA)-based dissolvable microneedle (MN) system (termed RF/SFMA MNs). <i>In vitro</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> experiments showed that RF/SFMA MNs exhibited excellent mechanical strength, dissolution profile, drug release profile and biocompatibility. <i>In vivo</i>, RF/SFMA MNs were characterized by suitable corneal penetration capability through a minimally invasive approach. MNs with different RF concentrations (0-2%) and tip lengths (330-800 µm) were tested. RF/SFMA MNs with a 1% RF concentration and a tip length of 550 µm achieved sufficient RF permeation and delivery depth within the corneal stroma. Furthermore, integrating SFMA into the CXL procedure allowed RF to mediate multiple crosslinking events between SFMA and collagen, resulting in an enhanced increase in corneal biomechanical strength compared to conventional Epi-on and Epi-off CXL strategies. Over a two-week observation period, MN-based CXL enhanced corneal biomechanics more effectively than Epi-off and Epi-on CXL, while maintaining collagen arrangement without adverse effects on the epithelium or endothelium. Therefore, RF/SFMA MNs, designed for minimally invasive RF delivery and enhanced CXL efficacy, present a promising and innovative approach to optimize CXL in the treatment of keratoconus.
40227069	Sapheno-Femoral Junction Aneurysm: Single Centre Experience With Technical Notes and Histological Analysis.	ObjectiveAn aneurysm is a localized dilation of a blood vessel, commonly referring to the arterial system, but venous aneurysms, especially in the lower limbs, are significant and often underreported vascular conditions. This study focuses on superficial venous aneurysms at the sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ), categorized as Type IA and IB.Materials and MethodsEleven patients (5 females, 6 males; mean age 50 years) with venous masses were identified after negative hernia evaluations. Diagnosis was established through clinical examination and duplex ultrasound, confirming SFJ dilation with specific inclusion criteria. Surgical excision was performed, followed by follow-up assessments up to 5 years.ResultsAll patients underwent successful surgical excision. No major complications occurred, and all patients ambulated immediately post-surgery. Five years post-operation, there were no inguinal recurrences, and residual great saphenous vein remained patent and continent. Histopathological analysis revealed wall thinning, reduced smooth muscle and elastic fibers, and fibrous connective tissue predominance.ConclusionSuperficial venous aneurysms at the SFJ are rare but can be effectively managed through surgical excision. With appropriate diagnosis and intervention, the risk of complications is minimal, supporting the need for awareness and accurate classification in clinical practice.

40227066	Patient Demographics are Associated with Testing for Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis in Children.	Among a retrospective cohort of 65,786 outpatient encounters for children > 3 years with acute respiratory tract infection at an academic institution in 2023, 38,790 (59%) had a group A streptococcal test ordered. Testing rates differed significantly by race, ethnicity, insurance type, social vulnerability index, visit location, and clinician type and children in historically underserved and socially vulnerable groups were less likely to undergo GAS testing compared to their social counterparts.
40227065	Integrating magnetic Co-nanopillars in a NbN-based VAN thin film as a multifunctional hybrid metamaterial.	NbN thin films are considered as a promising alternative candidate to conventional Al superconducting electrodes for Josephson junction devices, superconducting qubits and quantum logic circuits. Herein, by co-growing ferromagnetic Co with superconducting NbN, self-assembled NbN-Co vertically aligned nanocomposite (VAN) thin films have been successfully deposited on a MgO substrates, with NbN in its cubic superconducting phase. The obtained VAN metamaterials exhibit epitaxial growth of NbN with uniformly dispersed Co nanoplates. Further physical property characterization reveals that the NbN-Co VAN presents ferromagnet properties with strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and optical anisotropy. This hybrid metamaterial system could find future applications in superconducting spintronic devices and quantum computing devices.
40227064	High-resolution time-course observations of pollination drop withdrawal in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata).	Gymnosperms have few mechanisms for shaping the mating pool between the time of pollen reception on a pollination drop (PD) and fertilization. The duration of the PD on the ovule may be one mechanism if it changes depending on relatedness of the pollen source and the recipient. Here, we timed the duration of the PD after pollination with pollen from different clones of the outcrossing conifer Cunninghamia lanceolata.
40227063	Combating yellow fever virus with 7-deaza-7-fluoro-2'-C-methyladenosine.	Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a deadly zoonotic flavivirus endemic in tropical/sub-tropical Africa and South America transmitted by mosquito vector (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>; <i>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</i>) to humans and non-human primates. There are no approved antiviral agents for YFV. We previously identified 7-deaza-7-fluoro-2'-C-methyladenosine (DFA) with anti-YFV activity. Interestingly, DFA exhibits pan-activity in vitro against flaviviruses, such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and hepatitis C. This study aimed to expand DFA's anti-flavivirus profile. DFA exhibited potent sub-micromolar anti-YFV activity <i>in vitro</i> against both the vaccine strain (YFV-17D) and a viscerotropic clinical YFV isolate (DakH1279) concomitantly with low cellular cytotoxicity and no notable mitochondrial toxicity. <i>In vivo</i>, efficacy was assessed against both YFV-17DD and a human clinical isolate in A129 and AG129 mouse flavivirus infection models, respectively. DFA significantly reduced virus replication in the livers of YFV-infected mice and the hallmarks of YFV-induced liver damage, including alanine transaminase levels and indocyanine green clearance. Collectively, this work identifies DFA as a potent YFV inhibitor and lays the groundwork for further therapeutic development as a YFV and, potentially, pan-flavivirus therapeutic.
40227062	Developing an Evaluation Grid for the "Drawn Stories Technique": Exploring the Indicators of Children's Socio-Emotional Development, Anxiety, and Depression Levels.	Since the first development of psychology, drawing has been considered a useful tool to understand an individual's development and personality. The graphic method has been regarded as a valuable means of expressing not only personality traits but also a child's emotions and the emotional tone they "invest" in the surrounding environment. However, empirical evaluations have raised substantial doubts about the reliability and validity of this kind of technique, and the lack of studies that provide empirical scoring methods represents a significant limitation in the field. This study aims to develop a tailored evaluation grid for the Drawn Stories Technique to explore which drawing indicators-story outcomes, themes, content, and formal aspects might reflect children's socio-emotional functioning in terms of emotional and social intelligence, as well as clinical levels of anxiety and depression. The Drawn Stories Technique along with four self-report questionnaires assessing trait Emotional Intelligence, Social Intelligence, Anxiety, and Depression, were administered to 228 primary school children in groups during class time. Negative outcomes were positively related to depression scores but not to anxiety scores, while social skills were associated with fewer death-related themes. Children that exhibited clinical levels of depression tended to draw significantly fewer themes related to fables and animals, and more everyday life events. Conversely, children with clinical levels of anxiety showed differences in some formal aspects in their drawings, including fewer empty spaces and more heavy line traits. This study has shown the potential use of graphic techniques with primary school children to obtain potential indicators of maladjustment through an evaluation grid to collect information.
40227061	Impact of Endoscopic Bladder Outlet Procedures on Medical and Surgical Retreatment: A Large Population Analysis.	<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Many men undergo operation for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Although most procedures relieve symptoms, some patients experience recurrence or persistence. This study explores rates of and factors contributing to medical and surgical retreatment after index BPH procedure. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This longitudinal, retrospective, population-based cohort study used MarketScan commercial insurance claims data. From 2009, men with BPH/LUTS diagnosis were evaluated for medical and surgical retreatment after index operation. Index procedures included holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP), laser ablation of the prostate, and transurethral resection of the prostate grouped as traditional procedures, whereas transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation, water vapor thermal therapy, and prostatic urethral lift (PUL) were minimally invasive surgical therapies (MISTs). Multivariable Cox hazard models (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were used to determine factors associated with retreatment after index procedure. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We evaluated 10,938 men with median age at diagnosis of 58 years (minimum-maximum 35-65). Five-year surgical retreatment rates were highest for TUMT and PUL (24.5% and 22.3%) and lowest for HoLEP (7%; <i>p</i> < 0.001). One-year medical retreatment rates with bladder outlet medications (i.e., alpha-blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors) were higher after MIST compared with traditional procedures (42.9% <i>vs</i> 27.3%; <i>p</i> < 0.001). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Surgical and medical retreatment rates are higher than previously reported in clinical trials. MIST procedures and older age were predictive of both medical and surgical retreatment after index operation. HoLEP had the lowest rate of retreatment compared with TUMT and PUL, which had the highest.

40227055	Functional implications of respiratory syncytial virus F sequence variability: a comparative analysis using contemporary RSV isolates.	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a major global health issue. Therapeutic options are limited, but new prophylactics, all targeting the fusion (F) glycoprotein, were recently licensed. Although F sequence variation is limited, it is unclear if and how this variability translates to phenotypical differences. We analyzed full F sequences of 105 contemporary RSV isolates, gathered from children presenting with acute lower respiratory tract infections. Based on F antigenic site variation, 20 isolates were selected for functional characterization. Although RSV F diversity is generally low, the overall mean pairwise distance between RSV-A strains is higher than RSV-B (0.014 vs 0.008, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Sequence variability in the known monoclonal antibody (mAb)-binding sites seems insufficient to explain the divergent and often subgroup-dependent sensitivity to mAb neutralization. Despite comparable growth rates, mean syncytium size was higher (mean 61.68 [SD 24.51] vs 31.72 [SD 11.64], <i>P</i> < 0.001), and mean syncytium frequency was lower (mean 25.37 [SD 9.20] vs 47.85 [11.52], <i>P</i> < 0.001) in RSV-A strains. For all isolates, higher temperatures were associated with increased inactivation, although some RSV-A isolates displayed manifestly higher stability. Genomic and phenotypic variability among our contemporary RSV isolates was limited, with noticeable exceptions. The availability of new prophylactics targeting RSV F corroborates the importance of continued RSV surveillance to identify changes in the F sequence, including mutations that reduce mAb efficacy or lead to escape mutants. Surveillance should include both sequencing data and an evaluation of sensitivity to prophylactic antibodies, using contemporary clinical isolates.IMPORTANCERespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory infections in young children worldwide. Recent progress has led to new ways to prevent serious RSV-associated disease. The virus's fusion (F) protein is a key focus for vaccine development because it helps the virus enter host cells and is well conserved across different virus strains. However, it is unclear if small differences in the F protein sequence could affect how the virus behaves <i>in vitro</i>. In this study, we, therefore, analyzed 105 RSV samples from children under two who presented with respiratory infections. We selected 20 samples (12 RSV-A and 8 RSV-B) for functional testing, based on their F protein sequences. Phenotypic differences between clinical isolates and reference strains, such as virus stability at 4°C and susceptibility to monoclonal antibody neutralization, highlight the importance of using viruses isolated from recent clinical samples. Although significant functional differences were observed in traits related to the F protein, both between the RSV subgroups and within, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Ongoing monitoring of RSV is critical to ensure current and future vaccines remain effective.
40227054	Management of Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Children With Craniofacial Abnormalities and Skeletal Dysplasia.	Anatomic malformations associated with craniofacial abnormalities (CFAs) and skeletal dysplasias (SDs) contribute to airway obstruction during sleep in children, which may be treated surgically, with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, or with dental appliances. This study examines the management of OSA in children with CFAs and/﻿or SDs, including the prevalence of residual OSA postsurgery and PAP therapy compliance.
40227053	International Observerships in Global Neurosurgery: Overview and Analysis of a 40-Year Experience at Barrow Neurological Institute.	This article provides an overview of the Barrow Neurological Institute international observership and visiting scholars program, one of the oldest and largest international neurosurgical observership programs in the world, and discusses its past, present, and future directions. Background information was collected from the program manager and through one-on-one interviews with the program's founders and current chairman. A survey was administered to past observers to capture feedback. Interviews were summarized, descriptive statistical analysis was performed on quantitative survey data, and a thematic analysis was completed for qualitative data. Since 2006, 686 neurosurgeons, residents, and medical students from more than 64 countries have traveled to Barrow Neurological Institute for an observership. Five hundred and seventy (86.2%) of 661 observers with historical data on country of origin came from high-income countries or upper middle-income countries, 91 (13.7%) from lower middle-income countries, and none from low-income countries (LICs). Of 94 observers who completed the feedback survey, 67 (71%) specialized in cerebrovascular and 21 (22%) in spine. Most observers (70%) were self-funded. Cost (38%) and time (25%) were considered the greatest barriers to observership. Despite the barriers, 93% would recommend the observership to a colleague. Future aspirations for the program include fully funded observerships geared toward neurosurgeons from lower middle-income countries and LICs. Next steps for the program are better inclusion of observers from lower middle-income countries and LICs and expanded research and mentorship opportunities. Future work should investigate the effect of observership programs on career path and "brain drain."

40227051	NDM-5-carried outer membrane vesicles impair the efficacy of antibiotics against bacterial infections.	The intensifying use of antimicrobials in the rapidly growing livestock industry has heightened concerns over the proliferation of antibiotic resistance, particularly among <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> producing β-lactamase. Elucidating the role of β-lactamase could unlock novel strategies to combat drug-resistant <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> in livestock and poultry farming. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by gram-negative bacteria have the ability to encapsulate and transport components derived from their parental bacteria. This raises the intriguing possibility that OMVs from drug-resistant bacteria could harbor drug-resistance enzymes, thereby conferring protection to susceptible bacteria against antibiotics. Here, we successfully extracted OMVs from New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-5 (NDM-5)-expressing <i>Escherichia coli</i> and confirmed that these vesicles indeed carry NDM-5 protein. Furthermore, bacterial protection assays showed that these OMVs could cause sensitive bacteria treated with meropenem to restore growth activity, and the degradation of meropenem by the OMVs was verified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Lastly, the survival rate of the OMVs intervention group was significantly lower than that of the drug-treated group in a <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae infection model, validating the protective effect of these OMVs on sensitive bacteria and increasing their tolerance to meropenem. These findings illustrate that OMVs can serve as vehicles for resistance-related factors, thereby promoting antibiotic tolerance in susceptible bacteria.
40227050	The adjacent ATP-binding protein-encoding genes of the <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> phosphate-specific transport (<i>pst</i>) locus have non-overlapping cellular functions.	The widely conserved <i>pst-phoU</i> operon encodes a low-velocity, high-affinity, ATP-dependent importer for inorganic phosphate (Pi). The <i>pstB</i> gene encodes the ATPase that powers the import of Pi into the cell. In some Firmicutes, including the gastrointestinal commensal and opportunistic pathogen <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, the <i>pst-phoU</i> locus contains adjacent <i>pstB</i> genes. In this work, we compared the functionality of <i>E. faecalis pstB1</i> and <i>pstB2. E. faecalis pstB1</i> and <i>pstB2</i> share sequence similarities with verified PstB ATPases from <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> and only share ~60% amino acid identity with each other. Deletion of <i>pstB1</i> was associated with a growth defect in low Pi-containing chemically defined medium (CDM), reduced Pi uptake, and a moderate increase in alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity. Deletion of <i>pstB2</i> fully inhibited growth in CDM regardless of inorganic phosphorus source but did not hinder growth in rich, undefined medium. The Δ<i>pstB2</i> mutant also exhibited a significant increase in AP activity that was associated with extracellular Pi accumulation. Overexpression of <i>pstB2</i> in the <i>pstB1</i> mutant was sufficient to restore growth in low-Pi CDM, Pi uptake, and AP activity, but this was not recapitulated with overexpression of <i>pstB1</i> in the Δ<i>pstB2</i> mutant. Deletion of either <i>pstB</i> paralog increased expression of the tandem paralog, and overexpression of <i>pstB2</i> in Δ<i>pstB2</i> reduced <i>pstB1</i> expression. These results suggest that the <i>E. faecalis pstB2</i>-encoded ATPase is required for Pi import, while the <i>pstB1</i>-encoded ATPase has an accessory role in Pi import that can be duplicated by the presence of excess PstB2.
40227049	Characterizing antimicrobial activity of environmental <i>Streptomyces</i> spp. and oral bacterial and fungal isolates from <i>Canis familiaris</i> and <i>Felis catus</i>.	Antimicrobials are a pillar of modern medicine, yet our limited arsenal of antibiotics and antifungals is currently threatened by widespread drug resistance. Ongoing efforts are focused on developing strategies to identify compounds that enhance the efficacy of current antimicrobials and develop novel, resistance-evasive therapeutic strategies. In this study, we characterized microbial isolates from two distinct environments to identify those that exhibit antimicrobial activity alone and in combination with current antimicrobials: (i) oral isolates from domesticated animals and (ii) environmental <i>Streptomyces</i> spp. First, conditioned media prepared from bacterial and fungal oral isolates that were collected from <i>Canis familiaris</i> and <i>Felis catus</i> were screened for antibacterial and antifungal activity. Three supernatants from bacterial isolates exhibited antifungal activity against the human fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of fluconazole, the most widely deployed antifungal. Additionally, two bacterial isolates displayed antibacterial activity against <i>Escherichia coli</i> alone and in combination with the antibacterial ampicillin. Furthermore, 32 environmental isolates of confirmed and predicted <i>Streptomyces</i> spp. were screened for activity against <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>E. coli</i>. Cell-free media harvested from isolates WAC5038 and WAC5287 exhibited antifungal activity against <i>Candida</i> spp., while only the WAC5038-conditioned medium displayed antibacterial activity. Bioactivity-guided fractionation, coupled with UV/Vis absorbance spectra, suggested that the bioactive compound in WAC5287 has a similar absorbance spectrum to the antifungal class of polyenes, while the bioactive component of WAC5038 remains unknown. Overall, this work highlights a strategy to collect and screen environmental isolates for the identification of novel antimicrobials.
40227048	Genomics for antimicrobial resistance-progress and future directions.	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical global public health threat, with bacterial pathogens of primary concern. Pathogen genomics has revolutionized the study of bacterial pathogens and provided deep insights into the mechanisms and dissemination of AMR, with the precision of whole-genome sequencing informing better control strategies. However, generating actionable data from genomic surveillance and diagnostic efforts requires integration at the public health and clinical interface that goes beyond academic efforts to identify resistance mechanisms, undertake <i>post hoc</i> analyses of outbreaks, and share data after research publications. In addition to timely genomics data, consideration also needs to be given to epidemiological sampling frames, analysis, and reporting mechanisms that meet International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards and generation of reports that are interpretable and actionable for public health and clinical "end-users." Importantly, ensuring all countries have equitable access to data and technology is critical, through timely data sharing following the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable). In this review, we describe (i) advances in genomic approaches for AMR research and surveillance to understand emergence, evolution, and transmission of AMR and the key requirements to enable this work and (ii) discuss emerging and future applications of genomics at the clinical and public health interface, including barriers to implementation. Harnessing advances in genomics-enhanced AMR research and embedding robust and reproducible workflows within clinical and public health practice promises to maximize the impact of pathogen genomics for AMR globally in the coming decade.

Craniocervical junction (CCJ) arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are rare conditions, with the optimal timing and approach to treatment still debated among neurosurgeons. The aim of this study was to characterize CCJ AVF-related SAH and determine appropriate surgical timing in a multicenter study.
40227046	Defining the networks that connect RNase III and RNase J-mediated regulation of primary and specialized metabolism in <i>Streptomyces venezuelae</i>.	RNA metabolism involves coordinating RNA synthesis with RNA processing and degradation. Ribonucleases play fundamental roles within the cell, contributing to the cleavage, modification, and degradation of RNA molecules, with these actions ensuring appropriate gene regulation and cellular homeostasis. Here, we employed RNA sequencing to explore the impact of RNase III and RNase J on the transcriptome of <i>Streptomyces venezuelae</i>. Differential expression analysis comparing wild-type and RNase mutant strains at distinct developmental stages revealed significant changes in transcript abundance, particularly in pathways related to multicellular development, nutrient acquisition, and specialized metabolism. Both RNase mutants exhibited dysregulation of the BldD regulon, including altered expression of many cyclic-di-GMP-associated enzymes. We also observed precocious chloramphenicol production in these RNase mutants and found that in the RNase III mutant, this was associated with PhoP-mediated regulation. We further found that RNase III directly targeted members of the PhoP regulon, suggesting a link between RNA metabolism and a regulator that bridges primary and specialized metabolism. We connected RNase J function with translation through the observation that RNase J directly targets multiple ribosomal protein transcripts for degradation. These findings establish distinct but complementary roles for RNase III and RNase J in coordinating the gene expression dynamics critical for <i>S. venezuelae</i> development and specialized metabolism.
40227045	Major updates to FDA-recognized Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints are a win for the fight against antimicrobial resistance.	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing crisis for global health. At the front lines of detecting AMR are clinical laboratories, which perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). In recent years, the ability of laboratories to conduct this testing in the United States has been challenged by changing interpretive standards and increased regulation surrounding laboratory testing, most recently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation of laboratory-developed tests. In early 2025, the FDA recognized many breakpoints published by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, including for microorganisms that represented an unmet need. This unprecedented step heralds a pragmatic approach to AST by the FDA and is a major win for laboratories, clinicians, and patients in the United States and globally. In this commentary, we discuss these changes and the impact on clinical laboratories.
40227044	Assessing Morbidity and Mortality in Adult Patients With Acute Traumatic Cervical Spinal Cord Injury Using a Modified Risk Analysis Index.	The Risk Analysis Index (RAI) is a comprehensive assessment of frailty for predicting neurosurgical outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess whether frailty, measured by a modified RAI (mRAI), was an independent predictor of adverse events (AEs), nonroutine discharge (NRD), and in-hospital mortality for patients with acute cervical spinal cord injuries (SCIs).
40227043	Using Natural Language Processing to Automate Screening of Abstracts for Neurosurgical Guideline Creation.	The body of neurosurgical literature has grown exponentially with publication rates increasing year-over-year. Manual screening of abstracts for systematic review creation and guideline formation has become an arduous process because of the mass of literature. Natural Language Processing, namely, large language models (LLMs), has shown promise in automating the abstract screening process. We evaluated whether Gemini Pro and ChatGPT, two LLM, can automate the screening of abstracts for a guideline created by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.
40227041	Comparative efficacy of levofloxacin, azithromycin, and doxycycline prophylaxis and treatment in an experimental <i>Ureaplasma</i> murine lung infection model.	Although lung transplant recipients who develop <i>Ureaplasma-</i>associated hyperammonemia syndrome are treated with <i>Ureaplasma</i>-targeted antibiotics, optimal therapy is incompletely defined, and typically not based on real-time antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. This study compared levofloxacin, azithromycin, and doxycycline prevention and treatment of <i>Ureaplasma urealyticum</i> (UU) and <i>Ureaplasma parvum</i> (UP) infections in an immunosuppressed murine lung infection model. For prophylaxis, mice received antibiotics before infection with UP-FS (susceptible to all study antibiotics), UP-AzmR (azithromycin-resistant), UP-LevR (levofloxacin-resistant), or UU-DoxR (doxycycline-resistant), with lung bacterial loads (color changing units [CCUs]) measured 18 hours following infection. For UP-FS, doxycycline was most active (Δ4.84 log<sub>10</sub> CCU/g; <i>P</i> = 0.0006), followed by levofloxacin (Δ2.45 log<sub>10</sub> CCU/g; <i>P</i> = 0.018), with azithromycin yielding a nonsignificant CCU reduction. Doxycycline (Δ1.9 log<sub>10</sub> CCU/g; <i>P</i> = 0.0025) and levofloxacin (Δ1.3 log<sub>10</sub> CCU/g; <i>P</i> = 0.004) showed activity against UP-AzmR. Only doxycycline showed activity against UP-LevR (Δ2.28 log<sub>10</sub> CCU/g; <i>P</i> = 0.0002), and only azithromycin showed activity against UU-DoxR (Δ0.67 log<sub>10</sub> CCU/g; <i>P</i> = 0.0175). For treatment, antibiotics were administered 24 hours following infection; doxycycline significantly reduced bacterial loads of all study isolates, except UU-DoxR. In addition, azithromycin was active against UP-LevR (Δ1.21 log<sub>10</sub> CCU/g reduction; <i>P</i> = 0.0003). In summary, except for doxycycline-resistant UU, doxycycline was active in preventing and treating <i>Ureaplasma</i> lung infection in immunosuppressed mice.
40227039	Impact of hepatic impairment and renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid and its metabolites: contribution of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.	Linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibiotic, is used in patients with liver or kidney disease. However, the effects and mechanisms of hepatic impairment or renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid and its metabolites (PNU-142586 and PNU-142300) remain unclear. We used carbon tetrachloride-induced impaired hepatic function and 5/6 nephrectomy-induced renal failure rat models to investigate linezolid and metabolite pharmacokinetics. Isolated primary rat hepatocytes were used to evaluate the impact of hepatic impairment or renal failure on linezolid metabolism. Uptake and efflux transport studies were also conducted. The influence of hepatic impairment or renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid and two metabolites did not differ between intragastric gavage and intravenous administration in rats. Linezolid did not accumulate in the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and small intestinal tissues of the hepatic impairment or renal failure rats. And PNU-142300 did not accumulate in the liver or kidney tissue. Compared to the isolated normal rat hepatocytes, the <i>in vitro</i> hepatic clearance of linezolid in hepatic impairment and renal failure rat hepatocytes decreased by 61.3% and 44.1%, respectively. Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), or multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR) did not mediate linezolid transport. Hepatic impairment primarily increases linezolid exposure through reduced hepatic metabolism, whereas renal failure increases both linezolid and two metabolites exposure through reduced hepatic metabolism and renal glomerular filtration. These findings guide adjusting the dose of linezolid in patients with hepatic and renal insufficiency.
40227038	Performance of disc diffusion and four commercially available MIC tests to determine mecillinam susceptibility on carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales.	Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are predominantly caused by Enterobacterales, and escalating resistance poses significant challenges due to carbapenemase production, which can compromise the efficacy of last-resort antibiotics. Pivmecillinam, as the prodrug of mecillinam, may serve as a treatment option for UTIs caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE). However, accurate methods are required to accurately assess susceptibility to this antibiotic. This study aimed to evaluate the <i>in vitro</i> susceptibility of mecillinam on a collection of 161 well-characterized CPE isolates collected from July to November 2023 in France and assess the performances of disc diffusion, Liofilchem MTS gradient strip, bioMérieux E-test, Sensititre broth microdilution, and VITEK 2 compared to agar dilution (reference method) in this specific population of CPE. None of the commercially available tests met the International Organization for Standardization standards with this entire collection. Using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) or European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines on the complete collection of CPE, disc diffusion possessed the best categorical agreement [77.0 (124/161) or 84.5% (131/161), respectively]. Sensititre broth microdilution and VITEK 2 overestimated MICs (by 1.8 and one doubling-dilution, respectively) but had low very major error (VME) rates (0% (0/53) for Sensititre and 4.2% (6/53) for VITEK 2 with CLSI and 0% (0/53) for Sensititre and 11.3% (6/53) for VITEK 2 with EUCAST). Notably, when focusing solely on <i>E. coli</i> isolates (<i>n</i> = 45), performance improved considerably. Both disc diffusion and VITEK 2 demonstrated high categorical agreements [95.6 (43/45) and 93.3% (42/45), respectively] with no VME observed for either method using CLSI breakpoints. In conclusion, while agar dilution remains the reference method for mecillinam MIC determination, disc diffusion and VITEK2 are accurate alternatives to determine mecillinam susceptibility in CPE isolates, especially for <i>Escherichia coli</i>.

40227035	Current Understanding of Crouzon Syndrome Pathophysiology and New Therapeutic Approaches.	Crouzon syndrome (CS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of cranial sutures, leading to craniofacial abnormalities and potential neurological complications. CS is caused primarily by gain-of-function mutations in the FGFR2 gene and, less commonly, by mutations in the FGFR3 gene (specifically associated with CS with acanthosis nigricans). Managing CS requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining early and later surgical interventions to prevent intracranial hypertension and correct craniofacial deformities, along with ongoing care to address associated complications. Recent advancements in CS classification on the basis of cranial suture involvement have refined phenotype-genotype correlations, improving personalized therapeutic strategies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and updated overview of CS, including detailed insights into molecular genetics and biological mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology, and a depiction of the clinical features, diagnosis, and surgical aspects of CS. In addition, we delve into innovative theranostic views, where molecular genetic testing allows the design of personalized noninvasive therapeutic approaches based on innovative biotechnologies, including RNA-interference molecules, pharmacological modulation of FGFR signaling pathways, and recombinant proteins. These advancements underscore the importance of integrating molecular studies into diagnostic and therapeutic protocols to increase the precision and effectiveness of nonsurgical treatments for CS.
40227034	Novel <i>Plasmodium falciparum Kelch13</i> polymorphisms in Cameroon with structural and physicochemical impact.	The recent emergence of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (<i>Pf</i>) parasites resistant to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) in Africa has outlined the need for continuous molecular surveillance of artemisinin partial resistance. Here, the genetic polymorphism in the <i>Kelch</i> 13 gene (<i>pfk13</i>) and its structural impact were analyzed. <i>Pf</i>DNA was extracted from dried blood spots of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals living in different epidemiological facets of Cameroon. The <i>pfk13</i> gene was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction, and amplicons were sequenced to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The evolutionary history and the impact of the polymorphisms on physicochemical properties, structure, and function of the pfK13 protein were appraised using various <i>in silico</i> models. A total of ten SNPs were identified in this study, of which five non-synonymous SNPs have not been previously reported (L647<b><u>F</u></b>, D648<b><u>V</u></b>, N657<b><u>S</u></b>, K658<b><u>R</u></b>, and L663<b><u>P</u></b>). The genetic diversity of <i>pfk13</i> sequences was low, and the <i>pfk13</i> gene evolved under the neutral model. Some mutations, especially L663<b><u>P</u></b>, appeared to affect the function and structure of the pfK13 protein. Analysis of the physicochemical properties of the Cameroonian pfK13 protein sequences revealed slight changes in the solvent-accessible surface area, isoelectric point, and hydrophobicity. The results support the ongoing use of ACTs in the study areas, given the absence of validated SNPs associated with artemisinin partial resistance. Computational findings suggest a possible deleterious effect of some novel SNPs on the pfK13 structure and/or function.
40227033	Bidirectional Intramolecular Singlet and Triplet Energy Transfer in Tetracene-Ultrasmall Gold Nanocluster Dyads: An Evaluation of the Triplet Behavior of Gold Nanoclusters.	A series of tetracene (Tc)-alkanethiol-functionalized gold nanoclusters (Au<i><sub>m</sub></i>: <i>m</i> = 25, 38) dyads with varying alkyl chain lengths (<i>n</i> = 5, 11) (denoted as Tc-C<i><sub>n</sub></i>-Au<i><sub>m</sub></i>) were synthesized to investigate the excited-state dynamics through the triplet excited state of these gold nanoclusters. Transient absorption measurements revealed bidirectional intramolecular energy transfer processes, including the initial singlet-singlet energy transfer (S-SEnT) from Tc to Au<sub>25</sub>, followed by the subsequent triplet-triplet energy transfer (T-TEnT) from Au<sub>25</sub> to Tc in Tc-C<i><sub>n</sub></i>-Au<sub>25</sub> (<i>n</i> = 5, 11), with nearly similar rate constants regardless of the alkyl chain length (<i>n</i>). In the case of Tc-C<sub>5</sub>-Au<sub>38</sub>, intramolecular S-SEnT from Tc to Au<sub>38</sub> was similarly observed; however, T-TEnT from Au<sub>38</sub> to Tc was not detected. The differences in excited-state dynamics between Tc-C<sub>5</sub>-Au<sub>25</sub> and Tc-C<sub>5</sub>-Au<sub>38</sub> can be attributed to variations in the triplet energies of Au<i><sub>m</sub></i>. These results clearly demonstrate the triplet character of Au<sub>25</sub> and Au<sub>38</sub>.

40227029	Birth season associates with multiple anthropometric traits in Estonian children.	Seasonal variation in maternal exposure to sunlight during pregnancy, which relates to variation in vitamin D and other micronutrient availability for a fetus, is a prevalent explanation for the variation of offspring traits with birth season. However, little consensus exists about the pregnancy period during which the fetus is most sensitive to maternal UV exposure and which offspring traits are most sensitive. We examined the association between 11 anthropometric traits and birth season/month among 18,459-23,876 Estonian children born in 1937-62. Nine traits showed seasonal patterns, which were generally weak, compared to the effects of family socioeconomic position (SEP). Most prominent nonlinear associations between offspring traits and birth month emerged among children of mothers in unskilled manual professions. A possible explanation is that the growth of children in high-SEP families is more strongly buffered against any external exposures (including possible shortage of maternally synthesised vitamin D and essential micronutrient availability) than in low-SEP settings. For most traits, children born in spring/summer were larger than those born in autumn/winter. Hip width, trunk length and weight showed the most distinct seasonal patterns. If these birth-season-related patterns are related to maternal sunlight exposure, our results support the view that UV exposure benefits offspring growth towards the end of pregnancy. It is also possible that children born in spring and summer benefitted from the seasonally increasing nutrient availability during the first post-natal months.
40227028	Evaluation of Patients Undergoing Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for Earthquake-Related Tissue Injuries.	Tissue injuries that occur after earthquakes are usually traumatic and cause various anatomical damages. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is an increasingly popular treatment modality for such tissue injuries because it has the potential to accelerate the healing process of tissues by providing effective oxygen.This study aimed to present a retrospective evaluation of the effects and outcomes of HBOT in patients with tissue damage after earthquakes, thus contributing to the development of medical intervention strategies following natural disasters.
40227027	Review of the Emergency Preparedness, Resilience, and Response Exercise Frequency of NHS Acute Trusts in England.	In England, the Civil Contingencies Act (Contingency Planning) Regulations 2005 require National Health Service (NHS) Trusts which provide hospital accommodation and services in relation to accidents or emergencies to conduct Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) exercises. The NHS England EPRR Framework specifies the minimum frequencies of these exercises. This review assessed the number of Trusts conducting exercises in accordance with these frequencies one year after the national NHS COVID-19 response was stepped down.
40227025	Heavy metal exposure risk to black-winged stilt (<i>Himantopus himantopus</i>) in a typical industrial city in northwest of China.	Heavy metal pollution poses a critical threat to waterfowl, and a quantitative risk assessment model is significant for accurately evaluating the threat level and providing early warning of the potential harm before the situation becomes nonreversible. In this study, the exposure risk of heavy metals to black-winged stilt (<i>Himantopus himantopus</i>) was assessed in three districts (Dawukou District, Huinong District and Pingluo County) of Shizuishan, an important industrial city in northwestern China. The results showed that Cr, Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations in habitat soil or water exceeded the local background levels or the permissible safe limits, which were the main heavy metal pollutants in the habitats. Cd and Cr were the most major heavy metals causing potential ecological hazards in the habitat. The food pathway and soil pathway were the main routes of exposure to heavy metals in waterfowl, and Cr was the priority pollutant in waterfowl conservation in Shizuishan due to the high health risk grade. The combined risks of heavy metals were high in all three districts; however, the potential health hazards to waterfowl in Dawukou District, a region historically associated with coal mining activities that has undergone years of ecological remediation, especially need to focus attention. Our findings provide a scientific basis for waterfowl conservation and their habitat improvement management in industrial cities.

40227021	The evolution of machine learning potentials for molecules, reactions and materials.	Recent years have witnessed the fast development of machine learning potentials (MLPs) and their widespread applications in chemistry, physics, and material science. By fitting discrete <i>ab initio</i> data faithfully to continuous and symmetry-preserving mathematical forms, MLPs have enabled accurate and efficient atomistic simulations in a large scale from first principles. In this review, we provide an overview of the evolution of MLPs in the past two decades and focus on the state-of-the-art MLPs proposed in the last a few years for molecules, reactions, and materials. We discuss some representative applications of MLPs and the trend of developing universal potentials across a variety of systems. Finally, we outline a list of open challenges and opportunities in the development and applications of MLPs.
40227020	Emergence of Triazole-Resistant <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> after Exposure to Environmentally Relevant Concentrations of Difenoconazole in Liquid Medium and Soil.	The rapid global emergence and spread of resistance to clinical triazoles in <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> have been associated with the use of agricultural triazole fungicides. However, there is no direct evidence currently linking the emergence of triazole-resistant <i>C. neoformans</i> (TRCN) strains to the application of triazole fungicides in soil. This study investigated whether triazole resistance in <i>C. neoformans</i> could be induced by difenoconazole, an agricultural triazole fungicide, in liquid medium and soil. Our findings reveal that environmentally relevant concentrations of difenoconazole can drive cross-resistance to clinical triazoles in <i>C. neoformans</i> through the upregulation of <i>ERG11</i> and efflux pump genes (<i>AFR1</i>, <i>AFR3</i>, and <i>MDR1</i>). Notably, the prevalence of TRCN strains in soil correlates with residual difenoconazole levels, with significantly more TRCN isolates observed at two- and five-fold the recommended dose than at the standard dose. These results provide direct evidence linking agricultural triazole use to the emergence of TRCN and highlight the importance of applying difenoconazole at or below the recommended dosage to mitigate resistance development in soil environments. This study addresses a critical gap in the understanding of the environmental drivers of triazole resistance and underscores the need for responsible fungicide use to prevent the spread of resistant pathogens.
40227017	The impact of arterial cannulation strategy on carotid perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass: A computational fluid dynamics analysis from the perspective of vascular anatomy.	<i>Introduction:</i> Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is utilized during cardiovascular surgery to maintain organ oxygen supply and blood perfusion instead of cardiopulmonary function. Three primary methods of artery cannulation used for CPB include ascending aortic cannulation (AscAoC), right axillary artery cannulation (rAxAC), and femoral artery cannulation (FAC).<i>Methods:</i> In this study, computational fluid dynamics simulation technology was employed to analyze aorta and main branches of 62 patients undergoing CPB with different arterial cannulation schemes, observing carotid artery (CarA) perfusion and characteristics.<i>Conclusions:</i> Results indicate that the total perfusion of bilateral CarAs using the three cannulation methods was sufficient when there was no significant variation in arterial morphology. Without considering the peripheral resistance and the body's autoregulatory function, the right CarA was less perfused than the left CarA under AscAoC and rAxAC, leading to perfusion imbalance. Especially heteroplastic patients with rAxAC may be at risk of the right CarA hypoperfusion during CPB. FAC provides balanced and adequate perfusion of both hemispheres without stenosis or dissection of the aorta.
40227016	Investigation of the Relationship Between Disaster Risk Perception and Sustainable Earthquake Awareness of Nursing Students.	This study aimed to assess the perception of disaster risk and the level of earthquake awareness among students enrolled in the Department of Nursing at Artvin Çoruh University, Faculty of Health Sciences. The study sample comprised 274 students enrolled in the Department of Nursing at Artvin Çoruh University, Faculty of Health Sciences. The data were gathered utilizing the Sociodemographic Characteristics Form, Disaster Risk Perception Scale, and Sustainable Earthquake Awareness Scale. The data was obtained using the SPSS 24.0 program and analyzed using <i>t</i> tests, One-way ANOVA, and Pearson correlation analyses. The study's findings indicate that most students have yet to undergo disaster training, yet most are interested in such training. Furthermore, it was ascertained that most students had not encountered any calamity. However, they wanted to participate actively and voluntarily in disaster scenarios. A statistically significant difference was observed between the students' class and the average total scores of disaster risk perception scale and sustainable earthquake awareness scale. Courses on disaster management should be added to nursing education curricula. In order to provide disaster risk perception and sustainable earthquake awareness to nursing students, they need to take part in different activities in the field of disaster management.

40227011	Hybrid Molecules as Efficient Drugs against Multidrug-Resistant Malaria Parasites.	This review is focused on hybrid molecules defined as chemical entities with two or more structural domains, as antimalarial drug-candidates, over the past 25 years. Due to their different pharmacophores, such hybrids can interact with a single biological target by different and complementary mechanisms; they can also act simultaneously on several targets having complementary biological functions (dual mode of action), and can theoretically reduce the selection of parasite drug-resistance. This review is not an exhaustive report of all hybrid drugs tested on malaria parasites but a selection of hybrids with pharmacologically relevant antiplasmodial properties and original chemical structures. The choice of pharmacophore synthons and junction arms is obviously decisive. Among the large varieties of hybrid drugs published, emoquine-1 appears at the moment as a promising antimalarial drug candidate, considering 1) its high activities on several multidrug-resistant Plasmodium lab strains and field isolates, 2) its capacity to eliminate the quiescent forms of the artemisinin-resistant parasites, and 3) its curative properties in a malaria mouse model. Such molecules confirm the synergistic effect of hybrid compounds compared to the combination of the pharmacophores leading to novel chemical structures that meet the critical parameters for new antimalarial drugs.
40227007	3D printed heart models assist in pre-procedural planning of the innominate vein to pulmonary venous atrium redirection (Hraska / Rome procedures).	Innominate vein redirection to the pulmonary venous atrium has been used in single ventricle patients in order to relieve lymphatic complications resulting from systemic venous hypertension. This has been achieved both surgically, known as the Hraska procedure and via transcatheter approach, known as the Rome procedure. Determining the pathway from the innominate vein to the pulmonary venous atrium is challenging with important intra- and extra-cardiac structures close-by. We present two cases; one surgical and one transcatheter approach, where 3D-printed cardiac models were used to assist in the pre-procedural planning of this relatively novel and challenging strategy.

Enantioselective amine-catalyzed conjugate additions of aldehydes to oxetane- and azetidine-containing nitroolefins afford γ-nitroaldehydes as key building blocks <i>en route</i> to spirocyclic oxetane/azetidine-pyrrolidines. The study provided insights into the stability and reactivity of these β,β-disubstituted nitroolefins and enabled the enantioselective synthesis of chiral oxetanes and azetidines in moderate-to-high yields and enantioselectivities. This approach expands synthetic access to medicinally relevant scaffolds and broadens the scope of enantioselective organocatalytic transformations.
40227005	Heartmate 3 left ventricular assist device system in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.	BackgroundGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic enzymatic disorder that affects millions of people worldwide and characterized by hemolysis under oxidative stress. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have substantially enhanced survival and quality of life for individuals with advanced heart failure. However, their use is associated with the risk of hemolysis, thrombosis, and embolic events. These risks may be heightened in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Given the limited published research on this subject, the primary objective of this study was to assess the degree of hemolysis and identify associated factors in adult patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency who underwent Heartmate 3 (HM3) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation.MethodsThis retrospective, observational, single-center study was conducted on adult (>18 years of age) patients with G6PD deficiency, who underwent LVAD implantation using the HM3 LVAD between 2017 and 2022. Hemolysis-related investigation and findings as well as in-hospital outcome were assessed.ResultsLeft ventricular assist devices (LVADs) were successfully implanted in five adult patients with G6PD deficiency, including one individual with associated sickle cell trait (SCT). There were no major complications or fatalities during the hospitalization period. The average follow-up duration was 30 months (mean 30.4 ± 13). During the follow-up period, two patients died, two LVADs were explanted, and one patient received a heart transplant. No instances of macroscopic hemolysis were observed throughout the follow-up period.ConclusionsWhile our study was limited in size, LVADs seem safe for G6PD-deficient patients and offer significant clinical benefits. Larger studies are needed to confirm this and assess long-term interactions.
40227004	Protein-losing enteropathy after fontan surgery: insights from Vietnamese clinical experience and the need for global collaboration.	Protein-losing enteropathy remains a formidable and underrecognised complication following Fontan surgery, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality among affected patients. Despite substantial progress in managing single-ventricle CHDs, protein-losing enteropathy persists as a major clinical challenge, particularly in resource-constrained environments where specialised diagnostic modalities are scarce. This manuscript discusses the prevalence, clinical presentation, diagnostic hurdles, and management of protein-losing enteropathy in post-Fontan patients, drawing from clinical experiences in Vietnam. Among 95 post-Fontan patients reviewed, the prevalence of protein-losing enteropathy was 4.2%, with considerable morbidity necessitating invasive interventions and, in some cases, resulting in mortality. Diagnostic limitations, including restricted access to alpha-1-antitrypsin clearance testing, highlight the urgent need for heightened clinical suspicion and pragmatic diagnostic approaches. We advocate for integrating low-cost, widely accessible screening measures, such as routine serum protein monitoring, into standard post-Fontan care protocols to enhance early detection and management of protein-losing enteropathy. Furthermore, we underscore the critical importance of global collaboration and multicentre research initiatives to address the worldwide burden of protein-losing enteropathy, facilitate resource-sharing, and develop evidence-based interventions. Coordinated international efforts are essential to closing diagnostic and treatment gaps, ultimately improving survival and quality of life for patients living with the Fontan circulation.

40227002	Hydrogen Controls the Heavy Atom Roaming in Transient Negative Ion.	Bromine and hydrogen play unusual roles as mobile atom and dissociation dynamics moderator, respectively, during roaming in the 3-bromo-4H-1,2,4-triazole anion. The present study of the reactivity of 3-bromo-1H-1,2,4-triazole and 3-bromo-4H-1,2,4-triazole with low-energy electrons reveals the effect of the hydrogen position on the reaction dynamics. We report energy-dependent ion yields for both molecules showing significant differences. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that heavy Br atom migration is energetically more favored than H atom migration in the case of the H atom adjacent to Br. This is enabled by the energetically favorable formation of a noncovalent complex of Br<sup>-</sup> around the triazole ring. Recently, such complexes have been reported for several other biologically relevant molecules. In the present work, we demonstrate that the position of hydrogen on the ring influences the character of the lowest resonant state and, consequently, the Br<sup>-</sup> roaming and dissociation dynamics, particularly the neutral release of hydrogen bromide.
40227001	High-Resolution Full-Field Structural Microscopy of the Voltage-Induced Filament Formation in VO<sub>2</sub>-Based Neuromorphic Devices.	In order to make neuromorphic functions in memristive devices more efficient, information about the structural properties of filament formation at the micro- and mesoscopic scales is necessary. Despite extensive research on VO<sub>2</sub>, a key material due to its filament formation, local operando structural measurements remain challenging and often involve destructive specimen preparation and long rastering times, greatly limiting the scope of experimental studies. Utilizing dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM), a full-field imaging modality, structural signatures of the filament formation process operando are revealed in VO<sub>2</sub> devices. DFXM experiments illustrate that rutile filaments contain isolated monoclinic clusters, indicating structural nonuniformity interior to the filament. The formation of the rutile phase beneath device electrodes was shown to precede filament development, followed by the formation of filament paths guided by nucleation sites within the device. Finally, a medium-term (<30 min) memory mechanism is observed in VO<sub>2</sub>, mediated by sites within the device gap that tend to switch at significantly lower voltages after electrical cycling, a tendency that persists through a brief thermal reset. High spatial resolution, large field-of-view, structure selectivity, and fast signal acquisition of DFXM provided insight into structural features of the filamentary channel and surrounding regions during voltage cycling.
40227000	Phase-dependent optical, photocatalytic and capacitive properties of tungsten oxide nanowires.	Transition metal oxides hold great promise across a wide range of applications due to favorable properties such as high abundance, low toxicity, and excellent stability. Nanoengineering approaches are essential for controlling the structural, optical, and electronic properties of these materials, enabling the achievement of desired characteristics in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner. In this study, we synthesize stoichiometric (WO<sub>3</sub>) and sub-stoichiometric (WO<sub>3-<i>x</i></sub>) tungsten oxide nanowires by controlling their phases and morphologies through the hydrothermal method. This approach allows us to systematically investigate the effects of different phases and oxygen vacancies on the optical properties, as well as on photocatalytic and supercapacitance applications. We use the photodegradation of RhB as a benchmark for photocatalytic activity under various experimental conditions, revealing that oxygen vacancies significantly influence photocatalytic behavior. For example, WO<sub>3-<i>x</i></sub> nanowires adsorb/degrade a substantial amount of RhB within short durations under ambient conditions, where WO<sub>3</sub> nanowires are mostly inactive. The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> enhances the photocatalytic performance of WO<sub>3</sub> nanowires over 30 minutes, with even better results under low pH conditions with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This study also explores the phase-dependent electrochemical properties of WO<sub>3</sub> and WO<sub>3-<i>x</i></sub> nanowires, providing insights into their potential for improved supercapacitor performance by leveraging their complementary properties in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. WO<sub>3-<i>x</i></sub>, with a higher density of oxygen vacancies and thinner structure, offers enhanced conductivity and increased active sites for charge storage, resulting in superior specific capacitance and charge retention.
40226999	After 75 Years, an Alternative to Edman Degradation: A Mechanistic and Efficiency Study of a Base-Induced Method for N-Terminal Peptide Sequencing.	The sequencing of peptides via N-terminal amino acid removal is a classic reaction termed Edman degradation. This method involves repeated treatment of the N-terminal amino group of a peptide with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), followed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. Spurred by the need for an alternative non-acid-based chemistry for next-generation protein sequencing technologies, we developed a base-induced N-terminal degradation method. Several N-terminal derivatization reagents carrying supernucleophiles were tested. After rounds of iterative designs, compound <b>DR3</b>, with a <i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimide as a leaving group and hydrazinecarboxamide as the supernucleophile, demonstrated the highest yield for the peptide derivatization step and the most efficient elimination of the N-terminal amino acid in just 1% of a hydroxide salt. The method successfully removed all 20 amino acids at the N-terminus in high yield. The technique demonstrates compatibility with oligonucleic acids, which differs from Edman degradation due to their inherent sensitivity to acidic environments. To demonstrate the practical application of our approach, we sequenced amino acids sequentially from a peptide, effectively determining the sequence of an unknown peptide. Notably, our methodology was successfully applied to mixtures of peptides derived from protein samples, where a significant fraction of the peptides derivatized with <b>DR3</b> underwent elimination of their N-terminal amino acid upon addition of base. Overall, although our method does not outperform Edman degradation in efficiency, it serves as a valuable alternative in cases where base-induced cleavage is advantageous, particularly for preserving acid-sensitive functionalities.

40226990	Identification of Rapaglutin E as an Isoform-Specific Inhibitor of Glucose Transporter 1.	Natural products rapamycin and FK506 are macrocyclic compounds with therapeutic benefits whose unique scaffold inspired the generation and exploration of hybrid macrocycle rapafucins. From this library, a potent inhibitor of the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT), rapaglutin A (RgA), was previously identified. RgA is a pan-GLUT inhibitor of Class I isoforms GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4. Herein, we report the discovery of rapaglutin E (RgE). Unlike RgA, RgE is highly specific for GLUT1. Further characterization revealed that RgE and RgA likely bound to distinct sites on GLUT1 despite their shared FKBP-binding domain, suggesting that the distinct effector domains of RgE and RgA play key roles in the recognition of GLUTs.
40226989	Interface morphodynamics in living tissues.	Interfaces between distinct tissues or between tissues and environments are common in multicellular organisms. The evolution and stability of these interfaces are essential for tissue development, and their dysfunction can lead to diseases such as cancer. Mounting efforts, either theoretical or experimental, have been devoted to uncovering the morphodynamics of tissue interfaces. Here, we review the recent progress of studies on interface morphodynamics. The regulatory mechanisms governing interface evolution are dissected, with a focus on adhesion, cortical tension, cell activity, extracellular matrix, and microenvironment. We examine the methodologies used to study morphodynamics, emphasizing the characteristics of experimental techniques and theoretical models. Finally, we explore the broader implications of interface morphodynamics in tissue morphogenesis and diseases, offering a comprehensive perspective on this rapidly developing field.
40226988	Far from home: Morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular characterization of <i>Thometrema patagonicum</i> (Szidat, 1956) (Hemiuroidea: Derogenidae) from an unexpected host and locality, with taxonomic implications.	While most higher taxa in the Hemiuroidea exhibit remarkable diversity and thrive worldwide in marine ecosystems, a few groups have successfully radiated into freshwater environments. Among them, species of <i>Thometrema</i> are well known from freshwater and brackish fishes in the New World. In this study, specimens of <i>Thometrema</i> from a single specimen of the endangered pimelodid catfish <i>Steindachneridion scriptum</i> in the Upper Paraná River basin, State of São Paulo, Brazil, were subjected to morphological, ultrastructural (first scanning electron microscopy data for the genus) and molecular analyses. Newly obtained sequences of the partial large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA (28S rDNA) and partial mitochondrial cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase subunit I (COI mtDNA) provided strong evidence supporting the identification of the specimens as <i>T. patagonicum</i>, a trematode previously known only from endemic percichthyid fishes (Percichthyidae) in the Argentinian Patagonia. This unexpected finding, along with critical morphological evaluation of new and deposited material, led us to propose <i>T. overstreeti</i> and <i>T. bonariense</i> as junior synonyms of <i>T. patagonicum.</i> Moreover, we reassessed certain morphological features, revealed new potential distinguishing characters (papillae) and raised doubts about the taxonomic value of commonly used features for species differentiation (e.g., vitellarium masses). To overcome taxonomic problems in <i>Thometrema</i> due to the paucity of morphological features to clearly set species boundaries, new descriptions could leverage integrative approaches, as employed here, to establish robust species hypotheses and ultimately unravel the actual species composition in the Americas.
40226987	Simulation of head-tail biofilm streamer growth based on immersed boundary method.	Biofilms are subjected to various forces in the fluid field, as a result, the biofilm forms a head-tail structure known as a streamer to reduce pressure differential resistance. To characterize biofilm growth in fluid, we establish a head-tail biofilm streamer growth model based on the immersed boundary method using MATLAB software, and simulate streamer growth in various environmental conditions to explore the factors affecting its growth. Firstly, we found that a higher flow velocity makes the streamer grow faster and thereby produce more biomass. Secondly, we explored the effect of the position of nutrient source on the streamer growth, found that when the nutrient source overlaps with the streamer, its length is longer than when the nutrient source and the streamer are mismatched. Further we found that the Young's modulus of the streamer also influences its growth length. Streamers with small Young's modulus were more likely to deform, making them grow longer than the streamers with large Young's modulus. Finally, we determined the relationship between the tail length and the head diameter of the streamer through mechanical analysis, and found that there is an optimal ratio of the tail length to the head diameter which exposes the streamer to the minimum drag in the fluid field.
40226985	Tetrahymena predation drives adaptive evolution of Salmonella by disrupting O-antigen biosynthesis and upregulating transcriptional regulator csgD.	Protozoan predation is increasingly understood to be one of the main environmental factors driving bacterial virulence evolution and adaptation strategies. In this study, we reveal the adaptive evolution of Salmonella Enteritidis in phenotypic and genomic traits after passage through Tetrahymena thermophila. We identified a beneficial and fixed mutation that occurs at the coding region of rfbP, encoding the undecaprenyl-phosphate galactosephosphotransferase, and demonstrated that almost all observed phenotypic changes caused by selection pressure, including enhanced biofilm formation and reduced bacterial motility, are related to the early termination of RfbP protein translation. This mutation blocks the lipopolysaccharide O antigen synthesis, and leads to upregulation of the transcriptional factor csgD, which plays a central role in regulating Salmonella adaptation to the adverse environment. Our findings underscore the selective pressure from Tetrahymena as a pivotal driver of adaptive evolution in Salmonella, elucidating the nexus between adaptation to protozoan predation and augmented environmental persistence. This investigation advances our understanding of the ecological role of protozoan predation in the natural selection of bacterial communities.
40226984	Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling: Defect Driven High-Performance Regeneration.	The continuous accumulation of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has brought about critical economic and environmental issues. This paper discusses the direct recycling of spent LIBs through defect engineering, emerging as a sustainable strategy for upcycling. Degraded materials, including cathodes and anodes, exhibit structural defects that can be repurposed for modifying, enhancing the performance of regenerated batteries. Studies show that utilizing lithium vacancies (LVs) and oxygen vacancies (OVs) allows the efficient diffusion of dopants like Mg/Al and F, improving electrochemical stability and high-voltage capabilities. Additionally, this approach significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional methods, offering significant insights for large-scale LIBs upcycling and closed-loop energy storage systems.
40226983	Autophagic Cell Survival-to-Death Switch Induced by Cisplatin and Zn(II) Dual-Loaded Dispersity-Tunable Zwitterionic Hybrid Polyion Nanocomplex.	Engineered nanomaterials, with their tunable size and surface characteristics, have played a pivotal role in biomedical delivery systems by modulating specific cellular processes such as autophagy and apoptosis, thereby influencing cellular homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Recently, zwitterionic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) has gained attention for its enhanced biocompatibility and antifouling properties, presenting potential as a promising alternative to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in various biomedical applications. This study investigates the relationship between metal-chelated nanomaterial structures and their biochemical activity using core-corona nanoparticles (NPs) composed of a metallic pharmacophore core and a zwitterionic PMPC polymer shell. Two NP systems were designed, both containing aquated cisplatin (<i>cis</i>-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>) and a Zn(II) adjuvant, with identical surface structures but contrasting core stabilities, leading to distinct drug release profiles: (1) labile NPs with pH-responsive drug release and variable size dispersity under endosomal conditions and (2) inert NPs characterized by slow drug release and low dispersity due to stable heterometallic Lewis complex formation at the core. The labile NP combinations exhibited strong drug synergism in cytotoxicity through apoptosis and ferroptosis, with cisplatin driving the primary pharmacological effects, while Zn-NPs modulated prosurvival autophagy toward autophagic cell death, which demonstrated the potential of Zn-NPs as a synergistic adjuvant in cisplatin delivery. In contrast, Pt/Zn-coloaded inert NPs exhibited controlled drug release and cytotoxicity, showing approximately 8-11 times higher IC<sub>50</sub> values than those of labile NP combinations, depending on the combination ratio. These results demonstrate the critical role of the NP structure in modulating cytotoxicity and autophagy, providing insights for the rational design of effective drug delivery systems.

40226980	4-Amino-3',4'-dihydroxychalcone Increases Tau Dynamics in Phase-Separated Droplets and Inhibits Tau Aggregation.	The aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is a distinctive characteristic of several neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Small-molecule inhibitors have been investigated as a potential therapy for tau aggregation-related diseases. Here, we identified 4-Amino-3',4'-dihydroxychalcone (4-ADHC), a substituted aminochalcone, as an inhibitor of different stages of tau aggregation, namely, liquid-liquid phase separation, oligomerization, and filamentation. Size exclusion chromatography, absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopic experiments suggested that 4-ADHC bound to purified tau. The dissociation constant for the binding of 4-ADHC to tau was determined to be 5.1 ± 0.8 μM using surface plasmon resonance. The compound potently inhibited heparin and arachidonic acid-induced tau aggregation in vitro. However, 4-ADHC neither inhibited tubulin polymerization nor the enzymatic activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments showed that 4-ADHC increased tau dynamics in phase-separated droplets, suggesting that the compound impeded the maturation of the droplets by increasing their liquid-like behavior. Further, atomic force microscopy, dot blot assay, and dynamic light scattering experiments demonstrated that the compound suppressed tau oligomerization. In addition, 4-ADHC inhibited tau filamentation and disaggregated preformed filaments. Thus, 4-ADHC is a candidate for developing potent tau aggregation inhibitors.
40226979	Effect of processing conditions on the physical-chemical and mechanical properties of chitosan-alginate polyelectrolyte complex films for potential wound dressing application.	The combination of chitosan and alginate leads to the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) that have been mainly used for applications such as wound dressings in biomedical areas. However, processing conditions can affect the resulting complex structure, influencing the final material properties. This work aims to evaluate the influence of processing conditions on the physical-chemical and mechanical properties of chitosan-alginate PEC films for wound dressing applications. The study was carried out using a Box-Behnken design, with controlled variables including pH, agitation speed, amounts of crosslinker and plasticizer, and the type of acid used in chitosan solubilization. Response variables were thickness, liquid absorption capacity, water vapor barrier, and mechanical properties, which are important characteristics in defining the applicability of dressings. All studied factors, as well as their interactions, showed significant effects on the properties of interest. The mathematical models obtained for the studied properties did not have a predictive character but rather a qualitative one, providing a good insight into the behavior of these materials regarding the modification of the evaluated experimental conditions, which strongly influence the characteristics of chitosan-alginate PEC films. Additional swelling and FTIR analyses performed for a selected sub-set of samples confirmed, respectively: (i) the high equilibrium values and stability at the equilibrium of the films regarding liquid absorption for both water and PBS; (ii) no degradation of the chitosan and alginate functional groups or loss of interaction between them under the considered processing conditions.
40226976	Construction of metal-organic nanostructures and their structural transformations on metal surfaces.	Metal-organic nanostructures, composed of organic molecules as building blocks and metal atoms as linkers, exhibit high reversibility and flexibility and open up new vistas for the creation of novel metal-organic nanomaterials and the fabrication of functional molecule-based nanodevices. With the rapid development of emerging surface science and scanning probe microscopy, various metal-organic nanostructures, ranging from zero to two dimensions, have been prepared with atomic precision on well-defined metal surfaces in a bottom-up manner and further visualized at the submolecular (or even atomic) level. In such processes, the metal-organic interactions involved and the synergy and competition of multiple intermolecular interactions have been clearly discriminated as the cause of the diversity and preference of metal-organic nanostructures. Moreover, structural transformations can be controllably directed by subtly tuning such intermolecular interactions. In this perspective, we review recent exciting progress in the construction of metal-organic nanostructures on metal surfaces ranging from zero to two dimensions, which is mainly in terms of the selection of metal types (including sources), in other words, different metal-organic interactions formed. Subsequently, the corresponding structural transformations in response to internal or external conditions are discussed, providing mechanistic insights into precise structural control, <i>e.g.</i>, by means of metal/molecule stoichiometric ratios (including through scanning probe microscopy (SPM) manipulations), thermodynamic control, introduction of extrinsic competing counterparts, <i>etc.</i> In addition, some other regulatory factors, such as the functionalization of organic molecules and the choice of substrates and lattices, which also crucially govern the structural transformations, are briefly mentioned in each part. Finally, some potential perspectives for metal-organic nanostructures are evoked.

40226972	Nondegradative Synthetic Molecular Glues Enter the Clinic.	Molecular glues are small molecules that can induce or stabilize protein-protein interactions between proteins inside cells. Unlike classical small molecule drugs, molecular glues can target challenging disease-causing proteins lacking well-defined binding pockets. Nature has repeatedly used this mode of action, but identifying molecular glues for new target proteins has been a major challenge. Recently, manmade molecular glues, inspired by natural products, for KRas, entered clinical trials although KRas is a major cancer target long thought to be undruggable. Here, how these molecules are initially discovered and optimized to provide several advanced drug candidates for various KRas-dependent cancer types are outlined. The major insights obtained for this new class of drug modalities are further summarized. These results showcase how molecular glues that do not rely on protein degradation can provide clinical benefits for challenging drug targets.
40226971	Chiral organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites synthesized using an acoustofluidic closed system.	Chiral organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite films hold significant promise for optoelectronic applications due to their unique optical activity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, their air and moisture sensitivity necessitate inert atmosphere processing, hindering practical application. In this work, we present a closed acoustofluidic system utilizing surface acoustic wave-based microcentrifugation for the synthesis of high-quality (<i>S</i>-MBA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> films. By confining both synthesis and film deposition within a sealed chamber, this approach eliminates air exposure, enabling the fabrication of films with enhanced crystallinity and a reduced band gap of 2.37 eV. The resulting chiral perovskite films exhibit significant circular dichroism, with an asymmetry factor of 9.3 × 10<sup>-4</sup>. Furthermore, control over film surface roughness (achieving <0.6 μm) is demonstrated through modulation of acoustic operation parameters. The cost-effectiveness and versatility of this acoustic microcentrifugation system highlight its potential for advanced film material fabrication.

40226966	Rural and urban differences in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness and acceptability among Black cisgender women living in the U.S. South.	Black cisgender women in the U.S. South experience a significant disparity in HIV infection rates. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective medication that can reduce HIV risk but is underutilized among Black women. We assessed the association between setting and PrEP awareness and acceptability in Black cisgender women in the U.S. South. A cross-sectional online survey was administered from March to June 2022 to HIV-negative Black cisgender women living in the Southern United States. Participants reported demographic information, PrEP awareness, likelihood of PrEP use, HIV knowledge, risk perception, and healthcare access. Logistic regression models assessed correlates of PrEP awareness and acceptability. Of 491 participants (Mean age = 40.42 [SD = 17.5], 20.0% rural, 80.0% urban/suburban), 44.9% of rural and 38.2% of urban/suburban participants were PrEP aware. 44.9% of rural versus 36.1% of urban/suburban participants were likely to use PrEP. Rural Black women reported higher PrEP acceptability (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.96, 95% CI 1.20, 3.18, <i>p</i> = 0.01). Having health insurance (aOR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.28, 4.65, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and younger age (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.96, 0.99, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were associated with PrEP acceptability. To improve PrEP awareness, acceptability, and uptake, intervention programs should be tailored to individuals' geographical circumstances and needs.
40226965	Relationship between parental reflective functioning and children's multiple theory of mind in 4- to 7-year-old children with and without developmental language disorder: Parental stress as a mediator.	Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) often struggle with theory of mind (ToM). This study explored the link between parental reflective functioning (PRF) and children's ToM, focusing on the mediating role of parental stress (PS). A total of 80 children aged 4-7 years (40 with DLD and 40 with typical language development, TLD) and their parents were included for analysis. Assessments included the WPPSI-IV, NEPSY-II, TEC, and ELT for children and the PRFQ and PSI-SF4 for parents. Results showed that children with DLD performed similarly to their TLD peers in terms of nonverbal intelligence but faced difficulties with cognitive and affective ToM and understanding of emotional terms (UET). Parents of DLD children exhibited low interest and curiosity (PRF components) and high PS, particularly due to dysfunctional interactions and challenging behaviors. Mediation analysis revealed that low parental interest and curiosity negatively affected children's cognitive ToM and UET through increased PS from dysfunctional interactions. These findings highlight the need for early interventions to enhance ToM in children with DLD and support parents in better understanding and interacting with their child. Such interventions can reduce parent-child stress and promote ToM development of children with DLD, aligning with bioecological models of development.
40226964	ZmCIPK33 and ZmSnRK2.10 mutually reinforce the abscisic acid signaling pathway for combating drought stress in maize.	The calcineurin B-like protein (CBL)-CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) Ca²⁺ sensors play crucial roles in the plant's response to drought stress. However, there have been few reports on the synergistic regulation of drought stress by CBL-CIPK and abscisic acid (ABA) core signaling components. In this study, we discovered that ZmCIPK33 positively regulates drought resistance in maize. ZmCIPK33 physically interacts with and is enhanced by phosphorylation from ZmSnRK2.10. Drought stress can activate ZmCIPK33, which is partially dependent on ZmSnRK2.10. ZmCIPK33 in combination with ZmSnRK2.10 can activate the slow anion channel ZmSLAC1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes independently of CBLs, whereas ZmCIPK33 or ZmSnRK2.10 alone is unable to do so. Furthermore, ZmCIPK33 phosphorylates ZmPP2C11 at Ser60, which leads to a reduction in the interaction between ZmPP2C11 and ZmEAR1 (the ortholog of Arabidopsis Enhancer of ABA co-Receptor 1) and weakens the phosphatase activity of ZmPP2C11, consequently, enhancing the activity of ZmSnRK2.10 in an in vitro assay and in the in-gel assay of the zmcipk33 mutant. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the reciprocal enhancement of Ca²⁺ and ABA signaling under drought stress in maize.

40226962	RNA interference-based dsRNA application confers prolonged protection against rice blast and viral diseases, offering a scalable solution for enhanced crop disease management.	Rice production is severely impacted by pathogens such as Magnaporthe oryzae and the rice stripe virus (RSV). Ineffectiveness in controlling viruses and the excessive use of fungicides have proven traditional chemical pesticides increasingly inadequate. RNA interference (RNAi) represents a cutting-edge approach for combating crop diseases, especially in rice. This study addresses the critical gap in scalable, effective RNAi-based rice disease management by exploring the potential of spray-applied small RNA (sRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules. We utilized dsRNAs produced by in vitro transcription and bacterial expression systems and employed layered double hydroxides (LDH) to enhance RNA stability, absorption, and efficacy. Our research demonstrated that modified sRNAs could effectively penetrate M. oryzae cell membranes and inhibit conidial germination and appressorium formation, while LDH-conjugated dsRNAs provided prolonged and enhanced protection against both rice blast and rice stripe diseases. Most importantly, dsRNA treatments resulted in improved agronomic traits or increased crop yields by protecting against blast and stripe diseases. This study also validated the compatibility of these RNA molecules with industrial production methods, highlighting their potential as a scalable and eco-friendly option for managing crop diseases at the gene level. This work not only offers a new direction for rice disease control but also provides a foundation for the broader application of RNAi technology in agricultural pest management.
40226961	Methadone Analgesia During Awake Craniotomy for a Patient With Chronic Pain on Buprenorphine: A Case Report.	The resection of brain tumors requires careful surgical and anesthetic planning to preserve essential motor, cognitive, and sensory cortical regions. An awake craniotomy with stereotactic brain mapping is frequently performed to protect these areas, requiring patients to be conscious enough for functional and neurocognitive testing. Patients on long-term opioids for chronic pain present unique anesthetic challenges, requiring anesthesiologists to balance providing adequate analgesia with maintaining adequate responsiveness. This case report illustrates the successful use of methadone in the anesthetic management of a patient with chronic pain on transdermal buprenorphine who underwent an awake craniotomy with an asleep-awake technique.
40226960	Optimization of nanobody caplacizumab <i>via</i> computational design.	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by the formation of microvascular thrombosis caused by ultra-large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers. Caplacizumab, the first FDA-approved nanobody for TTP treatment, binds to the A1 domain of VWF, thereby inhibiting its interaction with platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to dynamically analyze the regulatory mechanism of caplacizumab on the interaction between VWF A1 and GPIb. Subsequently, alanine scanning was conducted to identify critical hotspot residues at the caplacizumab-VWF A1 binding interface and evaluate their contributions to binding free energy. Single-point saturation mutagenesis was performed on coldspot and warmspot residues of caplacizumab, and the binding free energy changes of the resulting mutants with VWF A1 were calculated. Following the identification of mutants with significantly enhanced binding affinity, combinatorial mutations were designed, resulting in an optimized caplacizumab variant with four mutations. Computational results demonstrated that this four-point mutant substantially improved the binding free energy with VWF A1. This study provides valuable theoretical insights into the allosteric regulation mechanisms of nanobody therapeutics and establishes a foundation for designing next-generation caplacizumab variants. The findings open new avenues for the development of more effective and precise antithrombotic therapies.
40226959	High-quality genome of allotetraploid Avena barbata provides insights into the origin and evolution of B subgenome in Avena.	Avena barbata, a wild oat species within the genus Avena, is a widely used model for studying plant ecological adaptation due to its strong environmental adaptability and disease resistance, serving as a valuable genetic resource for oat improvement. Here, we phased the high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of A. barbata (6.88 Gb, contig N50 = 53.74 Mb) into A (3.57 Gb with 47,687 genes) and B (3.31 Gb with 46,029 genes) subgenomes. Comparative genomics and phylogenomic analyses clarified the evolutionary relationships and trajectories of A, B, C and D subgenomes in Avena. We inferred that the A subgenome donor of A. barbata was Avena hirtula, while the B subgenome donor was probably an extinct diploid species closely related to Avena wiestii. Genome evolution analysis revealed the dynamic transposable element (TE) content and subgenome divergence, as well as extensive structure variations across A, B, C, and D subgenomes in Avena. Population genetic analysis of 211 A. barbata accessions from distinct ecotypes identified several candidate genes related to environmental adaptability and drought resistance. Our study provides a comprehensive genetic resource for exploring the genetic basis underlying the strong environmental adaptability of A. barbata and the molecular identification of important agronomic traits for oat breeding.

40226957	The Impact Of Climate Change-Induced Abiotic Stresses on the Nutritional Quality of Legume Seeds.	Legumes are integral to agricultural sustainability, offering multifaceted benefits ranging from enhanced yields to companion crops to improved soil health. Despite their recognized advantages, challenges such as technological lock-ins, limited breeding resources, and adverse environmental conditions pose threats to their cultivation. Herein, the complex interaction between climate change stressors - specifically drought, high temperatures, and elevated CO2 levels - and their individual and combined impacts on the nutritional quality of legumes will be discussed. This topic has not been reviewed very often for multiple legume crops, despite its importance under climate change. This review critically examines the impact of environmental stresses on the nutritional quality of legume seeds and explores the underlying regulatory mechanisms, encompassing protein, amino acids, minerals, carbohydrates, lipids, and bioactive compounds. Key insights indicate a general need to shift legume cultivation practices, and the necessity of field studies beyond controlled environments for results that are more readily translated to the target population of environments for legume cultivation.

40226955	Fast-forwarding plant breeding with deep learning-based genomic prediction.	Deep learning-based genomic prediction (DL-based GP) has shown promising performance compared to traditional GP methods in plant breeding, particularly in handling large, complex multi-omics data sets. However, the effective development and widespread adoption of DL-based GP still face substantial challenges, including the need for large, high-quality data sets, inconsistencies in performance benchmarking, and the integration of environmental factors. Here, we summarize the key obstacles impeding the development of DL-based GP models and propose future developing directions, such as modular approaches, data augmentation, and advanced attention mechanisms.

40226946	Exploring the effect of Ru(II) arene complexes on cytotoxicity upon co-ligand variation and loading on amine-functionalized silica nanoparticles.	To overcome the undesirable side effects and acquired resistance associated with platinum-based chemotherapeutics, scientists are searching for alternative strategies involving novel metal-based compounds with improved pharmacological properties. Ruthenium complexes have emerged as prospective candidates to combat side effects and improve the selectivity of anticancer agents. In this work, a benzimidazole-based chelating ligand, <b>HL</b> (4-(1<i>H</i>-naphth[2,3-<i>d</i>]imidazol-2-yl)-1,3-benzenediol) with O and N donor atoms, was synthesized and used for complexation with ruthenium to obtain three Ru(II) arene complexes represented by [Ru(η<sup>6</sup>-<i>p</i>-cym)(L)Cl], [Ru(η<sup>6</sup>-<i>p</i>-cym)(L)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)]<sup>+</sup> and [Ru(η<sup>6</sup>-<i>p</i>-cym)(L)(PTA)]<sup>+</sup> (where <i>p</i>-cym = <i>p</i>-cymene, PPh<sub>3</sub> = triphenylphosphine and PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane). The synthesized complexes were characterized using spectroscopic techniques. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and LC-MS were used to study the stability of the complexes in biological medium. Their lipophilicity was studied by calculating the partition coefficient in <i>n</i>-octanol and water. The complexes showed significant binding with biomolecules like albumin proteins and nucleic acids. All the complexes were found to be cytotoxic, with complex [Ru(η<sup>6</sup>-<i>p</i>-cym)(L)PPh<sub>3</sub>]PF<sub>6</sub> exhibiting the highest anticancer activity. The mechanism of anticancer activity was attributed to the ability of the complexes to induce apoptosis and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The complexes also exhibited antimetastatic properties. Furthermore, complex [Ru(η<sup>6</sup>-<i>p</i>-cym)(L)PPh<sub>3</sub>]PF<sub>6</sub> was loaded onto amine-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles which led to an increase in its cytotoxic activity.
40226945	Ultrastructural and Immunohistochemical Study of a Gastric Bizarre Leiomyoma: Bizarre Nuclei and Prominent Cytoplasmic Processes Extending Into and Displacing the Stroma.	This study presents the ultrastructural and immunohistochemical findings of a gastric bizarre leiomyoma arising in the vestibule of a 79-year-old male. Histologically, loosely proliferating tumor cells consist of large, multinucleated, bizarre nuclei with intranuclear inclusions and abundant cytoplasm-containing vacuoles. A murky line was apparent between the tumor cells and eosinophilic and heterogenous stroma-like areas. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells exhibited positively stained dot patterns of α-smooth muscle actin and caldesmon, which were distributed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells and stroma-like regions. Ultrastructurally, tumor cells exhibited extended and complex cytoplasmic processes comprising the fascicles of filamentous fibers. These structures were also detected in the apparent stroma-like regions observed histologically and were consistent with the α-smooth muscle actin- and caldesmon-immunopositive dot structures. The original stromal areas remained as considerably narrow gaps between tumor cells with extended cytoplasmic processes.

Herein we report a diastereoselective synthesis of boryl-substituted vinylcyclopropanes, a class of highly valuable synthetic building blocks, via deborylative cyclization of geminal diboron compounds. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance and accommodates diverse alkyl and aryl α-substituents. The diastereoselectivity is primarily governed by the α-substituent (alkyl vs aryl), while olefin geometry in the side chain has a secondary influence. Mechanistic studies indicated distinct pathways: a concerted process for alkyl substrates and a carbanion intermediate for aryl derivatives. Synthetic utility of the products was also demonstrated.

40226941	Binuclear lanthanide complexes as magnetic resonance and optical imaging probes for redox sensing.	We report a family of lanthanide(III) complexes that act as redox probes via both magnetic resonance and luminescence outputs. The ligands are functionalized with nitro, azobenzene and azide groups which are reduced to a common aniline product, and each responds to both chemical and biocatalytic reductive conditions at different cathodic onset potentials. By judicious choice of complexed Ln(III), the probes can be optimized either for use in magnetic resonance imaging (Ln = Gd), or as highly efficient turn-on luminescence probes (Ln = Tb). The Tb(III) analogues are essentially non-emissive, until reductive generation of the aniline affords a complex which when excited by visible light (488 nm) emits green light with a quantum yield of 45% and millisecond long luminescent lifetimes (ms). The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to imaging hypoxia.

A synthesis of (-)-viriditin A and (-)-viriditin B has been completed sequentially using a Suzuki coupling and a Heck reaction of <i>trans</i>-1,2-dichloroethylene. The selectivity for monocoupling of <i>trans</i>-1,2-dichloroethylene is attributed to a lower-energy transition state for the oxidative addition step.
40226939	Pilot Study of Intratumoral Immunotherapy with Cowpea Mosaic Virus Nanoparticles: Safety in Refractory Canine Oral Tumors.	Oral tumors (squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and fibrosarcoma) represent 6-7% of all canine cancers. Given that these tumors have a high local recurrence rate and metastatic potential, conventional therapies have suboptimal response rates, leading to poor patient outcomes. Here, we report the use of intratumoral virus-like particles from cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) in four canine patients with recurrent oral malignant tumors and lymph node metastasis. All tumors were nonresponders to chemotherapy and had a mild initial response to CPMV intratumoral immunotherapy without any serious immune-related adverse effects. None of the patients developed pulmonary metastasis during follow-up, although local progression was seen in all the patients. Furthermore, tumor-infiltrated immune T cells increased in number after the intratumoral immunotherapy with CPMV, suggesting activation of the tumor microenvironment. All the patients had a rapid decrease in the tumor-promoting chemokines IL-8 and CXCL1, which could indicate that a decrease in metastatic potential could have been generated by the CPMV immunotherapy. The increased number of infiltrated immune cells, the decrease in some pro-tumoral chemokines, and the absence of adverse effects suggest that CPMV could be a safe treatment and should be further explored as a novel therapy for canine oral tumors.

40226937	The Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Evaluation of Prostate Pathology.	Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging tool in diagnostic pathology, including prostate pathology. This review summarizes the possibilities offered by AI and also discusses the challenges and risks. AI has the potential to assist in the diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer. Diagnostic safety can be enhanced by avoiding the accidental underdiagnosis of small lesions. Another possible benefit is a greater degree of standardization of grading. AI for clinical use needs to be trained on large, high-quality data sets that have been assessed by experienced pathologists. A problem with the use of AI in prostate pathology is the plethora of benign mimics of prostate cancer and morphological variants of cancer that are too unusual to allow sufficient training of AI. AI systems need to be able to account for variations in local routines for cutting, staining, and scanning of slides. We also need to be aware of the risk that users will rely too much on the output of an AI system, leading to diagnostic errors and loss of clinical competence. The reporting pathologist must ultimately be responsible for accepting or rejecting the diagnosis proposed by AI.

Despite increasing interest in Turnbull-Cutait pull-through delayed coloanal anastomosis (DCAA) for low rectal cancer, its advantages over conventional immediate coloanal anastomosis (ICAA) with a diverting stoma remain unclear. This study aimed to compare postoperative outcomes between DCAA and ICAA following elective total mesorectal excision (TME) for low rectal cancer.
40226930	Revealing the Therapeutic Potential of Pituranthos scoparius: Phytochemical Composition, Biological Activities, and Abiotic Stress Resilience Through In Vitro and In Silico Analyses from the Algerian Sahara.	This study investigates the medicinal potential of Pituranthos scoparius, a plant native to the Algerian Sahara, by evaluating its biological activity, phytochemical composition, and environmental stress responses. In silico molecular docking simulations were conducted to assess the plant's phytochemicals in inhibiting Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR. Soil samples from Adrar, characterized by moderate limestone, low salinity, high potassium, and low phosphorus, revealed osmolytes such as glycine betaine, proline, soluble carbohydrates, chlorophyll, and carotenoids in stressed plants. The plant's essential oil, analyzed by GC-MS, identified 40 major components, including β-phellandrene and exo-2-hydroxyanisole, while LC-MS detected bioactive compounds like β-carotene, riboflavin, and ascorbic acid. The ethanolic extract (IC50 = 164.86 ± 29.92 µg/mL) and essential oil (IC50 = 188.46 ± 5.49 µg/mL) exhibited DPPH radical scavenging activity. Anti-inflammatory tests showed inhibition of albumin denaturation (84.46 ± 0.008% for ethanolic extract, 62.25 ± 0.015% for essential oil). The ethanolic extract (100 mg/mL) demonstrated antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. faecalis with inhibition zones of 34 mm. In silico analysis revealed effective binding of quercetin, methylbicyclo(4.4.0)decane (cis), and cianidanol to LasR, offering insights into potential drug development. This study highlights the bioactive compounds and therapeutic potential of P. scoparius.

40226927	Comparing Hospital-Free Days by Frailty Status Among Those Undergoing Surgical Intervention for Cardiovascular Disease.	Aging patients face increasing comorbid conditions, most commonly atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD), often treated surgically; however, with aging also comes frailty portending adverse postoperative outcomes. Assessing outcomes in a frail surgical cohort necessitates the use of valid patient-centered metrics like hospital free days (HFD) quantifying patient time home and out of the hospital.
40226926	Antimicrobial protection of fabrics with poly(allylamine hydrochloride)-ZnO coating.	Microbial infections are causing numerous deaths and can be found on various surfaces such as fabrics used in healthcare facilities as wound dressings or protective clothing in operating or sterile rooms. The study aimed to determine the difference in antibacterial activity of sheet, sphere, and rod-like ZnO NPs embedded in poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) multilayers on cotton, nylon, and polyester with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Additionally, the adhesion of recombinant human SARS-CoV-2 RBD S-protein on the coated materials and the water droplet absorption after placement on the fabric surface were tested. Results demonstrated that PAH/ZnO coating with rod-like NPs achieved the highest antibacterial activity on the cotton fabric, with the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> cell viability reduced by more than 99%. ZnO NPs significantly reduced bacterial surface coverage on textiles, particularly on cotton and polyester. The adhesion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was reduced considerably on the coated nylon fabrics due to the change in the material's hydrophobicity and wettability. Due to its better ZnO NP adherence, cotton demonstrated slightly higher antibacterial performance than polyester and nylon, showing potential for wound dressings, especially with the addition of rod-like ZnO NPs. PAH/ZnO coated nylon showed potential for usage in protective clothing in operating and sterile rooms against bacteria, viral adhesion, and aerosol absorption through the fabrics to the skin.

40226924	Cell cycle and age-related modulations of mouse chromosome stiffness.	Chromosome structure is complex, and many aspects of chromosome organization are still not understood. Measuring the stiffness of chromosomes offers valuable insight into their structural properties. In this study, we analyzed the stiffness of chromosomes from metaphase I (MI) and metaphase II (MII) oocytes. Our results revealed a tenfold increase in stiffness (Young's modulus) of MI chromosomes compared to somatic chromosomes. Furthermore, the stiffness of MII chromosomes was found to be lower than that of MI chromosomes. We examined the role of meiosis-specific cohesin complexes in regulating chromosome stiffness. Surprisingly, the stiffness of chromosomes from three meiosis-specific cohesin mutants did not significantly differ from that of wild-type chromosomes, indicating that these cohesins may not be primary determinants of chromosome stiffness. Additionally, our findings revealed an age-related increase of chromosome stiffness for MI oocytes. Since aging is associated with elevated levels of DNA damage, we investigated the impact of etoposide-induced DNA damage on chromosome stiffness and found that it led to a reduction in stiffness in MI oocytes. Overall, our study underscores the dynamic and cyclical nature of chromosome stiffness, modulated by both the cell cycle and age-related factors.
40226922	Memento Mortuorum: The Necrosociality of Whole-Body Donor Remembrance Ceremonies.	This study explores whole-body donor remembrance ceremonies as secondary mortuary rituals within medical education, analyzing their role in transitioning donors from educational tools to persons reintegrated into a framework of respect and reverence. Through participant observation, textual analysis, and symbolic interpretation, the research investigates themes of gratitude, personhood, and symbolic exchange. The ceremonies are contextualized within anthropological frameworks of liminality and necrosociality, highlighting parallels with global mortuary practices. We observe that these rituals serve not only as acts of commemoration but also as pedagogical tools, fostering professional empathy and reinforcing societal trust in anatomical donation programs. By addressing the social and ethical dimensions of body donation, the study emphasizes the ceremonies' role in humanizing medical education while affirming the cultural significance of death and remembrance. This work contributes to a broader understanding of the intersection between ritual, education, and the social construction of personhood.
40226921	Bioconversion of Mushroom Chitin-Rich Waste into Valuable Chitin Oligosaccharides Using a Combined Approach of Biocatalysis and Precision Fermentation.	The shift toward a circular economy has increased efforts to derive valuable chemicals from renewable resources, including chitin-rich waste. Mushroom cultivation generates significant waste, particularly the stalks left behind on breeding beds, which contain a substantial amount of chitin with untapped potential. This research establishes a proof of concept for valorizing this waste stream by converting it into valuable chitin oligosaccharides, which have applications across food, feed, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals. Using a combined approach of enzymatic saccharification with five chitinolytic enzymes, followed by precision fermentation of the resulting <i>N-</i>acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc), we successfully produced defined chitinpentaose. Chitin extracted from <i>Agaricus bisporus</i> brown demonstrated the highest saccharification efficiency, achieving a GlcNAc conversion of 31 ± 1% (w/w). Our findings highlight the necessity of purifying the saccharification product to ensure product specificity during fermentation, although the production strain's growth remained suboptimal compared to commercially available GlcNAc. Using an engineered <i>E. coli</i> strain, we achieved pure chitinpentaose, with a yield of 0.0327 g/L at a 10 mL scale and production levels (g/OD<sub>600</sub>) comparable to those obtained with HPLC-grade commercial GlcNAc. This study provides a foundation for further research aimed at improving biocatalyst recycling and optimizing the growth phase, thereby enhancing the cost-efficiency and scalability of this sustainable bioconversion process.
40226911	Metal-Free Visible-Light Excitation of TMSN<sub>3</sub> Enables [3 + 2] Cycloaddition of Arylidenecyclopropanes with Olefins.	A visible-light photoredox [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of arylidenecyclopropanes with olefins was developed, employing the readily available and commercially accessible TMSN<sub>3</sub> as an efficient radical mediator. This method provides a convenient and efficient route to arylidenecyclopentanes from readily available starting materials, is metal-free, and features enhanced atom and step economy, excellent selectivity, extensive substrate versatility, favorable functional group compatibility, structural diversity, and mild reaction conditions, which further enable late-stage diversification. DFT calculations elucidated that this transformation entails sequential radical generation, radical addition, ring-opening, radical cyclization, and elimination steps.
40226910	Thermally Activated Swelling and Wetting Transition of Frozen Polymer Brushes:a New Concept for Surface Functionalization.	Functional polymer brush coatings have great potential for various industrial applications thanks to their ability to adapt to environmental stimuli, providing tunable surface properties. While existing approaches rely on polymer-solvent interactions and their response to external stimuli, changes in the intrinsic physical properties of the polymer also play a critical role in modulating brush behavior. In this context, the melting transition of a semicrystalline oleophilic poly-octadecylmethacrylate (P18MA) brush coating is shown to drive a swelling and wetting transition upon exposure to various liquid alkanes. The top surface of this polymer displays a somewhat higher melting temperature than the bulk, enabling separate control of the bulk-driven swelling and surface-driven wetting transitions. Laser-induced heating enables reversible on-demand activation of both transitions with micrometer lateral resolution. These findings suggest a new concept of polymer brush-based functional surfaces that allow for controlled fluid transport via separately switchable surface barriers and bulk transport layers based on a suitable choice of polymer-polymer and polymer-solvent interactions.
40226909	Functionalized Cellulose-Based Binders for Lithium Cobalt Oxide Cathodes: Improving Stability and Lithium-Ion Transport Under High Voltage.	Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) is a key material for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries, but its application at high voltages is hindered by structural instability and interfacial side reactions. This study introduces a functionalized cellulose-based binder designed to address these challenges. By grafting polar groups onto cellulose, the material's crystallinity is reduced, solubility is improved, and strong adhesion with enhanced ion transport is achieved. The binder enables LCO cathodes to retain 95.9% of their capacity after 200 cycles at 4.6 V, significantly outperforming conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binders. Furthermore, the binder reduces polarization and facilitates lithium-ion diffusion, contributing to improved electrode stability and electrochemical performance. These results highlight the potential of functionalized cellulose-based binders as sustainable and effective solutions for stabilizing high-voltage LCO cathodes, paving the way for next-generation high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries.
40226908	Significant but Overlooked: The Role of Anthropogenic Monoterpenes in Ozone Formation in a Chinese Megacity.	Recent observations have revealed unexpectedly high concentrations of monoterpenes (MT) in urban areas, frequently surpassing those in forested regions. These findings suggest significant anthropogenic contributions (MT<sub>ANT</sub>), challenging the traditional view that MT emissions are predominantly natural (MT<sub>NAT</sub>) in current inventories. This oversight likely results in a substantial underestimation of MT's role in urban ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) production. Therefore, we developed a novel approach to generate a gridded emission inventory (EI) of MT<sub>ANT</sub>, integrating flux measurements of MT and carbon monoxide (CO). Results show that MT<sub>ANT</sub> emission rate in Beijing core areas exceeds MT<sub>NAT</sub> by a factor of 1.83, with household volatile chemical products (VCPs) contributing 56% of total MT<sub>ANT</sub> emissions. Incorporating MT<sub>ANT</sub> emissions into the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model significantly improved the simulation of diurnal MT variations (correlation coefficient, <i>r</i> = 0.985) and reduced the normalized mean bias (<i>NMB</i>) in surface MT concentration predictions by 53%. Notably, the combined effects of anthropogenic and biogenic MT emissions increased summertime maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> levels by 12.8 ppb in Beijing core areas, with MT from household VCPs (MT<sub>VCP</sub>) accounting for 62% of the MT<sub>ANT</sub>-driven O<sub>3</sub> increase. This study provides a robust quantitative foundation for assessing the impact of anthropogenic MT emissions on urban air quality and highlights the urgent need for targeted regulatory measures to mitigate their growing contribution to O<sub>3</sub> pollution.

40226906	Development of mass spectrometric methods for determination of desoxycorticosterone pivalate and its esterase product in canine serum.	Hypoadrenocorticism is a serious condition in dogs that results from autoimmune adrenalitis and depletion of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Affected dogs respond well to glucocorticoid supplementation and treatment with the synthetic mineralocorticoid desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP). DOCP injected once monthly resolves serum Na/K abnormalities and normalizes water balance, but therapy is expensive. Cost abatement involves prolongation of the 30-day dosage interval or decreasing the 2.2 mg/kg dosage. These approaches are not based on DOCP pharmacokinetics. A full assessment of the practicality of either approach would benefit from understanding drug pharmacokinetics, requiring measurement of DOCP and its esterase product desoxycorticosterone (DOC) in canine serum while avoiding toxic endpoints from overdosing. Mass spectrometric methods were developed including gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of DOCP and DOC-methoxime trimethylsilyl derivatives, an approach sensitive to 2 ng/mL. Greater sensitivity was desired, so liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with ESI+ ionization was investigated. Supported liquid extraction was devised for serum with recoveries ∼100%. The LC-MS/MS method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy and limits of detection (0.029 and 0.019 ng/mL for DOC and DOCP, respectively). A pilot experiment with DOCP-treated hypoadrenocorticism dogs over one-month revealed DOC baseline values as 0.183+/-0.090 ng/mL, which increased to the 1.0 - 2.2 ng/mL range. DOCP was not visible in any samples suggesting 100% conversion. Halving the dosage to 1.1 mg/kg still showed clear increases over the DOC baseline. MS fragmentation involved ring cleavages, dehydrations and double-charged fragments. The methodology was robust and suitable for studying DOC/DOCP pharmacokinetics in future studies of hypoadrenocorticism dogs.

40226900	Functionalized Hydroxyapatite Loading Enhances the Mechanical and Biodegradation Properties of Wet-Spun Poly(Lactide-co-Glycolide) Scaffolds by Additive Manufacturing.	Additive manufacturing of biodegradable composite materials is an effective strategy for the development of tailored scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. This research activity is aimed at the development of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds loaded with hydroxyapatite (HA) by means of a novel additive manufacturing approach. For this purpose, HA particles are functionalized through PLGA grafting (PgHA) to increase their compatibility with the polymeric matrix. PgHA-loaded PLGA scaffolds show higher tensile and compressive moduli than analogous PLGA scaffolds non-loaded with the ceramic phase, as well as a higher elongation at break than PLGA scaffolds loaded with non-functionalized HA. In addition, PgHA-loaded scaffolds maintain their structural stability in vitro for a longer time (9 weeks) than the other two kinds of scaffold. All the developed scaffolds support in vitro preosteoblast viability and differentiation toward the osteoblastic phenotype. The obtained results encourage therefore future research on the developed composite scaffolds for personalized bone tissue engineering approaches.
40226899	Computational design and screening of highly efficient metal dual-atom-modified g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction to C<sub>2</sub> chemicals.	This work investigated a series of metal dual-atom-modified g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> catalysts (CuM/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, In, Sn, Pt, and Bi) for the photoreduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>2</sub> chemicals by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that CuPd/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has the best catalytic activity and selectivity for ethanol production, with *CO-*CO<sub>2</sub> → *CO-*COOH as the energy-determining step which has a limiting free energy change (Δ<i>G</i><sub>L</sub>) of 0.43 eV. CuSn/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has the best activity for ethylene generation, and the energy-determining step is *CHO-*CO → *CHOH-*CO, with a Δ<i>G</i><sub>L</sub> of 0.68 eV. The adsorption free energies of key species such as *CO<sub>2</sub> and *CO-*CO<sub>2</sub> were identified as suitable descriptors to correlate the activity of CuM/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to ethanol. The activity of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to ethylene mainly depends on the desorption free energy of ethylene, and the CuSn/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> catalyst was screened as a promising candidate for ethylene generation. This work reveals that the catalytic activity and product selectivity of CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction can be effectively regulated by carefully adjusting the composition of metal dual-atom active centers and their interactions with the g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> support, providing useful reference for future catalyst design.

40226897	Acceptability and feasibility of an internet-based intervention for bereaved Chinese with prolonged grief: a mixed methods study.	<b>Background:</b> In China, professional resources for the bereaved are scarce. Internet-based interventions could offer a promising solution for providing mental health services to those experiencing prolonged grief. However, the acceptability and feasibility of such interventions for this group are not well understood.<b>Objective:</b> This study aims to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a newly developed prolonged grief intervention protocol and the way how the intervention is delivered.<b>Methods:</b> Thirty-eight Chinese bereaved individuals with prolonged grief were recruited online to use a WeChat mini programme named <i>Healing Grief</i>, which was developed on the basis of the Dual Process Model (DPM) of coping with bereavement, for six weeks. Participants were asked to complete pre - and post - intervention questionnaires to capture their demographic information, bereavement-related characteristics, related mental health variables and user experience of the intervention. Semi-structured interviews focused on user experience were conducted after the intervention. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and difference tests, while thematic analysis was applied to the interview transcripts.<b>Results:</b> Thirty participants (78.9%) completed the whole intervention, and 25 participants (65.8%) attended the interview. Overall, participants had high acceptability of the intervention form and the intervention protocol. Regression analysis suggested goal achievement in the <i>Searching for meaning</i> module (<i>β </i>= -0.501, <i>p </i>= .005) predicted 22.4% improvement in prolonged grief. Goal achievement in the <i>Saying goodbye</i> module (<i>β </i>= 0.554, <i>p </i>= .001) and the quality of the intervention (<i>β </i>= 0.328, <i>p </i>= .028) predicted 48.0% improvement in post-traumatic growth. Thematic analysis showed that most participants agreed that the intervention helped them cope with grief, embrace positive changes, and change their previous cognitions about psychological intervention and grief.<b>Conclusions:</b> The DPM-based intervention delivered via WeChat mini programme demonstrated high acceptability and feasibility among Chinese individuals with prolonged grief. Further randomized controlled trials are recommended to assess its effectiveness.
40226896	Liquid Crystalline Fluorene-2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole Oligomers with Amplified Spontaneous Emission.	Conjugated fluorene-based molecules are a powerful class of materials for optoelectronic applications, known for their outstanding photoluminescence quantum yields and easily tunable optical properties. While conjugated polymers like poly(fluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) have been extensively studied, their performance is often hindered by product inhomogeneity and morphological constraints. By contrast, well-defined oligofluorenes offer precise molecular structures and better morphological control, making them an attractive alternative to conjugated polymers. Among them, benzothiadiazole (BT)-centered oligofluorenes exhibit strong yellow emission with remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yields, yet their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, a straightforward synthesis of BT-cored pentafluorenes is reported, where the alkyl side chains are systematically varied to investigate their impact on the morphology. These pentamers demonstrate amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with thresholds as low as 1.64 µJ cm⁻<sup>2</sup>. By fine-tuning the alkyl chains, crystalline, amorphous, and liquid crystalline morphologies are achieved, while maintaining consistent optical properties, paving the way for defined materials in advanced optoelectronic applications.

40226894	Preferential Space Use Exhibited by Individual Orangutans in an Innovative Enclosure at Auckland Zoo.	To meet the needs of socially complex primates, modern zoo enclosures are designed to include structural, sensory, food-based, and tactile enrichment, as well as opportunities to express the behavioral preferences of zoo-housed individuals. The welfare of captive primates is commonly measured by the expression of species-typical behaviors; and more recently by analyzing space use. Here, we present data from a study on preferential space use for three adult orangutans housed at Auckland Zoo. One of the zoo's main goals, with the recent introduction of an overhead line pathway, was to encourage arboreal movement and to increase time spent off the ground. Findings from this study show significant departure from expected values for use of both location and height. Most notably, all individuals used the overhead pathway within values expected by chance, but there was significant variation in location use within the enclosure. Residuals indicate that each orangutan has personal preference for different areas and height ranges of their enclosure, which is supported by behavioral observations. Enclosure use is heavily influenced by individual preferences, physical capabilities, and husbandry practices.
40226893	PCSK9 Targeted Autophagosome-Tethering Compounds: Design, Synthesis, and Antiatherosclerosis Evaluation.	Atherosclerosis is a multifaceted disease involving various cell types and complex mechanisms, and it is the main cause of cardiovascular disease. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) has been identified as an effective target for treating atherosclerosis; however, most current research focuses on biological drugs. Our work optimized the previously reported autophagosome-tethering compound <b>OY3</b>, and specifically, compound <b>W6</b> induced PCSK9 degradation with a 5-fold increase in activity and a 6-fold increase in bioavailability. Compared to the currently marketed PCSK9 drug, siRNA, <b>W6</b> demonstrated comparable antiatherosclerosis effects both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. <b>W6</b> exhibited beneficial effects on hepatocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells involved in the atherosclerosis process, making it a promising potential antiatherosclerosis drug. This work highlights the feasibility of ATTECs in degrading both intracellular and extracellular proteins, and our novel PCSK9-ATTEC <b>W6</b> provides a valuable reference for the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases.

40226888	Surgical interventions for presbyopia.	Presbyopia is a progressive condition that everyone who lives long enough will experience, irrespective of gender, ethnicity, or economic status. A wide range of surgical options has emerged for overcoming near and intermediate visual impairment; however, questions about the effectiveness and safety of these interventions remain unanswered. Given the global burden of presbyopia and the need to improve decision-making practices in tailoring management and allocating scarce resources, it is essential to review the available evidence on this issue systematically.
40226887	Assessment of cytotoxic properties of tetrahydroisoquinoline oximes in breast, prostate and glioblastoma cancer cells.	Tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) oximes have been investigated as antidotes for poisoning by toxic organophosphorus compounds. Recent studies have shown that some THIQ oximes induce cytotoxic effects and trigger apoptosis in various cell types. Since this pathway activation is desirable for anticancer drugs, we further explored the effects of three selected THIQ oximes on well-known cancer cell models: breast (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), prostate (PC-3) cancer and malignant glioblastoma (U251). The tested THIQ oximes were cytotoxic to breast cancer cells and, to a lesser extent, to glioblastoma cells, but not to PC-3 cells at concentrations up to 200 µM within a 24-h exposure period. The MCF-7 cells exhibited the highest sensitivity, with all three oximes affecting it in a time-dependent manner (IC<sub>50</sub> from 7-74 µM). While the membrane integrity of affected cells was maintained after treatment with the tested THIQ oximes, they disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and activated caspase 9 indicating triggering of the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Overall, these findings suggest that the THIQ oxime scaffold could be a foundation for developing targeted therapies, especially for breast cancer, and other derivatives may be worthier of exploration.
40226885	Photomediated Radical Cascade Addition-Cyclization of N-Butenoyl Tetrahydroquinolines: Accessing Functionalized Julolidines.	Herein, we describe the photomediated radical cascade addition-cyclization of N-butenoyl tetrahydroquinolines to access various functionalized julolidine-5-one. The scope of the methodology was illustrated with several sulfonyl chlorides and tetrahydroquinolines. Other radical precursors, such as trifluoromethyl, bromoacetonitrile, bromoacetates, etc., also worked efficiently, demonstrating the broad utility of the method. Finally, large-scale synthesis of sulfonyl-substituted julolidine-5-one and downstream conversions of the synthesized julolidine derivatives were carried out to illustrate the synthetic utility of the methodology.

This study investigated whether disability status increased with the frequency of insomnia symptoms and sleep medication usage over a 5-year period and whether frequent use of sleep medication modified the longitudinal effects of insomnia symptoms on disability among community-dwelling older adults.
40226881	Rictor stability mediated by USP9X regulates embryo implantation by participating in lipid metabolism of endometrium.	The receptive endometrium is a prerequisite for successful embryo implantation, and abnormal endometrial receptivity would lead to infertility. Many key proteins involved in endometrial receptivity have been confirmed to undergo post transcriptional modifications. However, there are limited reports on deubiquitination modification during this process. Our previous studies found that Rictor participated in the endometrial receptivity, and maintained at a high level in the endometrium during implantation, but the mechanism for maintaining stability of Rictor protein remains unclear. Here, we showed that USP9X expression in endometrium was dynamic with the establishment of endometrial receptivity, and promoted the protein stability of Rictor through deubiquitination. Inhibition of USP9X could suppress the adhesion action of trophoblast cells to endometrial epithelial cells, reduce the filamentous pseudopodia of epithelial cells, and inhibit the epithelial mesenchymal transformation. Rictor is partially responsible for the derailment of epithelial cell transformation in response to USP9X inhibition. Membrane fluidity mediated by lipid metabolism is involved in regulation of Rictor on endometrial receptivity. This study revealed the role of USP9X in endometrial receptivity for the first time, and confirmed that Rictor was the target protein of USP9X in endometrium. In addition, we described the unique lipidomics characteristics of the endometrial epithelial cells regulated by Rictor. These data would further improve the molecular network of endometrial receptivity, supplement the regulatory factors of lipid metabolism in endometrial cells, and provide insights into the new therapeutics, pre-diagnosis and preventive strategies for the derailment of endometrial receptivity and subsequently adverse "ripple effect" including infertility.
40226880	Utilizing an aqueous-liquid crystal interface to investigate membrane protein interactions and mutation effects of a pore-forming toxin.	Listeriolysin O (LLO) is a crucial cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) secreted by <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. LLO lyses the phagosomal membrane <i>via</i> pore-formation, resulting in pathogenesis. CDCs' ability to recognize and bind to membrane cholesterol is a hallmark in the pathogenesis of these pore-forming toxins, distinguishing them from other toxins. Conservation of the cholesterol-recognition motif (CRM) has been discovered to be one of the prerequisites for the membrane binding of some CDCs, but the role of the CRM for LLO binding and pore-formation is still unclear. Therefore, we investigated LLO-mediated lipid remodelling at a nanomolar concentration using the interfacial properties of a biomimetic liquid crystal (LC)-aqueous interface. The examination addresses the significance of the CRM in protein structure and membrane reorganizations for the cholesterol-mediated binding of LLO. We report that the CRM assists in the binding of LLO in a unique amphipathic environment, especially at low cholesterol levels. However, eliminating or substituting the CRM from LLO significantly alters the threshold cholesterol level required for its activity. This study also reveals the effect of cholesterol-dependent membrane dynamics in the association and activity of LLO. Our findings suggest a novel paradigm that opens up an array of possibilities for discovering sequential mutations and delineating the molecular mechanisms of CDCs in nanomolar concentration regimes.
40226879	CsSAD1-silenced in tea leaves impaired drought tolerance by decreasing plasma membrane H +-ATPase activity.	Drought stress is a negative regulatory factor that leads to reduced yield and quality. Unsaturated fatty acids controlled by SAD (stearic acid desaturase) play a key role in mediating membrane fluidity to cope with drought stress; however, the response of CsSAD1 to drought stress is poorly understood. In this study, CsSAD1-silenced leaves displayed weakened drought tolerance, accompanied by lower Fv/Fm and higher MDA levels. However, CsSAD1-overexpressing Arabidopsis exhibited an elevated tolerance to drought stress in pot experiments. Furthermore, CsSAD1-silenced leaves displayed reduced plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity, which promoted membrane potential depolarization and led to a massive K+ loss under PEG stress. In contrast, CsSAD1-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed higher plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity and alleviated membrane potential depolarization, which in turn mitigated K+ loss under drought stress. Moreover, an exogenous supply of Na3VO4 (P-type ATPases inhibitor) further indicated that the difference in K+ efflux in the transgenic plants was dependent on the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Therefore, silencing CsSAD1 in tea leaves inhibited plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity, which was the primary factor contributing to the maintenance of K+ homeostasis and, consequently, drought tolerance in tea plants.

40226876	Improved Evaluation of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in Bovine Spermatozoa Using JC-1 with Flow Cytometry.	One of the most popular methods for measuring mitochondrial membrane potential via conventional flow cytometry in spermatozoa is through the use of the fluorescent dye 5,5,6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'tetraethylbenzimi-dazoylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1). The JC-1 dye is unique in that it will fluoresce green (525 nm, monomers) or red-orange (595 nm, J-aggregates) when excited to indicate depolarized or polarized mitochondria. While JC-1 can be multiplexed with viability dyes such as propidium iodide and SYBR 14 for microscopy, doing so for conventional flow cytometry has proved difficult due to overlap of the emission spectra between dyes. The objective of this protocol is to improve the accuracy of JC1 J-aggregate quantification in conventional flow cytometry by using a 405 nm or 532 nm laser for excitation coupled with the viability dye calcein violet (CV). Quantification of live J-aggregates when excited with a 405 nm or 532 nm laser is more strongly correlated to progressive motility (405 nm: r = 0.73, P < 0.0001; 532 nm: r = 0.52, P = 0.0002) and viability (405 nm: r = 0.93, P < 0.0001; 532 nm: r = 0.74, P < 0.0001) than quantification with the traditional 488 nm laser excitation and dual emission of 525 nm and 595 nm (progressive motility: r = 0.05, P = 0.72; viability: r = 0.21, P = 0.14). The use of a 405 nm or a 532 nm laser requires no compensation. This allows for clear identification of the polarized J-aggregates, and when combined with CV, may help identify which spermatozoa have the greatest fertilization potential.

The versatility of the C-Br bond for forging C-S and C-C bonds was demonstrated. The fluorosulfonylation reaction allowed the first entry of the cubane in click chemistry illustrated with nucleophiles, electrophiles, and alkynes. The grafting of appendages was illustrated with amino acids and dipeptides, enabling the discrimination of the diesters via cyclization into "fused cubane-lactam" structures.

Hip hemiarthroplasties are performed in medically frail and/or comorbid patients who sustain a displaced intracapsular hip fracture. Dislocations occur in approximately 0.6-5.0% patients and are associated with worse outcomes, including mortality when compared against a similar cohort of patients who do not suffer a dislocation of their hemiarthroplasty.This study aimed to quantify the outcomes from the management of dislocated hip hemiarthroplasties in a cohort of contemporaneously used implants and the associated 1-year mortality.
40226872	Skylite: Skyline-Based Lipid Isomer Retention Time Evaluation for Lipidomics in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis.	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most prevalent liver disorder worldwide and can progress to steatohepatitis. Elevated de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a key contributor to hepatic steatosis. Fatty acid (FA) desaturation produces several unsaturated lipid isomers that are structurally very similar but have diverse biological functions. However, due to their structural similarity, many conventional mass spectrometry approaches cannot detect such metabolic alterations. Thus, we introduce the Skylite (Skyline-based lipid isomer retention time evaluation) workflow using conventional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify important isomer features. Retention times of isomeric phosphatidylcholines are compared with the well-characterized human plasma reference standard NIST 1950. Retention time trends correlate well with fixed-charge derivatized FA in liquid chromatography and ozone-induced dissociation mass spectrometry data. The interpretation is supported by double bond diagnostic fragments in LC-MS/MS experiments of epoxidized hydrolyzed fatty acids. We investigate hepatic lipid profiles, focusing on esterified fatty acids in two mouse models of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Out of 37 phosphatidylcholine sum compositions, the workflow identifies 123 lipid features. Importantly, CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced and melanocortin-4 receptor knockout mice on a western diet (WD) have significantly higher levels of mead acid, branched-chain fatty acid, and <i>n</i>-7 PUFA incorporated into phosphatidylcholines. While the MASH mouse liver tissues contain notable amounts of <i>n</i>-7 PUFA, no <i>n</i>-10 PUFA were detected, potentially indicating a unique desaturation pattern. The screening for altered lipid isomer profiles bridges the gap between high-throughput analyses and specialized structure-resolved techniques.
40226871	Tumor Hemorrhage-inducing Polysaccharides Secreted by Streptococci and Serratia Proposed as the Active Principal Ingredients (API's) of Coley's Toxin: On PS1, the Serratia marcescens API.	Coley's Toxin comprised a mixture of cell-free, heat-treated culture media from Streptococcus pyogenes (originally Streptococus erysipelatos) and Serratia marcescens (originally Bacillus prodigiosus). A 250 kDa tumor hemorrhage-inducing polysaccharide "PS1" is reported here secreted into culture medium by S. marcescens. Four h after PS1 is injected at 32 μg/kg (10pM) into the tail vein of Balb/C mice bearing C26 subcutaneous colon-derived tumors, tumor-specific capillary hemorrhage is exhibited in 90% of tumors. As a positive control, CM101, a similar tumor hemorrhagic polysaccharide from Streptococcus agalactica caused tumor hemorrhage in 75% of tumors in the Balb/C-C26 model at 7.5 μg/kg(2.5pM). CM101 has previously been safety tested in a Phase I clinical trial. These two polysaccharides have merit to be identified as the active principal ingredients (API's) of Coley'sToxin. Additional approaches to cancer therapy are a global need. No matter the level of wealth of victims, some cancers are still incurable. Recall in recent years the tragic early cancer deaths of Steve Jobs and Paul Allen among other luminaries. Streptococcal and Serratia bacterial extracts have unique tumor specific capillary destructive activity, with observations originating with sarcomas cured by nosocomial erysipelas infections in the 1860's. The active pharmaceutical10 ingredients (API's) in these extracts and Coley's Toxins are proposed to be polysaccharides.

40226869	Red Ginseng Aqueous Extract Superior to White Ginseng Exhibited Anti-aging Property through IIS Signaling Pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans.	The traditional Chinese herbal medicine Panax ginseng can optimize physical health and is anticipated to be a valuable resource for investigating anti-aging therapies. This study investigated the anti-aging effects of red ginseng aqueous extract (RG) and white ginseng aqueous extract (WG). Network pharmacology forecasted that the key mechanisms of anti-aging in white and red ginseng were the PI3K-Akt and IIS signaling pathways. Experiments conducted on Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) showed that 5 mg/mL WG and RG notably prolonged lifespan and improved stress resistance. The qPCR analysis revealed that changes in upstream genes activated downstream genes in the IIS pathway. Furthermore, forward and reverse validation indicated that WG and RG acted through the IIS pathway in promoting longevity. RG exhibited superior anti-aging effects compared to WG at the same concentration. This might be attributed to the fact that RG contained more reducing sugars, polyphenols, melanoidins, total saponin content and especially the conversion of ginsenosides. Molecular docking showed that ginsenosides interacted with the key protein DAF-2, with ginsenosides Rg3, Rg5, Rh4, Rf, and Rc binding more strongly than ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, and Rd. Overall, RG possessed different active ingredients compared to WG and showed superior results in improving aging in C. elegans.

40226867	Structurally Engineering Multi-Shell Hollow Zeolite Single Crystals via Defect-Directed Oriented-Kinetics Transformation and Their Heterostructures for Hydrodeoxygenation Reaction.	Single-crystalline multi-shell hollow porous materials with high compartment capacity, large active surface area, and superior structural stability are expected to unlock tremendous potential across diverse critical applications. However, their synthetic methodology has not yet been well established. Here, we develop a defect-directed oriented-kinetics transformation approach to prepare multi-shell hollow aluminosilicate ZSM-5 zeolite (MFI) crystals with single-crystalline feature, hierarchical macro-/mesoporosity, controllable shell number, and high structural stability. The methodology lies in the creation of zeolite precursors consisting of multiple inhomogeneous layers with gradient-distributed defects along the [100] and [010] directions and irregularly discrete defects-rich regions along the [001] direction via continuous epitaxial growth. Subsequently, the locations with more defects could be preferentially etched to form voids or mesopores, meanwhile oriented recrystallization interconnects the nanoshells into a unified architecture along the [001] direction. Benefiting from the easily accessible bifunctional metal/acid sites and the capability for reactant accumulation, the resultant multi-shell hollow Ni-loaded zeolite catalysts show significantly enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid into liquid fuels. The insight gained from this systematic study will facilitate the rational design and synthesis of diverse multi-shell hollow structured single-crystalline porous materials for a broad range of potential applications.
40226866	Benchmark Paraffin Adsorption in a Super-Hydrophobic Porous Coordination Polymer with Blade-like Circular Phenyl Nanotraps.	Selective capture of paraffin from olefin that permits one-step purification of olefin is significantly important, yet developing adsorbents with high separation selectivity and hydrophobicity remains a daunting challenge. Although aromatic environments can enhance paraffin affinity and hydrophobicity through nonpolar interactions, water adsorption still occurs in regions distant from the aromatic rings, as well as in secondary pores that are always overlooked. Herein, we reported an ultramicroporous porous coordination polymer (ZnFPCP) featuring blade-like circular phenyl paraffin nanotraps. As further validated by DFTB calculations, GCMC simulations, and in situ FT-IR analysis, these ultramicroporous paraffin nanotraps created by surrounding benzene rings enhance the preferential adsorption of paraffin, and the segmented spaces between adjacent nanotraps in the blade-like structure combined with hydrophobic petal-like secondary pore channels enclosed by fluorinated functional groups further mitigates the water co-adsorption. Remarkably, ZnFPCP exhibited outstanding IAST selectivity of C3H8/C3H6 (2.08) and competitive selectivity of C2H6/C2H4 (2.93) under ambient conditions, while also exhibiting record-breaking C3H8 and C2H6 uptake at low pressures. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated the excellent performance of ZnFPCP in olefin purification, affording the exceptional productivity of ultra-high purity (99.99%) for C3H6 and C2H4. Robust stability and super hydrophobicity highlight its potential in harsh industrial application scenarios.
40226864	Gemini Molecular Assembly Colocalization (GOAL): Accurate and Efficient Fusion Genotyping for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Intelligent Diagnosis.	RNA small fragment aberrances are associated with diseases by mediating a range of pathogenesis and pathological processes. DNA assembly-based barcoding and amplification technologies are currently being actively explored for RNA in situ analysis. However, these modular integrated DNA assembly processes are inevitably accompanied with false positive signals caused by unexpected misassembly. Completely avoiding this phenomenon through simple and universal methods is challenging. Here, a novel dual-input to dual-output in situ analysis paradigm is proposed, aiming to improve target specificity through co-recognition (dual-input) and to eliminate false positive misassembly through fluorescent signal co-localization (dual-output). Based on this paradigm, Gemini molecular assembly co-localization (GOAL) in situ imaging system is launched to accurately distinguish the fusion gene subtypes associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and to precisely report the proportion of minimum residual cancer cells in clinical samples by intelligent co-localization counting and sorting. GOAL achieves highly sensitive and accurate genotyping recognition of 0.01% CML tumor cells and realizes fully automatic rapid diagnosis with a customized Intelligent Cell Image Sorter (iCis). iCis-assisted GOAL represents an innovative and versatile molecular toolkit for accurate, rapid, user-friendly, and professional-independent profiling of cancer cells with RNA small fragment aberrances, providing efficient clinical decision support for disease diagnosis.
40226863	Self-Restoration of a Wrinkled Hf<sub>0.5</sub>Zr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Ferroelectric Membrane.	Ferroelectric oxides are generally prone to brittle deformation, which impedes their applicability in flexible devices. Using a damage-free peel-off process, we successfully synthesized wrinkled 10 nm thick membranes of zirconium-doped hafnium oxide Hf<sub>0.5</sub>Zr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (HZO). We studied their self-restoration dynamics via in situ scanning probe microscopy. Substantial deformations were induced as the tip descended by applying and sustaining a predefined static force at the crest of the wrinkled membrane. The membrane was fully restored to its original wrinkled state within a specific force range, with no observed damage after force removal. The membrane demonstrated self-restoration even after forces exceeding 100 nN, which completely collapsed the wrinkles, highlighting the exceptional flexibility of these freestanding HZO membranes─an uncommon property among functional oxides. Combining phase-field simulations, we observed the emergence of a region exhibiting continuous variation in polarization intensity within the strained area. The formation of this specific domain structure plays a pivotal role in the self-restoration behavior of the freestanding ferroelectric membranes. This self-restoration capability is essential for the long-term stability of flexible electronic devices, such as sensors, energy harvesters, and electronic skins.
40226862	Obesity-related glomerulopathy: How it happens and future perspectives.	Obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG) is an emerging complication of excess adiposity. Its incidence rises alongside the obesity pandemic. Up to 40% of individuals can be affected by ORG, irrespective of the status of glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria. ORG is a distinct histological diagnosis based on kidney biopsy, showing classical features of an enlarged glomerulus with and without focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in the perihilar region seen with all categories of obesity. About 10% of individuals with ORG may progress to end-stage kidney disease. The invasive nature of kidney biopsy highlights the need for non-invasive biomarkers for improved screening, diagnosis and risk prediction of ORG. These biomarkers may narrow the gaps in the management of ORG by improving: (1) screening, diagnosis and differentiation of ORG from non-ORG conditions; (2) risk prediction and stratification of individuals at risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease including the detection of trajectories of progression; (3) monitoring of treatment safety and effectiveness and (4) development of novel therapeutic targets. In the present review, we discussed the pathophysiology, emerging biomarkers (such as kidney injury molecule-1 [KIM-1], uromodulin, klotho, circulating microRNA-21 [miR-21]) and future treatment strategies (metabolic surgery, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, incretin-based therapy and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists) of ORG.
40226861	Stepwise Crystallization Synthetic Strategy for Monodisperse InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots with Mid-Infrared Absorption.	Colloidal InSb quantum dots (QDs) are promising mid-infrared (MIR) photodetection materials due to their suitable bandgap, unparalleled room temperature electronic properties, environmental-friendly elemental composition and facile solution processability. However, current InSb QDs suffer from limited spectral absorption within 2 μm, polydisperse QDs populations and complex size-selective precipitation for further use, due to the lack of applicable growth theory and synthetic method. Here, we present a novel synthetic strategy for InSb QDs, which is featured by the initial formation of an amorphous intermediate and a subsequent stepwise crystallization process. This strategy enables the achievement of monodisperse InSb QDs with unprecedented 5.8 nm to 22.2 nm size range, and a remarkably low size distribution deviation of 5.8% without the need of any size-selective precipitation. For the first time, we realize the synthesis of InSb QDs with absorption wavelength exceeding 3000 nm, the record among the environmental-friendly QDs. The results presented here will pave the way towards environmental-friendly QDs as outstanding infrared optical and optoelectronic materials and push the frontier of solution-processed QDs into the mid-infrared regime applications.
40226860	Synthesis and biological evaluation of γ-alkylidenebutenolides isolated from <i>Melodorum fruticosum</i>: the role of the propylidene-type side chain structure on anti-melanogenic activity.	The first structure-activity relationship study on γ-alkylidenebutenolides [(4<i>Z</i>)- and (4<i>E</i>)-6,7-dihydroxyhepta-2,4-dien-4-olide 6-monobenzoate] (4<i>Z</i>, 3 and 4<i>E</i>, 4) and 7-monobenzoate (4<i>Z</i>, 1 and 4<i>E</i>, 2) which are potent melanogenesis inhibitors (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.3-2.9 μM) isolated from the medicinal plant <i>Melodorum fruticosum</i>, was carried out using the related analogous (7-21). The inhibitory activities of the (4<i>Z</i>)- and (4<i>E</i>)-6,7-dideoxylated compounds (7) completely disappeared, while those of the 6-oxo-7-hydroxy-type compounds (4<i>Z</i>, 20 and 4<i>E</i>, 21) were significantly attenuated compared with those of 1-4. By contrast, the 6,7-dihydroxylated compounds (4<i>Z</i>, 8 and 4<i>E</i>, 9; IC<sub>50</sub> = 5.8-1.5 μM) showed inhibitory activities similar to those of 1-4, suggesting that the two hydroxyl groups at positions C6 and C7 on the side chain play an essential role in the onset of potent inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activities of the 6,7-diacylated analogues (10-19, acyl group = Ac, Piv, or Bz; IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.7-3.3 μM) were also nearly identical to those of the 6- or 7-monobenzoates (1, 3, and 4), regardless of the geometry of the double bond. However, acylation of the strongest inhibitor (4<i>E</i>, 2; IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.3 μM) at position C6, reduced the activity by approximately 1/3 to 1/5. This result suggests the importance of the cooperative role of the acyl moiety at position C7 and the hydroxyl group at position C6 in the <i>E</i>-configured double bond. The total synthesis of the natural products melodorinone A (20) and melodorinone B (21) was also achieved during the synthesis of the γ-alkylidenebutenolide analogues.

We report on an unconventional and highly active iron catalyst embedded within molten barium amide (Ba(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) for NH<sub>3</sub> decomposition. A ternary barium iron amide (Ba-NH<sub><i>x</i></sub>-Fe) species plays a crucial role in NH<sub>3</sub> decomposition catalysis. The synergy among multiple Fe atoms, Ba atoms, and the NH<sub>2</sub> moiety is responsible for its high catalytic activity under low temperatures.
40226858	Preparation of Light-colored Botanical Sunscreen from Pink Birch Lignin.	Lignin holds significant potential in UV-blocking and skincare products. However, its application has been hindered by the dark color. In this study, a pink lignin (PL) is successfully extracted from birch under mild condition, with molecular weight and polydispersity index of 4680 Da and 1.38, respectively. As PL preserves the native structure of lignin, it retains 57.14% of β-O-4 linkages and 19.09% of methoxy groups, and possesses a whiteness index of -25. To address its limited absorption in long-wave UV irradiation, PL capsules with broad-spectrum UV absorption are developed by encapsulating chemical sunscreen actives via one-step ultrasonic cavitation. Optimal capsules with an average diameter of 180 nm are obtained using 3 wt% PL solution concentration, 8:2 mass ratio of PL to chemical sunscreen actives, and 7.5 wt% surfactant. Formulating sun creams with 10% and 15% PL capsules as the sole active ingredient achieve sun protection factor (SPF) values of 130+ and 180+, respectively. And their whiteness indexes maintain -18 and -22. Due to the excellent photostability of PL, the SPF value of the capsule based sun cream decreases by only 18% after 7.5 hours UV exposure. Moreover, the PL capsules exhibit good biocompatibility and have promising application potential.

The incidence of gynecologic cancer in women of reproductive age is increasing, as is the trend towards fertility-sparing treatments, highlighting the importance of safe and effective contraceptive counseling. Selecting a contraceptive method requires careful consideration of the tumor's histological subtype, its hormonal expression, and the timing of counseling within the cancer care continuum (diagnosis, treatment, and post-treatment phases). The Portuguese Society of Contraception and the Section of Gynecologic Oncology of the Portuguese Gynecological Society present recommendations about contraception in women with gynecologic cancer who have undergone fertility-sparing treatments, from diagnosis to the end of the reproductive age.
40226856	Decoding the Plastic Patch: Exploring the Global Microplastic Distribution in the Surface Layers of Marine Regions with Interpretable Machine Learning.	The marine environment is grappling with microplastic (MP) pollution, necessitating an understanding of its distribution patterns, influencing factors, and potential ecological risks. However, the vast area of the ocean and budgetary constraints make conducting comprehensive surveys to assess MP pollution impractical. Interpretable machine learning (ML) offers an effective solution. Herein, we used four ML algorithms based on MP data calibrated to the size range of 20-5000 μm and considered various factors to construct a robust predictive ML model of marine MP distribution. Interpretation of the ML model indicated that biogeochemical and anthropogenic factors substantially influence global marine MP pollution, while atmospheric and physical factors exert lesser effects. However, the extent of the influence of each factor may vary within specific marine regions and their underlying mechanisms may differ across regions. The predicted results indicated that the global marine MP concentrations ranged from 0.176 to 27.055 particles/m<sup>3</sup> and that MPs in the 20-5000-μm size range did not pose a potential ecological risk. The interpretable ML framework developed in this study covered MP data preprocessing, MP distribution prediction, and interpretation of the influencing factors of MPs, providing an essential reference for marine MP pollution management and decision making.
40226854	Palladium Complex Grafted on PEG-Based Amphiphilic Polymers as ppm Level Micellar Catalysts for Suzuki-Miyaura Coupling in Water.	A series of bisphosphine-grafted amphiphilic polymers based on polyethylene glycol-poly(vinylethylene glycol) (PEG-PVEG) copolymers have been synthesized by using allylic etherification polymerization as a pivotal step. Self-assembling of the palladium complexes of the obtained amphiphilic polymers into spherical micelles has been investigated by UV-vis, DLS and TEM analysis. The outstanding catalytic performance of the present micellar palladium catalyst has been evidenced in the aqueous Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction, achieving remarkable efficiency even at a low catalyst loading of 100 ppm within 2 h.
40226853	Revealing the photochemical pathways of nitrate in water through first-principles simulations.	The nitrate anion (NO3-) is abundant in environmental aqueous phases, including aerosols, surface waters, and snow, where its photolysis releases nitrogen oxides back into the atmosphere. Nitrate photolysis occurs via two channels: (1) the formation of NO2 and O- and (2) the formation of NO2- and O(3P). The occurrence of two reaction channels with very low quantum yield (∼1%) highlights the critical role of the solvation environment and spin-forbidden electronic transitions, which remain unexplained at the molecular level. We investigate the two photolysis channels in water using quantum chemical calculations and first-principles molecular dynamics simulations with hybrid density functional theory and enhanced sampling. We find that spin-forbidden absorption to the triplet state (T1) is possible but occurs at a rate ∼15 times weaker than the spin-allowed transition to the singlet state (S1). A metastable solvation cage complex requires additional thermal energy to dissociate the N-O bond, allowing for recombination or non-radiative deactivation. Our results explain the temperature dependence of photolysis, linked to hydrogen bond rearrangement in the solvation shell. This work provides new molecular insights into nitrate photolysis and its low quantum yield under environmental conditions.
40226852	A basis-free phase space electronic Hamiltonian that recovers beyond Born-Oppenheimer electronic momentum and current density.	We present a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian ĤPS (parameterized by both nuclear position X and momentum P) that boosts each electron into the moving frame of the nuclei that are closest in real space. The final form for the phase space Hamiltonian does not assume the existence of an atomic orbital basis, and relative to standard Born-Oppenheimer theory, the newly proposed one-electron operators can be expressed directly as functions of electronic and nuclear positions and momentum. We show that (i) quantum-classical dynamics along such a Hamiltonian maintains momentum conservation and that (ii) diagonalizing such a Hamiltonian can recover the electronic momentum and electronic current density reasonably well. In conjunction with other reports in the literature that such a phase-space approach can also recover vibrational circular dichroism spectra, we submit that the present phase-space approach offers a testable and powerful approach to post-BO electronic structure theory. Moreover, the approach is inexpensive and can be immediately applied to simulations of chiral induced spin selectivity experiments (where the transfer of angular momentum between nuclei and electrons is considered critical).

Detecting triethylamine (TEA), which is a highly active industrial chemical, is crucial in today's globalized world with increasing air pollution. In this work, we propose reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/ZnO nanocomposites for efficient TEA detection under ultraviolet (UV) light activation at room temperature. rGO@ZnO nanocomposites with different rGO weight percentages (1, 2.5, 5, and 10 wt%) were synthesized through a scalable, one-step solid-state method and characterized using various physicochemical techniques. Among the samples, the 2.5wt% rGO@ZnO nanocomposite (2.5%G@ZnO) exhibited the highest photo-response after UV light irradiation, indicating its superior carrier concentration generation under UV light. TEA sensing studies were carried out under UV light using sensors based on pristine ZnO nanopowder and the 2.5%G@ZnO nanocomposite. The 2.5%G@ZnO sensor demonstrated a significantly enhanced TEA sensing response (35%) compared with pristine ZnO, and it exhibited a lower detection limit of 15.6 ppm at room temperature. The sensing mechanism was explained using the depletion layer model, accompanied by scanning Kelvin probe analysis, which highlighted the role of UV light activation in improving sensor performance. These findings underscore the potential of UV-activated rGO/ZnO nanocomposite sensors for sensitive and efficient TEA detection.

40226849	Synthesis of Dithioester Derivatives by Base-Mediated Fragmentation of 1,3-Dithiolanes.	Dithioesters are important agents for chain transfer in polymer chemistry and precursors in the synthesis of heterocycles. Straightforward approaches to their synthesis are therefore in demand. Outlined herein is a method to access such compounds in one-pot. 2-Aryl-1,3-dithiolanes undergo ring fragmentation with LiHMDS in CPME to generate aryl-dithiocarboxylates in 5 min at 100 °C. These anions are subsequently captured in the second step by addition of various alkyl halides and diaryliodonium salts to furnish a large library of dithioesters in good yields. The method can be also employed in a one-pot, one-step manner for alkyl bromides and allows the synthesis of dithioesters in gram scale.
40223812	Quantifying anomalous chemical diffusion through disordered porous rock materials.	Fickian (normal) diffusion models show limitations in quantifying diffusion-controlled migration of solute species through porous rock structures, as observed in experiments. Anomalous diffusion prevails and can be interpreted using a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) framework with a clear mechanistic underpinning. From the associated fractional diffusion equation we derive solutions over a broad range of anomalous diffusion behaviours, from highly anomalous to nearly Fickian, that yield temporal breakthrough curves and spatial concentration profiles of diffusing solutes. We illustrate that these solutions can be tailored to match realistic experimental conditions and resulting measurements that display anomalous diffusion. In particular, our analysis enables clear differentiation between early-time Fickian and anomalous diffusion, which becomes more pronounced over longer durations. It is shown that recent measurements of diffusion in natural rocks display distinct anomalous behaviour, with significant implications for critical assessment of solute migration in diverse geological and engineering applications.

40223808	Oncogenic and teratogenic effects of <i>Trp53</i><sup>Y217C</sup>, an inflammation-prone mouse model of the human hotspot mutant <i>TP53</i><sup>Y220C</sup>.	Missense 'hotspot' mutations localized in six p53 codons account for 20% of <i>TP53</i> mutations in human cancers. Hotspot p53 mutants have lost the tumor suppressive functions of the wildtype protein, but whether and how they may gain additional functions promoting tumorigenesis remain controversial. Here, we generated <i>Trp53</i><sup>Y217C</sup>, a mouse model of the human hotspot mutant <i>TP53</i><sup>Y220C</sup>. DNA damage responses were lost in <i>Trp53</i><sup>Y217C/Y217C</sup> (<i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup>) cells, and <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> fibroblasts exhibited increased chromosome instability compared to <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells. Furthermore, <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> male mice died earlier than <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> males, with more aggressive thymic lymphomas. This correlated with an increased expression of inflammation-related genes in <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> thymic cells compared to <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells. Surprisingly, we recovered only one <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> female for 22 <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> males at weaning, a skewed distribution explained by a high frequency of <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> female embryos with exencephaly and the death of most <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> female neonates. Strikingly, however, when we treated pregnant females with the anti-inflammatory drug supformin (LCC-12), we observed a fivefold increase in the proportion of viable <i>Trp53</i><sup>YC/YC</sup> weaned females in their progeny. Together, these data suggest that the p53<sup>Y217C</sup> mutation not only abrogates wildtype p53 functions but also promotes inflammation, with oncogenic effects in males and teratogenic effects in females.
40223807	Accurate prediction of ionic liquid density-of-states from low-cost calculations.	The electronic structure of ionic liquids (ILs) is a key factor in their chemical reactivity. Experimental techniques provide insight into IL electronic structure (<i>e.g</i>., X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS), but are impractical for screening large numbers of potential ILs. Computational screening offers an alternative approach, but current <i>ab initio</i> calculation methods (ion-pairs or large calculations with periodic boundaries) are not suitable for screening. We establish that a simple and computationally low-cost method, lone-ions evaluated at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311+G(d,p) level employing a generalised solvation model SMD (solvation model based on density), captures IL liquid-phase density-of-states (DoS) with good accuracy by validating against XPS data for a wide range of ILs. The additivity of the results from individual lone-ion calculations provides a significant advantage, enabling predictions of the DoS for a large number of ILs and delivering a significant step towards the computational screening of ILs for many applications.
40223804	Metal-oxygen bonding characteristics dictate activity and stability differences of RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub> in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction.	Ruthenium dioxide (RuO<sub>2</sub>) and iridium dioxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>) serve as benchmark electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet their intrinsic activity-stability relationships remain elusive. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the origin of divergent OER catalytic behaviors between RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub> in acidic media. Mechanistic analyses reveal that RuO<sub>2</sub> follows the adsorbate evolution mechanism with superior activity (theoretical overpotential: 0.698 V <i>vs.</i> 0.909 V for IrO<sub>2</sub>), while IrO<sub>2</sub> demonstrates enhanced stability due to a higher dissolution energy change (>2.9 eV <i>vs.</i> -0.306 eV for RuO<sub>2</sub>). Electronic structure analysis reveals that RuO<sub>2</sub> exhibits ionic-dominated metal-oxygen bonds with delocalized electron distribution, facilitating intermediate desorption but promoting detrimental RuO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> dissolution. In contrast, IrO<sub>2</sub> features covalent bonding characteristics with more electron filling in Ir-oxygen bonds (2.942 <i>vs.</i> 2.412 for RuO<sub>2</sub>), thereby stabilizing surface intermediates against dissolution at the expense of higher OER barriers. This work establishes a clear correlation between the bonding nature and electrocatalytic performance metrics, offering fundamental insights for the rational design of acid-stable OER electrocatalysts with optimized activity-stability relationships.
40223803	Elucidating pressure dependency and combustion mechanism of micro-unit composite propellants.	The interfacial control method is a promising strategy for regulating energy output and enhancing the combustion performance of solid propellants. This assembly technique enables direct contact between metal fuels and oxidizers, forming micro-units encapsulated in a binder (<i>e.g.</i>, Al@AP (Aluminum@ammonium perchlorate) and AP@Al structures), thereby reducing the heat and mass transfer distance between them. This study conducted a series of molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the combustion behavior of two typical micro-unit structures, focusing on heat transfer, mass diffusion, and reaction kinetics. Particular attention is given to the AP@Al configuration, examining the effects of the continuity and thickness of the coated Al layer. Two extreme pressure conditions, including condensed-phase combustion with a constant volume and vacuum conditions with varying volume, were thoroughly examined to elucidate the pressure dependency. Under condensed-phase conditions, the Al@AP configuration demonstrates favorable combustion performance, though with a relatively slower consumption rate of active Al due to a single reaction front. In contrast, the AP@Al structure achieves a burning rate 2.4 times faster, benefiting from a larger reaction area and a double reaction front. Under vacuum conditions, both structures exhibit similar energy output performance, yet the AP@Al structure maintains a faster Al consumption rate, indicating a lower pressure dependency. These numerical findings shed light on the combustion mechanisms of micro-unit composite propellants, underscoring the importance of the interfacial control strategy and paving the way for the rational design and development of next-generation solid propellants.
40223802	Structural order of Mg-stabilized amorphous calcium carbonate and its associated phase transformation.	Biominerals formed by marine organisms exhibit intricate structures and support a remarkable range of functionalities. Recent advances in our understanding of biomineralization highlight the pivotal role of magnesium-stabilized amorphous calcium carbonate (Mg-ACC) as a transient precursor in the formation of calcareous biominerals. This feature article reviews recent <i>in vitro</i> studies of Mg-ACC, illustrating the concepts of particle attachment, secondary nucleation, domain segregation, and mesocrystal formation. Some conceptual issues associated with the ongoing debate between classical nucleation theory and non-classical nucleation theory are discussed. We suggest that solid-state NMR measurements of the van Vleck second moment provide a stringent test for any proposed atomic model of Mg-ACC. The coordination environment of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and the significance of bicarbonate ions in Mg-ACC are discussed. The diffusion of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions within the calcitic lattice of high-Mg calcite offers a mechanistic insight into the 'dolomite problem'. The fusion of neighboring high-Mg calcite spherulites highlights their potential role as versatile building blocks for calcareous biomineral skeletal frameworks. Altogether, this article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural complexity and transformation pathways of Mg-ACC.
40223801	Interprofessional collaboration across sectors for unemployed refugees with post-traumatic stress disorder in Denmark: a panacea to person-centered care?	Many refugees suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), influenced by traumatic experiences and post-migration stressors, including unemployment. This complexity calls for person-centered care (PCC) and interprofessional collaboration across sectors. In this qualitative study we aimed to understand what refugees and professionals from two sectors value about participating in cross-sector network meetings to coordinate and agree on shared plans for PTSD treatment and assessing employability. We conducted interviews with 24 unemployed refugees, 10 physicians, and 20 municipal employment case workers. Results from our thematic analysis demonstrated that all participants appreciated the value of coordinating care and agreeing on next steps. However, the meetings were not void of power dynamics. The refugees valued the physicians being health advocates and preferred the physicians to explain mental health challenges. Equally, the employment case workers looked to the physicians to validate the experiences of the refugees. The physicians thus played a central role in helping refugee patients and employment case workers come to a mutual understanding and way forward. Our results suggest that interprofessional collaboration across sectors supports PCC by fostering trust-building and holistic understanding. However, PCC is also challenged by interprofessional collaboration due to the validated information and documentation required by organizational practices.

40223799	Bioselective agglutination induced nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement.	Nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement (nanoDLD) is a microfluidic-based size separation technique allowing separation of subcellular biological particles such as double-stranded DNA and extracellular vesicles. Although there has been extensive study of the separation mechanism, across several applications, a systematic study of migration angle shift due to aggregation has not been done. A bead-based immunoassay is developed to aggregate and separate in the presence of a target protein. The results show that the system effectively separates particles, shows bioselectivity, and allows for the detection of target proteins. We demonstrate the agglutination model can be used to explain the migration angle of the aggregation process as a function of antibody and antigen concentrations.
40223798	Exciton-phonon coupling in quasi-two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites: impact of a mixed-phase structure.	Two-dimensional (2D) metal halide perovskites (MHPs) hold great potential for optoelectronic and spintronic device applications due to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. In this study, we conducted a systematic temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) investigation to elucidate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering on the optoelectronic properties of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites, (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>SNH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>Pb<sub><i>n</i></sub>I<sub>3<i>n</i>+1</sub> (<i>n</i> = 1-4). The results from our micro-PL study suggest that the optical band gap of each 2D phase (a perovskite with a specific number of inorganic layers, <i>n</i>) varies with temperature due to thermal lattice expansion and exciton-phonon interactions. The strength of exciton-phonon interactions differs in each 2D phase within a mixed-phase sample, with a notable increase as the layer number (<i>n</i>) rises. This enhancement is attributed to greater lattice mismatch, increased interface complexity, and a higher degree of disorder within the system. Additionally, we found that parameters such as exciton-phonon coupling strength and exciton binding energy exhibit significantly different behaviours across various mixed-phase perovskite samples, likely due to changes in the local environment around excitons in each specific phase. These findings offer valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying nonradiative processes and scattering phenomena and provide guidance for optimizing the efficiency of 2D-RP mixed-phase perovskite-based optoelectronic and spintronic devices.
40223797	Field-Free Current-Induced Magnetization Switching of a Room-Temperature van der Waals Magnet for Neuromorphic Computing.	Spin orbit torque (SOT) has become a promising approach to manipulating magnetization switching. The high-quality interface is essentially desired for SOT performance, which is readily acquired by two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials. Recently, a 2D ferromagnetic material, Fe<sub>3</sub>GaTe<sub>2</sub>, has been discovered to possess an above-room-temperature Curie temperature and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, providing an excellent candidate to build spintronic devices. On the other hand, an external magnetic field is necessary for the SOT-driven deterministic switching, hindering the real applications. Here, we realize field-free SOT switching of Fe<sub>3</sub>GaTe<sub>2</sub> at room temperature. Moreover, inspired by the superiority of 2D materials in 3D heterogeneous integration, we explore the potential in the computing in memory. The artificial synapse function is studied and used in the convolutional neural network, achieving a high-accuracy (∼92.8%) pattern recognition. Our work paves the way for magnetic memory and neuromorphic computing.
40223796	Activated immune infiltrates expand opportunities for targeted therapy in p53-abnormal endometrial carcinoma.	Tumor protein p53 mutated/abnormal (p53abn) endometrial carcinomas account for over 50% of deaths but comprise only 15% of all endometrial carcinomas. Most patients show limited response to standard-of-care chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, and only a minority of cases are amenable to targeted therapies like poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and HER2-directed therapies. Recent immunotherapy clinical trials have demonstrated remarkable efficacy, not only in mismatch repair deficient (MMRd) tumors but also in a subset of mismatch repair-proficient (MMRp) tumors. However, the immune microenvironment and its relationship to other therapeutic targets in MMRp endometrial carcinoma remains poorly understood. Here, we characterize the immune microenvironment of p53abn endometrial carcinoma, the most clinically aggressive subtype of MMRp endometrial carcinoma, and correlate antitumor immune signatures with other targetable alterations. We accrued 256 treatment-naïve p53abn endometrial carcinomas and systemically profiled T-cell, B-cell, myeloid, and tumor-cell populations with multiplex immunofluorescence to assess the tissue localization and functional status of immune cells. Shallow whole-genome sequencing was performed on a subset of 126 cases. Patterns of immune infiltration were compared to survival outcomes and mutational signatures. Mixture modeling divided p53abn endometrial carcinoma into tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-rich and TIL-poor subsets. Over 50% of tumors were TIL-rich. TIL-rich cases overexpressed targetable immune evasion molecules and were associated with longer overall and disease-specific survival in multivariate analysis. This effect was particularly pronounced in advanced stage disease and in patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. TIL did not associate with homologous recombination deficient mutational signatures or HER2 amplification. Our findings demonstrate a biological rationale for immunotherapy in a substantial subset of patients with p53abn endometrial cancer and may help inform combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibition, PARP inhibitors, and anti-HER2 agents. © 2025 The Author(s).

40223795	Mepitel Film Versus StrataXRT in Managing Radiation Dermatitis in an Intra-Patient Controlled Clinical Trial of 80 Postmastectomy Patients.	Mepitel film decreases the severity of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients, but its application is resource-intensive. Many departments therefore use StrataXRT, a gel that patients apply themselves. We compared the protective effects of Mepitel film and StrataXRT on radiation dermatitis during and immediately after radiation therapy.
40223793	The Effect of Work Environment and Work-Related Characteristics on Perceived Individual Work Performance of Front-Line Nurse Managers: A Cross-Sectional Study.	This study aimed to examine the effect of work environment and work-related characteristics of front-line nurse managers on their perceived individual work performance. It was conducted between March and May of 2022 with 219 front-line nurse managers working in a private chain hospital group in Türkiye. The Nurse Manager Practice Environment Scale and the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation analysis, and generalized linear model regression analysis were used in data analysis. A positive correlation was found between the scores obtained from the two scales (r = 0.453; p < 0.001). Regression analysis revealed that two independent variables-nurse manager's work environment and duration of managerial experience-predicted nurse managers' perceived individual work performance level, with these variables explaining 28.1% of the total variance. Results showed that a favorable work environment and four or more years of managerial experience enhanced the perceived individual performance of front-line nurse managers. These findings suggest that to improve the individual work performance of front-line nurse managers, their work environment must also be improved. In addition, retention strategies that target experienced front-line nurse managers are critical to maintaining high levels of performance.

40223791	A portable paper-based sensor for simultaneous determination of sodium and potassium ions in the human plasma matrix.	Accurate determination of sodium and potassium ions in biological fluids is crucial for managing various health conditions, as these electrolytes play a vital role in regulating physiological processes and maintaining overall well-being. A low-cost portable paper-based sensor has been developed for the simultaneous determination of sodium and potassium in the human plasma matrix. It comprises three electrodes on a single paper substrate: a solid-state polyvinyl butyral reference electrode, a sodium selective electrode and a potassium selective electrode. The sensor utilizes conductive functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes, selective ionophores and dyes to enhance sensing capabilities. It demonstrates high selectivity for sodium and potassium ions, with a linear range of 10<sup>-6</sup> to 10<sup>-2</sup> M and a Nernstian response (slopes of 59.08 ± 0.32 and 59.15 ± 0.28 mV per decade for sodium and potassium, respectively). The sensor provides a reproducible stable potential over 180 days and a dynamic response time of 10 s. The described paper-based sensor is an excellent tool for point-of-care analysis of sodium and potassium imbalances due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness and disposability. It provides fast and reliable determination of sodium and potassium ions in the human plasma matrix, making it a valuable tool for managing their imbalances in clinical settings.
40223790	Exploring the gas sensing performances of O-functionalized TiVC MXene: mechanistic insights from computations.	The detection of toxic gases remains a critical challenge for environmental safety, and MXenes have rapidly emerged as innovative materials for sensor development. In this work, we break new ground by exploring the sensing capabilities of O-functionalized TiVC MXene, a material not yet studied for gas sensing applications. <i>Ab initio</i> molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations confirm the monolayer's dynamical stability at 300 K. Using first-principles-based DFT calculations, we systematically analyze the interaction of H<sub>2</sub>, CO, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> gas analytes with the TiVCO<sub>2</sub> surface. Our study highlights key parameters such as adsorption strength, charge transfer, change in work function, and gas desorption time, critical to sensitivity and selectivity-core elements of the 4-S principle (sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and speed). The robust interaction energies (≤-48 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>), short interaction distances, and significant charge transfer suggest that NO adsorption on TiVCO<sub>2</sub> is characterized by strong physisorption, governed by hybridization of the 3d-orbitals of titanium and vanadium with the p-orbital of nitrogen. Notably, the change in work function upon interaction comes out to be >0.1 eV and the calculated desorption time of NO at 300 K is 1.74 s, making this MXene a highly promising candidate for NO gas detection at room temperature. Other gases exhibited much weaker physisorption with nanosecond desorption times, reinforcing the selective nature of TiVCO<sub>2</sub> for NO detection. These findings offer insights into the use of O-functionalized TiVC MXene for gas sensors, with the potential to revolutionize the design of high-performance sensing devices in environmental monitoring and industrial applications.
40223789	Factors Associated With Intent to Leave the Nursing Profession in the United States: An Integrative Review.	The ongoing regional nursing shortages in the United States, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, compromise patient safety and quality. Additionally, an aging workforce coupled with an aging population requiring more nursing care services limits organizations' ability to adequately staff their facilities. Nurses' turnover from the profession has been studied less than organizational turnover, thus, the purpose of this integrative review is to identify factors associated with intention to leave the nursing profession in the United States. Using Whittemore and Knafl's (2005) guidelines for integrative review methods, we conducted systematic searches in CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science in July 2024. There were 39 peer-reviewed studies that met inclusion criteria. Synthesis of findings resulted in four individual and four work-level themes associated with intent to leave the nursing profession. Individual themes included individual beliefs, health and wellbeing, individual work experiences, and career stability. Work-level themes included job characteristics, job demands/workload, resources and support, and work environment. Notably, job-level factors (i.e., workload, work environment, and support) were associated with professional turnover intention, which suggests that nurses do not believe their experiences will improve at another nursing job. Gaps in the literature include studies with nationally representative samples, studies using validated measures of health, and qualitative studies conducted with the aim of understanding why nurses want to leave the profession. To promote retention of nurses at the professional and organizational level, organizations should measure and modify relevant job-level factors, and the protection of nurses' wellness should be a top organizational priority.
40223786	Development and pilot-testing of an app to complement trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy for adolescents.	<b>Background:</b> Apps have the potential to support psychological treatments by providing psychoeducation, increasing homework compliance, and generalizing therapeutic skills outside of sessions. However, there are few apps developed to support specific evidence-based treatment for PTSD for adolescents.<b>Objective:</b> This paper shares experiences developing an app to complement Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). It also describes adolescents' and therapists' perceived usefulness and the potential effect of the app 'My everyday life' on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS).<b>Methods:</b> We did a needs assessment with adolescents, therapists, and TF-CBT trainers, followed by programming and beta-testing. We carried out a mixed methods study of 59 adolescent patients (aged 13-18 years) and their therapists. Using a triangulation design, we combined quantitative data on app use and changes in PTSS with qualitative data from interviews with 10 adolescents and 10 therapists who described their experiences with the app.<b>Results:</b> The app includes psychoeducation, mental health self-monitoring, coping tools, and goal-setting functionality. The most used features were psychoeducation and breathing exercises. Few therapists actively used the monitoring progress feature. Both adolescents and therapists found the app beneficial for everyday use, though some therapists were unsure about how to integrate it with TF-CBT. Adolescents reported significant PTSS improvement during TF-CBT with the app as a complement. Adolescents with post-treatment data (<i>n</i> = 13) did not report significantly different PTSD improvement compared to adolescents without access to app, but the study lacked power to draw strong conclusions.<b>Conclusions:</b> The app 'My everyday life' can be useful for adolescents receiving TF-CBT. The therapists may benefit from clearer guidelines on how to integrate apps with evidence-based treatments. Digital tools are a promising avenue for supporting the implementation of evidence-based treatment.
40223784	Dual magnetic behavior of an Fe(III)-dioxolene complex with tri-substituted catechol.	Magnetically bistable compounds attract considerable attention due to their possible applications in molecular electronics and spintronics devices. Of special interest are spin-crossover (SCO) systems that can interconvert between the low-spin and high-spin states leading to switching of the magnetic properties. Synthesis and comprehensive characterization of a family of ionic ferric-dioxolene complexes [(TPA)Fe(HO-DBCat)]ClO<sub>4</sub> (1), [(TPA)Fe(NO<sub>2</sub>-DBCat)]ClO<sub>4</sub> (2) and [(TPA)Fe(MeOCH<sub>2</sub>-DBCat)]ClO<sub>4</sub> (3) (TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine; HO-DBCat = dianion of 4,6-di-<i>tert</i>-butyl-1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene, NO<sub>2</sub>-DBCat = dianion of 4,6-di-<i>tert</i>-butyl-3-nitro-1,2-dihydroxybenzene and MeOCH<sub>2</sub>-DBCat = dianion of 4,6-di-<i>tert</i>-butyl-3-methoxymethyl-1,2-dihydroxybenzene) are reported. Variable temperature structural, magnetic and spectral analyses revealed that compounds 1-3 undergo a thermally induced SCO in the solid state between the high-spin (<i>S</i> = 5/2) and low-spin (<i>S</i> = 1/2) states. Alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated that the nitro-substituted complex 2 shows a field supported slow magnetic relaxation in the low-spin state at 5000 Oe. Such duality of magnetic properties makes complex 2 the first ferric compound which demonstrates a complete <i>S</i> = 5/2 → <i>S</i> = 1/2 SCO with a single molecule magnet behavior (SMM, <i>S</i> = 1/2). Electronic structures and magnetic properties of 1, 2 and 3 were investigated with the aid of DFT and SA-CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations.
40223783	Valorization of Apple Pomace: Production of Phloretin Using a Bacterial Cellulose-Immobilized β-Glycosidase.	In the last decade, phloretin (PHL) has attracted increasing attention due to its remarkable biological properties, including antimicrobial, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects, becoming a leading ingredient in the cosmetic sector. In this work, an efficient, cost-effective and highly-productive biocatalytic strategy for the preparation of natural PHL has been developed starting from its glycosylated form phloridzin (PHZ), one of the main flavonoid components of apple processing waste (apple pomace). The process involved the use of the extremophilic β-glycosidase AHeGH1 immobilized on bacterial cellulose films in a two-liquid phase reaction system (water/2,2,5,5-tetramethyloxolane), allowing for the complete conversion of 5 g/L of substrate in 7 h of reaction (molar conversion >99%; isolated yield 95%). Since all the materials used in the biotransformation have been recovered and recycled (i.e., solvents, aqueous phase, catalyst), this system can be considered a zero-waste reaction. Interestingly, a further leap forward in the overall bioprocess sustainability was achieved by producing bacterial cellulose, the support for enzyme immobilization, by fermentation of apple pomace. This allows for a biocatalytic process where both the substrate and the immobilization carrier derive from the same feedstock.
40223782	Cyclen-based lipidoids for mRNA delivery and immunotherapy.	As mRNA vaccines continue to gain widespread attention, the development of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), as the preferred platform for mRNA delivery, has become a key focus of research. 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen), with its excellent protonation capability and ease of modification, has emerged as a promising candidate for the ionizable head group of lipid materials. In this study, a series of cyclen-based lipidoids with different linkages and hydrophobic tails was designed and conveniently synthesized. Structure-activity relationship studies were performed to screen out the carriers capable of efficient mRNA delivery and with potential for tumor therapeutic applications. <i>In vivo</i> biodistribution experiments in mice revealed that the lipidoid OEs-K, containing both hydroxyl and ester groups in its linkage, exhibited high mRNA delivery efficiency and lymph node-targeting properties. Using a subcutaneous EG.7-OVA tumor model in mice, the delivery of tumor antigen OVA mRNA using the lipidoid material was evaluated for its antitumor immunotherapeutic potential. Results demonstrated that LNPs formulated with OEs-K promoted dendritic cell uptake in lymph nodes, effectively activated immune responses, and inhibited tumor growth. Hematological and histopathological evaluations indicated no significant toxicity to the body. This study provides insights into the design and development of carrier materials for mRNA vaccines.
40223780	Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Bortezomib: Enhanced Antitumor Efficacy and Tumor Accumulation in Breast Cancer Therapy.	Nanoparticle albumin-bound (NAB) formulations are emerging as a viable strategy for the intravenous delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. This study aims to improve the therapeutic profile of Bortezomib (BTZ), addressing its low solubility and significant systemic toxicity through the development of NAB-BTZ nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited an average size of 296.47 ± 10 nm and a high drug encapsulation efficiency of 75%, and a drug loading of 10%. NAB-BTZ displayed a controlled, pH-sensitive release profile, with 59% release at pH 5.4 (mimicking tumor environments) and 46% at pH 7.4 after 12 h. In vitro assays demonstrated that NAB-BTZ significantly reduced the viability of 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, increasing late apoptosis from 6% to 54% after 48 h, compared to 24% for free BTZ. At molecular level, NAB-BTZ induced apoptosis by upregulating p53 and Bax, downregulating Bcl-2, and activating caspases 3 and 7. In vivo tests in a murine 4T1 breast cancer model showed that NAB-BTZ substantially inhibited tumor growth, achieving an average tumor volume of 916 mm<sup>3</sup> by day 31 versus 1400 mm<sup>3</sup> for free BTZ, leading to an improved survival rate of 100% compared to 83% in the BTZ group. Technetium-99m (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) labeling and SPECT imaging confirmed enhanced targeting capability, showing preferential accumulation of NAB-BTZ in tumor sites compared to free BTZ. These findings suggest that NAB-BTZ not only improves antitumor efficacy but also enhances its safety profile, underscoring its clinical potential in breast cancer therapy.

40223776	Chirality in metal-based antimicrobial agents: a growing frontier in biomedical research.	Chirality is increasingly being recognised as a valuable tool in the design of novel metal complexes aimed at combating antimicrobial resistance. Chiral metal complexes possess unique spatial configurations that enable selective interactions with biological targets, providing innovative solutions for treating diseases such as cancer and antimicrobial-resistant infections. Although the relationship between the chirality of metal complexes and their antimicrobial activity was initially highlighted by Dwyer and collaborators in a seminal mid-20th-century study, subsequent research exploring this intriguing relationship has been limited. The few documented cases of enantiomer-dependent biocidal activity are mainly limited to a series of chiral silver complexes recently investigated by our group and the Nomiya research team, which demonstrate enhanced antimicrobial efficacy of specific enantiomers.
40223775	Elongated Magnetic Nanorobots with Multi-Enzymatic Cascades for Active In Vivo Tumor Targeting and Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy.	Targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to malignant tissues is crucial for enhancing clinical outcomes and reducing side effects. Magnetic nanorobots (MNRs) present a promising strategy for controlled delivery, leveraging external magnetic fields to achieve precise in vivo targeting. This work develops elongated MNRs comprising linearly arranged magnetic nanoparticles linked by metal-polyphenol complexes (MPCs) for magnetic-field-directed active tumor targeting and synergistic tumor therapy. The MNRs are created by assembling 30 nm Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles, tannic acid, and ferrous ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) under a uniform magnetic field, resulting in elongated chain-like structures fixed by MPCs, which also promotes peroxidase-like activity. These structures show a greater magnetic response than individual nanoparticles, offering flexibility in magnetic manipulation. The MPCs coating allows tailored surface modifications with glucose oxidase, copper ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>), and human serum albumin (HSA), producing colloidally stable MNRs with a built-in multienzymatic cascade (MNRs@GOx/Cu/HSA) that consumes glucose, generates <sup>•</sup>OH, and depletes the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Collectively, surface-engineered multifunctional MNRs demonstrate improved in vivo tumor targeting driven by external magnetic fields, leading to efficient localized chemodynamic therapy. The tailored structural and functional properties of the developed MNRs render them suitable for targeted cargo delivery, minimally invasive surgery, and localized treatments in disease sites.
40223774	Theoretical understanding of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction products on nitrogen-doped graphene supported dual-atom catalysts.	In recent years, nitrogen-doped graphene supported dual-atom catalysts (DAC@NC) for the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR) have attracted widespread research interest. Although some DAC structures for deep reduction C<sub>1</sub> products and C<sub>2</sub> products have been proposed in previous theoretical calculations, the desired products are still difficult to be realized in experiments. This work systematically investigates the reaction pathways and products of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction on bimetallic DAC@NC (M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>2</sub>@NC, M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub> = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt) by first-principles calculations. After excluding improper M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>2</sub>@NC due to catalyst poisoning and hydrogen evolution competition, C-C coupling processes always have much higher free-energy increments than the corresponding hydrogenation, making it difficult to form multi-carbon structures. For most of the C<sub>1</sub> intermediates on M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>2</sub>@NC, the free-energy increments of C-C coupling are higher than 0.8 eV. Some C<sub>1</sub> intermediates could couple with a second carbon, but this process is much more difficult than hydrogenation toward C<sub>1</sub> products. This work reveals why C<sub>2</sub> products are still difficult to be achieved for the CO<sub>2</sub>RR on M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>2</sub>@NC and identifies the M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>2</sub> combinations for deep reduction C<sub>1</sub> products (methane and methanol), which is inspiring for the future design of CO<sub>2</sub>RR catalysts.
40223773	Smart SPIONs for Multimodal Cancer Theranostics: A Review.	Despite significant advancements in anticancer research, the performance statistics of current therapeutic regimens yield unsatisfactory outcomes. Issues such as high metastasis rates, drug resistance, limited efficacy, and severe side effects underscore the urgent need for safer and more effective strategies for tumor mitigation. One promising approach lies in the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for hybridized cancer therapy, leveraging their unique properties and functional versatility to enhance treatment efficacy and safety. They can serve as platforms for various therapeutic as well as diagnostic applications, enhancing imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging. This paper presents an in-depth compilation of the application of nanoparticulate SPIONs amalgamates for multimodal cancer therapeutics. Physical phenomena such as light, heat, sound, and magnetism can be coupled to nanoparticulate delivery systems for developing targeted, precision medicine against cancer. Integration of noninvasive and effective platforms technologies such as photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, magnetic hyperthermia, and sonodynamic therapy hold great promise in counteracting the daunting challenges within cancer therapeutics.
40223771	Association Between Urodynamic Findings and Urinary Retention After Onabotulinumtoxin A for Idiopathic Overactive Bladder.	Onabotulinumtoxin A (BTX-A) is a minimally invasive therapy for idiopathic overactive bladder (iOAB). Incomplete bladder emptying is a known risk of the procedure, with an overall rate as high as 20% in male and female patients. Risk factors for incomplete bladder emptying after BTX-A have been reported in the literature, but are widely variable amongst studies and therefore patients at increased risk of this adverse effect cannot easily be identified by clinicians. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pre-procedure urodynamics (UDS) findings are associated with incomplete bladder emptying after intradetrusor BTX-A injection for iOAB.
40223768	Behavioral impairments in a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome associated with dopaminergic and neuroinflammatory modulations.	Kabuki syndrome is a rare multisystem congenital disorder characterized by specific facial malformations and several other symptoms, including motor impairments, increased susceptibility to infections, immune mediators' deficits, anxiety, and stereotyped behaviors. Considering the reports of motor impairments in Kabuki syndrome patients, the first hypothesis of the present study was that this motor dysfunction was a consequence of striatal dopaminergic modulation. The second hypothesis was that the peripheral immune system dysfunctions were a consequence of neuroinflammatory processes. To study these hypotheses the mutant <i>bapa</i> mouse was used as it is a validated experimental model of Kabuki syndrome.
40223767	Synthesis of Axially Chiral Compounds via Transition Metal-Catalyzed Atroposelective C-H Functionalization.	ConspectusAxially chiral skeletons are prevalent in natural products and biologically important compounds, and they are widely utilized as privileged scaffolds in enantioselective catalysis. Consequently, the catalytic atroposelective synthesis of enantiopure atropisomers has garnered considerable attention. A variety of synthetic strategies involving metal catalysis or organocatalysis have been developed. Among these elegant approaches, transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective C-H activation has emerged as an atom- and step-economical strategy to streamline the construction of axially chiral compounds in recent years.In this Account, we discuss our efforts in the atroposelective synthesis of different types of axially chiral compounds, including biaryls, atropisomeric styrenes, and C-N atropisomers, via transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective C-H activation strategies. To this end, we have developed several approaches, including the chiral transient directing group (<i>c</i>TDG) strategy using catalytic Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub> and <i>tert</i>-leucine (Tle), as well as catalytic enantioselective systems involving Pd(II)/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), Pd(II)/l-pyroglutamic acid (<i>p</i>Glu), Pd(0)/norbornene cooperative catalysis with a chiral biimidazoline (BiIM) ligand, and Co(II)/salicyloxazoline (Salox).At the outset, we successfully applied the <i>c</i>TDG strategy to access axially chiral biaryl aldehydes through Pd-catalyzed atroposelective C-H olefination, alkynylation, allylation, naphthylation, and alkylation. The efficacy of these methods has been demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of chiral aldehyde catalysts and natural products, such as TAN-1085, (+)-isochizandrin, and (+)-steganone. To facilitate the synthesis of biaryl atropisomers with diverse functionalities, we developed a novel Pd(II)/CPA catalytic system, which enables the preparation of various axially chiral quinolines, biaryl-2-amines, and atropisomeric biaryls bearing chalcogenoether units with high enantioselectivities. The Pd(II)/CPA system also allows for the synthesis of more challenging conjugated diene-based axially chiral styrenes.Nonbiaryl atropisomers, such as axially chiral styrenes and anilides, present synthetic challenges due to their conformational instability and higher degree of rotational freedom compared to their biaryl counterparts. We have addressed these challenges and achieved the highly efficient synthesis of atropisomeric styrenes and anilides using Pd(II)/<i>p</i>Glu and Pd(0)/norbornene/BiIM catalysis. In addition to palladium catalysis, cobalt(II)/Salox catalysis has also been developed for the construction of chiral biaryls, atropisomers with vicinal C-N and C-C stereogenic axes, remote distinct C-N diaxes, and chiral calix[4]arenes featuring both inherent and axial chirality. We anticipate that the enantioselective C-H activation strategy will find broad applications in the construction of synthetically useful axially chiral compounds.
40223766	Rate constants and Arrhenius parameters for H-atom abstraction from Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH by the 2,2-dimethylvinyl radical in PhMe. Kinetic evidence for an entirely free radical mechanism for the O-directed hydrostannation of alkynols with stannanes and Et<sub>3</sub>B/O<sub>2</sub>.	Using the 2,2-dimethylvinyl radical 6 as a horological calibrant for the α-cyclopropyl-β-tributylstannylvinyl radicals 2a and 13 in PhMe, the <i>k</i> values and Arrhenius parameters for their cyclopropane ring-openings have been estimated by competition kinetics over a 293-353 K temperature range. The high log <i>A</i> values (14.95 and 14.55) for these reactions only satisfactorily align with a unimolecular, β-scissive, E<sub>H</sub>1 radical ring-opening being rate-determining, and the radicals 3a (R = Bu) and 14 undergoing H-atom abstraction from the stannane to give 4a and 15. The log <i>A</i> data for these two reactions only endorse a totally free radical mechanism for the O-directed free radical hydrostannation of dialkyl acetylenes with stannanes and Et<sub>3</sub>B/O<sub>2</sub>. An estimated <i>k</i><sub>H-atom abstraction Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH PhMe 293 K</sub> of 1.96 × 10<sup>8</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> is proposed for 6 in PhMe, along with an estimated <i>k</i><sub>H-atom abstraction Ph<sub>3</sub>SnH PhMe 293 K</sub> of 1.36 × 10<sup>9</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

40223764	A Scoping Review of Evidence-Based Grief Interventions for Parentally Bereaved Children: Comparing Individual, Group, and Family Approaches.	This scoping review examines and compares the effectiveness of different intervention formats for parentally bereaved children by focusing on three therapeutic formats: individual, group, and family-based approaches. Using the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we analyzed ten peer-reviewed quantitative studies published between 2010 and 2022. This study emphasizes formal interventions with measurable outcomes, excluding creative or symbolic approaches such as art and ritual-based therapies. This review highlights that individual interventions, particularly cognitive-behavioural techniques, significantly reduce critical deficits such as prolonged grief disorder and PTSD symptoms. Group approaches foster social connection and emotional regulation, while family interventions emphasize improved family communication and caregiver support. Notable limitations include small sample sizes, heterogeneity in program structure, and reliance on self-reported outcomes. Future research should explore diverse grief experiences, longer-term impacts, and cultural considerations. This review provides insights into tailoring interventions to the unique needs of bereaved children, aiding practitioners in selecting evidence-based approaches.

40223758	Patterns of father responsiveness to child distress and children's socioemotional outcomes.	This study utilized a novel, observational paradigm to identify functional patterns of father responsiveness to child distress. In particular, we sought to identify a pattern of caregiving deactivation characterized by parenting behavior that functioned to minimize activation of the caregiving behavioral system. We also sought to identify a pattern of caregiving hyperactivation characterized by parenting behavior that functioned to maintain or heighten caregiving system activation. In turn, we examined whether caregiving deactivation and hyperactivation were differentially associated with children's socioemotional development over a two-year period. Participants included 235 fathers (55% White) and children (M<sub>age</sub> = 2.97; 55% female) who visited the laboratory at two measurement occasions spaced approximately two years apart. A path model analysis revealed that caregiving deactivation was uniquely associated with decreases in children's oppositional defiance and hostility over a two-year period. In contrast, caregiving hyperactivation was uniquely associated with increases in children's anxiety and social disengagement two years later. The findings highlight the importance of considering both form and function in parenting behavior and provide evidence on the importance of considering fathers' caregiving behavior.
40223756	The association between parenting quality and offspring's biological aging evaluated by telomere length: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	There is widespread agreement that offspring are shaped by the parenting they receive in early childhood. This development is intertwined with offspring's biological functioning, evidenced by their telomeres length (TL)-a key biomarker of aging. Until recently, most studies have focused on the detrimental implications of negative parenting for offspring's TL. Contemporary research is oriented toward exploring the possible resilience-promoting effect of positive parenting on the biological aging of the offspring. We conducted a meta-analysis synthesizing the findings regarding the association between parenting quality and offspring's TL. It examines whether positive parenting delays aging processes and whether such processes are exacerbated by exposure to negative parenting. An analysis of 15 studies (<i>k</i> = 23; <i>N</i> = 3,599, <i>M</i> <sub><i>mean cohort's age</i></sub> = 15.5, SD = 17.5) revealed a significant association between positive parenting and offspring's longer TL (<i>r</i> = .16, 95% CI [.11, .20]). Negative parenting was associated with an increased risk of TL erosion (<i>r</i> = -.17, 95% CI [-.28, -.06]). Moreover, this negative association became more robust as offspring grew older (<i>β</i> = -.01, <i>p</i> < .001). Future investigations would benefit from probing associations between parental quality and offspring's development. Interventions fostering positive parenting might also scaffold these biological processes.
40223753	Tapwater exposures, residential risk, and mitigation in a PFAS-impacted-groundwater community.	Tapwater (TW) safety and sustainability are priorities in the United States. Per/polyfluoroalkyl substance(s) (PFAS) contamination is a growing public-health concern due to prolific use, widespread TW exposures, and mounting human-health concerns. Historically-rural, actively-urbanizing communities that rely on surficial-aquifer private wells incur elevated risks of unrecognized TW exposures, including PFAS, due to limited private-well monitoring and contaminant-source proliferation in urbanizing landscapes. Here, a broad-analytical-scope TW-assessment was conducted in a hydrologically-vulnerable, Mississippi River alluvial-island community, where PFAS contamination of the shallow-alluvial drinking-water aquifer has been documented, but more comprehensive contaminant characterization to inform decision-making is currently lacking. In 2021, we analyzed 510 organics, 34 inorganics, and 3 microbial groups in 11 residential and community locations to assess (1) TW risks beyond recognized PFAS issues, (2) day-to-day and year-to-year risk variability, and (3) suitability of the underlying sandstone aquifer as an alternative source to mitigate TW-PFAS exposures. Seventy-six organics and 25 inorganics were detected. Potential human-health risks of detected TW exposures were explored based on cumulative benchmark-based toxicity quotients (<i>∑</i><sub>TQ</sub>). Elevated risks (<i>∑</i><sub>TQ</sub> ≥ 1) from organic and inorganic contaminants were observed in all alluvial-aquifer-sourced synoptic samples but not in sandstone-aquifer-sourced samples. Repeated sampling at 3 sites over 52-55 h indicated limited variability in risk over the short-term. Comparable PFAS-specific <i>∑</i><sub>TQ</sub> for spatial-synoptic, short-term (3 days) temporal, and long-term (3 years quarterly) temporal samples indicated that synoptic results provided useful insight into the risks of TW-PFAS exposures at French Island over the long-term. No PFAS detections in sandstone-aquifer-sourced samples over a 3 year period indicated no PFAS-associated risk and supported the sandstone aquifer as an alternative drinking-water source to mitigate community TW-PFAS exposures. This study illustrated the importance of expanded contaminant monitoring of private-well TW, beyond known concerns (in this case, PFAS), to reduce the risks of a range of unrecognized contaminant exposures.

Notably, their quaternized salts exhibited green emission with unexpectedly high quantum yields and mega-large Stokes shift and were successfully used for mitochondrial imaging.
40223751	Biological impact of meniscus injury on post-traumatic osteoarthritis.	Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a common and debilitating problem following meniscal injury, which may lead to pain, loss of function, and early joint failure. Over the past 25 years, clinical, laboratory, and translational studies have greatly improved our understanding of PTOA pathogenesis and prevention. Clinical studies have established the benefit of meniscal preservation in preventing PTOA, leading to a significant increase in meniscus repair. Similarly, improved understanding of the biomechanical importance of the meniscal root attachment has increased focus on the detection and treatment of meniscal root injuries. Laboratory studies have demonstrated a preliminary mechanistic pathway of PTOA development following meniscal injury, whereby injury and altered joint loading stimulate a pro-inflammatory response that leads to both articular cartilage breakdown and impaired meniscal healing. In vitro evidence suggests that mechanical loading of the meniscus may ameliorate this catabolic response, with implications for treatment and rehabilitation protocols. Numerous animal models have emerged, allowing for in vivo assessment of PTOA initiation and offering a platform to test potential therapeutic targets. Despite these advances, meniscal repair remains imperfect and is not always possible, and investigations translating laboratory findings to the human setting have been limited. Future directions include further characterizing the immune and cellular responses to meniscal injury, investigating therapies to target the pro-inflammatory cascade and enhance meniscal healing, and developing new models to better distinguish PTOA pathogenesis in human subjects. Continued laboratory, translational, and clinical research efforts are required to identify treatment strategies to reduce the burden of PTOA after meniscal injury.
40223750	Tricetin, a Dietary Flavonoid, Alleviates Neuroinflammation and Promotes Autophagy in Alzheimer's Disease by Regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among older adults, significantly impairs behavioral and cognitive functions, posing a severe threat to patients' health and quality of life. The Tricetin (TRN), a natural flavonoid found in wheat, pomegranate, and eucalyptus honey, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and neuroprotective properties. However, its role in the context of AD has not been previously explored. This study investigated the antineuroinflammatory and autophagic protective effects of TRN in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 cells and <sub>D</sub>-galactose/sodium nitrite/aluminum chloride (<sub>D</sub>-gal/NaNO<sub>2</sub>/AlCl<sub>3</sub>)-induced AD mice. The RNA sequencing examined the underlying mechanisms by which TRN ameliorates AD-related pathologies. Our research findings revealed that TRN significantly improved memory and mobility in AD mice, reduced Aβ deposition, and inhibited Tau protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, TRN regulated enzyme activities and reduced pathological markers associated with AD. Moreover, it modulated inflammatory mediators, inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in LPS-induced BV2 cells, and exerted anti-inflammatory and autophagic protective effects via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, TRN demonstrated robust neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo AD models by regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. These findings highlight its potential as a promising therapeutic agent for treating AD.
40223749	Tunable Plasmochromic Devices Using Gold Nanoislands Integrated with an Electropolymerized Organic Semiconductor.	The need for the reversible and on-demand reconfiguration of local surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) has driven the emerging field of active plasmonics. The overwhelming majority of electrochromic-polymer-mediated active plasmonic nanostructures consist of lithographically fabricated nanoarrays or colloidal nanoparticles embedded in conductive polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI). Herein, we introduce the semiconducting polymer poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3MT) as a novel tunable dielectric medium for active plasmon control. Likewise, we employ thermally dewetted gold nanoislands (AuNIs) as scalable, cost-effective, and robust plasmonic nanostructures. To date, active plasmonic devices based on P3MT or thermally dewetted nanostructures have yet to be explored. Active plasmonic devices consisting of AuNIs coated with ultrathin 12-15 nm P3MT shells were fabricated and tested. Modulation between reduced and oxidized P3MT resulted in a reversible average LSPR modulation of 22 nm, which compares to or even outperforms other electrochromic polymers at similar shell thicknesses. The plasmochromic performance of P3MT-coated Au nanoislands with various LSPRs and size distributions was evaluated in terms of modulation depth, response time, reversibility, chromaticity, and stability. Cyclic stability measurements reveal that plasmonic shifts can still be observed after 1000 cycles of repeated modulation. This work not only expands the current roster of tunable dielectric media and plasmonic nanostructures for use in active plasmonics but also lays the foundation for next-generation active plasmonic technologies such as tunable organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic photodiodes (OPDs), and plasmonic field-effect transistors (FETs).
40223746	Root-sparing valve replacement in a prefabricated KONECT RESILIA aortic valved conduit.	The KONECT RESILIA aortic valved conduit is a prefabricated ready-to-implant composite biological Bentall graft manufactured by Edwards Lifesciences, first released for commercial distribution in July 2020. The goal of this product is to streamline the process of aortic root replacement and reduce the intraoperative time previously required to assemble a biological composite. One concern that has been raised about the use of this device is the need for potential root replacement in a reoperation for aortic valve degeneration. This video tutorial demonstrates the first reported aortic valve replacement in a prior KONECT composite graft while avoiding a complete root replacement.
40223745	Sodium butyrate attenuates experimental neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis by suppressing TLR4-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis.	Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a fatal intestinal disease in premature infants, and is characterized by intestinal inflammation and disruption of the intestinal barrier. The protective effects of sodium butyrate (NaB) against NEC have been documented, however, the underlying fundamental processes remain unknown. To address this deficit, we used the NEC neonatal rat model to confirm the intestinal protective effect of NaB. We then used network pharmacology and confirmed a role for NaB in the attenuation of NEC and this was associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome and the NF-κB signaling pathway. These results were verified by proteome analysis <i>in vivo</i>, and molecular docking analysis was used to explore the potential underlying mechanisms, revealing a suppressive function of NaB on NEC, which may be caused by its interaction with the TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. An <i>in vitro</i> cell model (LPS-stimulated IEC-6 cells) was then established to confirm the docking results. Results using assays involving the NLRP3 (MCC950) and TLR4 (TAK-242) inhibitors suggested that NaB protected intestinal cells from inflammatory injuries during NEC by suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB/NLRP3/cleaved caspase-1/GSDMD inflammasome pathway. These findings indicated that NaB can be used as a potential modulatory and therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NEC.
40223744	Ultrasensitive electroanalytical sensing platform using aptamer-conjugated V<sub>2</sub>CT<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene for the detection of the HER-2 biomarker.	Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women globally, with the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) serving as a vital biomarker for its diagnosis and management. In this study, an electrochemical aptasensor was developed using V<sub>2</sub>CT<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene for the sensitive and selective quantification of HER-2. The sensor's electrochemical performance was evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) that demonstrated a wide linear detection range of 1 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> to 100 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The aptasensor achieved an exceptional detection limit of 0.36 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and a quantification limit of 1.96 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> under optimized conditions. Furthermore, the sensor displayed excellent selectivity for HER-2 against other biomarkers and retained stability for 40 days, making it suitable for prolonged use. The high electrochemical response was attributed to the exceptional surface-to-volume ratio and conductivity of the V<sub>2</sub>CT<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene, enabling efficient aptamer immobilization and signal enhancement. These findings highlight the potential of the developed aptasensor as a non-invasive, reliable, and cost-effective platform for early HER-2 detection, paving the way for improved breast cancer diagnosis and monitoring.
40223743	Electron-deficient hemicryptophanes for the recognition of anions through anion-π interactions.	The selective recognition and encapsulation of anions are crucial in many biological and environmental processes. Anion-π interactions, characterized by attractive non-covalent interactions between anions and electron-deficient aromatic surfaces, have gained significant attention for their potential in anion binding. However, due to the weak nature of these interactions, receptors that rely solely on anion-π interactions are scarce. To promote anion binding <i>via</i> electron-deficient surfaces, we constructed a cavity within the hemicryptophane framework using tetrafluoroxylylene arms and a benzene triimide unit, thereby displaying multiple electron-deficient surfaces. Binding studies revealed that the electron-deficient receptor exhibits significantly higher anion binding constants compared to a less electron-deficient hemicryptophane. For example, the affinity for chloride (<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> = 207) is ten times higher for the most electron-deficient hemicryptophane. More impressive is the unique affinity for triiodide (<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> = 416), representing the first example of triiodide recognition by a BTI-based receptor. The enhanced binding properties of this receptor result from the combination of different π-acidic surfaces in a single cage molecule.
40223742	Mucus-Inspired Supramolecular Adhesives: Exploring the Synergy between Dynamic Networks and Functional Liquids.	The exceptional physicochemical and mechanical properties of mucus have inspired the development of dynamic mucus-based materials for a wide range of applications. Mucus's combination of noncovalent interactions and rich liquid phases confer a range of properties. This perspective explores the synergy between dynamic networks and functional liquids in mucus-inspired supramolecular adhesives. It delves into the biological principles underlying mucus's dynamic regulation and adhesive properties, the fundamentals of supramolecular adhesive design, and the transformative potential of these materials in biomedical applications. Finally, this perspective proposes potential directions for the molecular engineering of mucus-inspired supramolecular materials, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to harness their full potential for biomedical and sustainable applications.

40223740	Genetic variation in gut microbe as a key regulator of host social behavior in <i>C. elegans</i>.	Gut microbiota have been shown to influence the social behaviors of their hosts, while variations in host genetics can affect the composition of the microbiome. Nonetheless, the degree to which genetic variations in microbial populations impact host behavior, as well as any potential transgenerational effects, remains inadequately understood. Utilizing <i>C. elegans</i> as a model organism, we identified 77 strains of <i>E. coli</i> from a total of 3,983 mutants that significantly enhanced aggregation behavior through various neurobehavioral pathways. This discovery underscores a collaborative regulatory mechanism between microbial genetics and host behavior. Notably, we observed that some mutant bacteria might affect social behavior via the mitochondrial pathway. Additionally, the modulation of social behavior has been identified as a heritable trait in offspring. Our results provide a novel perspective on the regulatory role of microbial genetic variation in host behavior, which may have significant implications for human studies and the development of genetically engineered probiotics aimed at enhancing well-being across generations.
40223736	Molybdenum-modified ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> with a bifunctional cocatalyst for efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting under simulated sunlight.	Photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS) is a promising technique for sustainable hydrogen production that can potentially tackle the current energy and environmental challenges. As a visible-light-active photocatalyst, ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> is an ideal candidate for POWS; however, it exhibits low efficiency due to poor charge separation and improper surface reactions. Here, ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> was modified by doping Mo and depositing a bifunctional cocatalyst for efficient POWS under sunlight. Charge separation and photodeposition of Pt and CrO<sub><i>x</i></sub> were accelerated by Mo introduction to promote surface POWS reactions and suppress reverse reactions. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, the modified ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> achieved POWS with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.17% at 420 ± 20 nm and a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 0.016%. Theoretical calculations indicated that Mo dopants introduced spin-polarized states at both the conduction band bottom and the valence band top, which are spin-forbidden for charge recombination. This study served as a useful guideline for the design and development of efficient photocatalysts for sunlight-driven POWS.
40223735	Bumblebees increase their learning flight altitude in dense environments.	Bumblebees rely on visual memories acquired during the first outbound flights to relocate their nest. While these learning flights have been extensively studied in sparse environments with few objects, little is known about how bees adapt their flight in more dense, cluttered, settings that better mimic their natural habitats. Here we investigated how environmental complexity influences the first outbound flights of bumblebees. In a large arena we tracked the bees' 3D positions to examine the flight patterns, body orientations, and nest fixations across environmental conditions characterised by different object constellations around the nest entrance. In cluttered environments, bees prioritised altitude gain over horizontal distance, suggesting a strategy to overcome obstacles and visual clutter. Body orientation patterns became more diverse in dense environments, indicating a balance between nest-oriented learning and obstacle avoidance. Notably, bees consistently preferred to fixate the location of the nest entrance from elevated positions above the dense environment across all conditions. Our results reveal significant changes in the 3D flight structure, body orientations, and nest fixation behaviours as object density increases. This highlights the importance of considering 3D space and environmental complexity in understanding insect navigation.
40223734	Diastereoselective radical cascade cyclization to access indole-fused diazepine derivatives.	The synthesis of polycyclic indoles is significant in organic chemistry, due to such heterocyclic frameworks being present in numerous bioactive pharmaceuticals and natural alkaloids. Herein, we provide an efficient radical cascade cyclization strategy to generate indole-fused diazepine derivatives using phosphoryl or sulfonyl radicals with <i>N</i>-(2-(1<i>H</i>-indol-1-yl)phenyl)-<i>N</i>-methylmethacrylamides. The merits of this synthesis are attributed to its accessible starting materials, broad substrate compatibility and excellent diastereoselectivity.
40223732	Racemization-free peptide bond formation <i>via</i> 2-nitrobenzensulfonyl strategy for diastereoselective synthesis of (<i>Z</i>)-fluoroalkene-type peptidomimetics.	The Xaa-Pro-type (<i>Z</i>)-fluoroalkene dipeptide isostere (FADI) serves as a versatile surrogate for peptide bonds, effectively restricting <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i> isomerization of the prolyl amide bond and offering advantages in the development of conformationally constrained peptide analogues. However, the diastereoselective synthesis of tripeptidomimetics incorporating Xaa-Pro-type FADIs is challenging due to the high susceptibility to racemization of the α-stereogenic center during peptide bond formation. Here, we introduce a racemization- and epimerization-free coupling strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of fluoroalkene-type peptidomimetics by reacting Xaa-Pro-type FADIs with amino acid benzyl esters or peptides. This approach leverages the unique properties of the 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Ns) group as an N-terminal protecting group, which promotes sulfonamide anion formation, effectively suppressing α-deprotonation and thereby preventing racemization or epimerization. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the <i>N</i>-Ns group in peptide synthesis and provide a robust platform for expanding the utility of FADIs in peptidomimetic designing.
40223731	Modulators of the ubiquitin-proteasome system from natural products: chemical structures and their potential for drug discovery.	Covering: up to 2024The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a key role in regulating intracellular protein degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Within the UPS, target proteins are polyubiquitinated through sequential reactions catalyzed by ubiquitination-related enzymes. These ubiquitinated proteins are then recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome. Deubiquitinating enzymes cleave the formed polyubiquitin chains and regulate protein degradation, thereby contributing to precise regulation of the system. Dysregulation of the UPS is associated with cancer, immune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, making it a potential target for drug discovery. To date, a variety of natural products that target the UPS have been discovered and used in pharmaceutical development, and these compounds have provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms of UPS regulation. This review describes natural products that inhibit protein degradation in the UPS and activate protein degradation mediated by the 20S proteasome, thus clarifying their mechanisms of action and exploring their potential applications as therapeutic agents.
40223717	Drug-coated balloons in percutaneous coronary interventions: existing evidence and emerging hopes.	Drug-coated balloons (DCB) have been developed as an alternative to drug-eluting stents (DES) as a part of the "leave nothing behind" strategy following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). DCBs facilitate revascularization and delivery of an antiproliferative agent directly to a coronary artery lesion, without the need for DES implantation. Subsequently, DCBs promote positive vascular remodeling and allow for a shorter duration of dual antiplatelet therapy. Since the first reports on the successful treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) with paclitaxel-coated balloon catheters in the year 2006, the use of DCBs has been growing, driven by reports of DCB application to treat ISR, bifurcation lesions, and small vessel disease. Contemporary clinical trials evaluating DCBs in large vessel disease and chronic total occlusions might further expand the indications for this technology. Attention has also been brought to the use of DCBs in patients with diabetes mellitus and acute coronary syndrome, especially those at high bleeding risk. This review aims to discuss the existing evidence and emerging hopes associated with DCBs, including technical aspects of DCB PCI and the use of DCBs in different clinical scenarios.
40223716	Short- and long-term outcomes of Impella-protected, high-risk, elective PCI in patients with multivessel coronary disease and low ejection fraction - Polish Impella Registry.	The Impella percutaneous mechanical circulatory support device provides improved support in treating patients with high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions (HR-PCI) or in cardiogenic shock. IMPELLA-PL is a multicenter registry developed to share clinical data and experiences using Impella technology in Poland. The retrospective analysis conducted in this study aims to fill the knowledge gap of Impella performance in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) (≤30%) treated with HR-PCI.
40223715	Evaluation of the school-based "PhunkyFoods" intervention on food literacy and cooking skills; a cluster randomized controlled trial in the UK.

40223714	Accent the positive: An investigation into five-year-olds' implicit attitudes towards different regional accents.	Regional accent biases in 27 Essex five-year-olds are investigated. This study is the first to analyse implicit language attitudes by measuring children's neural activity (event-related potentials) while they take part in an Implicit Association Test. Both measures find a preference towards the prestigious accent, Standard Southern British English (SSBE), which is associated with cleverness (CLEVER). A late positive potential in the brain data for the association of the familiar, low-prestige Essex accent with CLEVER suggests the children also have a positive association with their home accent. The association between the less familiar, low-prestige Yorkshire accent and either CLEVER or NOT-CLEVER depends on the measure. Differences in the results are found relating to the children's accent exposure; those with a more heterogenous group of caretakers show more positive bias towards all three accents overall. Consequences for modelling the development of language attitudes are discussed.
40223713	Uncertainty and Regimes of Temporality Among Girls and Women with Turner Syndrome in France.	Based on ethnographic fieldwork with people living with Turner syndrome in France, in this article we analyze the relationship between uncertainty and temporalities specific to rare diseases. We first show how the syndrome requires a work of interpretation to decipher an opaque body and the desynchronization between bodily changes and age positions. We then analyze how the delay in information and diagnosis can change the perception and consequences of the disease. Finally, we show how new treatments or biotechnologies provide new imagined futures, multiplying choices but also the risk of failure and some ethical dilemmas in the contemporary French context.

40223711	Plasticity of Gene Expression in Spaceflight and Postflight in Relation to Cardiovascular Disease: Mechanisms and Candidate Repurposed Drugs.	Spaceflight poses unique challenges to human health due to exposure to increased levels of cosmic radiation, microgravity, and associated oxidative stress. These environmental factors can lead to cellular damage, inflammation, and a range of health complications, including cardiovascular problems, immune system impairment, and an increased risk of cancer. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a critical transcription factor that regulates the body's defense mechanisms against oxidative stress by promoting the expression of antioxidant enzymes. Recent research has shed more light on the critical role of NRF2 in addressing space-related health challenges. In this study, we developed a computational methodology to explore the plasticity of the gene expression profile in flight and postflight conditions, highlighting the genes and corresponding mechanisms that do not return to ground levels and correlate with gene signatures associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have been used to investigate the cellular effects of microgravity on cardiac function. Gene expression monotonicity studies were performed and linked to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to highlight the monotonically expressed genes associated with CVD. The selected monotonically expressed genes were also mapped onto the NRF2 network to investigate the impact of spaceflight on human cardiomyocyte function in the context of redox signaling pathways. Based on this knowledge, we used computational drug repurposing methods to suggest a short list of repurposed drug candidates that can be further tested in astronauts for the prevention of CVD. This study provides insights into the molecular and redox signaling alterations in cardiomyocytes induced by spaceflight, laying the foundation for future research aimed at mitigating cardiovascular risks in astronauts and advancing clinical applications on Earth.
40223709	Co-designing solutions to tackle food insecurity in higher education settings: a scoping review.	Food insecurity (FI) in the higher education setting is a pressing social justice and public health nutrition issue. Persistent FI rates among students suggest that the current programs and institutional policies are inadequate. Engaging the community in co-design practices can enhance research and decision-making, leading to more targeted advocacy and solutions. This review describes and evaluates evidence of co-design approaches and identifies strategies for addressing FI in higher education settings.

40223705	Consumers acceptability of using screen capture methods to capture marketing strategies on online food delivery platforms- A qualitative study.	Use of Online food delivery (OFD) platforms are on the rise and currently there are no public health policies that regulates what and how food is sold on these platforms. Research quantifying and describing the marketing strategies on OFD platforms is limited. Our study aimed to test the consumers' acceptability of using two screen capture methods to record their food purchasing behaviour on OFD platforms and; to describe consumers' exposure to, and engagement with, marketing strategies on OFD platforms in real-time.
40223704	Co-speech gesture comprehension in autistic children.	Co-speech gestures accompany or replace speech in communication. Studies investigating how autistic children understand them are scarce and inconsistent and often focus on decontextualized, iconic gestures. This study compared 73 three- to twelve-year-old autistic children with 73 neurotypical peers matched on age, non-verbal IQ, and morphosyntax. Specifically, we examined (1) their ability to understand deictic (i.e., <i>pointing</i>), iconic (e.g., <i>gesturing ball</i>), and conventional (e.g., <i>gesturing hello</i>) speechless video-taped gestures following verbal information in a narrative and (2) the impact of linguistic (e.g., vocabulary, morphosyntax) and cognitive factors (i.e., working memory) on their performance, to infer on the underlying mechanisms involved. Autistic children displayed overall good performance in gesture comprehension, although a small but significant difference advantage was observed in neurotypical children. Findings suggest that combining speech and gesture sequentially may be relatively spared in autism and might represent a way to alleviate the demand for simultaneous cross-modal processing.
40223703	Global Geographic Patterns of Soil Microbial Degradation Potential for Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons.	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic and persistent pollutants that are widely distributed in the environment. PAHs are toxic to microorganisms and pose ecological risks. Bacteria encode enzymes for PAH degradation through specific genes, thereby mitigating PAH pollution. However, due to PAHs' complexity, information on the global degradation potential, diversity, and associated risks of PAH-degrading microbes in soils is lacking. In this study, we analyzed 121 PAH-degrading genes and selected 33 as marker genes to predict the degradation potential within the soil microbiome. By constructing a Hidden Markov Model, we identified 4990 species carrying PAH-degrading genes in 40,039 soil metagenomic assembly genomes, with <i>Burkholderiaceae</i> and <i>Stellaceae</i> emerging as high-potential degraders. We demonstrated that the candidate PAH degraders predominantly emerged in artificial soil and farmland, with significantly fewer present in extreme environments, driven by factors such as average annual rainfall, organic carbon, and human modification of terrestrial systems. Furthermore, we comprehensively quantified the potential risks of each potential host in future practical applications using three indicators (antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, and pathogenic bacteria). We found that the degrader <i>Stellaceae</i> has significant application prospects. Our research will help determine the biosynthetic potential of PAH-degrading enzymes globally and further identify potential PAH-degrading bacteria at lower risk.

40223701	Treacle's ability to form liquid-like phase condensates is essential for nucleolar fibrillar center assembly, efficient rRNA transcription and processing, and rRNA gene repair.	We investigated the role of the nucleolar protein Treacle in organizing and regulating the nucleolus in human cells. Our results support Treacle's ability to form liquid-like phase condensates through electrostatic interactions among molecules. The formation of these biomolecular condensates is crucial for segregating nucleolar fibrillar centers from the dense fibrillar component and ensuring high levels of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene transcription and accurate rRNA processing. Both the central and C-terminal domains of Treacle are required to form liquid-like condensates. The initiation of phase separation is attributed to the C-terminal domain. The central domain is characterized by repeated stretches of alternatively charged amino acid residues and is vital for condensate stability. Overexpression of mutant forms of Treacle that cannot form liquid-like phase condensates compromises the assembly of fibrillar centers, suppressing rRNA gene transcription and disrupting rRNA processing. These mutant forms also fail to recruit DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), suppressing the DNA damage response in the nucleolus.

40223699	GLIM consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update.	The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) introduced an approach for malnutrition diagnosis in 2019 that comprised screening followed by assessment of three phenotypic criteria (weight loss, low body mass index [BMI], and low muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (reduced food intake/assimilation and inflammation/disease burden). This planned update reconsiders the GLIM framework based on published knowledge and experience over the past 5 years.
40223698	Clinical progress note: Secondary fracture prevention.	Osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated after fragility fractures. Hospitalists should be able to risk stratify osteoporosis severity to guide treatment decisions. Bisphosphonates remain the cornerstone of treatment. However, patients with the highest fracture risk may benefit from anabolic therapy before bisphosphonate use. Behavioral and environmental fall prevention measures also play a key role to prevent future fractures. Hospitalists are well-positioned to help address the gap in osteoporosis care-especially for patients who have already fractured and are at highest risk.
40223696	Exploring the causal link between childhood maltreatment and asthma: a Mendelian randomization study.	<b>Background:</b> Prior research indicates a potential connection between childhood maltreatment and asthma. In response, we designed a Mendelian Randomization (MR) study to further investigate this association.<b>Methods:</b> Utilizing the MR approach, we leveraged Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data from the UK Biobank (UKB). Our primary outcome was asthma, analyzed through GWAS datasets termed AsthmaUKB and AsthmaIEU, sourced from two distinct studies. Additionally, we conducted stratified analyses focusing on pediatric asthma and adult asthma to address different asthma phenotypes. The causal impact of childhood maltreatment (CM) on asthma was assessed using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) methods, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO tests, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalizability of our findings.<b>Results:</b> The IVW analyses identified significant associations between CM and increased risks for AsthmaUKB (<i>OR</i> = 1.59, 95% <i>CI</i> = 1.23-2.05, <i>p</i> < .001), AsthmaIEU (<i>OR</i> = 1.04, 95% <i>CI </i>= 1.02-1.06, <i>p</i> < .001), pediatric asthma (<i>OR</i> = 1.72, 95% <i>CI</i> = 1.26-2.35, <i>p</i> = .001), and adult asthma (<i>OR</i> = 1.71, 95% <i>CI</i> = 1.17-2.48, <i>p</i> = .005). The MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO results confirmed the absence of pleiotropy, reinforcing our causal inferences. Although Cochran's <i>Q</i> test indicated some heterogeneity among asthma subtypes (<i>p</i> > .05), the robustness of the IVW results remains reliable.<b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings suggest a potential causal relationship between CM and various asthma phenotypes, as validated through rigorous Mendelian randomization analyses. These results emphasize the importance of considering CM in asthma prevention and intervention strategies and lay the groundwork for further investigation into how early-life adversities may predispose individuals to asthma, contributing to a deeper understanding of its etiological pathways.
40223695	The yoga of droplets: coalescence in complex fluids.	Coalescence of liquid drops is a widely observed phenomenon across a diverse range of natural and industrial processes, ranging from the formation of raindrops and the growth of tumor cells to inkjet printing. The physics involved in this seemingly simple process of coalescence is far from simple, and the rheological complexity of the fluid under investigation makes the problem even more challenging. The present article provides a brief overview of existing knowledge on this topic and discusses the potential avenues for future research. Special attention is given to non-Newtonian fluids and soft materials, which exhibit distinct behaviors compared to Newtonian liquids, revealing fascinating deviations that demand deeper investigation.
40223694	Heterogeneity across idiographic network associations among emotion dysregulation, alcohol use, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and intimate partner violence.	Nearly half of women in the United States experience intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetime, which is linked to deleterious sequelae related to health outcomes. To better understand these dynamic processes, the current study used secondary data from a 30-day experience sampling methods (ESM) study to examine associations among IPV experiences, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), alcohol use, and emotion dysregulation. Participants were women over 18 years of age who experienced physical or sexual victimization in the past 6 months. Group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME) was used to generate idiographic networks for each individual, followed by unsupervised subgroup classification to examine patterns of results across people. The results indicated great heterogeneity among networks. No overall group-level paths emerged, but seven small subgroups emerged, and 30.6% of the sample did not fit into any subgroup. All networks had significant autoregressions, suggesting that associations between IPV, PTSS, emotion dysregulation, and alcohol use are variable and highly specific to the individual. Notably, across findings, most associations emerged at the contemporaneous level, with few lagged effects. The complexity of the findings suggests that substantial heterogeneity exists in the dynamic associations among these processes. Personally tailored approaches may be more effective than one-size-fits-all approaches for assessing and intervening on IPV and related mental health concerns.

40223692	<i>De Novo</i> Design of Cyclic Peptide Binders Based on Fragment Docking and Assembling.	Cyclic peptides offer distinct advantages in modulating protein-protein interactions (PPIs), including enhanced target specificity, structural stability, reduced toxicity, and minimal immunogenicity. However, most cyclic peptide therapeutics currently in clinical development are derived from natural products or the cyclization of protein loops, with few methodologies available for <i>de novo</i> cyclic peptide design based on target protein structures. To fill this gap, we introduce CycDockAssem, an integrative computational platform that facilitates the systematic generation of head-to-tail cyclic peptides made entirely of natural - or -amino acid residues. The cyclic peptide binders are constructed from oligopeptide fragments containing 3-5 amino acids. A fragment library comprising 15 million fragments was created from the Protein Data Bank. The assembly workflow involves dividing the targeted protein surface into two docking boxes; the updated protein-protein docking program SDOCK2.0 is then utilized to identify the best binding fragments for these boxes. The fragments binding in different boxes are concatenated into a ring using two additional peptide fragments as linkers. A ROSETTA script is employed for sequence redesign, while molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA calculations assess the conformational stability and binding free energy. To enhance docking performance, cation-π interactions, backbone hydrogen bonding potential, and explicit water exclusion energy were incorporated into the docking score function of SDOCK2.0, resulting in a significantly improved performance on the updated test set. A mirror design strategy was developed for cyclic peptides composed of -amino acids, where natural amino acid cyclic peptide binders are first designed for the mirror image of the target protein and the resulting complexes are then mirrored back. CycDockAssem was experimentally validated using tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) as the target. Surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated that six of the seven designed cyclic peptides bind TNFα with micromolar affinity, two of which significantly inhibit TNFα downstream gene expression. Overall, CycDockAssem provides a robust strategy for targeted <i>de novo</i> cyclic peptide drug discovery.
40223691	<i>Ginkgo biloba</i> leaf extract alleviates paraquat-induced RLE-6TN cell damage via the miR-155-5p/SIRT1/TLR4 axis.	<i>Ginkgo biloba</i> extract (GBE) has demonstrated therapeutic potential in paraquat (PQ)-induced injury; however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. The cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and apoptosis of RLE-6TN cells were assessed using CCK-8, LDH assay, and flow cytometry. Oxidative stress was evaluated using the DCFH-DA probe, while inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were measured via ELISA. The expression of miR-155-5p was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were employed to investigate the interaction between SIRT1 and miR-155-5p. Protein expression levels of SIRT1, TLR4, phosphorylated P65 (p-P65), and total P65 were determined by western blotting. The results showed that miR-155-5p expression was upregulated in PQ-induced cell injury. Knockdown of miR-155-5p improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory damage in PQ-treated cells. In RLE-6TN cells, miR-155-5p directly targeted the SIRT1/TLR4 axis. GBE mitigated PQ-induced cell injury by modulating the miR-155-5p/SIRT1/TLR4 axis, thereby enhancing cell viability and reducing apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. This study indicates that GEB may protect against PQ-induced RLE-cell injury by regulating the miR-155-5p/SIRT1/TLR4 signaling pathway and that miR-155-5p could be a promising biomarker for PQ intoxication, providing novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies for PQ poisoning.
40223690	Electrochromic platform for the visual detection of the neuroblastoma biomarkers vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid.	Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) are biomarkers for the diagnosis and course-of-disease monitoring of malignant tumor neuroblastomas, which endanger infants and children. Herein, we demonstrated a proof-of-concept visual detection of VMA and HVA on an electrochromic basis, in which the viologen 1,1'-dibenzyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride was used as a coloration chromophore. It was found that VMA and HVA can be used as effective electron mediators to improve the electrochromic performance of devices. It is interesting to note that VMA and HVA reduce the driving voltage of electrochromic devices (ECDs) down to -1.0 V, which is lower than that (-2.1 V) achieved without these additives, and the coloration of ECDs is undoubtedly dependent on the concentration of VMA and HVA from 0.8 to 10<sup>-6</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup>. Thus, this study presents an ECD platform as a breakthrough strategy for the facile, routine and portable visual detection of the neuroblastoma biomarkers VMA and HVA with obvious advantages over other detection techniques such as HPLC/MS used in clinical diagnosis.
40223688	P(TT-TPA) featuring a conjugated extended structure: enabling high-performance flexible electrochromic-supercapacitors.	Electrochromic-supercapacitors (EC-SCs) based on conducting polymers hold broad application prospects in fields such as smart electronic devices, wearable devices, and the Internet of Things. However, complex structures generated by their large molecular weights severely deteriorate the disorder of chain arrangements, which significantly hinders the migration of charge carriers within the chains and exerts an adverse impact on the opto/electric performance. In this work, triphenylamine (TPA) is adopted as the scaffold, and thieno[3,2-<i>b</i>]thiophene (TT) groups are introduced to successfully construct TT-TPA (HTPA) with a conjugated extended structure. Leveraging the intermolecular π-π stacking effect effectively restricted the rotation of single bonds, significantly enhancing the molecular planarity. Concurrently, the introduction of multiple active sites opened up more channels for charge storage. The obtained P(TT-TPA) (PHTPA) films exhibit remarkable optical contrast (51% at 1050 nm) and outstanding energy storage capacity (177 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>). The flexible devices based on PHTPA show significant color changes, excellent capacitive performance (46 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>), and good bending resistance. In summary, the molecular design strategy of expanding the conjugated structure furnishes a certain theoretical foundation and referential significance for the development of EC-SC electrode materials that balance comprehensive performances.
40223687	Characterization of the Cubamyces menziesii terpenome.	Long-lasting polypore fungi are significant producers of terpene cyclases of high interest for medicinal or biotechnological applications. Following the 1,000 Fungal Genomes initiative launched by the Joint Genome Institute, we explored the genome of Cubamyces (C.) menziesii and identified eighteen genes encoding sesquiterpene cyclases. In a search for robust catalysts suitable for practical applications, we cloned the eighteen codon-optimized open reading frames and overproduced the C. menziesii sesquiterpene cyclases in Escherichia coli. In ten cases, the catalytically active enzyme was purified and tested with three chemically synthesized linear diphosphates: geranyl diphosphate (GDP), farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). Only FDP proved to be a substrate for these ten enzymes. The product specificity of all these enzymes was determined by GC-MS and NMR analysis. Among the ten enzymes, four produced a predominant compound, four yielded two main compounds and the remaining two acted as multiproduct catalysts. This work sheds light on the potential sesquiterpenes involved in the chemical ecology of the polypore C. menziesii and provides evidence for the potential of Polyporales fungi in the identification of new sesquiterpene cyclase activities.

40223683	In Situ Cancer Vaccines: Redefining Immune Activation in the Tumor Microenvironment.	Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Nanomedicines have significantly improved life expectancy and survival rates for cancer patients in current standard care. However, recurrence of cancer due to metastasis remains a significant challenge. Vaccines can provide long-term protection and are ideal for preventing bacterial and viral infections. Cancer vaccines, however, have shown limited therapeutic efficacy and raised safety concerns despite extensive research. Cancer vaccines target and stimulate responses against tumor-specific antigens and have demonstrated great potential for cancer treatment in preclinical studies. However, tumor-associated immunosuppression and immune tolerance driven by immunoediting pose significant challenges for vaccine design. In situ vaccination represents an alternative approach to traditional cancer vaccines. This strategy involves the intratumoral administration of immunostimulants to modulate the growth and differentiation of innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, and restore T-cell activity. Currently approved in situ vaccines, such as T-VEC, have demonstrated clinical promise, while ongoing clinical trials continue to explore novel strategies for broader efficacy. Despite these advancements, failures in vaccine research highlight the need to address tumor-associated immune suppression and immune escape mechanisms. In situ vaccination strategies combine innate and adaptive immune stimulation, leveraging tumor-associated antigens to activate dendritic cells and cross-prime CD8+ T cells. Various vaccine modalities, such as nucleotide-based vaccines (e.g., RNA and DNA vaccines), peptide-based vaccines, and cell-based vaccines (including dendritic, T-cell, and B-cell approaches), show significant potential. Plant-based viral approaches, including cowpea mosaic virus and Newcastle disease virus, further expand the toolkit for in situ vaccination. Therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy, radiation, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and Checkpoint blockade inhibitors contribute to enhanced antigen presentation and immune activation. Adjuvants like CpG-ODN and PRR agonists further enhance immune modulation and vaccine efficacy. The advantages of in situ vaccination include patient specificity, personalization, minimized antigen immune escape, and reduced logistical costs. However, significant barriers such as tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and logistical challenges remain. This review explores strategies for developing potent cancer vaccines, examines ongoing clinical trials, evaluates immune stimulation methods, and discusses prospects for advancing in situ cancer vaccination.
40223682	Screening and Functional Analysis of TPO Gene Mutations in Patients With Congenital Hypothyroidism.	Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene mutations have been reported as the most commonly reported pathogenic variants in congenital hypothyroidism (CH) caused by thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis disorders, the significance of some mutations remains unclear. The study analyzed 54 children diagnosed with CH who underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES). Functional analysis of the TPO p.K78Q variant, a novel variant of uncertain significance (VUS), revealed that it caused developmental defects in zebrafish and also disrupted thyroid axis gene expression, decreasing tg, dio1, dio2, trβ, nis, ttr and increasing tshβ, trα.
40223681	Exploring the origin of electron spin polarization in metal-containing chromophore-radical systems <i>via</i> multireference calculations.	The electron spin polarization (ESP) phenomenon in photoexcited chromophore-radical connected systems was analyzed by multireference electronic structure calculations. We focused on bpy-M-CAT-<i>m</i>Ph-NN (bpy = 4,4'-di-<i>tert</i>-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, M = Pt or Pd, CAT = 3-<i>tert</i>-butylcatecholate, <i>m</i>Ph = <i>meta</i>-phenylene, and NN = nitronyl nitroxide) reported by Kirk <i>et al.</i>, which is a connected system consisting of a donor-acceptor complex and a radical, and elucidated the mechanism behind the reversal of the sign of photoinduced ESP depending on the metal species. The low-lying electronic states of these molecules were revealed through the multireference theory, suggesting that the ligand-to-ligand charge-transfer states play a significant role. Additionally, several structural factors that influence the energies of the excited states were identified. To enhance our understanding of the ESP, we incorporated spin-orbit coupling as a direct transition term between excited states and explicitly considered its effects on the ESP. The results of evaluating transition rates through a transition simulation indicate that when the influence of spin-orbit coupling is significant, the sign of the ESP in the ground state can reverse. This novel ESP mechanism mediated by spin-orbit coupling may offer fundamental insights for designing molecules to precisely control electron distribution across multiple spin states.
40223680	Substrate-dependent deposition of Cu thin films by molecular dynamics simulations.	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/Cu composite films simultaneously exhibit the merits of flexibility, light weight and excellent electrical conductivity, and thus have potential applications in 5G technology. Although PET/Cu films have been prepared by available experiments, few studies have further provided an atomic-scale understanding of these deposition processes. Here, the growth of Cu thin films on Cu and PET substrates has been carried out by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and vacuum evaporation experiments. A detailed comparison of surface roughness, crystal structures and interfacial adhesion for Cu films deposited on these two substrates has been made. A conclusion has been achieved that Cu films deposited on the PET substrate exhibit lower surface roughness and stronger adhesion than those on the metal substrate. This investigation will provide a deep understanding of the substrate-dependent deposition performance of metal thin films.
40223679	Brønsted Acid-Assisted Lewis Acid Mediated Intramolecular Trapping of Aminoenol with Activated Alkenes and Ketones.	An efficient Brønsted acid-assisted Lewis acid-mediated synthesis of indolines and pyrrolidines has been achieved from α-hydroxydimethylacetals and suitable electrophile-tethered amines. The reaction proceeds via an interrupted Amadori/Heyns rearrangement, where the key aminoenol intermediate was successfully trapped with Michael acceptors and ketones in an intramolecular fashion to afford corresponding derivatives in good yield and diastereoselectivity. The reaction is operationally simple, general, and tolerates various functional groups.

40223674	Persistent Dimer of Nanographdiyne Functionalized With Ester.	Controlling the self-assembly and aggregation behavior of nanographdiyne (NanoGDY) in solution is crucial for understanding the intrinsic structure-property relationships of graphdiyne. However, capturing the persistent NanoGDY dimer aggregate presents a significant challenge. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a novel ester-functionalized NanoGDY with solubilized alkyl chains at the periphery named NanoGDY-CO and investigated its aggregation behavior at different temperatures as well as different solvents by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, UV-vis, and FL spectroscopy. The combination of intermolecular hydrogen bonding formed by the ester groups and π─π stacking facilitates the self-assembly of NanoGDY-CO into a persistent coplanar and slip-stacked dimer. In contrast, the branched 2-octyldodecyl substituent acts as a steric control agent preventing further aggregation of the self-assembled NanoGDY dimer. This work offers new insights into understanding and manipulating the self-assembly behavior of NanoGDYs in solution.

Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective for LBP management when combined with medication and physical therapy. An understanding of patients' willingness to pay (WTP) and preferences is needed to integrate MBIs into standard LBP care. We examined WTP and preferences for MBIs, as well as associated factors, among patients with chronic LBP in the Hong Kong public healthcare sector.
40223666	Association of obesity traits and uric acid levels with cardiovascular disease in Punjabi patients from Faisalabad, Pakistan.	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the significant public health concerns worldwide. Understanding the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC), Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) and uric acid levels are important in assessing cardiovascular risk.

40223665	Why Universities Should Make Misconduct Reports Public.	This paper reflects on the availability of a key document in the research integrity landscape: Reports of institutional and university misconduct investigations. It reviews how universities have typically responded to calls for disclosure, offers suggestions to mitigate concerns, and argues that the failure to release such reports creates a critical evidence gap. It closes with a call for disclosure of such reports as a default.
40223663	Survey of pathogens and human fecal markers in stormwater across a highly populated urban region.	Microbial contamination of urban stormwater, rivers, and creeks during rainstorms is a persistent and widespread problem. Remediation of these waters has proven to be challenging since there are many potential sources for the fecal indicator bacteria on which water quality is regulated. Microbial source tracking markers have allowed for improved identification and quantification of the sources of contamination, but the majority of the source-attributed microbial targets are not responsible for causing the illnesses associated with waterborne human fecal contamination. Thus there is a need to better understand the relationships of human pathogens and human fecal markers in stormwater. In this study, we used a spatially-intensive sampling approach (31 sites) across southern California for the analysis of stormwater. During three storms from 2021-2023, we used droplet digital PCR to quantify the human fecal markers HF183 and Lachno3 along with human adenovirus, human norovirus, <i>Campylobacter</i> spp., and <i>Salmonella</i> spp. This spatially intensive sampling design captures information from a 5900 km<sup>2</sup> area with ∼22 million people. We detected human markers HF183 and Lachno3 genes at 90% and 97% of the sites; concentrations ranged from below detection to 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> gene copies per 100 mL, respectively. We found variable concentrations of human bacterial and viral pathogen genes. HF183 was significantly correlated to human adenovirus and Lachno3. Lachno3 was also significantly correlated with <i>Salmonella</i>. We reported PCR inhibition in 83-90% of the samples but found that separating sediment and adding proteinase K during lysis improved DNA/RNA extraction efficiency and reduced inhibition.
40223661	Stereotactic body radiotherapy for central non-small cell lung cancer: risk analysis of radiation pneumonitis and bronchial dose constraints.	The present study investigated risk factors and bronchial dose constraints for symptomatic radiation pneumonitis (RP) in stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for central early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We reviewed 245 patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with SBRT, and 78 patients with a tumor within 3 cm of the main or lobar bronchus were included in this study. Dose-volume histogram data were converted to a 4-fraction equivalent using the linear-quadratic model with an α/β value of 3. To examine the independent effects of dose parameters on grade ≥ 2 RP after adjusting for clinical factors, the Fine-Gray model with death as a competing risk was used for evaluation. With a median follow-up period of 44 months, the 4-year cumulative incidence of grade ≥ 2 and ≥ 3 RP was 22.5% and 8.5%, respectively. After adjustment for clinical factors, 6 bronchial dosimetric factors were significantly associated with grade ≥ 2 RP. Lung dosimetric factors were not significantly associated with grade ≥ 2 RP. Among significant dosimetric factors of the bronchus, bronchus V35Gy had the highest hazard ratio (HR) (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.49, P = 0.027). The optimal threshold for bronchus V35Gy based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 0.04 cc. The 4-year incidence of grade ≥ 2 RP in the bronchus V35Gy ≤ 0.04 cc vs. >0.04 cc groups was 15.7% vs. 37.0% (P = 0.036). In SBRT for central early-stage NSCLC, bronchus V35Gy < 0.04 cc is the definitive indicator for preventing grade ≥ 2 RP.

40223658	Decolonial Framings in Global Health Law: Redressing Colonial Legacies for a Just and Equitable Future.	Colonialism has produced the global health system, and decoloniality must inform global health law. This article considers the foundational impact of colonialism on the global health system and advocates for adopting decoloniality as a crucial framework to reshape global health law. Through a historical lens, it examines how European colonialism established power dynamics and structures that continue to influence contemporary global health governance. This article calls for overcoming enduring challenges by emphasizing the urgency of dismantling outdated and unjust systems that perpetuate health inequities and hinder effective interventions. It argues for a paradigm shift toward epistemically inclusive, ethical, and equitable practices, emphasizing the active participation of marginalized communities in health policymaking. By addressing the root causes of health disparities and decoupling health systems from racial capitalism, a decolonial approach promises a more just and effective future for global health law.

40223655	Law and Global Governance of Infectious Disease: Access to Medicines on COVID-19, AIDS, and Beyond.	Scientific advances to fight infectious diseases have been remarkable. International law and global governance have sought, and often failed, to keep pace, secure equity, and stop outbreaks. We trace the law and governance model emerging from early failure in the AIDS response and identify four elements: use of law by national governments to compel sharing; decentralized generic manufacturing; mechanisms for voluntary sharing of patents and technology transfer; international funding. In combination, these created a remarkable new ecosystem. We find that when COVID-19 hit and mRNA vaccines were rapidly developed, global North governments opposed mobilizing this synergistic model. Instead, equity efforts focused on financing purchase of vaccines from originator companies with little use of law. Amidst monopolies and scarcity of doses, vaccine nationalism fatally undermined this effort. Whether more synergistic law and governance emerges from rapidly changing global health law will likely dictate the efficacy of future global infectious disease response.

40223652	Snakebite envenoming in India: it is time we look beyond the concept of the Big Four species.	India faces substantial challenges from snakebite envenoming secondary to the high morbidity, mortality and financial burden, particularly in rural communities. While concentrated on the 'Big Four' venomous species, recent research indicates a necessity to expand the focus to encompass additional medically relevant species. This review emphasizes the geographic heterogeneity in venom among these snakes, which impacts antivenom effectiveness and necessitating region-specific formulations. This analysis highlights the shortcomings of current antivenoms and identifies non-Big Four species involved in snakebite envenoming, advocating for an urgent shift to inclusive antivenom strategies that integrate local venom profiles to enhance treatment effectiveness and thereby reduce snakebite-related morbidity and mortality. Improved training for healthcare providers and enhancements in anti-snake venom quality are essential for meeting the World Health Organization's 2030 Sustainable Development Goal objective of halving snakebite-related fatalities and disabilities. Incorporating snakebite management into national health programs and conducting epidemiological research systematically are crucial to mitigating this preventable health concern.
40223651	Survival outcomes and prognostic factors in bladder cancer treated with radiotherapy.	This study evaluated survival outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with bladder cancer treated with radiotherapy. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 488 patients across all cancer stages who received radiotherapy at two institutions between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2022. Overall survival (OS) was assessed based on treatment intent (radical or palliative) and cancer stage. Among these patients, 304 with Stage II-III disease who underwent radical radiotherapy were further analyzed for OS and prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression analysis. In the radical radiotherapy group, median survival times (MSTs) were 43 months for Stage 0-I, 29 months for Stage II-III, and 17 months for Stage IV (M0). In the palliative radiotherapy group, MSTs were 16 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11-25) for M0 and 9 months (95% CI: 7-15) for M1. Among the 304 patients with Stage II-III disease treated with radical radiotherapy, the 3-year OS rate was 43.0%. Hydronephrosis was the only independent prognostic factor significantly associated with worse OS (hazard ratio: 1.915, P < 0.001). Age, sex, stage, treatment era, prophylactic pelvic radiotherapy, chemotherapy and prescribed dose had no significant impact on OS. Radiotherapy remains a viable treatment option for patients at any stage of cancer. Although hydronephrosis negatively affects survival, it should not preclude the use of radiotherapy.

As of December 2024, 19 small nucleic acid drugs have been approved globally, with applications primarily in treating rare and hereditary conditions, metabolic diseases, and ophthalmological disorders, demonstrating great clinical potential. This review provides an overview of the classification, mechanism of action, technical challenges, and addressing strategies for small nucleic acid drugs, with a focus on the indications for market-available drugs, aiming to equip healthcare professionals with a thorough understanding and practical guidance on their utilization.
40223649	Reflections on Health and Human Rights.	Communities and individuals globally continue to suffer the violent impacts of colonialism and racism, in a global system of governance that remains rooted in unequal and hierarchical power imbalances. The interpersonal, societal, and structural violence that persists around the world exists in violation of human rights, and is evidence of a persistent lack of political will to effectively invest in human rights, including the right to health, as a true priority.The demand on States and non-State actors to fulfil the human right to health is imperative. Attacks on civilians during times of conflict and catastrophe, as seen in the latest escalation and display of imperial aggression by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory, demonstrate the consistent uneven application of human rights and commitment to fulfilling them.Protecting human rights, and specifically the realization of the right to health, is fundamental as it has significant consequences for the realisation of other human rights. Eliminating discrimination requires paying sufficient attention to groups of individuals that suffer historical or persistent prejudice. Fulfilling a commitment to health equity and justice demands creating opportunity and conducive conditions for the dignity for all people.
40223648	Surface-Modified Micro-Ring-Resonator Sensors for HMGB1 Detection on a Chip-Scale Platform.	High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is considered a pivotal mediator and biomarker in inflammatory diseases, garnering increasing attention for precise detection. Silicon on insulator (SOI) integrated waveguide biosensors have the advantages of high sensitivity, easy functionalization, and compatibility with CMOS technology, promising enhanced sensing of HMGB1. Here, we propose a chip-scale, cost-effective HMGB1 sensor device based on a micro-ring resonator (MRR), which is surface functionalized by a chemical bonding method. This sensor enables quantitative determination of HMGB1 concentration, with a sensitivity reaching 1.75 pm/nM and a detection limit as low as 0.13 μg/mL (4.99 nM). The HMGB1 concentration was accurately determined in a mixed solution environment of unknown concentration with an average error of only 5.4%. This study demonstrates the excellent performance of a surface-modified HMGB1 antibody MRR sensor in sensing HMGB1 concentration.

40223646	Retractions of COVID-19-related Research Publications During and After the Pandemic.	Retracted research publications reached an all-time high in 2023, and COVID-19 publications may have higher retraction rates than other publications. To better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the research literature, we analyzed 244 retracted publications related to COVID-19 in the PubMed database and the reasons for their retraction. Peer-review manipulation (18.4%) and error (20.9%) were the most common reasons for retraction, with time to retraction occurring far more quickly than in the past (13.2 mos, compared with 32.9 mos in a 2012 study). Publications focused on controversial topics were retracted rapidly (mean time to retraction 10.8 mos) but continued to receive media attention, suggesting that retraction alone may be insufficient to prevent the spread of scientific misinformation. More than half of the retractions resulted from problems that could have been detected prior to publication, including compromise of the peer review process, plagiarism, authorship issues, lack of ethics approvals, or journal errors, suggesting that more robust screening and peer review by journals can help to mitigate the recent rise in retractions.
40223645	Global Health Law: Reflections on the Past, Present, and Future of the Field.	In the decade since the first edition of Global Health Law was published, the world has moved incrementally towards global health with justice, at least by one basic metric: life expectancy has edged up globally, with more rapid gains in low- than high-income countries. But to look around the world, global health with justice still seems a distant dream. Health gaps between people in rich and poor countries remain shocking and unconscionable-as do health inequities within countries. The pandemic also gave salience to profound health injustices-from injustices in access to lifesaving vaccines to gaping disparities in morbidity and mortality based on income, race, and national origin. So did the Trump administration's decision to pause, and then slash, foreign assistance, bringing an end to lifesaving programs around the world. Guided by the overarching theme of justice, these reflections canvass the history of global health law as a field and discuss developments and challenges in the field across four core themes: multilateralism; equitable distribution of the benefits of scientific advancement; global health law for the poly-crises; and human rights and equity.
40223644	Photoinduced NO production from a mononuclear {MnNO}<sup>6</sup> complex bearing a metal-diaryldisulphide ligand.	A solution of six-coordinate [Mn(PS2)<sub>2</sub>] (1) is inert towards nitric oxide (NO) at room temperature. In the presence of a proton source such as <i>p</i>-toluenesulfonic acid or perchloric acid, however, the treatment of 1 with NO in the dark leads to the formation of {MnNO}<sup>6</sup> [Mn(NO)(SPS-SPS)] (2) with a metal-diaryldisulphide ligand, as confirmed by several spectroscopy investigations, including single-crystal X-ray diffraction. A possible pathway for the formation of 2 was determined through theoretical studies and involves the following: (i) the thiolato sulphur in 1 interacts with H<sup>+</sup> to generate an intermediate [Mn(PS2)(PS2H)]<sup>+</sup> (A) with an S⋯H interaction; (ii) the reaction of A with NO yields HNO and an Mn(IV)-bound-thiyl radical species (B); and (iii) the nucleophilicity of the thiyl radical B to an adjacent thiolato sulphur produces a five-coordinate Mn(III)-diaryldisulphide species (C), which reacts with the generated HNO to yield 2. Complex 2 is sensitive to visible light. When photolysis of 2 in solution is performed, complex 1 is regenerated and NO is released, which is related to metal-disulphide/metal-thiolate interconversion.
40223643	Reflections on Global Health Law in the COVID-19 Response.	Over the last three years, Larry Gostin, I, and many others have urged world leaders to open their minds toward specific subsets of reform in the interest of pandemic response, including mechanisms for transparency, accountability, and, crucially, financial buy-in. With negotiations for a new pandemic accord still incomplete, our focus must remain on reaching global agreement, and keeping at top of mind the immense stakes if that is not possible.
40223642	Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin: a predictive biomarker of In-hospital mortality in heart failure patients.	The ratio of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin (ALB), known as RAR, functions as an innovative indicator related to prognosis. However, whether RAR can predict the in-hospital mortality (IHM) for heart failure (HF) patients remains ambiguous.
40223641	Systematic Reviewers Have an Obligation to Promote Research Integrity.	Systematic reviewers are ideally placed to detect untrustworthy studies and decrease their use in decision making. The systematic review process already requires rigorous evaluation of an entire body of evidence related to a particular question. Excluding untrustworthy studies from systematic reviews can reduce their subsequent impact on evidence used for decisions and raise awareness of the problem among universities, journal editors, research funders and other stakeholders who can take appropriate action to eliminate them from the scientific literature.
40223639	Suppression of cancer stem-like cell radioresistance by inhibiting AMPK signaling.	Cancer stem cell (CSC) radioresistance is a major cause of radiotherapy (RT) failure and tumor recurrence. The molecular target for eradicating CSCs has not been identified despite research efforts to overcome tumor radioresistance. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is responsible for transmitting nuclear DNA damage signals to the mitochondria, which in turn generate adenosine triphosphate to execute a DNA damage response. Disruption of this mitochondria-mediated genomic defense mechanism may be an effective strategy to enhance the cytotoxic efficacy of RT. Here, we investigated the potential efficacy of the pan-AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin (Dor) in preventing CSC radioresistance. Radioresistant cancer stem-like cells were derived from the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 (HepG2 82FR-31NR). The radiosensitizing effect of Dor was then examined in HepG2 82FR-31NR cell cultures by clonogenic assays. Low-dose Dor markedly suppressed the recovery of HepG2 cancer stem-like cells after radiation but had little effect on normal fibroblast proliferation and survival, whether applied alone or in combination with radiation. In conclusion, this study strongly suggests that Dor treatment can radiosensitize cancer stem-like cells at doses that have no significant cytotoxic effects on normal human fibroblasts.
40223618	Optimal Oversizing With the New-Generation Evolut (PRO/PRO+/FX) Self-Expanding Valves: A Multicenter Study.	Paravalvular leaks (PVLs) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement have a significant prognostic impact, and valve oversizing, particularly with self-expanding valves, may prevent postprocedural PVL occurrence. Recent iterations of the Evolut valve system are intended to reduce PVL, but the effects of oversizing with such valves on PVL are largely unknown. We aimed to assess, in a real-world contemporary setting, the impact of Evolut valve oversizing on PVL after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

40223610	Gaps and Knowledge in the Contemporary Management of Acute Right Ventricular Failure.	Acute right ventricular failure (ARVF) is commonly seen in the intensive care unit and constitutes a significant clinical challenge, with associated high in-hospital mortality. Recently, the treatment of ARVF has significantly changed, with the progressive implementation of mechanical circulatory support devices that now represent important tools for clinicians in treating this condition. However, despite recent advancements, the optimal approach for ARVF remains elusive, and precise treatment algorithms and comprehensive management protocols are still lacking. In the present review, we explore the pathophysiology of ARVF, highlighting the different mechanisms that may lead to this clinical entity and emphasizing the left and right heart's complex interplay. We analyze the different therapeutic options that are now available for short- and long-term management of ARVF, with a particular focus on the advantages and disadvantages of the mechanical circulatory support devices actually used. Furthermore, we propose future directions in the field and a possible flowchart for the treatment of this condition.
40223608	Relationship Between Remote, Ambulatory Pulmonary Artery Pressures, and All-Cause Mortality in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure.	Hemodynamically guided management of patients with chronic heart failure (HF), using a remote, ambulatory pulmonary artery (PA) pressure monitor, has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity. These improved outcomes were associated with a reduction in PA pressure. However, several pivotal questions remain unanswered: do systolic, diastolic, or mean PA pressures each predict all-cause mortality? Do PA pressures predict mortality across the ejection fraction (EF) spectrum? Do increases or decreases in PA pressure over time predict increases or decreases in mortality?

40223606	Promoting Individuals' Intentions to be a Moral Rebel by Confronting Their Compliance With Morally Compromising Situations.	The tendency to be a moral rebel reflects individuals' propensity to resist, oppose, and confront morally problematic situations when otherwise failing to do so would compromise their values. Because the tendency to be a moral rebel is relatively rare, the current research examines if confrontation can promote individuals' intentions to be a moral rebel. Results revealed that confrontation of individuals' compliance with morally problematic situations-whether through providing them feedback via informational or normative social influence-promoted their intentions to be a moral rebel (studies 1, 2, and 3), particularly when morality was important to their identities (study 2 and 3). The effects of confrontation were not limited to direct interpersonal confrontation (studies 1 and 2) and emerged when individuals' behavior was challenged online by an artificial electronically-generated human voice (study 3). Findings suggest that confrontation can promote individuals' tendency to principally resist, oppose, and confront morally problematic situations.
40223605	Facile chloride ion (Cl<sup>-</sup>) doping enhances the oxygen evolution reaction activity of La<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>FeO<sub>3-<i>δ</i></sub> .	Perovskite electrocatalysts have garnered significant attention due to their catalytic activity, environmental friendliness, tunable structure and high performance. However, their activities in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still require further enhancement. In this study, to address this challenge, an anion doping strategy was employed to modify La<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>FeO<sub>3-<i>δ</i></sub> (LSFO) perovskite oxides, and a series of chloride ion doped catalysts were successfully prepared. The Cl<sup>-</sup> doping induced the selective leaching of Sr ions, leading to the formation of Sr vacancies on the perovskite surface and a significant increase in the proportion of oxidative oxygen species (O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>/O<sup>-</sup>). Additionally, a significant increase in the oxidation state of iron (Fe) in the perovskite was observed after the reaction. This synergistic effect effectively optimized the electronic conductivity of the perovskites, accelerated the intrinsic reaction kinetics, and substantially enhanced OER performance. Electrochemical testing results demonstrated that the optimal Cl-doped LSFO electrocatalyst exhibited an overpotential of only 232 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec<sup>-2</sup>. Additionally, the optimal Cl-doped LSFO showed a low charge transfer resistance and excellent long-term cyclic stability. This study not only demonstrated the regulatory mechanism of Cl<sup>-</sup> doping on the catalytic activity of perovskite catalysts but also provided theoretical insights and practical strategies for the design of efficient and stable electrocatalysts.
40223604	Photocatalytic Hydrogenation of Quinolines To Form 1,2,3,4-Tetrahdyroquinolines Using Water as the Hydrogen Atom Donor.	The design of a sequential process combining hydrogenation and a subsequent stereomutation is an attractive strategy for the stereoselective reduction of cyclic disubstituted π-systems to access the thermodynamically more stable trans-isomer, which would be the minor compound considering a kinetically controlled cis-hydrogenation process. Herein, we demonstrate stereoselective photocatalytic phosphine-mediated quinoline reductions with water as the hydrogen atom source under mild conditions to afford the corresponding 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines with complete selectivity towards reduction of the heteroaromatic part. The method shows broad functional group tolerance and provides access to trans-2,3-disubstituted tetrahydroquinolines with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. These trans-isomers are not readily obtained using established methods, as transition-metal catalyzed regioselective quinoline hydrogenations provide the corresponding cis-2,3-disubstituted isomers with high selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrogenation of the 2,3-disubstituted quinolines proceeds through a cascade process comprising an initial cis-selective photocatalytic hydrogenation of the heteroarene core of the quinoline followed by a trans-selective photoisomerization.

40223600	Chronic Total Occlusion Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Present and Future.	Chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention has evolved into a subspecialty of interventional cardiology. Using a variety of antegrade and retrograde techniques, experienced operators currently achieve success rates of 85% to 90%, with an incidence of major periprocedural complications of ≈2% to 3%. Several developments in equipment (new microcatheters and guidewires, novel reentry devices), imaging (computed tomography angiography guidance, intravascular imaging for reentry), techniques (intraocclusion contrast injection, advanced subintimal tracking and reentry), and artificial intelligence (automated computed tomography image analysis and prediction of the likelihood of crossing success with various techniques) could further improve outcomes. Global collaboration and rapid dissemination of new developments accelerate the pace of progress. While innovation is exciting and necessary, adhering to the basic principles of chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention (such as continual assessment of risks and benefits, meticulous angiographic review, and use of dual injection) remains critical for achieving optimal patient outcomes.

Poor sleep health is associated with cardiometabolic disease and related risk factors, including heart disease, stroke, elevated blood pressure and lipid levels, inflammation, glucose intolerance, obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, unhealthy substance use, poor mental health, and increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and is associated with social determinants of cardiovascular health and health disparities. Therefore, sleep duration has been recognized by the American Heart Association as one of Life's Essential 8. Although chronic sleep duration is the sole metric used in Life's Essential 8, sleep health represents a multidimensional construct. This scientific statement outlines the concept of multidimensional sleep health (sleep duration, continuity, timing, regularity, sleep-related daytime functioning, architecture, and absence of sleep disorders) as it applies to cardiometabolic health. Considerations of how these dimensions are related to cardiometabolic health and patterned by sociodemographic status are explained, and knowledge gaps are highlighted. Additional data are needed to understand better how these various dimensions of sleep should be assessed and how interventions targeting sleep health in clinical and community settings can be leveraged to improve health.
40223594	Proteasome dysfunction in T cells causes immunodeficiency via cell cycle disruption and apoptosis.	Proteasomes are essential molecular complexes that regulate intracellular protein homeostasis by selectively degrading ubiquitinated proteins. Genetic mutations in proteasome subunits lead to proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes (PRAAS) characterized by autoinflammation, partial progressive lipodystrophy, and, in certain cases, immunodeficiency. However, the molecular mechanisms by which proteasome dysfunction results in these phenotypes remain unclear. Here, we established a mouse model carrying a mutation in β5i (encoded by Psmb8) along with T-cell-specific β5 (encoded by Psmb5) deficiency (KIKO mice). The KIKO mice presented severe loss of mature T cells in the spleen but not in the thymus, with reduced proteasome activity leading to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. The CD4+ T cells of KIKO mice presented impaired proliferative activity with cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase following TCR engagement. T cells from KIKO mice underwent rapid cell death through apoptosis, as treatment of T cells with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD rescued cell viability. Moreover, proteasome dysfunction induced apoptosis in T cells without affecting either mitochondrial functions or ER stress responses. Thus, our data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying not only immunodeficiency in PRAAS patients but also T-cell deficiency associated with other disorders.
40223593	Global Health Law: Between Hard and Soft Law.	The field of global health law encompasses both "hard" law treaties and "soft" law policies that shape global health norms. Transitioning from "international health law" to "global health law and policy," global health policymakers have increasingly looked to soft law instruments to address public health needs in a rapidly globalizing world - within the World Health Organization and across global health governance. Yet, as policymakers have expanded the landscape of soft law policy instruments to advance global health across state and non-state actors, the COVID-19 response revealed the limitations of this soft law approach to global health threats, with states now seeking hard law reforms to strengthen global health governance. As hard and soft law can provide complementary approaches to preventing disease and promoting health, future research must conceptualize how these normative frameworks interact in advancing global health.
40223592	Structural, optical, and magnetic behavior and the nucleation of a Griffiths-like phase in (Ca,V)-doped ZnO nanoparticles.	Single-phase (Ca,V) co-doped ZnO nanoparticles (Zn<sub>0.93</sub>Ca<sub>0.04</sub>V<sub>0.03</sub>O, called hereinafter ZCVO) were synthesized <i>via</i> a modified sol-gel method. The hexagonal wurtzite symmetry of the ZnO phase nanostructure, belonging to the <i>P</i>6<sub>3</sub><i>mc</i> space group, has been confirmed through X-ray diffraction examinations using Rietveld refinement. No segregated secondary phases or Ca or/and V-rich clusters were detected. The TEM images clearly show the presence of nanoparticles exhibiting a diverse range of spherical shapes. The effect of co-doping on the optical band gap and crystalline quality was also investigated <i>via</i> photoluminescence (PL), UV-vis, and Raman spectrometers. The <i>M</i>-<i>T</i> curve suggests a tenability of magnetic coupling which was discussed within the context of three competing magnetic phases using the 3D spin wave model and Curie-Weiss law. The lack of saturation of the <i>M</i>-<i>H</i> loop at 10 K suggests the presence of both paramagnetic (PM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases in ZCVO NPs. The bound magnetic polaron (BMP) model provides a plausible explanation for the observed magnetic phase transition. Moreover, a Griffiths-like phase was observed for the first time, to our knowledge, in co-doped ZnO nanoparticles. This novelty may stem from the interplay between the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and FM interactions of the Ca and V ions, which are acquired by oxygen deficiency.
40223590	Reflections on Advocacy as a Foundation of Global Health Law.	Law can function and act on norms, through legislation, regulation, treaties and the like. Law can also be a key accompaniment to activism. The career of Larry Gostin represents both aspects of the law in achieving social change.
40223589	Reflection on the Legacy of Lawrence Gostin in Global Health.	The tenth anniversary of the publication of Lawrence Gostin's seminal treatise Global Health Law affords us the opportunity to reflect on his enduring legacy as a preeminent scholar, and one of the field's founding thought leaders.

40223587	The 2024 Amendments to the International Health Regulations: A New Era for Global Health Law in Pandemic Preparedness and Response?	On June 1, 2024, the World Health Assembly reached consensus on a package of amendments to the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR). These amendments follow nearly two decades of implementation and an intensive multilateral process prompted by the global struggle against COVID-19. This article critically examines whether the amended IHR reflect lessons learned from the pandemic, potentially ushering in a new era for global health law in pandemic preparedness and response, or if they deflect attention from the need for deeper structural reforms. While the IHR remain the only near-universal legal framework for preventing and addressing the international spread of disease, these amendments emphasize equity and solidarity, and potentially shift the IHR from a technical instrument to one focusing on inherently political issues. This analysis examines key IHR amendments and their implications for the future of global health law, particularly in the context of equity, financing, and implementation.
40223586	Environmental Health: Towards Synthesis in Global Law and Governance.	International law and global governance regimes for environmental health challenges have been slow to reflect the intertwined relationship between the environment and human health. Historical legacies have caused artificial fragmentation between the two that has resulted in distinct fields of international law and institutions for the environment and health. However, new global paradigms for thinking about environmental health have emerged to foster synthesis under global health law, including One Health and Planetary Health approaches, as well as through international human rights law like the recognition of the right to a clean, safe, and healthy environment. Guided by equity, new international law and global governance reforms, including the proposed Pandemic Agreement and Plastics Treaty, are opportunities to synthesize the intersecting dimensions of the environment and global health. However, future paths towards cohesion must explicitly incorporate human rights in environmental health governance, including the rights of Indigenous Peoples, while actively addressing inequities in global health law, between and within countries, and across generations.
40223585	AI and Data Surveillance: Embedding a Human Rights-based Approach.	Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize public health surveillance by analyzing large datasets to detect outbreaks. However, privacy, consent, and governance issues persist. While the International Health Regulations do not explicitly mention the use of AI in infectious disease surveillance, transparent processes, accountability, and public trust are key for responsibly integrating AI in pandemic preparedness.
40223584	The facile preparation of mixed-valence metal-organic frameworks through reduction.	A facile strategy was applied to prepare Cu(I)/Cu(II) MOFs, where the Cu(I) amount and porous structure can be adjusted by the degree of reduction and the size of HKUST-1, by partially reducing HKUST-1 with hydrazine hydrate at room temperature. The Cu(I)/Cu(II) MOFs exhibit excellent catalytic capability in the Cu(I)-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition.

40223582	A self-catabolic smart DNAzyme nanocapsule for amplified chemo-photodynamic therapy.	Violent degradation strategies of traditional nucleic acid hydrogels may bring adverse toxicity to complex biological systems when administered systemically due to uncontrolled digestion. Herein, an Mn<sup>2+</sup>-driven self-catabolic smart deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) nanocapsule is developed for precise on-demand drug release to amplify cancer chemo-photodynamic therapy. Loaded manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) can generate oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to overcome tumor hypoxia and enhance photodynamic therapy, and a microRNA-21 (miR-21) antisense sequence can adsorb and clear intracellular miR-21 to amplify chemotherapy. The encoded DNAzymes and substrate sequences enable the programmable digestion of nucleic acid hydrogel carriers with Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions as cofactors, so as to accurately deliver various therapeutic drugs. The results show that the smart nanocapsules can amplify chemo-photodynamic therapy by improving hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment and functional genes to kill tumor cells, which is expected to play an important role in tumor diagnosis and treatment.
40223581	Aquatic eDNA outperforms sedimentary eDNA for the detection of estuarine fish communities in subtropical coastal vegetated ecosystems.	In South Africa, mangrove forests and seagrass meadows often co-occur in estuarine systems and in combination host rich, often endemic biodiversity. There is an urgent need to explore community diversity in coastal vegetated ecosystems, given the degrading effects of climate change and anthropogenic pressures. Environmental DNA metabarcoding is a promising biomonitoring tool in South African coastal ecosystems, although studies highlight the need to optimise and standardise sampling protocols. This study aimed to contribute to developing sampling protocols by understanding the applicability of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding within coastal vegetated habitats and by investigating diversity using two different sample types. Aquatic and sedimentary environmental DNA samples from three estuaries along the east coast of South Africa, in combination with MiFish metabarcoding, detected 148 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) representing 67 fish genera from 50 families, although only 16% were resolved to species. We observed that aquatic eDNA samples detected 97% of the total fish diversity, suggesting that this is an efficient tool to comprehensively detect ichthyofaunal diversity. We did not detect different fish communities between mangroves and seagrasses and our findings underscore the importance of taking hydrological connectivity into consideration for sampling design. Overall, our work reinforces key considerations for future eDNA metabarcoding studies focused on fish fauna in estuaries, and therefore contributes to optimising sampling protocols to support the biomonitoring of coastal biodiversity.
40223580	Learning Pairwise Interaction for Extrapolative and Interpretable Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with Physics-Informed Neural Network.	Achieving both robust extrapolation and physical interpretability in machine learning interatomic potentials (ML-IPs) for atomistic simulation remains a significant challenge, particularly in data-scarce areas such as chemical reactions or complex, multicomponent materials at extreme conditions. Here, we present a pairwise-decomposed physics-informed neural network (P2Net) that parametrizes an analytical bond-order potential (BOP) layer to decouple the energy contributions of atomic pairs. By leveraging fundamental physical principles, P2Net demonstrates excellence at extrapolating beyond its training regime and accurately capturing molecular geometries far from equilibrium. The pairwise energy decomposition further empowers the bond analyses for deprotonation and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, which is not easy with most ML-IPs. The atomic pair energy offers how to elucidate the evolution of interatomic interactions as a reaction proceeds. Our methodology highlights enhanced data efficiency in building ML-IPs and facilitates more informative postsimulation analysis, thereby broadening the applicability of ML-IPs to complex and reactive systems.

To present the long-term outcomes of men with Grade Group (GG) 1 prostate cancer (PCa), included in the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study, and to assess the effect of the inclusion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within the active surveillance (AS) protocol.
40223577	B Cells as a Host of Persistent Salmonella Typhimurium.	Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) can colonise different intracellular niches, either actively dividing or remaining dormant to persist. Bacterial persisters are phenotypic variants that temporarily enter a nonreplicative state. This allows them to evade host cell defences and antibiotics, leading to chronic infections. We previously reported that during chronic periods, Salmonella remains within B cells in the bone marrow and spleen. However, the dynamics of Salmonella replication and the formation of antibiotic tolerance in infected B cells have not been studied. Here we show that B cells are a favourable reservoir for bacterial persistence. In vitro and in vivo experiments identified non-replicating, persistent Salmonella subsets in splenic B cells. These non-replicative Salmonella are tolerant to antibiotics (cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin), while replicative bacteria remain susceptible. Infected mice demonstrated viable, nonreplicative Salmonella in spleen B cells, maintaining antibiotic tolerance. Although acid intravacuolar pH and SPI-2 regulators (SsrA/SsrB) are not necessary for Salmonella persistence in B cells, the SehA/B and RelE/B toxin-antitoxin system facilitates the formation of the persistent phenotype in Salmonella. Overall, we show that B cells are a reservoir for nonreplicating, antibiotic-tolerant Salmonella.
40223574	Enhanced disgust generalization in obsessive-compulsive disorder is related to insula and putamen hyperactivity.	Compulsive cleaning is a characteristic symptom of a particular subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and is often accompanied by intense disgust. While overgeneralization of threat is a key factor in the development of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, previous studies have primarily focused on fear generalization and have rarely examined disgust generalization. A systematic determination of the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying disgust generalization in individuals with contamination concern is crucial for enhancing our understanding of OCD.
40223573	The long reach of puberty: mechanisms underlying sex-dependent links between pubertal timing and adult internalizing symptoms.	Pubertal development variations have consequences for adolescent internalizing problems, which likely continue into adulthood. Key questions concern the extent of these links between pubertal timing and adult symptoms, as well as the underlying mechanisms.
40223572	Reusable Selenenyl Iodide-Initiated Cascade Cyclization of Polyenes with N-terminating Groups.	Although cascade cyclization of polyenes has advanced remarkably, most reported examples are limited to carbon- or oxygen-terminating groups, with nitrogen-terminating cyclizations remaining rare. In this work, we developed a cascade cyclization of polyenes with N-terminating groups, initiated by an isolable selenenyl iodide (RSeI) bearing a cavity-shaped substituent. Acid-labile substrates were successfully employed in the cascade cyclization. Compared with commonly used organoselenium reagents, a selenenyl iodide, characterized by its unique soft electrophilic nature, proved to be the most effective in promoting the cascade reaction. Furthermore, the stabilizing effect of the cavity-shaped substituent enabled the isolation of a selenenic acid (RSeOH), which was generated via oxidative β-selenoxide elimination from the cyclized product during its derivatization to an olefin, as a stable compound. We also developed a method for regenerating the starting selenenyl iodide from the selenenic acid. The reusability of the selenenyl iodide renders the series of molecular transformations environmentally benign by reducing unwanted organoselenium waste.
40223571	Development of the PRINTQUAL-Web Tool for Assessing the Quality of Online News Reporting of Suicide.	<b></b><i>Background:</i> Suicide prevention strategies internationally recommend promoting responsible media reporting of suicide to reduce negative impacts on population suicides. Existing tools to assess the quality of suicide reporting do not capture specific harmful features of the online setting. We aimed to adapt PRINTQUAL, a tool for assessing newspaper reporting of suicide, for online news reports. <i>Methods:</i> We identified all online news reports about the 2020 suicide of a British female television celebrity over a 14-month period and used content analysis to identify features of poor-quality and good-quality reporting based on media guidelines on suicide reporting. We gained expert consensus on items to include negative/poor-quality and positive/good-quality subscales for the new tool: PRINTQUAL-web. Weightings were calculated using an expert judgement ranking exercise. <i>Results:</i> Content analysis of 342 online articles published from 15/02/20 to 05/04/21 identified 18 items for a proposed negative/poor-quality subscale and four items for a positive/good-quality subscale, gaining consensus on inclusion/exclusion and weightings, and rescaling scores for easier interpretation. <i>Limitations:</i> PRINTQUAL-web does not account for article prominence or quantitative reach (e.g., views or circulation) and relies on a binary agree/disagree rating which may not capture nuance. <i>Conclusions:</i> The PRINTQUAL-web and PRINTQUAL tools assess the quality of online and print reporting of suicide, respectively, with rescaling permitting score comparisons across different corpora of reporting.
40223570	The Essence of Nature Can be the Simplest (2)-- Self-Inhibition Boundary: Keeping away from Extracellular Fenton Reactions.	The formation of boundaries, or inhibition zones, between neighboring colonies is a prevalent phenomenon in nature, occurring not only between different species but also within the same species or even within a single colony. The first paper in this series presents extracellular Fenton chemistry as an alternative mechanism for cellular energy production. Specifically, PKS-derived polycyclic aromatic metabolites initiate and amplify robust extracellular Fenton reactions, whereas NRPS-derived siderophores or iron chelators recycle iron and protect the host from the potentially harmful effects of these reactions. Our findings further demonstrate that extracellular Fenton reactions are pivotal in the formation of boundaries, both within and between strains and species. PKS-derived aromatic metabolites promote the establishment of self-inhibition boundaries, while NRPS-derived siderophores primarily alleviate these boundaries. Notably, the development of these boundaries can be modulated by adjusting media components, such as proteins and starch, thereby influencing metabolic pathways. Consequently, experimental methodologies should be redesigned not merely to assess the antibiotic properties of compounds or metabolites, but to investigate their involvement in extracellular Fenton reactions and self-protection mechanisms, which are fundamental to understanding their natural biological roles.

40223568	Removal of Sulfonamide Antibiotics in Peracetic Acid-Mediated Natural Polyphenol Systems via an Overlooked Polymerization Pathway: Role of <i>ortho</i>-Quinones.	Natural polyphenols can be oxidized into reactive quinones, which might play a key role in the removal of specific contaminants in natural polyphenol-related advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In this study, peracetic acid (PAA) was employed in combination with natural protocatechuic acid (PCA) to remove sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) from water. More than 95% removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and other SAs was observed in the PCA/PAA system, and neutral pH conditions (5.0-8.0) were more conducive to the removal of SMX. The PCA/PAA system exhibited a great anti-interference ability against complex water matrices. <i>ortho</i>-Quinone, generated from the oxidation of PCA by PAA, played a dominant role in the SMX removal. Electrons tended to transfer from SMX to the generated <i>ortho</i>-quinones and form covalent bonds, resulting in the production of less toxic oligomers via the overlooked polymerization pathway. A reduction in the toxicity of the SMX solution was found following treatment with the PCA/PAA system. More interestingly, several polyphenols structurally related to PCA could also facilitate SMX removal using PAA as the oxidant. Overall, this study proposes a novel strategy for developing reactive quinones dominated AOPs with robust anti-interference performance, as well as enhances the understanding of contaminant removal via an overlooked polymerization pathway in natural polyphenol-related AOPs.
40223567	Salt-Resistant and Ethanol-Resistant Monoamine Oxidases: New Sight for <i>yobN</i> Mining from <i>Bacillus</i> and Biogenic Amine Degradation Mechanism in Fermented Food.	Amine oxidases have strong capabilities for the degradation of biogenic amines (BAs) in fermented foods. However, their application is limited by substrate specificity, and high concentrations of ethanol and salt can hinder their effectiveness. This study presents a novel approach utilizing comparative genomics, protein clustering analysis, and full homology modeling to identify three amine oxidases: KCYOBN from the salt-resistant <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, and LYYOBN1 and LYYOBN2 from the ethanol-resistant <i>Bacillus cereus</i>. These enzymes are highly similar in structure and exhibit broad substrate specificities. KCYOBN maintains over 84% relative activity at 20% (w/v) NaCl, while LYYOBN1 and LYYOBN2 retain over 32 and 21% relative activity at 25% vol ethanol. Variations in key residues are one of the reasons for the differences in tolerance. In fermented foods, KCYOBN degraded 45.97% of the total BAs in cooking wine and 38.33% in fish sauce. LYYOBN1 achieved the highest degradation rate of 32.93% in <i>huangjiu</i>. LYYOBN2 exhibited degradation rates of 30.00% in soy sauce and 35.14% in wine with no significant impact on flavor compounds. The significance of this work lies in the identification of the novel salt-resistant KCYOBN and ethanol-resistant LYYOBN1 and LYYOBN2 through this new method, which can simultaneously degrade multiple BAs and have a broad application potential.
40223566	Predicting acute toxicity of pesticides towards <i>Daphnia magna</i> with random forest algorithm.	A large number of pesticides are released into the environment, resulting in serious threat for aquatic organisms. In this work, 15 quantum chemical descriptors were used to develop a quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) model for toxicity pEC<sub>50</sub> of 745 pesticides towards <i>Daphnia magna</i>, by using random forest algorithm. The optimal QSTR model in this paper yielded a coefficient of determination of 0.828, root-mean-square error of 0.798, and mean absolute error of 0.628 for the test set of 149 pesticides, which are accurate values compared with those of QSTR models published recently. Research has revealed that increasing molecular size (or molar volume), the most positive atomic Mulliken (or APT) charge with hydrogens summed into heavy, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy, can result in higher toxicity pEC<sub>50</sub>. Increasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy and the HOMO and LUMO energy gap can lead to lower toxicity pEC<sub>50</sub>.

40223564	Core-Shell Hyperbranched Polymers via Catalytic Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization.	This work explores the synthesis, characterization, and applications of hyperbranched polymers (HBP) using a divergent ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) approach. An ABB'-type hyperbranching monomer, formed by covalently linking a traditional ROMP monomer to a chain transfer agent, was diluted with a linear comonomer to produce branched polymers with controlled molar mass and dispersity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and X-ray scattering confirmed their globular shape in solution. Additionally, we functionalized HBPs to create core-shell materials capable of encapsulating organic dyes efficiently. The study also highlights their role in sustainable polymer design, demonstrating degradation under mild acidic conditions. Core-shell particles synthesized via this approach enabled efficient capture and rapid, on-demand release of guest molecules, emphasizing their potential in drug delivery and advanced materials science.
40223563	Cultural variability in dementia caregiver motivations: Unraveling unique and common drivers.	<b>Introduction:</b> In the Netherlands, approximately 800,000 individuals act as informal caregivers for people with dementia. Current policies prioritize care within the home setting, often relying on informal caregivers for support, assisted by care professionals. Given the wide ethnocultural diversity among dementia caregivers in the Netherlands, it is crucial to understand how these cultural differences influence caregiving. Given the emphasis on researching barriers to providing care in literature, this study specifically focused on motivators and facilitators to providing care. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted semi-structured interviews, both with caregivers of native Dutch patients (<i>n</i> = 11) and caregivers of patients with a migration background (<i>n</i> = 9), who all provided care at home for patients with dementia. Data was collected using an interview guide and open, axial and selective coding were used to analyze the transcripts of the interviews in Atlas.ti. <b>Results:</b> Four themes were identified. First, culturally shared motivators to providing care emerged, such as having a unique bond with the person with dementia and themes of reciprocity. Second, culture specific perspectives were identified, with Dutch caregivers often spontaneously reporting considering professional care, while culturally diverse caregivers stressed the available network of informal caregivers and their ability to persevere. Third, personal philosophies on life were a driver to provide care for caregivers of native Dutch patients, while religion mainly served as a source of strength in continuing to provide care in the culturally diverse group. Lastly, adult child caregivers benefit from supportive home environments and from using structure and routine in providing care. <b>Discussion:</b> Our findings show that the decision to provide care often seems driven by reciprocity and the prior quality of the relationship with the person with dementia, contrasting with previous work suggesting that religion is a main reason to provide care. Several recommendations are made how care professionals can take these factors into consideration when assisting caregivers.
40223562	Life's Essential 8 scores, socioeconomic deprivation, genetic susceptibility, and new-onset chronic kidney diseases.	The American Heart Association recently released a new cardiovascular health (CVH) metric, Life's Essential 8 (LE8), for health promotion. However, the association between LE8 scores and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains uncertain. We aimed to explore the association of LE8 scores with new-onset CKD and examine whether socioeconomic deprivation and genetic risk modify this association.
40223561	Dog-assisted interventions for children and adults with mental health or neurodevelopmental conditions: systematic review.

40223560	Post-diagnostic support in Australia: Perspectives of people recently diagnosed with dementia and their carers.	<i>Introduction:</i> Timely post-diagnostic support is necessary to help people with dementia and those who provide care adapt to the diagnosis and optimise independence and quality of life. However, evidence from people with dementia and carers regarding the support they need is scarce. <i>Aim:</i> To explore the perspectives of people with dementia and their carers regarding the support they had been offered, barriers and facilitators to accessing such support, and support they viewed as desirable or ideal. <i>Method:</i> This was a cross-sectional qualitative exploratory study. Data were collected from individual interviews with 13 people recently diagnosed with dementia at nine Australian memory clinics and 17 carers. Interviews were conducted between September 2021 and October 2022. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to examine participants' comments under four topics: Current Care and Support, Barriers, Facilitators, and Desirable Care and Support. <i>Results:</i> Current Care and Support: Four themes emerged: Communication with empathy; Written information valuable but could be overwhelming; Referrals provided but not necessarily followed; A focus on prescribed anti-dementia medications. Under the topic of Barriers, three themes were derived: Dementia stigma restricts life after diagnosis; Disapointment in Health and Aged Care systems; Limited insight into and/or difficulty expressing own needs. Under the topic of Facilitators, comments focused on Support from family and friends is crucial. Under the topic of Desirable Care and Support, three themes emerged: A single person guiding ongoing post-diagnostic support; Support with driving concerns; Engaging and tailored information. <i>Conclusion:</i> Perspectives of people recently diagnosed with dementia and their carers identified the need to ensure that post-diagnostic support addressed their individual needs, was clear, ongoing and involved the support of family and friends to reduce barriers and facilitate access. The importance of guidance by a trusted professional support person was considered key in facilitating more effective post-diagnostic dementia care.
40223559	A teicoplanin-cyclodextrin bilayer chiral stationary phase boosts chiral separation of native amino acids.	Separating enantiomers is crucial for advancing scientific research. Teicoplanin-based columns exhibit unique advantages in the chiral separation of native amino acids, and its further improvement for better separation performance is valuable. This work reports double-layer bridged columns, in which different amounts of cyclodextrin (CD) were directly bridged onto teicoplanin (TK) molecules on the chiral stationary phase (TK CSP) to prepare TK-CD-2 CSP and TK-CD-6 CSP. Additionally, a column with the two chiral selectors (TK and CD) arranged in a single layer on the silica gel surface (TK + CD CSP) was prepared, which served as a control group. The results revealed that TK-CD-6 CSP exhibited better chiral separation ability for native amino acids and a wider range of separable chiral molecules than TK, TK + CD, and TK-CD-2 CSPs. The possible mechanism is that the dual-layer structure of the TK-CD-6 CSP effectively reduces the competition between the different chiral selectors and provides more chiral recognition sites, which enhances the separation ability and achieves broad-spectrum chiral separation. This work offers valuable insights for enhancing the chiral separation ability of teicoplanin-based columns and developing liquid chromatographic strategies with separation diversity.
40223558	Source apportionment, criteria derivation, and health risk assessment of heavy metals in urban green space soils.	Urban green spaces play a crucial role in maintaining urban resilience and offering opportunities for outdoor activities to residents. The potential hazards of heavy metals in the soils of these green spaces have raised significant concerns. A total of 130 topsoil samples containing seven heavy metals were collected from 50 urban green spaces in Tianjin, China. The study aimed to identify and quantify the potential sources of these heavy metals, establish general assessment criteria (GAC) for the metals, and evaluate the associated human health risks based on their concentration and sources. The findings indicated minimal pollution from heavy metals in the soils of Tianjin's urban green spaces. Through the use of positive matrix factorization (PMF), correlation analysis, and spatial interpolation, the study identified four main sources of heavy metals: traffic emissions, natural sources, industrial activities, and agricultural activities. Discrepancies between the contaminated land exposure assessment (CLEA) model-derived GAC and China's soil screening values were attributed to differences in land use scenarios. Moreover, concentration-specific health risk assessments revealed that protection area green spaces posed a higher risk to human health compared to park green spaces. The study also highlighted that natural factors correlated with cobalt and agricultural activities related to arsenic significantly contributed to non-carcinogenic risks in both adults and children. Arsenic-related agricultural activities were identified as key contributors to carcinogenic risks in children. The findings of this study are valuable for establishing soil quality standards, and provide a reference for the prevention and control of heavy metal pollution in urban greenfield soils as well as for the protection of the health of urban populations.
40223557	Hydrolysis of Organic Contaminants: Improving Laboratory Studies to Accurately Predict Environmental Transformation Rates.	Hydrolysis reactions comprise a widely studied class of abiotic transformation processes that impact the environmental fate of many organic contaminants. While hydrolysis rates are typically measured in buffered solutions in order to predict transformation rates in the environment, rate constants measured in laboratory buffers are often higher than values in corresponding natural water samples. In this Perspective, we summarize these discrepancies and prior explanations provided for their occurrence. Through modeling using two linear free energy relationships (i.e., the Swain-Scott and the Bro̷nsted relationships), we propose a simple but overlooked alternative explanation─namely, that hydrolysis reactions are often much more sensitive to constituents in laboratory buffers than often assumed. We suggest that buffers employed in standard practices (e.g., at 50 mM or higher concentrations recommended by regulatory guidelines) are expected to significantly catalyze many hydrolysis reactions by acting as nucleophiles or bases. Finally, we recommend strategies to successfully measure hydrolysis rates for more accurate predictions of contaminant transformation in environmental systems.
40223556	A quantitative analysis of the effects of target- and alternative-reinforcement rate on resurgence.	Resurgence is defined as an increase in a previously reinforced and reduced target response when conditions worsen for a more recently reinforced alternative response. The present experiment evaluated the effects of target- and alternative-reinforcer rate on resurgence in humans. We arranged combinations of contingent high- and low-rate target and high- and low-rate alternative reinforcement across four groups. When extinguishing all reinforcement, resurgence occurred only in groups experiencing a high rate of alternative reinforcement, with resurgence being higher in the group that experienced high rates of both target and alternative reinforcement. Our findings join those of others that indicate that rates of alternative reinforcement contribute more to resurgence than target-reinforcer rates. A quantitative model of resurgence, resurgence as choice in context (RaC<sup>2</sup>), tended to underpredict target responding and overpredict alternative responding in Phase 3. Including a misallocation parameter to account for a proportion of reinforcers misallocated between responses provided a better account of the findings.
40223555	A non-invasive way to enhance cosmetic efficacy by associating a cosmetic serum with a nanochip tapping.	Skincare cosmetics have long been central to daily facial care routines, while recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of home beauty devices.

Although various technological devices have been developed to meet these demands, research on the interactions between beauty devices and cosmetic products remains limited.
40223550	Alkyldimethylammoniumethyl Methacrylate Ionic Liquid Monomers and Their Poly(Ionic Liquid)s: Chain Length Dependent Crystallinity, Thermoresponsiveness, and Self-Assembly.	The studies of structure-property relationship in ionic liquid monomers (ILMs) and their corresponding poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) are required to gain deeper understanding of their tunable physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. In this work, a series of 2-(alkyldimethylammonium)ethyl methacrylate bromide ([R-DMAEMA][Br]) ILMs are synthesized followed by free-radical polymerization to obtain the analogous PILs with alkyl chains of varying lengths. The introduction of long alkyl chain induces crystallinity to these ILMs, whose melting temperature, enthalpy of fusion, and crystallinity increase with increasing the length of alkyl-chain. Exchange of Br<sup>-</sup> with bulkier NTf<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup> leads to a substantial change in the crystalline behavior of ILMs. The bromide-based PILs show detectable semicrystallinity due to the presence of crystallizable pendent long alkyl chains. Both bromide- and NTf<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>-based ILMs show strongly birefringent crystals of various morphologies but, the Br<sup>-</sup>-based PILs give fibrillar morphology of very weak birefringence. No such fibrils are observed for NTf<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>-based PILs. Except ILMs, the Br<sup>-</sup>-based PILs exhibit upper critical solution temperature (UCST)-type phase behavior in CHCl<sub>3</sub>, THF, CHCl<sub>3</sub>/<sup>i</sup>PrOH, and THF/<sup>i</sup>PrOH mixed solvents. The NTf<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>-based PILs exhibit such thermoresponsiveness only in THF. The Br<sup>-</sup>-based PILs self-assemble into vesicular nanostructures in CHCl<sub>3</sub> and THF capable of encapsulating model Eosin B dye.
40223549	High-Performance Integrated Micro-Vortex Air Filter Enabled With Honeycomb-Like Structured Nanofibrous Networks.	Particulate matter (PM) pollution has posed a serious threat to public health, especially with the outbreak of respiratory infections. However, most existing fiber filters face an inevitable trade-off between removal efficiency and air resistance, due to their thick fibers and uncontrolled flat stacking structure. Herein, a unique high-performance integrated micro-vortex filter is created using honeycomb-like structured cellular nanofibrous networks via the innovative electro-netting-assembly nanotechnique for air filtration. Manipulation of the ejection, deformation, and self-assembly of the charged droplets from the Taylor cone enables the one-step construction of 3D cellular cells with 2D nano architectured networks consisted of 1D nanowires with a diameter of ≈45 nm on a large-scale. The resultant micro-vortex air filter, functioned as an integrated filter system, achieved a remarkable air slip effect and striking micro-vortex cascade filtration mode, showing >99.97% PM<sub>0.3</sub> removal, ≈0.12% atmosphere pressure of air resistance, 27 g m<sup>-2</sup> dust holding, along with robust mechanical stability. This work may provide a promising avenue for the design and development of novel separation and purification materials.
40223548	Co(II) and Zn(II) Coordination Polymers with π-Conjugated Ligands for Enhanced Iodine Uptake in Vapor and Aqueous Media.	The efficient removal of radioiodine from an aqueous solution is crucial for the sustainable advancement of nuclear energy and environmental conservation. In this work, two π-conjugated nonporous coordination polymers, namely, {[Co(bqdc)(dpe)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O}<sub>n</sub> (Co-CP) and [Zn(bqdc)(dpe)]<sub>n</sub> (Zn-CP) (bqdc<sup>2-</sup> = 2,2'-biquinoline-4,4'-dicarboxylate and dpe = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene) were successfully synthesized and characterized. Single crystal X-ray analysis demonstrated that Co-CP and Zn-CP have different crystal structures. Co-CP displays the 1D chain via bidentate and monodentate coordination modes of bqdc<sup>2-</sup> and dpe, respectively, whereas Zn-CP presents a threefold interpenetrated 3D framework through bridging bidentated ligands. Both CPs exhibit a nonporous nature with high π-electron richness in the structural framework. Both compounds can adsorb iodine in vapor and solution phases with high adsorption capacity. The iodine adsorption capacities in the vapor phase at 70 °C are 3.54 and 1.57 g/g for Co-CP and Zn-CP, respectively. In addition, Co-CP and Zn-CP exhibit effective iodine adsorption in aqueous solutions with capacities of 2315.86 and 2032.97 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, competing anion adsorption, and iodine adsorption in real water samples were studied. The iodine adsorption mechanism is due to electron transfer from the effective sorption sites of CPs to iodine, forming the charge transfer complex, which was confirmed by FTIR, PXRD, EDX, and XPS techniques. They can also be reused to capture iodine in an aqueous solution with the ability to retain a high level of effectiveness.
40223547	Waterborne Polyurethane-Stabilized Hydrogel Coating with Lubrication and Antibacterial Properties on Medical Catheters.	Medical catheters require lubrication and antimicrobial properties to reduce complications, such as tissue trauma and bacterial infections. Coating hydrogel on the catheter surface is a promising strategy; however, it usually faces the challenge of weak interfacial adhesion, thus leading to coating delamination or fracture and failure. Here, a waterborne polyurethane (WPU)-triggered surface bonding strategy was presented to construct hydrogel coatings, which involved two key steps: (i) coating a sticky WPU layer on the catheter surface and (ii) dip-coating the WPU-coated catheter with a monomer solution consisting of quaternary ammonium chitosan (QCS), sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA), <i>N</i>-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP), and zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O) for growing the hydrogel layer by ultraviolet initiation. The hydrogel coating demonstrated tough adhesion performance to the catheter, and the interfacial bonding strength achieved 536 N/m. Meanwhile, the hydrogel coating had a variable thickness adjusted by QCS and possessed excellent hydrophilicity (WCA = 24.6°) and low surface friction properties (COF = 0.0357) based on the formation of the hydration layer. Furthermore, the introduction of ZnSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O endowed the hydrogel coating with prominent antimicrobial properties against <i>Escherichia coli</i> (Gram-negative bacteria) and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> (Gram-positive bacteria). This approach paves an avenue for fabricating hydrogel coatings with strong interface stability, controllable thickness, lubrication, and antibacterial properties.

40223545	Development of Novel PRMT7 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.	Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a prevalent malignancy in men and warrants novel and efficacious therapy. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) has been recently identified as a promising target for PCa treatment, however, the development of efficacious PRMT7 inhibitors is limited. Herein, we reported an effective and selective PRMT7 inhibitor, <b>A33</b>, which was obtained through structural optimization and exhibited potent anti-PCa efficacy in vitro and in vivo. <b>A33</b> significantly inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells and induced substantial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, <b>A33</b> decreased the monomethylarginine level in PCa cells, regulated tumor metastasis-, proliferation-, and apoptosis-associated proteins, and enhanced antitumor innate immunity by targeting PRMT7. More importantly, <b>A33</b> exhibited low toxicity and effectively suppressed PCa tumor growth in the DU-145 xenograft tumor model. Collectively, this study provides a novel potent PRMT7 inhibitor for further anti-PCa drug discovery.
40223544	Arginine <i>N</i>-glycosylation of melittin enhances its bacteriostatic activity and antiproliferative therapeutic index.	Melittin is a natural antimicrobial peptide isolated from bee venom, and the non-specific cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity severely limit its clinical application. Glycosylation of proteins is very common in physiological and biochemical processes and can modulate the interaction of proteins with their target. In this study, eight glycosyl groups were used to modify the arginine of melittin at sites 22 and/or 24, and single and double arginine <i>N</i>-glycosylated peptides were designed and synthesized. Among the acquired 24 glycopeptides, MLT-1c, MLT-3c, MLT-1f, MLT-3f, MLT-1g, and MLT-3h were found to possess higher helicity, while MLT-3c, MLT-3f and MLT-3h showed dramatically reduced hemolytic activity, especially MLT-3c, whose HC<sub>50</sub> value is 199.3 μM. MLT-1a, MLT-3a and MLT-2c exhibited improved inhibitory activity against <i>Puzza streptococcus</i>, and the MIC was 4 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>. MLT-1e and MLT-2g have the strongest tolerance to trypsase, and MLT-3c has the highest therapeutic index. In general, rhamnosyl-modified melittin MLT-3c could be a potent agent for antibacterial and antitumor therapy with high stability and low hemolytic side effects.

40223542	Back to the basics: the molecular blueprint of plant heat stress transcription factors.	Heat stress transcription factors (HSFs) play a pivotal role in regulating plant responses to heat and other environmental stresses, as well as developmental processes. HSFs possess conserved domains responsible for DNA binding, oligomerization, and transcriptional regulation, which collectively enable precise and dynamic control of cellular responses to environmental stimuli. Functional diversification of HSFs has been demonstrated through genetic studies in model plants such as <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and economically important crops like tomato, rice, and wheat. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern HSF function remain only partially understood, and for a handful of HSFs. Advancements in structural biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and genomics shed light into how HSFs mediate stress responses at the molecular level. These insights offer exciting opportunities to leverage HSF biology for gene editing and crop improvement, enabling the customization of stress tolerance traits via regulation of HSF-dependent regulatory networks to enhance thermotolerance. This review synthesizes current knowledge on HSF structure and function, providing a perspective on their roles in plant adaptation to a changing climate.

40223540	Reverse Regioselective Dicarbofunctionalization via anti-Michael-type Addition.	Vicinal dicarbofunctionalization of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a classical yet versatile method for constructing complex molecular architectures in a single step. However, the regioselectivity is typically governed by the electronic properties of the alkene moiety, leading to the introduction of a nucleophile at the β-position and an electrophile at the α-position. Herein, we report a palladium-catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti-Michael-type addition, achieving reverse regioselectivity relative to traditional approaches. This strategy enables the efficient incorporation of various (hetero)arene nucleophiles at the α-position and carbon electrophiles, including iodoarenes, vinyl iodides, and iodomethane, at the β-position to furnish dicarbofunctionalized amides in good yields. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeds through an alkylpalladium intermediate formed via the α-addition of a nucleophile.
40223539	The involvement of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) and 9 (CDK9) in coordinating transcription and cell cycle checkpoint regulation.	Cells regulate the expression of cell cycle-related genes, including cyclins essential for mitosis, through the transcriptional activity of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a complex comprising CDK9, cyclin T, and transcription factors. P-TEFb cooperates with CDK7 to activate RNA polymerase. In response to DNA stress, the cell cycle shifts from mitosis to repair, triggering cell cycle arrest and the activation of DNA repair genes. This tight coordination between transcription, cell cycle progression, and DNA stress response is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity. Cyclin-dependent kinases CDK7 and CDK9 are central to both transcription and cell cycle regulation. CDK7 functions as the CDK-activating kinase (CAK), essential for activating other CDKs, while CDK9 acts as a critical integrator of signals from both the cell cycle and transcriptional machinery. This review elucidates the mechanisms by which CDK7 and CDK9 regulate the mitotic process and cell cycle checkpoints, emphasizing their roles in balancing cell growth, homeostasis, and DNA repair through transcriptional control.
40223538	A fluorescent nonconjugated zwitterionic polymer dot: hydrothermal synthesis and application in the nano-molar sensing of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol.	Developing nonconjugated polymer dot-based sensors with high quantum yield for a targeted application is a challenging research field. Herein, we report the synthesis of a zwitterionic polymer dot (PD PAMAM 2.5, average diameter 12 nm), which contains a poly(aminoamide) core and amine and acid groups on the surface. The molecular structure and functionalities of the polymer dot were carefully established using various spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, FTIR, and XPS. The polymer dot revealed greenish blue/aqua emission (<i>λ</i><sub>max</sub> = 470 nm) with a quantum yield of 28%. The mechanism for the synthesis of polymer dot with respect to its structure and fluorescence property was examined using a combination of techniques, including NMR, zeta potential and fluorescence spectrometry. The application of the fluorescent polymer dot for the selective detection of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol was studied in detail. The limit of detection was determined to be 0.77 nM, which was the best value among the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, application of the polymer dot in real life scenarios was demonstrated using real life wastewater samples and a paper-based strip-test method.

40223534	Flexible 3D Kirigami Probes for In Vitro and In Vivo Neural Applications.	3D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are gaining popularity as brain-machine interfaces and platforms for studying electrophysiological activity. Interactions with neural tissue depend on the electrochemical, mechanical, and spatial features of the recording platform. While planar or protruding 2D MEAs are limited in their ability to capture neural activity across layers, existing 3D platforms still require advancements in manufacturing scalability, spatial resolution, and tissue integration. In this work, a customizable, scalable, and straightforward approach to fabricate flexible 3D kirigami MEAs containing both surface and penetrating electrodes, designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue, is presented. These novel probes feature up to 512 electrodes distributed across 128 shanks in a single flexible device, with shank heights reaching up to 1 mm. The 3D kirigami MEAs are successfully deployed in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns. Flexible 3D kirigami MEAs are therefore a powerful tool for large-scale electrical sampling of complex neural tissues while improving tissue integration and offering enhanced capabilities for analyzing neural disorders and disease models where high spatial resolution is required.
40223533	Metallized hollow-COF nanobowls with dual-mode ROS generation for cancer sonodynamic therapy.	Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as an encouraging route in tumor treatment, due to its exceptional tissue penetration depth and favorable safety profile. Nevertheless, the clinical translation of conventional organic sonosensitizers is hindered by intrinsic limitations, including pronounced hydrophobicity, insufficient chemical stability, and low reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In contrast, hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs) exhibit exceptional cargo-loading capabilities, structural robustness, and biocompatibility, positioning them as ideal nanoplatforms for advanced therapeutic applications. Herein, we engineered a bowl-shaped HCOF architecture designed to amplify ultrasonic cavitation effects. This nanostructure was subsequently functionalized with the sonosensitizer (Hemin) and subjected to strategic metallization <i>via</i> metal ion incorporation, culminating in the development of a high-efficiency antitumor nanosystem (FeHHCA). FeHHCA can achieve dual-mode ROS generation, namely, sonodynamic synergistically generating <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and being specifically activated by a tumor microenvironment (TME) to generate ˙OH through a Fenton-like reaction, achieving an 78.7% tumor inhibition rate <i>in vivo</i>. These findings offer innovative approaches and strategies for the design of hollow COFs and offer great potential for the application of SDT in cancer treatment.
40223532	A Charge-Coupled Phototransistor Enabling Synchronous Dynamic and Static Image Detection.	Emerging machine vision applications require efficient detection of both dynamic events and static grayscale information within visual scenes. Current dynamic vision and active pixel sensors (DAVIS) technology integrates event-driven vision sensors and active pixel sensors within single pixels. However, the complex multi-component pixel architecture, typically requiring 15-50 transistors, limits integration density, increases power consumption, and complicates clock synchronization. Here, a charge-coupled phototransistor is presented that uses dual photosensitive capacitors to provide gate voltage to a single transistor channel, enabling simultaneous capture of dynamic and static information, surpassing existing DAVIS technology. Under illumination, both top and bottom gates generate photogenerated electrons through a charge-coupling effect; electrons in the top gate are blocked by a thick dielectric layer, producing a stable current change for static grayscale detection, while electrons in the bottom gate tunnel through a thin dielectric layer, creating transient current spikes for dynamic event detection. This device demonstrates a dynamic range of 120 dB and a response time of 15 µs, comparable to traditional DAVIS pixels, while significantly reducing power consumption to 10 pW and overcoming clock synchronization issues. This charge-coupled phototransistor paves the way for the development of high-performance, low-power, and highly integrated machine vision technology.
40223531	Sensitive gas spectroscopy method for real-time determination of urease activity <i>via</i> ammonia production.	In this study we propose the use of a laser-based photoacoustic spectrometer as a new method to investigate the kinetics of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) emission from the hydrolysis of urea (H<sub>2</sub>N-CO-NH<sub>2</sub>) in the presence of urease. Experiments explored the effects of varying the amounts of water and urease on nitrogen (N) loss from urea aqueous solutions. A linear increase in N-NH<sub>3</sub> loss and the maximum emission rate (<i>r</i><sub>NH<sub>3</sub></sub>) was observed with increasing certified urease concentrations. Specifically, the addition of 10 units of urease resulted in an N loss of 8.1%, with a sensitivity of approximately 0.8% per unit of urease, and reached 12.8 μmol min<sup>-1</sup> with a sensitivity of 1.1 μmol min<sup>-1</sup> per unit of urease for <i>r</i><sub>NH<sub>3</sub></sub>. These relationships enabled the estimation of urease quantities in commercial soy flour extracts. Variations in water and urease proportions revealed that maximum NH<sub>3</sub> emissions occurred within the first 2-5 h, with the highest N-NH<sub>3</sub> loss value attaining (9 ± 1)% for samples containing 2.0 mL soy flour extracts and additional water. For urease concentration assays, N-NH<sub>3</sub> loss and <i>r</i><sub>NH<sub>3</sub></sub> were (14.4 ± 0.1)% and (25.3 ± 0.1) μmol min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, with 4.0 mL of soy flour extract. The results underscored the dominant influence of urease compared to that of water in urea hydrolysis. The PA spectrometer demonstrated sufficient sensitivity for detecting NH<sub>3</sub>, rendering it a promising tool for studying urease activity in urea decomposition. Future work could explore this system under crop field conditions to elucidate the roles of urease and water in the cycling of nutrients within agroecosystems.

40223525	Defective plane induced fractal TON zeolites for efficient hydroisomerization of long-chain hydrocarbons.	Fractal crystals are a class of fascinating crystals in this world, typically captured in dense crystal phases like snowflakes, graphene, and metal alloys. Nevertheless, such crystal analogues are quite rare in framework crystal phases, and their structural origins remain an intriguing enigma. In this work, we successfully constructed a series of fractal TON zeolites <i>via</i> a rare twinning mode, thereby revealing their structural origins. The continuous rotational electron diffraction technique solved its unique crystallographic structure. The fractal boundary exhibited coherence along the {021} facets and left the periodic dangling silanol defects. As evidenced by spatial element reconstruction and structural analysis, we found that the TON fractal was triggered by organic cations anchoring heteroatoms at the framework T3 site. Such fractal dimensions of TON can be effectively tailored by adjusting the heteroatom concentration in the synthetic system. The Pt-loaded fractal TON zeolite bifunctional catalyst demonstrated remarkable performance in the hydroisomerization of <i>n</i>-hexadecane with a maximum isomer yield of 84.4%, which is 28.9% higher than that of the Pt/rod-like TON catalyst, attributed to the more accessible active sites of the fractal architecture. Unravelling the twinning structure and its origin of zeotype catalysts would afford novel insights for the development of promising advanced heterogeneous catalysts.
40223524	Semi-dry transfer of CVD graphene on Si: surface morphology and electronic properties.	To expand the possible applications, chemical vapor deposition grown graphene needs to be transferred to appropriate substrates such as a silicon wafer. Although enormous efforts have been devoted to transfer graphene to various substrates using many different methods, the quality of the final product is still insufficient. We develop a new process named semi-dry transfer, which combines wet etching and dry transfer to obtain graphene with a clean interface with the substrate. For this purpose, an adhesive tape is attached to a sacrificial polymer deposited on the synthesized graphene, which allows the graphene to be easily manipulated so that it can be carefully cleaned before being precisely transferred onto target substrates, here silicon (Si) surfaces. We used this technique to transfer up to 4 × 4 cm<sup>2</sup> of graphene onto SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrates. Using various analysis techniques such as low energy electron diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, Raman, Auger electron and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, we demonstrate that our transferred graphene on Si is continuous, clean and that it is very promising for device fabrication. Graphene transistors show transport properties comparable with the state-of-the-art.
40223523	Artificial Mitochondrial Nanorobots Deliver Energy In Vivo by Oral Administration.	Delivering energy in vivo is essential for treating mitochondrial damage-related diseases. Current methods, including natural mitochondrial transplantation and artificial energy delivery systems, lack non-destructive, external energy-free, and clinically viable potential solutions. Here, artificial mitochondrial nanorobots (AMNs) carrying high-energy phosphate bonds rebuild the in vivo energy supply system to provide energy. Using ischemic heart disease (IHD) as an energy-deficient disease model and the oral route, which has high patient compliance and facilitates long-term administration, to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of AMNs. AMNs remain stable in the gastrointestinal tract, cross the intestinal barrier via a barrier-crossing unit, and target damaged heart tissue and cardiomyocytes using a motion unit chemotactically. Intracellularly, their energy-generating unit provides high-energy phosphate bonds for ATP synthesis (duration 12 h), while synergistically reducing inflammation and restoring cell viability. At the same frequency of administration, oral AMNs (50 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) match intravenous AMNs (10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in therapeutic efficacy, offering a convenient approach to improving cardiac function. Transcriptomics confirm that 200 µg AMNs emulate 5 × 10⁶ natural mitochondria, restoring energy metabolism and structural function in damaged hearts at the genetic level. This innovative design opens a new pathway for the construction of artificial energy delivery systems in vivo.
40223522	Remodeling of Effector and Regulatory T Cells by Capture and Utilization of miRNAs Using Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Tumor-Specific Photothermal Immunotherapy.	In immunotherapy for malignant tumors, the dysregulation of the balance between effector T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the uncertain efficacy due to individual differences have been considered as two critical challenges. In this study, we engineered an injectable nanocomposite hydrogel system (SNAs@M-Gel) capable of suppressing Treg proliferation and blocking PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immune evasion effectively, achieved through the stimulus-responsive modulation of multiple tumor-associated microRNAs. Simultaneously, this system enables microRNA-dependent photothermal immunotherapy, facilitating a highly efficient and personalized approach to tumor treatment. Specifically, oxidized sodium alginate (OSA) and cancer cell membrane (CCM)-encapsulated spherical nucleic acid nanoparticles (SNAs@M) were used to construct the SNAs@M-Gel hydrogel in situ at the tumor site through the formation of pH-sensitive Schiff base bonding and cross-linking using endogenous calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>). During treatment, SNAs@M-Gel was retained locally for up to 10 days, and SNAs@M nanoparticles were continuously released into the tumor microenvironment. Through the targeting ability of CCM, SNAs@M precisely entered tumor cells and specifically hybridized with the overexpressed miR-214 and miR-130a, leading to a significant downregulation of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and the restoration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function suppressed by Tregs, thereby remodeling the immune microenvironment. In addition, miRNAs functioned as cross-linking agents, facilitating the aggregation of SNAs and allowing the localized production of photothermal agents directly inside tumor cells, which, under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, promoted highly selective photothermal therapy. This cascade of events not only led to the destruction of the primary tumor but also resulted in the release of a substantial number of tumor-related antigens, which triggered the maturation of adjacent dendritic cells (DCs) and subsequent priming of tumor-specific CTLs, while simultaneously depleting Tregs, thereby reversing the tumor-promoting immune microenvironment and enhancing the overall therapeutic efficacy of photothermal immunotherapy.
40223521	Nanoresonance Cavity and Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Enhanced Broad-Spectral Photodetector for Versatile Applications.	To overcome the limitations inherent in traditional silicon (Si)-based photodetectors, particularly the low light absorption and complex carrier dynamics, this study proposes and fabricates in situ three-dimensional (3D) graphene/Si Schottky junctions integrated with WS<sub>2</sub> quantum dots (QDs). The introduction of WS<sub>2</sub> QDs enables the heterojunction to realize "double-enhanced absorption" by the synergistic effect of the natural nanoresonant cavity effect and the surface plasmon resonance effect (LSPR) of the WS<sub>2</sub> QDs. Photodetectors constructed from the WS<sub>2</sub> QDs/3D-graphene/Si heterojunction demonstrate a broadband, self-powered response from 440 to 1850 nm, maintaining stable operation at 1550 nm for 4 months. They exhibit high-frequency modulation (2 kHz), a responsivity of up to 83 A/W, a specific detectivity of 5.6 × 10<sup>11</sup> Jones, rapid response/recovery times of 139 μs/145 μs with multifunctionality in image acquisition, information encryption, and logic operations. This research lays the foundation for high-performance, stable photodetectors and light-controlled logic circuits in communications and imaging.
40223520	Environmentally Benign and Long Cycling Mn-Ion Full Batteries Enabled by Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes and Polycarbonyl Conjugated Organic Anodes.	Aqueous rechargeable manganese (Mn)-ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising candidate for multivalent ion rechargeable batteries. However, challenges remain, particularly in expanding the electrolyte's voltage window and identifying compatible anode materials. Herein, we introduce a Mn-ion full battery comprising a nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) cathode, a perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode, and a novel hydrated eutectic electrolyte formulated from Mn(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O and acetamide. This electrolyte composition, optimized for molar ratio, provides a stable solvation structure that suppresses water reactivity and supports high ionic conductivity, as confirmed by spectroscopic and molecular dynamics analyses. The PTCDI anode facilitates highly reversible Mn<sup>2+</sup> storage via a unique enolization redox reaction, delivering exceptional rate capability and cycling stability. As a result, the NiHCF||PTCDI full battery achieves a 1.2 V plateau, excellent rate performance (up to 5.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>), and long cycling life with 95.6% capacity retention over 1200 cycles at 1.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>. This study proposes a feasible strategy for the construction of environment-friendly, long-life and low-cost aqueous Mn-ion full batteries, offering a sustainable and high-performance solution for future energy storage applications.

40223518	Optical Sectioning for Reflection Interference Microscopy: Quantitative Imaging at Soft Interfaces.	Reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM, also known as interference reflection microscopy) and related techniques have become of wide interest to the biophysical, soft matter, and biochemistry communities owing to their exquisite sensitivity for characterizing thin films or individual nanoscopic objects adsorbed onto surfaces, or for monitoring cell-substrate interactions. Over the recent years, striking progress has been made to improve the sensitivity and the quantitative analysis of RICM. Its use in more complex environments, with spurious reflections stemming from a variety of structures in the sample, remains however challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate two optical sectioning methods that effectively reduce such background and can be readily implemented in a conventional RICM setup: line confocal detection and structured illumination microscopy. We characterize experimentally the benefits to image quality and demonstrate the use of the methods for quantitative imaging of complex biological and biomimetic samples: cellular membranes, thin organic films, biofunctional surfaces. We then discuss the benefits of each method and provide guidelines to arbitrate between sectioning and signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we provide a detailed description of our experimental setup and a home-written image acquisition and processing software that should allow the interested reader to duplicate such a setup on a home-built or commercial microscope.
40223517	Formation of a new hydrated sodium-thorium phosphate from thorium dioxide and its subsequent phase evolution.	This study investigated the behaviour of nanoscale thorium dioxide in a sodium phosphate buffer under hydrothermal conditions under conditions ranging from weakly acidic (pH ∼ 5) to weakly basic (pH ∼ 8). The hydrothermal syntheses yielded a nanosized hydrated double sodium-thorium phosphate phase. The acidity of the medium affected particle size and elemental composition of the product. The phase, identified in all cases as a hydrated variant of the known sodium-thorium phosphate NaTh<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, possesses a framework structure and is able to accommodate water and sodium cations within the channels; notably, the sodium content varied based on the acidity of the synthesis medium. Calcination of the nanosized phase in air produced mixtures of two distinct crystalline sodium-thorium phosphates, NaTh<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>Th(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, in different ratios. The final product composition was determined by the pH used during synthesis and the related phosphate content of the nanosized phase. Characterization of the materials before and after calcination was carried out with a range of complementary methods: X-ray diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, total X-ray scattering with pair distribution function analysis, infrared spectroscopy and <sup>31</sup>P MAS NMR.

40223515	Solid Polymer Electrolytes for All-Solid-State Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: Different Designs Dependent on Their Interaction with Sulfur Cathodes.	Nonflammable and flexible solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely studied to improve the safety of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Studies on SPE-based LSBs primarily focus on addressing issues stemming from poor SPE properties, Li dendrites, and "shuttle effect" of polysulfides. Currently, strategies from SPE-based lithium batteries (without sulfur cathodes) and liquid electrolyte (LE)-based LSBs (without SPEs) are the most commonly employed approaches to tackle above issues. These strategies are designed without taking into account the problems caused by the coexistence of SPEs and sulfur cathodes, resulting in SPE-based LSBs exhibiting significantly inferior performance than liquid-electrolyte-based LSBs. Therefore, the strategies for SPE-based LSBs necessitate different designs. However, no reviews have focused on the aforementioned differences and analyzing their corresponding causes thus far, which is unfavorable for the development of this field. Herein, the emerging advances in SPE-based LSBs are comprehensively reviewed. In particular, for the first time, the different designs and their corresponding causes are comprehensively discussed. These causes include the high adsorption strength of SPEs with polysulfides, corrosion of polysulfides to barrier layers, deterioration of the ionic conductivity of SPEs, and defective interfaces between cathodes and SPEs. Finally, several pressing challenges and future prospects for the field are discussed.
40223514	On the epitaxial growth in ALD Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>- and NiO-based bilayers.	NiO and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> are versatile materials studied for a plethora of applications, yet their performance for a specific application relies on the control of their crystallographic texture and corresponding surface facets. Achieving such control can be challenging, often requiring hetero-epitaxial growth on single-crystalline substrates, which are frequently incompatible with the requirements of the application. The combination of NiO and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in heterostructures provides potential to control texture due to their similar crystal structures, whilst retaining the possibility to work with more versatile substrates. In this study, atomic layer deposited (ALD) thin films based on cyclopentadienyl precursors and an oxygen plasma are adopted to tailor the crystallographic texture of NiO from 〈100〉 to 〈111〉 using an ALD Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> template layer, and similarly, to modify the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> texture from 〈111〉 to 〈100〉 on a NiO template. The films are shown to conform to the crystal orientation of the template material, whilst crystallizing directly in their own stable crystal structure with corresponding metal atom coordination. Further investigation includes ALD process parameters for NiO growth: the film texture is found to depend on the choice of co-reactant and the above-highlighted hetero-epitaxial relationship is stronger for plasma-based processes. In conclusion, these results demonstrate an original approach for application-oriented crystallographic engineering in thin films.
40223513	Delaying factors influencing the maternal health care disparities in developing countries: A scoping review.	Maternal mortality is a critically significant issue in developing countries, where the lifetime risk for a woman in pregnancy or childbirth is approximately one in six. This elevated risk is often linked to delays in accessing and utilizing maternal health care services. Therefore, the study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the delaying factors influencing the maternal health care disparities in developing countries using Thaddeus and Maine's Three Delays Model. Researchers searched Science Direct, Pub Med, Pub Med Central, Embase, Medline, Simantic Scholar and Scopus to extract 69 case study articles published between 2015 and 2023 for this scoping review. The search reveals that among the three primary delay factors (Delay 1- patient, Delay 2- en-route or geographical, and Delay 3- service factors), patient-related factors contribute most to adverse outcomes across Asia, which is often deeply rooted in socio-economic and cultural discrepancy. All three delays significantly hinder maternal health care access in Africa with Delay 2 remaining a persistent challenge. Along with en-route causalities and security risks, many African countries face an acute shortage of emergency obstetric care infrastructure. While, increasing awareness and addressing cultural barriers are essential for achieving better health outcomes across Asia, expanding free maternal health care policies, reducing indirect costs and improving community engagement found to be more significant for African regions. In Latin American countries, Delay 3 is the primary challenge, driven by persistent disparities in health care quality, understaffing, and inconsistent service delivery. The study therefore concludes that bringing structural changes is utmost necessary by framing policies from grass root level understanding to reduce the prevailing maternal health care disparities in developing part of the world.
40223511	Uniaxiality-Induced Reduced-Pressure Synthesis of Ultrahard Paracrystalline Diamond.	Synthesizing fully sp<sup>3</sup>-bonded non-crystalline carbon remains a long-standing challenge due to the intrinsic instability of the sp<sup>3</sup> bond at ambient pressure. Recently, paracrystalline diamond, a new-form sp<sup>3</sup>-bonded non-crystalline carbon consisting of sub-nanometer-sized paracrystallites, has been synthesized from face-centered cubic C<sub>60</sub> at 30 GPa, which has attracted attention due to its unique structural features and excellent physical properties. However, the ultrahigh synthesis pressure of paracrystalline diamond poses an obstacle to its large-scale production and applications. In this study, paracrystalline diamond is synthesized at an exceptionally low pressure (16 GPa) via inducing uniaxiality at high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, thereby breaking through the temperature-pressure phase diagram of C<sub>60</sub>. By combining structural characteristics and advanced molecular dynamics simulation, the remarkable reduction of synthesis pressure is attributed to the fact that the symmetry of the C<sub>60</sub> cage is broken due to the uniaxiality, which further allows the C<sub>60</sub> cage to collapse at much lower pressures. This work reveals the critical role of uniaxiality in the reduced-pressure synthesis of paracrystalline diamond, which may provide a potent methodological strategy for the development of novel low-cost high-pressure materials.
40223510	"Mitotic" kinesin-5 is a dynamic brake for axonal growth in Drosophila.	During neuronal development, microtubule reorganization shapes axons and dendrites, establishing the framework for efficient nervous system wiring. Our previous work demonstrated the role of kinesin-1 in driving microtubule sliding, which powers early axon outgrowth and regeneration in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we reveal a critical new role of kinesin-5, a mitotic motor, in modulating postmitotic neuron development. The Drosophila kinesin-5, Klp61F, is expressed in larval brain neurons, with high levels in ventral nerve cord (VNC) neurons. Knockdown of Klp61F in neurons leads to severe adult locomotion defects and lethality, primarily due to defects in VNC motor neurons. Klp61F depletion results in excessive microtubule penetration into the axon growth cone, causing significant axon growth defects in culture and in vivo. These defects are rescued by a chimeric human-Drosophila kinesin-5 motor, indicating a conserved role of kinesin-5 in neuronal development. Altogether, we propose that kinesin-5 acts as a brake on kinesin-1-driven microtubule sliding, ensuring proper axon pathfinding in growing neurons.

40223507	Strategic engineering of CoS<sub>2</sub>/ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> heterostructures incorporating Ar plasma-induced sulfur vacancies for potentiating electrocatalytic activity in furazolidone determination.	In recent years, the overuse and improper disposal of antibiotics have led to their widespread presence in various environmental matrices and biological fluids. Exploring non-noble metal sulfides as electrocatalysts for reliable antibiotic detection holds substantial value but is limited by their inherent low electrochemical activity. Herein, CoS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were first synthesized <i>via</i> a hydrothermal method, and used for the <i>in situ</i> assembly of ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> nanosheets. Then, plasma technology was employed for efficient and rapid generation of sulfur vacancies. Detailed studies illustrated the formation of heterojunctions, facilitating electron transfer from the thin, large-area ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> to CoS<sub>2</sub>, which acts as a co-catalyst due to its inherent conductivity and metallicity. The plasma-assisted generation of vacancies resulted in the formation of numerous exposed metal catalytic centers. Also, both the heterojunction and vacancy construction afforded a narrowed energy gap, an upregulated conduction band, and an enhanced carrier density, favoring electron injection during the electro-reduction process. Thus, an electrochemical platform was established using this material as an electrode substrate for furazolidone (Fz) detection, achieving a detection limit of 1.2 nM. The constructed platform was finally applied to evaluate Fz in actual samples of river water and urine, thanks to its good selectivity, high stability, and acceptable repeatability. In addition, <i>in situ</i> Fourier transform infrared technology was also used to monitor the electrocatalytic process. This work paves the way for preparing low-cost non-precious metal sulfides, which can be used as promising candidates for electrocatalysts in antibiotic testing.

40223503	I can't hear you: Songbird auditory processing in noise.	Animals have evolved complex auditory systems to extract acoustic information from natural environmental noise, yet they are challenged by rising levels of novel anthropogenic noise. Songbirds adjust their vocal production in response to increasing noise, but auditory processing of signals in noise remains understudied. Auditory processing characteristics, including auditory filter bandwidth, filter efficiency, and critical ratios (level-independent signal-to-noise ratios at threshold) likely influence auditory and behavioral responses to noise. Here, we investigated the effects of noise on auditory processing in three songbird species (black-capped chickadees, tufted titmice, and white-breasted nuthatches) that live in mixed-species flocks and rely on heterospecific communication to coordinate mobbing behaviors. We determined masked thresholds and critical ratios from 1-4 kHz using auditory evoked potentials. We predicted that nuthatches would have the lowest critical ratios given that they have narrowest filters, followed by titmice and then chickadees. We found that nuthatches had the greatest sensitivity in quiet conditions, but the highest critical ratios, suggesting their auditory sensitivity is highly susceptible to noise. Titmice had the lowest critical ratios, suggesting relatively minor impacts of noise on their auditory processing. This is not consistent with predictions based on auditory filter bandwidth, but is consistent with both recent behavioral findings and predictions made by auditory filter efficiency measures. Detrimental effects of noise were most prevalent in the 2-4 kHz range, frequencies produced in vocalizations. Our results using the critical ratio as a measure of processing in noise suggest that low levels of anthropogenic noise may influence these three species differently.
40223502	The missing effect of temperature on branchial O2 loss.	Air-breathing fish risk losing aerially sourced O2 to hypoxic water during branchial passage. Two adaptations thought to mitigate this loss are reduced gills and increased blood O2 affinity. Both are affected by temperature in the facultative air-breathing fish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, where increased temperature results in larger gills and reduced blood O2 affinity. Here, we tested whether branchial O2 loss increases with temperature, by measuring this loss and the aerial and aquatic gas-exchange at 25°C and 33°C in near aquatic anoxia. Surprisingly, increasing temperature did not change the absolute O2 loss while metabolic rate increased by 75%. Hence, animals suffered a 10% loss of the aerial O2 uptake at 25°C compared to only 5% loss at 33°C. Data indicates an increased hypoxia-induced reduction in gill ventilation at 33°C, negatively affecting aquatic exchange of both CO2 and O2, resulting in unchanged O2 loss and a CO2 partitioning shift towards the air phase.
40223501	Decoding Directional Control in Metal-Assisted Chemical Etching via Catalyst Architecture.	Metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has emerged as a promising technique for fabricating silicon nanostructures, yet the presence of anomalous isotropic etching poses significant challenges for precise dimensional control. Here, it is demonstrated that catalyst morphology, particularly its aspect ratio, plays a crucial role in determining etching directionality. Through systematic investigation of the initial stages of MaCE, it is revealed that significant undercutting occurs within seconds of etching initiation, persisting across all solution compositions. This phenomenon is quantitatively analyzed using the Degree of Undercutting (DoU) and Degree of Anisotropy (DoA) metrics, establishing that conventional solution chemistry control alone cannot suppress lateral etching. These findings reveal that high-aspect-ratio dendrite catalysts, formed at elevated AgNO<sub>3</sub> concentrations, undergo physical separation during etching, leading to residual catalysts that promote localized isotropic etching. To address this, a thermal treatment approach is developed that effectively transforms these problematic structures into stable, low-aspect-ratio catalysts. A critical transition at 450 °C, where enhanced silver atom mobility coincides with surface defect formation, enables nearly perfect vertical etching. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the relationship between catalyst geometry and etching behavior but also presents a practical solution for achieving precise control over silicon nanostructure fabrication.

40223499	Interfacial-Free-Water-Enhanced Mass Transfer to Boost Current Density of Hydrogen Evolution.	The advancement of water electrolysis highlights the growing importance of electrolyzers capable of operating at high current densities, where mass transfer dynamics plays a crucial role. In the electrode reactions, the interfacial water is a key factor in regulating these dynamics. However, the potential of utilizing interfacial-free water (IFW) to modulate electrode behavior remains underexplored. Herein, we investigate the effect of interfacial water structure on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance across different current density ranges, using designed platinum-coated nickel hydroxide on nickel foam (Pt@Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-NF) electrodes. We reveal that with increasing current density, changes in interfacial water structure alter the rate-determining step of the HER. Pt@Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>-NF exhibited excellent performance in alkaline electrolytes, achieving 1000 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 114 mV overpotential. This study provides a novel approach to optimizing alkaline water electrolysis dynamics by enhancing mass transfer, further paving the way for more efficient and energy-saving hydrogen production.
40223498	Triaminoalkenes Derived from Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes with a 1,1'-Ferrocenylene Backbone and N-Heterocyclic Carbenes: fcCAAC-NHC Heterodimers.	The study addresses triaminoalkenes derived from [3]ferrocenophane-type cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (fcCAACs) fc(CPh<sub>2</sub>CNR) (fc = 1,1'-ferrocenylene) and N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). Stable target compounds are obtained in good yields as crystalline solids by the combination of [fc(CPh<sub>2</sub>CHNMe)][BF<sub>4</sub>] with N,N'-dimethylimidazolin-2-ylidene and of [fc(CPh<sub>2</sub>CHN-p-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-tBu)](OTf) with 1,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazolin-2-ylidene, respectively, followed by treatment of the resulting addition product with KN(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Due to the presence of a triaminoethene unit and a ferrocene moiety, four redox states are expected for such fcCAAC-NHC heterodimers, viz., electroneutral, mono-, di-, and tricationic. An investigation of their redox behavior by electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry) has revealed that these compounds undergo two consecutive one-electron oxidations, with the poor stability of the dicationic species in solution preventing an observation of the tricationic redox state. A density functional theory (DFT) study shows that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized on the CCN<sub>2</sub> atom, which, in agreement with electron paramagnetic resonance results, is the site of the first oxidation. The second oxidation mainly involves the Fe atom, where the HOMO-1 is localized, resulting in a species with a triplet ground state composed, to a first approximation, of a carbon-centered and an iron-centered radical.
40223497	Sulfhydryl and Sulfonic Acid Bifunctional Group Achieving (101) Crystal Preferential Reversible Zn<sup>2+</sup> Electrodeposition Without Dendrite and Nucleation Overpotential.	Disordered electrodeposition of Zn<sup>2+</sup> resulted in serious dendrite and hydrogen evolution reactions, greatly decreasing the energy efficiency and durability of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MSN) is proposed as a new additive to achieve induced directional electrodeposition of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on the Zn (101) crystal surface to form a dense uniform Zn metal layer via the cooperative effect of sulfhydryl and sulfonic acid groups. Different from the reported additives, MSN molecules promote the rapid formation of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> adsorption layer, which greatly accelerates its directed migration rate and orderly nucleation process, achieving eliminated zinc dendrites and nucleation overpotential, far superior to the reported additives. The MSN-introduced Zn||Zn symmetric battery displays amazing durability and is stably cycled for more than 3500 h at 2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> @ 2 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup>, and over 1 000 h even under harsh conditions (5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> @ 5 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup>). Furthermore, the Zn||δ-MnO<sub>2</sub> coin battery offers a high capacity of 201.5 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and a low recession rate of 1% during 800 cycles at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>, far higher than that of the blank sample (121.3 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, 56.1%), respectively, fully demonstrating the extraordinary advantages and contributions of the new MSN molecules.

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated disease involving the skin and/or mucosa, whose aetiology is unclear and the most common predisposing factor is herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The presence of typical target-shaped erythema on the skin is key to its diagnosis. However, the diagnosis is a challenge for some patients whose lesions are limited to the oral mucosa. In this study, we reported a rare case of recurrent EM induced by Toxoplasma gondii infection. After confirming the diagnosis through serological testing, the patient was treated with anti-toxoplasma therapy alongside symptomatic management. This led to complete resolution of lesions with no recurrence over a 2-year follow-up period.
40223484	Interface-Engineered Polar Topological Domains in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals.	Polar topological domains, distinguished by their inherent topological protection and diverse optoelectronic functionalities, have recently attracted significant interest across scientific disciplines. However, the realization of these structures in inorganic materials is often impeded by crystal symmetry constraints. In this context, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, characterized by spontaneous polarization and flexible polarization orientation, provide an exceptional platform for the development of polar topological domains. Despite their potential, a considerable challenge lies in identifying a straightforward yet versatile approach for engineering polar topological domains within liquid crystals. Here, this study presents an interfacial engineering strategy that effectively stabilizes a range of polar topological domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center-divergent configurations, by synergistically modulating the surface tension and interfacial tension. Utilizing a combination of experimental characterization and simulation, the role of anchoring energy is systematically investigated in the molecular alignment of liquid crystals and facilitates transitions between diverse topological structures. This research not only extends the horizons for constructing and manipulating polar topological domains but also enhances their prospective applications in topological photonics.
40223483	Legumain In Situ Engineering Promotes Efferocytosis of CAR Macrophage to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis.	Uncontrolled and excessive cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) is a primary contributor to mortality by heart failure. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-MΦ) therapy shows great promise in cardiac fibrosis, however, the overwhelming apoptotic cells after MI results in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR-MΦ, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. This work here reports an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR-MΦs, restoring their antifibrotic capability. Specifically, with the in-house customized macrophages-targeting lipid nanoparticles, this work first creates an efferocytosis-boosted fibrosis-specific CAR-MΦs by introducing dual mRNAs that encode Lgmn, an endolysosomal cysteine protease, along with an anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP) CAR, respectively. This data demonstrate these CAR-MΦs displayed a significantly increased phagocytic capacity as well as improved efferocytosis and enhanced antifibrotic capability. Treatment with the in situ reprogrammed CAR-MΦs in MI mice obviously reduced the infarct size and mitigated cardiac fibrosis, leading to significant restoration of cardiac function. In sum, these findings establish that promoting efferocytosis through Lgmn engineering effectively relieved the overburdened efferocytosis of CAR-MΦs, and enhanced their treatment efficacy of cardiac fibrosis with broad application in other fibrotic diseases.
40223482	A CK2α' mutant indicating why CK2α and CK2α', the isoforms of the catalytic subunit of human protein kinase CK2, deviate in affinity to CK2β.	Protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase 2) mainly exists as heterotetrameric holoenzyme with two catalytic subunits (CK2α or CK2α') bound to a homodimer of non-catalytic subunits (CK2β). With <i>CSNK2A1</i> and <i>CSNK2A2</i>, the human genome contains two paralogs encoding catalytic CK2 subunits. Both gene products, called CK2α and CK2α', strongly interact with CK2β. An earlier report that CK2α' has a lower CK2β affinity than CK2α is confirmed via isothermal titration calorimetry in this study. Furthermore, we show with a fluorescence-anisotropy assay that a CK2β-competitive peptide binds less strongly to CK2α' than to CK2α. The reason for the reduced affinity of CK2α' to CK2β and CK2β competitors is puzzling: both isoenzymes have identical amino acid compositions at their CK2β interfaces, but the β4β5 loop, a component of this interface, is conformationally less adaptable in CK2α' than in CK2α due to intramolecular constraints. To release these constraints, we constructed a CK2α' mutant that was equalized to CK2α at the backside of the β4β5 loop. Concerning thermostability, affinity to CK2β or CK2β competitors and 3D-structure next to the β4β5 loop, this CK2α' mutant is more similar to CK2α than to its own wild-type, suggesting a critical role of the β4β5 loop adaptability for CK2β affinity.
40223481	A Balancing Act: Thymine DNA Glycosylase Combines Sequence and Rotational Preferences To Define Lesion Excision in the Nucleosome Core Particle.	Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a DNA glycosylase involved in base excision repair (BER) with a specialized role in the regulation of transcription through the maintenance of 5'-CpG-3' sites via active demethylation. In this work, we investigate the ability of TDG to excise modified nucleobases from the simplest unit of compacted DNA, the nucleosome core particle (NCP). We measure TDG activity on a population of NCPs with uracil (U) at various geometric positions and report that <i>k</i><sub>obs</sub> for U excision from the NCP depends on positioning and dinucleotide sequence context. Specifically, TDG prefers solution accessible 5'-UpG-3' and 5'-UpA-3' sites. By coupling our findings with previous studies, we suggest that TDG's stringent substrate preferences facilitate its epigenetic role through the extensive contacts made with its DNA substrate.

40223477	A Mitochondrion-Targeted NIR-II Modulator for Synergistic Ferroptosis-Immunotherapy.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have limited clinical efficacy against gastric cancer (GC) due to the nonimmunogenic tumor microenvironment. Therefore, inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) to reprogram the immunogenic landscape is essential. This study develops HD-FA nanoparticles by encapsulating a novel mitochondrion-targeted NIR-II modulator, HD, within DSPE-PEG-FA. HD-FA exhibits superior spatiotemporal resolution, robust tumor accumulation, and minimal adverse effects. Upon 808 nm laser irradiation, HD-FA generates reactive oxygen species, leading to ferroptosis and oxidative stress damage in GC cells by inhibiting the SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 axis. HD-FA triggers ICD, resulting in antitumor activity not only in primary tumors but also in distant tumors. Moreover, HD-FA promotes dendritic cell maturation, increases the effector-memory T-cell frequency, and reduces the presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thereby fostering enhanced antitumor immunity. This study presents the first report of a novel NIR-II modulator for GC immunogenic synergistic therapy with ICIs, marking significant advancements in the fight against GC.

The impact of child loss on the progression of depressive symptoms has not been extensively studied within the context of Chinese culture. Utilizing the five-phase follow-up data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, this study evaluated the depressive symptoms of 6303 eligible participants. Baseline analysis revealed a significant correlation between child mortality and the depressive status of the participants (<i>p</i> < .001). Longitudinal analysis indicated that the death of a child, as a major negative life event, continued to affect the mental health of participants over time (<i>p</i> = .006). This study also employed a restricted cubic spline function to account for the specificity of parents' age at the time of the child's death and their risk of depression. The findings suggest the necessity of enhancing psychological support for older parents who have experienced the loss of a child<b>.</b>

This study demonstrates the different wetting states that can be achieved by varying the diameter and density of nanowires in free-standing 3D gold nanowire networks. This network structure consists of nanowires oriented at 45° to the horizontal plane and interconnected from four different directions. Sessile drop measurements on these tailored nanostructured films show a transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic behavior as porosity increases from 20% to 98%. With tailored porosity from 60% to 80%, this nanostructure can exhibit super-hydrophilicity. In addition, the highly porous (>90%) hydrophobic structures exhibit the rose-petal effect, where water droplets remain pinned to the surface. These novel results demonstrate the capability to precisely control surface wetting behavior through intricate designs of nanostructures, which are crucial for a wide range of applications, including liquid transport, microfluidic devices, and sensors.
40223473	Facile Projection of Spatially Resolved Refractive Index Modulation in Monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> via Light Phase Changes.	Fast spatial contouring of the complex refractive index (n  +  ik) of semiconducting materials is a much sought-after goal since the advent of semiconductor-related industries. This study develops a novel metrology to shape the refractive index modulation of materials using hyperspectral phase microscopy by maximizing the light-matter interaction of physical properties. The facile, non-destructive, and wide-field hyperspectral phase technique realizes efficient visualization of the spatially resolved refractive index nature induced by strain within and among examined MoS<sub>2</sub> materials. Furthermore, numerical analyses based on a steady-state transfer matrix clarify that the spectral phase difference (Δϕ) is selectively sensitive to the modulation of refractive index (n) but not of extinction coefficient (k) under certain wavelength ranges. This dependence is associated with wavelength and the thickness of the dielectric layer on the substrates. Simple linear relation between n and Δϕ for ≈100 nm of SiO<sub>2</sub>, dielectric material supporting MoS<sub>2</sub>, enables to visualize the excitonic A and B band modulation, and furthermore, refractive index with fairly high precision (coefficient of determination, R<sup>2</sup> > 0.97 in the wavelength range of 530-630 nm).
40223471	Full-Color Tunable Time-Dependent Room-Temperature Phosphorescence from Self-Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots.	Achieving full-color time-dependent tunable phosphorescence (TDTP) in pure organic materials remains a significant challenge due to the nonradiative transition and modulation puzzle of triplet states. Herein, full-color TDTP has been realized in self-protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) under ambient conditions using a self-doping strategy. These CPDs are generated with dual emission centers of the high-energy N-related triplet state and the low-energy surface oxide triplet state, which are responsible for the slow-decaying blue afterglow (453 nm) and the fast-decaying green to red afterglow (513-609 nm), respectively. These luminescent centers can be activated simultaneously upon CPD aggregation due to the generated rigid networks by intra/intermolecular hydrogen-band interactions. The detailed experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that the red-shifted afterglow color is attributed to a gradual reduction of their energy levels with the increasing surface C═O content and aggregation degree of CPDs. Thus, these matrix-free CPDs exhibit dynamic TDTP colors over the entire visible spectrum in the solid state after turning off 365 nm UV light. Based on their unusual phosphorescent properties and excellent photostability, these CPDs have been tested for various applications such as multidimensional dynamic information encryption and anti-counterfeiting, as well as time-delayed light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

However, the poor reversibility of zinc metal anode in aqueous electrolytes is the main bottleneck limiting their practical application. In this study, an easily fabricated mesoporous ferroelectric separator designed to significantly enhance the reversibility of zinc anode in aqueous electrolytes is introduced. The ferroelectric fields generated by this separator induce a uniform distribution of hydrated zinc ions between the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) on the zinc surface and the bulk electrolyte, which in turn reduces the reactivity of parasitic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution and hydroxide formation. Meanwhile, the reduction of zinc reactivity, coupled with an increased zinc ion diffusion barrier, benefits planar zinc plating with minimal dendrite formation. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the zinc anode, equipped with the ferroelectric separator, achieves high reversibility in a standard 2 m ZnSO<sub>4</sub> aqueous electrolyte, with stable stripping/plating observed over 4000 cycles at various current densities. This study thus presents a novel separator for AZIBs that effectively mitigates parasitic reactions and dendrite growth by regulating the IHP structure, which offers a practical and low-cost pathway toward the actual application of AZIBs.
40223469	Plasma-Induced Wrinkle-Crack Dual Structure for Robust Directional Strain Sensing in Dynamic Motion Perception.	Flexible multi-directional sensors hold vast potential for complex application scenarios, yet creating sensitive, stable, and linear strain sensors capable of flexibly detecting multi-directional strain remains a significant challenge. Here, a plasma-induced wrinkle-crack dual structure is introduced for multi-directional force detection of high-reliability flexible strain sensors. By combining pre-stretching and oxidative plasma bombardment, a multi-layer structure exhibits film stress engineering with varying elastic moduli established on the surface of the elastomer. The rigid silicon oxide hardened layer induces shear film stress at the pre-stretched interface. Periodic wrinkles are generated upon release from pre-stretching, which not only suppresses crack propagation but also significantly enhances the linearity between the signal and applied force, thanks to the conductive network's wrinkles. By adjusting the direction of pre-stretching under plasma treatment, the morphology and orientation of the wrinkles on the conductive sensitive layer can be effectively controlled. The coexisting parallel wrinkle and perpendicular crack structures impart anisotropic properties, significantly improving the sensor's directional detection capabilities. With a high gauge factor (GF = 454), excellent cyclic durability (over 100 000 cycles), and multi-directional force detection capability, this sensor demonstrates promising applications in wearable electronics and robot motion detection, positioning it as a next-generation flexible strain sensor.
40223468	Methylthiolation Modifed Bay-Annulated Indigo Derivatives for Enhanced Performance in Organic Field-Effect Transistors.	Indigo is one of the most well-known natural dyes and has attracted significant research interest due to its low cost and exceptional stability. Notably, bay-annulated indigo (BAI) has been reported as an effective electron acceptor and is widely used in various applications. Herein, we successfully synthesize a methylthio-substituted BAI derivative, compound 1 and investigate the impact of methylthio substitution on its optoelectronic properties. UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra reveal that compound 1 displays a significant red shift compared to the non-methylthio-substituted compound 2. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and DFT calculations indicate that compound 1 has a narrower HOMO-LUMO gap, demonstrating the prominent influence of methylthio side chains in modulating molecular electronic properties. Importantly, the organic field-effect transistor (OFET) device based on compound 1 exhibits a hole mobility 3.5 times higher than that of the non-methylthio-substituted compound 2. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization reveals the formation of needle-like crystallites in the compound 1 film after annealing, whereas compound 2 forms an amorphous thin film. These results suggest that methylthiolation is an effective strategy for tuning intermolecular interactions in novel BAI derivatives, and compound 1 is a promising hole-transporting material.

40223465	Optimizing active sites <i>via</i> chemical bonding of 2D metal-organic frameworks and MXenes for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction activity.	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising electrocatalysts due to their large surface areas and abundant metal sites, but their efficacy is limited by poor exposure of active metal atoms to the electrolyte. To address this issue, we report an innovative approach that integrates a conductive layered MXene (Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub>) with a 2-dimensional (2D) Ni<sub>3</sub>(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)<sub>2</sub>-MOF through <i>in situ</i> synthesis of the MOF on the MXene, maximizing the accessible exposure of active sites for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. XPS analysis confirms that the MOF is chemically bonded with the MXene layers, while SEM analysis shows complete overlapping, intercalation, and surface growth of the MOF on the MXene layers. The optimized chemically bonded MOF on MXene exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, with an overpotential of 180 mV in alkaline media-four times better than that of the pristine MOF-and an overpotential of 240 mV in acidic media, three times better than that of the pristine MOF. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the bond formation between Ti atoms from the MXene and N atoms from the MOF, which facilitates charge transfer and improves both the kinetics and active electrocatalytic area for the HER. This method offers a simple, pioneering approach to fabricate noble metal-free, nanostructured electrocatalysts, enhancing water electrolysis efficiency and extending applicability to other conductive MOFs.
40223464	Cation and Octahedral Synergistic Regulation for Stable FAPbI<sub>3</sub> Perovskite Solar Cells.	Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) perovskite, one of the most promising light-absorbing materials, faces substantial stability issues, including FA<sup>+</sup> organic component volatilization and undesirable phase transition between corner-sharing and face-sharing [PbI<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4 ̶</sup> octahedra. Especially, the asymmetric hydrogen bonding, arising from oriented and irregularly spinning FA<sup>+</sup> cation, accelerates these transformations, compromising both the efficiency and long-term stability of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> PSCs. Herein, a robust strategy is reported to stabilize FAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite by using tricyclohexylphosphine trifluoromethanesulfonate (Cy<sub>3</sub>PH<sup>+</sup>SO<sub>3</sub>CF<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>) to strengthen hydrogen bonds within FA<sup>+</sup> and alleviate octahedral deformation. The hydrogen-bonding capacity of Cy<sub>3</sub>PH<sup>+</sup> effectively constrains and stabilizes orientated FA<sup>+</sup> through strong hydrogen bonds (F─H, N─H), while the strong electronegative SO<sub>3</sub>CF<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ion modifies [PbI<sub>6</sub>]<sub>4</sub> <sup>-</sup> octahedral deformation by diversified covalent bonds (Pb─F, Pb─O) and releases the internal stress of the lattice. As such, the resulting FAPbI<sub>3</sub> demonstrates mitigated organic volatilization and suppressed phase transition, significantly enhancing phase stability under thermal/humidity stress conditions. Moreover, because of co-regulated FA<sup>+</sup> cation and octahedral lattice, FAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite exhibits improved carrier dynamics and better matched energy-level alignment with carrier transport layers. The optimized FAPbI<sub>3</sub>-based PSCs deliver an impressive efficiency of 25.93% and exhibit exceptional stability, retaining 97% of initial efficiency after over 1500 h maximum power point tracking.
40223463	S-Scheme CdS/Co₃S₄ Double-Shelled Hollow Nanoboxes for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution.	Developing S-scheme systems with high photocatalytic performance is crucial for long-term solar-to-hydrogen conversion. In this study, hollow cobalt tetrasulfide (Co<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) nanoboxes (NBs), synthesized via sulfurization using zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) as a template, are combined with cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles (NPs) to construct heterojunction photocatalysts under mild conditions. The optimized CdS/Co<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> double-shelled nanoboxes (DSNBs) achieved a superior photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 23.45 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> under visible light, approximately 24 times greater than that of pure CdS NPs. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of CdS/Co<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub> DSNBs is 18.5 %. The distinctive hollow structure enhances visible-light-harvesting by exposing active sites, enabling multiple light reflections, and allowing the thin shells to shorten the transport distance for charge carriers, effectively minimizing charge recombination. The improved photoactivity results from the synergistic effects of the aligned bandgap structures, strong visible-light absorption, and interfacial interactions driven by the inherent electric field (IEF). The findings offer insights into designing efficient S-scheme heterojunction catalysts for sustainable hydrogen evolution through photocatalytic water splitting.
40223462	Stretchable Water-Repellent PEDOT:PSS-Impregnated Polyurethane Nanofiber Mats for Electromagnetic Interference Shielding.	High-performance wearable textiles made from poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hold great promise for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in military and healthcare systems. However, achieving an optimal balance of resilience, flexibility, and electrical properties is challenging due to weak interfacial interactions between PEDOT:PSS and the host substrates. In this study, a robust and stretchable wearable textile fabricated via vacuum-assisted impregnation of PEDOT:PSS is presented onto an electrospun polyurethane (PU) nanofiber mat. The process creates a convoluted interlock network at the interface layer between PEDOT:PSS and PU nanofiber mat, enhanced by the large contact area, effective chemical interactions, and vacuum-induced pressure. This results in exceptional tensile strength of 51.2 MPa, 207% elongation, and 86% elastic recovery, surpassing the practical requirement threshold of wearable textiles and fibers. The robust PU-PEDOT:PSS nanofiber mat shows a normalized EMI shielding effectiveness value of 365.2 dB mm<sup>-1</sup> at an ultrathin thickness of 100 µm. This textile is capable of maintaining its shielding performance after continuous loading and unloading cyclic tests up to 100% strain. Additionally, a one-step, durable, fluorine-free spray coating is introduced to protect the textile from moisture and dust, thereby extending its service life for practical outdoor applications.
40223461	Accurate and Affordable Simulation of Molecular Infrared Spectra with AIQM Models.	Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a potent tool for identifying molecular structures and studying the chemical properties of compounds, and hence, various theoretical approaches have been developed to simulate and predict the IR spectra. However, the theoretical approaches based on quantum chemical calculations suffer from high computational cost (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) or insufficient accuracy (e.g., semiempirical methods orders of magnitude faster than DFT). Here, we introduce a new approach, based on the universal machine learning (ML) models of the AIQM series targeting CCSD(T)/CBS level, that can deliver molecular IR spectra with accuracy close to DFT (compared to the experiment) and the speed close to a semiempirical GFN2-xTB method. This approach is based on the harmonic oscillator approximation with the frequency scaling factors fitted to experimental data. While the benchmarks reported here are focused on harmonic IR spectra, our implementation supports anharmonic spectra simulations via molecular dynamics and VPT2. These implementations are available in MLatom as described in https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom and can be performed online via a web browser.
40223458	Multi-Dimensional Design of Slippery Liquid-Infused Coatings Empowering Long-Term Corrosion Protection for Sintered Nd-Fe-B Magnets in Harsh Environments.	In spite of superior magnetic properties, neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) applications in harsh environments have been greatly hindered by their susceptibility to corrosion, humidity, mechanical, and temperature attacks. Herein, a construction strategy of robust slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) coatings is proposed via the multi-dimensional design of surface, bulk coating, and interface. The manipulation of colloidal states of silica particles by chemical hydrophobization allows for building a dense polymer network, enhancing interfacial adhesion and locking lubricant film effectively. The resulting coating is demonstrated to be extremely stable, endowing the magnet with excellent liquid repellency, anti-corrosion, and anti-icing properties. Strikingly, no trace of corrosion is detected after 136-day immersion in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution and the impedance modulus at 0.1 Hz can be maintained as the initial of 3.31 × 10<sup>8</sup> Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> even after 132-day immersion, which is far superior to that of commercial Ni-Cu-Ni, Zn, and EP coatings. Additionally, anti-icing performance at low temperatures is evidenced by the delayed icing time and decreased ice adhesion strength. Importantly, the self-healing property offers the surface intensified durability even after mechanical damage. This work demonstrates a construction strategy of robust SLIPS coatings with a multi-dimensional design, enabling the practical applications of Nd-Fe-B magnets in extreme environments like offshore wind turbines.
40223457	Responsive Ordered Assembly of Magnetic Nanoparticles for ROS Activatable Magnetic Particle Imaging.	Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a versatile biomedical imaging modality, yet a significant challenge persists in the absence of activatable MPI probes for targeted imaging of disease biomarkers. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is reported, engineered through the meticulous design of magnetic nanoparticle building blocks and ROS-responsive polymeric ligands, enabling precise control over the assembly structure. This ordered configuration amplifies magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, raising the energy barrier during nonequilibrium dynamic magnetization and effectively quenching the MPI signal. By modulating the assembly and disassembly of these ordered structures in response to ROS, this nanoprobe achieves ROS-dependent off/on MPI signal regulation. Consequently, the probe enables the monitoring of early pathological ROS change in a mice model of early acute liver injury, facilitating highly sensitive monitoring of the ROS level-dependent severity of the disease. This work represents the inaugural application of microenvironment-responsive MPI probes for the early diagnosis of ROS-associated diseases. The introduction of ordered assembly structures for MPI signal tuning offers a promising translational approach in the development of next-generation activatable MPI probes.

Miniaturizing nonlinear optical components is essential for integrating advanced light manipulation into compact photonic devices, enabling scalable and cost-effective applications. While monocrystalline lithium niobate thin films advance nonlinear nanophotonics, their high inertness limits the design of top-down fabricated nanostructures. A versatile bottom-up fabrication method based on nanoimprint lithography is presented for achieving polycrystalline lithium niobate nanostructures and demonstrate its significant potential for nonlinear metasurfaces. The fabrication enables nearly vertical features and aspect ratios of up to 6 combined, which we combine with a novel solution-derived material with high effective second-order nonlinearity d<sub>eff</sub> of 5 pm V<sup>-1</sup>. On this platform, second-harmonic focusing is demonstrated over a broad spectral range from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared, increasing the nonlinear signal intensity by up to 34 times. This method enables the first lithium niobate metalens and expands the field of nonlinear metasurfaces by providing a low-cost, highly scalable fabrication method for engineered nonlinear nanostructures.

In this study, a machine learning-guided analysis of phase transitions in a medium-entropy PBA system is delineated, utilizing an array of descriptors that encompass crystallographic phases, structural subtleties, and fluctuations in multimetal valence states. By integrating multimodal simulations with experimental validation, a thermodynamics-driven phase transformation model for medium-entropy PBA is established and accurately predicted the critical synthesis parameters. A constellation of advanced techniques-including atomic force microscopy coupled with Kelvin probe force microscopy for individual nanoparticles, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, operando ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, in situ X-ray diffraction, theoretical calculations, and multiphysics simulations-substantiated that the iron oxide@NiCoZnFe-PBA exhibits both exceptional stability and remarkable electrochemical activity. This investigation provides profound insights into the phase transition dynamics of polymetallic complexes and propels the rational design of other thermally-induced derivatives.

40223448	Hierarchical Assembly of Cellulose Fibrils and Tannin in Biocomposite Foam: Scalable Production via Oven Drying and Customizable Metal Ions Release for Antimicrobial Activity.	Advanced cellulose-based foams are urgently needed as sustainable packaging materials in an era of prioritizing environmental consciousness. However, transferring the mechanical properties of cellulose fibers into porous structures is always limited by gas entrapment during foaming and irreversible structural collapse upon liquid evaporation. Herein, a hierarchical assembly strategy combines cationic cellulose nanofibrils (CCNF) with a dynamic covalent tannin/borate (T/B) complex to fabricate 3D continuous foams with distinct lamellar structure via oven drying is proposed for scalable production. CCNF assembles the T/B complex onto cellulose fibers by electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding, while the reversible covalent bonds among T/B complex impart shear-thinning and self-healing properties, thereby ensuring foamability (exceeding 300%) and structural stability. Moreover, the T/B foam offers a versatile platform for customization with metal ions (Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Ag<sup>+</sup>), allowing the tailoring of physical and mechanical properties. At an optimized tannin addition of 10%, the 10T/5B-Fe foam exhibits the highest normalized strength above 410 Pa/density, while maintaining an ultralow density of 9.2 mg cm<sup>-</sup> <sup>3</sup>. Additionally, the pH-responsiveness of T/B complexes enables the release of metal ions for long-term antimicrobial activity.

40223446	Hierarchical Structure Design of ZIF-Derived CoNiFe LDH Nanocages Grown on Ag Nanowires as High-Performance Cathode for Zn-Air Batteries.	Developing bifunctional electrocatalysts with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and high durability are crucial for rechargeable metal-air batteries. Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are promising in the application as cost-effective and high-performance air cathodes. Herein, hierarchical composites of Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived CoNiFe LDH nanocages in situ grown on silver nanowires (Ag NWs) are synthesized as carbon-free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. The hollow structure of LDH and heterointerface with conductive Ag substrate not only maximizes exposure of active sites but also ensures effective electron transfer. In addition, the hybridization with Ag induces structural disorder and unsaturated coordination in the LDH shells, thereby enhancing intrinsic catalytic activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of Ag species can tune the electronic states and reduce the reaction barriers of OER and ORR. As a result, CoNiFe LDH@Ag NWs exhibit a bifunctional overpotential of 0.63 V. Applied as a carbon-free cathode in a zinc-air battery, CoNiFe LDH@Ag NWs yield a high specific capacity of 808 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and long cycling stability up to 300 h. This work provides new insight into the design of LDH hierarchical structure for efficient and durable electrocatalysts.

40223441	Nitrogen-Containing Carbon-Encapsulated Platinum Electrocatalysts Supported by Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells.	Platinum (Pt)-based electrocatalysts are widely regarded as the preferred choice for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC). However, their low stability remains a critical challenge. To overcome this problem, high-crystallinity and high-purity single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), fabricated by the enhanced direct injection pyrolysis synthesis (e-DIPS) method, are utilized as support with a nitrogen introducing treatment applied to produce nitrogen-containing SWCNT (N-SWCNT). Platinum electrocatalysts encapsulated by amorphous-carbon shell are synthesized on nitrogen-containing single-walled carbon nanotubes (Pt/N-SWCNT) using a facile and industrially favorable solution plasma (SP) method. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations indicate that Pt nanoparticles in Pt/N-SWCNT are encapsulated within nitrogen-containing carbon shells. As the cathodic catalyst of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) in a single cell, the Pt/N-SWCNT-MEA shows a decrease of only 20.8% in maximum power density after 16 000 cycles of the accelerated durability test (ADT). After the high-voltage acceleration (1.0-1.5 V), Pt/N-SWCNT-MEA exhibits a lower loss of 39.5%, compared to 48.3% for Pt/SWCNT-MEA and 93.2% for commercial Pt/C in maximum power density. These results indicate that nitrogen-containing carbon shells and SWCNTs as supports contribute to enhancing the stability and activity of the catalyst, thereby leading to the excellent performance of the PEFC.

40223438	Sequential Co-Deposition of Perovskite Film: An Effective Way of Tailoring Bandgap in All Vacuum Processed Perovskite Solar Cells.	This study introduces a simple and effective way to control the bandgap of perovskite film by constructing bilayer film composed of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) layers. The bilayer film is fabricated through the sequential co-deposition of methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), followed by formamidinium iodide (FAI) and PbI<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, the bandgap of the bilayer film can be tuned from 1.60 to 1.51 eV by adjusting the thickness of each layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that the highly diffusive methylammonium ions (MA<sup>+</sup>) enables the formation of stable α-phase with formamidinium ions (FA<sup>+</sup>) in the bilayer perovskite film even without further thermal annealing. Bilayer film-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated through an all-vacuum deposition process.

40223435	Thermal Imaging for Quality Control in Thin Silicon-Based Coatings for Lithium-Ion Batteries: Defect Detection, Drying Dynamics, and Machine Learning-Based Mass Loading Estimation.	This study demonstrates thermal imaging as a non-destructive, real-time quality-control-method for detecting coating defects, analyzing mass loading, and understanding drying dynamics in silicon-based thin coatings. Thermal imaging identifies critical defects such as streaks, pinholes, and chatter marks through distinct thermal signatures, with streaks reducing surface temperature by up to 15 °C. It establishes strong correlations between surface temperature, mass loading, and coating thickness: for instance, a 100 µm wet film thickness shows a surface temperature of ≈50 °C, corresponding to a mass loading of 2.4 mg cm⁻<sup>2</sup>. Drying dynamics reveal that thicker coatings retain more solvent, prolong drying, and shrink significantly, with 100 µm wet-gap coatings shrinking by up to 60%. A Random Forest machine learning model predicts mass loading with high accuracy (±0.3 mg cm⁻<sup>2</sup>) using surface temperature data, highlighting the feasibility of thermal imaging-based quality estimation. While validated in a batch process, this approach is well-suited for integration into roll-to-roll production across diverse thin coating applications, such as batteries, solar cells, and functional films. Thermal imaging provides a robust pathway for real-time defect detection, drying optimization, and quality control, improving coating performance and production reliability.
40223434	Controlled Synthesis of Dy/Cu Bimetallic Atoms for Efficient Artificial Photosynthesis.	The birth of metal atom catalysts marked a new historical stage in the field of catalysis, allowing scientists to better understand the science of catalysis at the atomic level. On the basis of anchoring independent metal atoms, bimetal dysprosium-copper atoms are successfully anchored on graphdiyne (DyCu/GDY). Dy and Cu metal atoms are selectively anchored in triangular holes of GDY and stabilized by non-integer charge transfer and the confined space effect between the metals and GDY. The dynamic charge-transfer equilibrium caused by the inherent non-integer charge transfer between GDY and metal atoms produces sustained high activity, inducing a redistribution of surface charge. This result shows that the non-integer charge transfer strongly promotes the adsorption activation of CO<sub>2</sub> and the desorption of the reaction intermediates, realizing the unpredictable selectivity and activity of CO<sub>2</sub> conversion in the process of artificial photosynthesis, where the selectivity and yield of CO are 98% and 279 µmol g<sub>cat.</sub> <sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.

40223432	Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties of Biscarbazole-Embedded Diaza[7]helicenes.	In this study, we report the synthesis and chiroptical properties of biscarbazole-embedded diaza[7]helicenes. Although the classical photocyclization pathway was unsuccessful, the strategic introduction of a bromo group successfully yielded the desired helical compounds. Interestingly, using methoxy groups instead of bromo groups led to the formation of an unusual degraded product during photocyclization. The synthesized molecules were resolved into their enantiomers, and their chiroptical properties were investigated by using steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopy. Additionally, the excited-state dynamics were examined through time-resolved fluorescence decay measurements. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to rationalize the observed optical properties.
40223430	Glycosylation of an N-Acetylated Glucosamine Disaccharide Using an Orthogonally Protected 3-Iodo-Kdo Fluoride Donor.	Kdo (3-Deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid) is an essential sugar found in bacterial lipopolysaccharides with significant biomedical relevance. This study introduces an orthogonally protected 3-iodo-Kdo fluoride donor and demonstrates its coupling to a pre-synthesized β-(1→6)-linked N-acetylglucosamine disaccharide acceptor as an example. Nuclear magnetic resonance data indicates the presence of an intraresidue hydrogen bond in the distal glucosamine unit. Two complementary glycosylation approaches are explored with an emphasis on achieving high stereoselectivity and minimizing protecting-group manipulation. The orthogonal protection of 3-iodo Kdo fluoride donor offers insights into tailoring Kdo-based donors for specific biomedical applications. While yields vary depending on the approach, they are sufficient to demonstrate the donor's applicability. These findings enable the design of advanced glycomimetic constructs for therapeutic and vaccine research.
40223429	Self-Adhesive Gelatin/Slide-Ring Double-Network Hydrogel for Human Motion Sensing and Morse Code Communication.	Hydrogels emerge as highly promising candidates for wearable electronics due to their moldability and biocompatibility. However, hydrogel-based wearable electronics often suffer from poor mechanical properties and limited adhesion, pose significant challenges to their practical application. Herein, a conductive, stretchable, and self-adhesive gelatin/slide ring hydrogel (SRH) with a double-network (DN) structure is developed by incorporating a polyrotaxane (PR) based cross-linker in the hydrogel with the gelatin (GEL) network. The water-soluble allylic PR (APR) cross-linkers are prepared from the cyclodextrin-based PR via a simple one-step method. Additionally, the effect of APR cross-linkers with different sliding capabilities on the mechanical properties of SRH is further investigated aiming to optimize performance. The optimized SRH achieves a balance between toughness (2226 kJ m<sup>-3</sup>) and rigidity (154 kPa), along with high stretchability (3048%) and strong adhesion to various substrate materials. More importantly, this DN hydrogel is demonstrated as a human motion sensor capable of Morse code communication. This work not only advances the understanding of slidable PR cross-linker applications but also paves the way for innovative hydrogels tailored for high-performance wearable electronics, broadening their scope and functionality in real-world use.
40223428	2-Bromohexadecanoic Acid as a Novel Bidentate Ligand for Passivation of Cesium Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals with Near-Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and Superior Photostability.	Halide vacancies on the surfaces of cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbX<sub>3</sub>, X = Cl, Br, or I) nanocrystals (NCs) play a crucial role in their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and photostability. However, effectively passivating these vacancies remains a challenge. Here, 2-bromohexadecanoic acid (BHA) is introduced as a bidentate auxiliary ligand for CsPbX<sub>3</sub> NCs. The CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> and CsPbBr<sub>1.5</sub>I<sub>1.5</sub> NCs, comodified with BHA, oleic acid (OA), and oleylamine (OLA) with 20% of OA substituted by BHA, are synthesized using a hot-injection technique and are designated as BHA-CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> and BHA-CsPbBr<sub>1.5</sub>I<sub>1.5</sub> NCs. The BHA-CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> NCs exhibit a PLQY of 97% and retain 42.19% of their original intensity after 48 h of continuous ultraviolet light exposure. The photoluminescence (PL) properties, stability, and PL recombination mechanism of the BHA-CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> NCs are investigated in detail. It is believed that the carboxyl oxygen and ortho-bromine atoms enhance the binding strength of BHA to the surface of CsPbX<sub>3</sub>. Additionally, the Br<sup>-</sup> ions produced from the biomolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction between BHA and OLA partially occupy the anionic vacancies on the surface of CsPbX<sub>3</sub>. These interactions reduce the halide vacancies and enhance the PL performance of CsPbX<sub>3</sub>.
40223426	The P4-phospholipid flippase Atp11a is required for maintenance of eye and ear structure in zebrafish.	The atp11a gene encodes a phospholipid flippase protein required to flip phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane to the inner leaflet. Mutations in ATP11A have been described in patients with sensorineural hearing loss and neurologic deterioration, however little is known regarding the mechanism by which loss of atp11a results in such phenotypes. To this end, we created loss of function atp11a mutant zebrafish to characterize potential disease states. We demonstrate that mutant atp11a zebrafish display a reduced number of stereocilia in the larval ear and a reduced number of hair cells in some sensory neuromasts, indicating that these fish represent an ideal model to study atp11a-attributable hearing loss. In addition, atp11a mutant zebrafish raised in a standard light cycle have reduced photoreceptor outer segments, the severity of which is lessened when mutant larvae are raised in the dark. Photoreceptors that do remain in homozygous atp11a mutants have undergone mitochondrial fission producing an increased number of mitochondria suggesting that defects in energy homeostasis may contribute to or result from outer segment degradation.
40223423	An 8-Micrometer-Thick Film Strain Sensor with Conformal 3D Microstructure for Accurate Detection of Body Motion and Air Leakage.	Elastomer-based resistive super-thin film strain sensors show great application potentials in electronic skins, human-machine interaction systems, wearable devices for healthcare, and machine learning algorithms. However, it is challenging to accurately monitor the deformation of human body joints and organs with curved surfaces (e.g., knees, throats, finger joints) by only taking advantage of material thickness and elasticity of conventional 2D film strain sensors. Herein, a simple strategy is developed to fabricate conformal elastomeric thin film sensors with periodic 3D microstructure inspired by the ridges and valleys of human skin for accurate signal acquisition. Specifically, an 8-micrometer-thick elastic film strain sensor with 3D microstructure is fabricated via thermoforming followed by in situ chemical growth of silver nanoparticles. The 3D film strain sensors exhibit excellent signal linearity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) and relatively high sensitivity (gauge factor = 14) over a relatively wide strain range (≈43%), with an ultra-low strain detection limit of 0.025%, enabling potential applications in human healthcare monitoring and air leakage detection. Thus, this study unveils a simple methodology to process microstructure-enabled conformable 3D film strain sensors, which show good conformability and multiple mechanical sensing functions for advancing the development of next-generation flexible strain sensors.
40223421	Spatial regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential by 𝛂5ꞵ1 integrin engagement in collective cell migration.	The mechanistic links between mechanical forces and bioenergetics remain elusive. We report an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) along the leading row of collectively migrating Xenopus laevis mesendoderm cells at sites where fibronectin- a5b1 integrin substrate traction stresses are greatest. Real-time metabolic analyses reveal a5b1 integrin-dependent increases in respiration efficiency in cells on fibronectin substrates. Elevation of metabolic activity is reduced following pharmacologic inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Attachment of mesendoderm cells to fibronectin fragments that support differing a5b1 integrin conformational and ligand-binding affinity states, increases MMP when both the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and Pro-Pro-Ser-Arg-Asn (PPSRN) synergy sites of fibronectin are engaged by the receptor. Cell stretch on deformable fibronectin substrates also results in a FAK-dependent increase in MMP. Inhibition of MMP or ATP-synthase activity slows collective cell migration velocity in vivo, further suggesting that integrin-dependent adhesion and signaling contribute to metabolic changes. These data highlight an underexplored link between ECM-integrin adhesion and metabolic activity in embryonic cell migration. We propose that fibronectin-integrin adhesion and signaling help shape the metabolic landscape of collectively migrating cells.
40223420	Synthesis and Machine Learning Prediction of High Entropy Multi-Principal Element Nanoparticles.	The vast compositional space of multi-principal element nanoparticles (MPENs), along with their unique properties and diverse applications, has garnered significant attention from the research community. MPENs exhibit unique properties, high configurational entropy, multi-element synergy, and long-range atomic ordering, featuring distinct sublattices of semi-metallic or metallic components. This review reports the recent approaches described in the literature, highlighting their commonalities and differences, and classifies them into general strategies. This report discusses in detail the synthesis approaches of single-phase MPENs. To integrate experimental validation with computational preselection, machine learning (ML) offers the opportunity to establish relationships between lattice structures, properties, and phase formations and how collect and analysis of experimental data. Additionally, challenges such as ML-guided uncertainty quantification and materials design are explored.
40223419	Controlling Thermal Conductivity of Amorphous SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub> Films through Structural Engineering Utilizing Single Crystal Substrate Surfaces.	Development of thin films with low thermal conductivity (κ) and high dielectric breakdown strength is essential to engineer insulating materials for electronics packaging and other application domains, such as power electronics. Silica glass (SiO<sub>2</sub>) has extremely high dielectric breakdown strength but a relatively high κ compared to multicomponent silicate glasses. This study reveals that a large and systematic decrease in κ can be obtained by shorter intermediate ordering distances controlled by stronger constraints from the substrate surface atoms. The largest effect on κ is observed for SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub> films on Si substrates, which can reach one-third of the bulk value. The change in ordering is observable by the shift of the main halo measured by grazing incidence X-ray total scattering. The improved understanding of the κ of SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub> films presented herein could enable new materials design for electronic devices including wide-bandgap semiconductors.
40223418	Pediatric Reference Ranges and Test Characteristics of E-point Septal Separation as a Marker for Left Ventricular Dysfunction: A Retrospective Study.	E-point septal separation (EPSS) is a well-established quantitative point-of-care ultrasound metric for estimating left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) in adults. However, its utility in pediatric populations remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the test characteristics of EPSS as a marker of LV systolic dysfunction in pediatric patients.
40223417	Pathway Complexity of Kinetically Trapped Dipeptide-Based Metastable State: Supramolecular Structural Transformation and Helicity Tuning.	Understanding the complexity of nanostructures involved during the supramolecular polymerization process can be achieved by kinetic control rather than thermodynamic stability. Study on supramolecular pathway complexity and associated nanostructures will provide precise control over the materials' properties. This work illustrates the pathway complexity and structural transformation of a naphthalimide-(NMI)-conjugated dipeptide from monomer to thermodynamically stable aggregated state in a binary mixed solvent system (DMSO and water). The self-assembly propensity can be modulated by changing the ratio of water, which offers an effective approach to provide kinetic stability to the on-pathway gel state before reaching its thermodynamically stable crystalline precipitate state. An in-depth spectroscopic and microscopic investigation suggested that the self-assembly process initiated the formation of tiny particles, which further nucleated to form a helical nanofibrilar assembly. At higher water percentages, the supramolecular gel state showed a transient behavior and proceeded toward its thermodynamic stability. However, at lower water percentage, the self-assembly process is kinetically trapped in its gel state. Here, the helicity of nanofibers can be modulated by altering the percentage of water in the mixed solvent. The self-assembled system is completely thermoreversible and can retain its chiral memory even after complete dissolution in the respective solvent composition.
40223416	Enhanced Deformability Through Distributed Buckling in Stiff Quasicrystalline Architected Materials.	Architected materials achieve unique mechanical properties through precisely engineered microstructures that minimize material usage. However, a key challenge of low-density materials is balancing high stiffness with stable deformability up to large strains. Current microstructures, which employ slender elements such as thin beams and plates arranged in periodic patterns to optimize stiffness, are largely prone to instabilities, including buckling and brittle collapse at low strains. This challenge is here addressed by introducing a new class of aperiodic architected materials inspired by quasicrystalline lattices. Beam networks derived from canonical quasicrystalline patterns, such as the Penrose tiling in two dimensions and icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) in three dimensions, are shown to create stiff, stretching-dominated topologies with non-uniform force chain distributions, effectively mitigating the global instabilities observed in periodic designs through distributed localized buckling instabilities. Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these designs in combining stiffness and stable deformability at large strains, representing a significant advancement in the development of low-density metamaterials for applications requiring high impact resistance and energy absorption. These results demonstrate the potential of deterministic quasi-periodic topologies to bridge the gap between periodic and random structures, while branching toward uncharted territory in the property space of architected materials.
40223415	Gold bis(dithiolene) radical with fused pyrazine and dithiine rings on dithiolene ligand turns metallic under pressure.	Conducting molecular materials built on dithiolene complexes, as mixed-valence salts or single component materials, are most often based on <i>planar</i> structures which efficiently stack on top of each other. Herein, we report an original dithiolene ligand, namely, [1,4]dithiino[2,3-<i>b</i>]pyrazine-2,3-bis(thiolate) (hereafter noted as pzdtdt), which combines an electron-withdrawing pyrazine ring and a folded (by 40-50°) dithiine ring. Until now, such strong distortions from planarity have been hindering the isolation of highly conducting materials from dithiine-containing dithiolene complexes. However, in this study, we showed that the gold complex radical [Au(pzdtdt)<sub>2</sub>]˙ obtained <i>via</i> electrocrystallization from the 1e<sup>-</sup> oxidation of [Ph<sub>4</sub>P][Au(pzdtdt)<sub>2</sub>] organized into regular, non-dimerized chains in the solid state. Interestingly, [Au(pzdtdt)<sub>2</sub>]˙ exhibited a semi-conducting behaviour at ambient pressure and turned metallic upon application of pressures above 4 GPa. The electronic structure of [Au(pzdtdt)<sub>2</sub>]˙ was investigated in terms of electron localization effects through spin-polarized band-structure calculations.
40223413	Morphology Engineering in Cobalt-Free Li-Rich Oxides for High-Capacity and Strain-Tolerant Cathodes.	Morphology engineering plays a critical role in enhancing ionic diffusion kinetics and activating oxygen redox activity in cobalt-free lithium-rich layered oxides (LROs), addressing their intrinsic limitations for high-energy-density batteries. Herein, a morphology-engineering strategy is proposed to synthesize cobalt-free LRO cathodes with radially arranged primary grains (LRO-RA) and short rod-like grains (LRO-SR). The radial architecture of LRO-RA establishes fast Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion pathways, as evidenced by its near-identical Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion coefficient to LRO-SR despite dominating oxygen redox contributions. This accelerated ion transport facilitates reversible anionic redox, yielding a 79 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> higher initial discharge capacity (0.1C) and a 50.6 mV lower O oxidation potential compared to LRO-SR. Advanced spectroscopic and diffraction analyses confirm that the radial morphology stabilizes anionic redox, minimizes MnO<sub>6</sub> distortion, and mitigates strain accumulation. Consequently, LRO-RA achieves a 94.8% capacity retention after 400 cycles (1C), far exceeding LRO-SR (75.6%), with mitigated voltage decay. Post-cycling analysis confirms that the dense radial grains resist electrolyte infiltration and phase transformation, preserving structural integrity. This work elucidates how morphology-driven ion transport optimization amplifies oxygen redox reversibility, offering a universal design principle for high-capacity Li-rich cathodes.
40223412	Deactivation Mechanism and Mitigation Strategies of Single-Atom Site Electrocatalysts.	Single-atom site electrocatalysts (SACs), with maximum atom efficiency, fine-tuned coordination structure, and exceptional reactivity toward catalysis, energy, and environmental purification, have become the emerging frontier in recent decade. Along with significant breakthroughs in activity and selectivity, the limited stability and durability of SACs are often underemphasized, posing a grand challenge in meeting the practical requirements. One pivotal obstacle to the construction of highly stable SACs is the heavy reliance on empirical rather than rational design methods. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to offer a concise overview of the recent progress in SACs stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism and mitigation strategies. Herein, this review first critically summarizes the SACs degradation mechanism and induction factors at the atomic-, meso- and nanoscale, mainly based on but not limited to oxygen reduction reaction. Subsequently, potential stability/durability improvement strategies by tuning catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface are delineated, including construction of robust substrate and metal-support interaction, optimization of active site stability, fabrication of porosity and surface modification. Finally, the challenges and prospects for robust SACs are discussed. This review facilitates the fundamental understanding of catalyst degradation mechanism and provides efficient design principles aimed at overcoming deactivation difficulties for SACs and beyond.

To investigate the pathophysiology of persistent geotropic direction-changing positional nystagmus (pGeo DCPN) by analyzing the caloric responses and clinical course in patients with pGeo DCPN and other variants of lateral semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (LSCC BPPV).
40223408	Analysis of Trapeziometacarpal Joint Mechanics During Spanning and Nonspanning Fixation for Thumb Metacarpal Distraction Lengthening.	Thumb trapeziometacarpal joint (TMj) contact area, pressures, and stability were quantified during metacarpal osteotomy and distraction lengthening with and without TMj-spanning fixation in a cadaver model. Spanning fixation was hypothesized to decrease TMj contact pressure, contact area, joint space narrowing, and subluxation compared with metacarpal fixation alone.
40223405	Developments in the treatment of multiple myeloma: overview and nursing implications.	Multiple myeloma is a haematological cancer where plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow. In the past there were few therapeutic options beyond autologous stem cell transplant. However, systemic treatments have dramatically improved over the past two decades, transforming multiple myeloma from an incurable disease with poor prognosis to a relapsing-remitting long-term condition with greatly improved survival. As a consequence, patients live longer, undergo protracted and burdensome treatments, and experience long-term effects of the disease and its treatment that negatively affect their quality of life. This article provides an overview of multiple myeloma and its diagnosis, treatment and burden, and describes the role of nurses in assessing patients and managing the consequences of the disease and its treatment.
40223396	Gambogic Acid Based Coordination Polymer Reinforces High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Gynecologic Malignancies.	High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as a promising non-invasive treatment for solid tumors. Nevertheless, HIFU may also induce the upregulation of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP-90), potentially resulting in resistance to HIFU. Besides, although it is effective against in situ tumors, challenges remain with tumor metastasis and recurrence. Herein, the innovative design of gambogic acid (GA) based coordination polymer-GAZn-PEG nanoparticles (GAZn-PEG NPs) are synthesized through the coordination of GA with zinc ions (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), and subsequently functionalized with lipid bilayer incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), sensitizing HIFU for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers. Briefly, under HIFU exposure, GA markedly suppresses the expression of HSP-90, thereby increasing the tumor's sensitivity to HIFU therapy. Furthermore, Zn<sup>2+</sup> not only overcome the issue of GA's poor water solubility but also synergistically stimulate immune responses in conjunction with GA. More intriguingly, it has been discovered that GAZn-PEG can effectively activate the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of the interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, thereby enhancing the immune responses provoked by HIFU. Specifically, GAZn-PEG NPs show a remarkable increase in dendritic cell activation and the effective stimulation of the cGAS-STING pathway, crucial for long-term protection against tumor recurrence and metastasis.
40223355	Effects of Antibiotics on First-line Immunotherapy in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.	Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has become the first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC). However, the impact of antibiotic (ATB) use on the efficacy of immunotherapy in RM-NPC remains unclear. A total of 200 patients with RM-NPC who started first-line immunotherapy between October 2021 and September 2023 were included. Forty-six patients received ATB within 60 days before and 42 days after the first infusion of immunotherapy (group ATB+), and the remaining 154 patients were in group ATB-. The median progression-free survival (PFS) times of the ATB+ and ATB- groups were 11.20 and 19.87 months, respectively (P = 0.061). The 2-year overall survival (OS) rates of the ATB+ and ATB- groups were 52.6% and 76.7%, respectively (P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, ATB use was significantly associated with worse OS (hazard ratio = 2.549, P = 0.002). No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of grade 3+ treatment-related adverse events. ATB use in RM-NPC may reduce the effectiveness of first-line immunotherapy.
40223331	Combined chocolate drug-coatedballoon treatment of femoropopliteal artery lesions in patients with Rutherford Grade 3-6.	<b></b><i>Background:</i> To investigate the efficacy of Chocolate balloon use as an adjunct to drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty for the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions. <i>Patients and methods:</i> This retrospective study was performed with a 12-month follow-up period. The rate of flow-limiting dissection, primary patency, rate and length of bailout stenting, and freedom from major adverse limb events (MALEs) were compared between femoropopliteal lesions treated with plain balloons (PBs) and those treated with Chocolate balloons combined with DCB angioplasty. <i>Results:</i> In total, 192 patients (197 de-novo lesions) were included: 137 patients (141 lesions) in the PB group and 55 patients (56 lesions) in the Chocolate balloon group. The mean total lesion lengths were 126.84±71.57 and 138.39±65.35 mm (P=0.297), more than half of patients had chronic total occlusion (53.2% and 51.8%, P=0.859), the rates of flow-limiting dissection were 15.6% and 12.5% (P=0.579). Rates of primary patency were 88.1% and 92.6%, respectively. Chocolate balloon use reduced the mean total bailout stenting length (135.17±68.85 vs. 98.24±36.78 mm, P=0.022), including in complex lesions (180±70.43 vs. 102.50±44.64 mm, P=0.011), and the absolute bailout stenting length (total bailout stenting/lesion length ratio; 0.74±0.24 vs. 0.48±0.19, P=0.017). <i>Conclusions:</i> Relative to PB, Chocolate balloon use combined with DCB angioplasty did not show a significant advantage. It did, however, reduce the absolute total bailout stenting length in complex lesions.
40223316	Cardiac Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) in Adolescents With Chest Pain or Syncope in the Emergency Department: Is There a Sex Discrepancy?	Cardiac POCUS is sometimes performed in patients with chest pain or syncope in the pediatric ED. It is possible that adolescent females are less likely to receive a scan due to provider discomfort with the potential obstruction of breast tissue. The primary aim of this study was to compare the proportion of cardiac POCUS obtained in adolescent males versus females to determine whether there is a difference. This was a retrospective chart review of adolescent patients who presented with chest pain or syncope from the year 2018 to 2020. Cardiac POCUS scans obtained on this cohort were reviewed, and the patients were then compared by sex to see whether there were differences in the number and proportion of scans obtained. The quality of the overall scans was also evaluated and compared to see whether there was a sex-based difference. Descriptive statistics was calculated, and differences were assessed by sex using χ2 test. A total of 2814 patients were enrolled in the study; 1096 were male, and 1718 were female. Of those, 259 received cardiac POCUS; 132 (51%) were male and 127 (49%) were female. There was a significant difference in the proportion of patients who received cardiac POCUS, based on sex (P<0.0001). There was no significant difference in the sex of the patient and the quality of the images obtained. Interrater reliability between a Pediatric Emergency Medicine fellow who has had cardiac POCUS training and a pediatric cardiologist was compared and yielded a kappa of 0.565. There was a significant difference in the sex of the patients who received cardiac POCUS for the complaint of chest pain or syncope.
40223309	A case report of semaglutide induced sarcopenia: causes of fatigue in older adults.	Semaglutide, a medication used for type 2 diabetes and weight loss, may have unexpected side effects such as sarcopenia and age-related loss of muscle mass and strength. A 74-year-old male patient with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia presented with progressive fatigue over 2 years. He experienced a significant decline in walking endurance and speed despite the absence of joint pain or other obvious causes. He had a history of ocular myasthenia gravis and localized prostate cancer, both of which were well-managed. Further investigation revealed a weight loss of 8 kg after starting semaglutide treatment for diabetes. Physical examinations revealed reduced muscle bulk and strength. Extensive investigations, including blood tests, imaging, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing, have ruled out other potential causes of fatigue. The patient's fatigue improved after reducing the semaglutide dose and implementing a tailored exercise program that focused on muscle strengthening. This case highlights the potential contribution of semaglutide to muscle mass loss and subsequent fatigue, particularly among older adults.
40223290	Exendin-4(1-32)K-Capric Acid, a Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist, Suppresses Food Intake via Arcuate Pro-Opiomelanocortin Neurons.	Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin known for its anti-obesity effects, and several effective drugs targeting GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs) have recently been developed to treat obesity. Although GLP-1Rs are expressed by various populations of central neurons, it is still unclear which specific populations mediate the anti-obesity effects of GLP-1R agonists.
40223286	Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) in the Netherlands.	We report highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 virus infection in 10 Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) found dead throughout January and February 2024 in the Netherlands. Five birds were infected with the H5N5 subtype, notable for markers of adaptation to mammals. Continuous infectious disease surveillance remains important in wild birds.
40223281	Antioxidants Ameliorates Ionizing Radiation-Induced Microcephaly in Cerebral Organoid Derived from Human-induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.	Ionizing radiation exposure induces DNA damage and chromosome aberrations through both direct and indirect effect. The indirect effects are primarily mediated by the generation of hydroxyl radicals, a process attributed to radiation. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ascorbic acid (AA) are known as radical scavengers and have radioprotective effects. Radiation therapy is widely employed in the treatment of malignant tumors such as glioblastoma; however, its side effects, including cognitive impairments resulting from damage to healthy neurons, pose significant challenges. To ameliorate these effects, radioprotective reagents have been sought. In this study, we used cerebral organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells to address the radioprotective effect of radical scavengers, DMSO and AA in brain exposure. Although exposure to radiation for 20-day-old cerebral organoids results in DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis leading to microcephaly phenotype, treatment with DMSO or AA not only before but also after radiation alleviated DNA damage, cell death, and the microcephaly phenotype. Our results suggest that DMSO and AA are candidates for the radioprotective reagents for brain tumor therapy.
40223245	Forensic and Health Challenges of Refugees in Turkish Emergency Departments: A Retrospective Analysis.	BACKGROUND The growing number of refugees in Turkey has had a considerable impact on the healthcare system, particularly in emergency departments (EDs). It is of great importance to gain insight into the demographic, clinical, and financial challenges associated with providing healthcare to refugees in these settings in order to enhance the quality of care and optimize resource allocation. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the demographic and clinical findings in 5729 refugees presenting to a major emergency department in Turkey during 2023. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted between January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024, at one of Turkey's largest hospitals. The study focused on refugees who presented to the emergency department and included an analysis of demographic data, clinical diagnoses, treatment outcomes, and financial costs associated with refugee cases. RESULTS A total of 415 464 patients presented to the ED, of these, 5729 (1.4%) were refugees. The largest group of refugee patients were Syrian nationals (2238, 39%). Among all refugee patients, 4230 (73%) presented with internal medical conditions, while 1498 (27%) were classified as medicolegal cases (p=0.02). The most prevalent medicolegal causes were simple falls (896, 59.8%) and firearm injuries and assaults (342, 22.8%). The majority of patients (n=4584, 80%) were discharged from the emergency department following treatment. A total of 488 patients (8.5%) required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study highlight the intricate interrelationship between medical, forensic, and financial challenges in refugee healthcare, underscoring the pivotal role of EDs in addressing these complexities.
40223242	Chronic Appendicitis-Induced Effusive-Constrictive Pericarditis and Hepatic Fibrosis: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND Effusive-constrictive pericarditis (ECP) is a rare pediatric condition linked to infections, autoimmune disorders, or post-surgical complications. Appendicitis, a common abdominal emergency, rarely causes systemic inflammation affecting distant organs. We report a unique case of chronic appendicitis with an appendicolith leading to ECP and hepatic fibrosis, necessitating extensive diagnostic evaluation and surgical interventions. CASE REPORT A 14.5-year-old boy presented with progressive dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, low-grade fever, and intermittent abdominal pain. Examination revealed hepatomegaly and systemic inflammation. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, and mild liver enzyme abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade, prompting urgent pericardiocentesis. CT identified a calcified appendicolith, but appendectomy was deferred to prioritize pericardial management. Pericardiocentesis provided partial relief. Persistent symptoms and further imaging confirmed pericarditis, leading to a subtotal pericardiectomy. Histology revealed chronic fibrotic pericarditis without infection. The patient improved significantly postoperatively but returned 6 weeks later with acute abdominal pain and fever. Imaging confirmed a perforated appendix with an abscess. Appendectomy led to complete resolution of symptoms, normalization of inflammatory markers, and improvement in hepatic and cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of atypical appendicitis with systemic involvement. Recognizing abdominal pathologies as potential sources of systemic inflammation is vital, especially in refractory cases. Early intervention in the primary source can prevent severe complications and improve outcomes.
40223235	MoS<sub>2</sub>@C-Modified Separator as an Efficient Polysulfide Barrier for High-Performance Li-S Batteries.	Due to the promising energy density (2800 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>) and high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>), there has been significant research interest in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) recently. However, the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics impede the commercial application of LSBs. In this work, a MoS<sub>2</sub>@C interlayer-modified commercial polypropylene (PP) (MoS<sub>2</sub>@C-PP) separator is designed to improve the electrochemical performance of LSBs. The active sites provided by MoS<sub>2</sub> are conducive to enhancing the absorption of polysulfide lithium and improving the electrochemical performance. The N-doped carbon not only facilitates electrolyte penetration but also enhances ion transfer to promote reaction kinetics. Additionally, the formation of C-S bonds significantly reduces the shuttle effect. These factors largely accelerate the redox kinetics and decrease the shuttle effect, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of LSBs. As a consequence, the LSB with the MoS<sub>2</sub>@C-PP separator achieves a high discharge capacity of 860.5 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.5 C after 200 cycles and a superior rate performance of 711.5 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 2 C. This work offers a promising direction for enhancing the electrochemical performance of LSBs through separator modification .

40223142	Low blood flow velocity in the left atrial appendage in sinus rhythm as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: results of a prospective cohort study with 3 years of follow-up.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of cardioembolic stroke and can lead to severe and recurrent cerebrovascular events. Thus, identifying patients suffering from cardioembolic events caused by undetected AF is crucial. Previously, we found an association between increasing stroke severity and a decreasing left atrial appendage (LAA) blood flow velocity below 60 cm/s.
40223139	Oncogenic gene fusions in cancer: from biology to therapy.	Oncogenic gene fusions occur across a broad range of cancers and are a defining feature of some cancer types. Cancers driven by gene fusion products tend to respond well to targeted therapies, where available; thus, detection of potentially targetable oncogenic fusions is necessary to select optimal treatment. Detection methods include non-sequencing methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and sequencing methods, such as DNA- and RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). While NGS is an efficient way to analyze multiple genes of interest at once, economic and technical factors may preclude its use in routine care globally, despite several guideline recommendations. The aim of this review is to present a summary of oncogenic gene fusions, with a focus on fusions that affect tyrosine kinase signaling, and to highlight the importance of testing for oncogenic fusions. We present an overview of the identification of oncogenic gene fusions and therapies approved for the treatment of cancers harboring gene fusions, and summarize data regarding treating fusion-positive cancers with no current targeted therapies and clinical studies of fusion-positive cancers. Although treatment options may be limited for patients with rare alterations, healthcare professionals should identify patients most likely to benefit from oncogenic gene fusion testing and initiate the appropriate targeted therapy to achieve optimal treatment outcomes.

40223092	Colonic bacterial community responding to selenium-enriched yeast supplementation associated with improved gut mucus function in growing-finishing pigs.	Selenium-enriched yeast (SeY), a high-quality organic source of selenium, enhances antioxidant activity and intestinal health in swine. This study aims to evaluate the effects of varying dietary SeY levels on intestinal morphology, epithelial mucus production, antioxidant activity, and colonic bacterial communities in growing-finishing pigs. Thirty 90-day-old Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire growing-finishing pigs (average body weight of 54.37±2.13 kg) were randomly assigned to five treatment groups. The control group (CON) was fed a basal diet, while the other four groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with SeY at 0.3, 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg, respectively, for an 80-day of feeding trial. The results showed that the addition of SeY at 0.3 mg/kg increased villus height, villus height/crypt ratio, and mucus production in the ileum, as evidenced by the increase in goblet cell number and mucus thickness (P < 0.05). Furthermore, 0.3 mg/kg SeY up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of the MUC-1, claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 genes (P < 0.05). In contrast, high-dose SeY at 5 mg/kg resulting in damage to mucosal morphology. Ileal antioxidant activity of SOD and GSH-Px, and jejunal mRNA expression of GPX-1 and GPX-4, were higher in response to SeY (P < 0.05). Faecal Se excretion increased in SeY groups in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). SeY led to a significant difference in beta diversity among treatment groups (P = 0.002) and led to a significant decrease in the concentrations of isobutyric and isovaleric acids when compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total short-chain fatty acids were positively correlated with the biomarker genera Agathobacter (SeY at 0.3mg/kg), while isobutyrate and isovalerate were negatively correlated with biomarker genera Lactobacillus (SeY at 0.3mg/kg) (P < 0.05). Faecal accumulation of Se was positively correlated with the biomarker genera Alloprevotella (SeY at 3mg/kg) and Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 (SeY at 5mg/kg) and was negatively correlated with biomarker genera Agathobacter (SeY at 0.3mg/kg), Bacteroides (CON), and Faecalibacterium (CON) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, SeY doses of 0.3 mg/kg have beneficial effects on intestinal health, whereas prolonged SeY doses up to 5 mg/kg may compromise the intestinal mucus function in growing-finishing pigs.
40223090	Florfenicol-induced dysbiosis impairs intestinal homeostasis and host immune system in laying hens.

40223087	Harnessing the power of One Health education to tackle Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) and other global health challenges.	One Health is an approach that focuses on balancing and optimizing the health of humans, animals, and ecosystems sustainably. It recognizes that the health and well-being of these three components are interconnected and interdependent. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging infectious diseases like Monkeypox, Avian Influenza, and Dengue, have highlighted the need to strengthen the health workforce's emergency preparedness, given the close link between human, animal, and environmental health. One Health education lays a strong foundation for a global workforce capable of enhancing synergies across various sectors in addressing the complex global health challenges like emerging infectious diseases in the twenty-first century. One Health education is crucial in promoting an interdisciplinary, holistic understanding of the interconnectedness of our planet, as well as transdisciplinary thinking and collaborations. It also encourages responsible citizenship, and global-mindedness, and equips students with problem-based scenarios that foster effective evidence-based decision-making. Significant progress has been made to promote and implement One Health education over the past decade, although some challenges tend to hinder its comprehensiveness. Most of the delivered courses are more theoretical rather than the required practical or field-based sessions. Institutions especially academia play an essential role in providing an enabling environment for the advancement of One Health education. The implementation of One Health education should continuously be prioritized to equip students and health practitioners with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate complex health challenges.

40223035	cGAS-STING signaling in melanoma: regulation and therapeutic targeting.	Melanocytes are the source of the skin cancer known as melanoma. It usually affects the viscera, mucous membranes, and skin. Even so, melanoma only makes for 7% of all skin cancer occurrences. By triggering the generation of type I interferons (IFN-I) and inflammatory cytokines upon identifying microbial DNA, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway promotes anti-microbial innate immunity. A growing body of research indicates that antitumor immunity depends on the cGAS-STING axis being activated. The cGAS-STING-regulated downstream cytokines, particularly IFN-I, act as linkages between adaptive and innate immunity. As a result, an increasing amount of research has concentrated on the synthesis and screening of agonists of the STING pathway. As a result, an increasing amount of research has concentrated on the synthesis and screening of agonists of the STING pathway. The many implications of the cGAS-STING pathway in the pathophysiology and therapy of melanoma are thoroughly examined in this study. Our research highlights the significance of the cGAS-STING pathway in melanoma and identifies it as a key target for boosting immunity against tumors.
40223034	Phytochemical characterization and therapeutic mechanism of Xialiqi capsule on benign prostatic hyperplasia.	Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common urological condition prevalent in elderly men. Xialiqi capsule (XLQC), a traditional Chinese patent medicine, is widely used to manage BPH. However, the precise mechanisms underlying XLQC's effectiveness in treating BPH are not well-understood. We aimed to investigate the phytochemical composition and therapeutic mechanisms of XLQC in the treatment of BPH. We conducted a comprehensive investigation that integrated high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), network pharmacological analysis, and animal experimental validation to explore potential pharmacodynamic compounds and mechanisms of action for XLQC in BPH treatment. In this study, a total of 12 components targeting eight molecular targets were identified; the major components included Danshensu, salidroside, 6-Acetylcodeine, azelaic acid, and berberine. The targets were CASP3, MMP9, PTGS2, IL6, ESR1, ERBB2, HIF1 A, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Enrichment analysis revealed that the molecular targets are mainly through calcium signaling pathway, endocrine resistance, steroid hormone biosynthesis, HIF- 1 signaling pathway, and estrogen signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as oxidative stress response. In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that XLQC effectively inhibited oxidative stress (OS) and cell proliferation by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA), increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD), and inhibiting the expression of Ki- 67 in prostate tissue, thereby improving prostate tissue morphology and reducing prostate index. XLQC can inhibit oxidative stress and cell proliferation, improve the morphology of prostate tissue, reduce the prostate index, and have therapeutic effects on BPH through multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway effects.
40223033	The therapeutic potential of brazilin in bladder cancer: inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I and tumor growth suppression.	This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of brazilin in the treatment of bladder cancer through the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I (Topo 1) and to explore its underlying mechanisms. In vitro experiments were conducted using bladder cancer T24 cell line and in vivo experiments were performed using a bladder cancer mouse model. The effects of brazilin on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage were evaluated. RT-qPCR and Western Blot analyses were used to assess the expression of Topo 1 mRNA and protein after treatment with brazilin. Additionally, tumor growth inhibition and potential side effects were evaluated in the animal model. Brazilin significantly inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and DNA damage in vitro. The expression of Topo 1 was downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that brazilin exerts its effects by inhibiting Topo 1 activity. In vivo, brazilin markedly suppressed tumor growth in the bladder cancer mouse model, with no significant toxic effects observed. Brazilin shows potential as a therapeutic agent for bladder cancer by inhibiting Topo 1 activity, leading to suppressed tumor growth and cellular damage.  This study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential use of brazilin as a novel anticancer drug for bladder cancer treatment.
40223031	Preparation of highly concentrated extracts from large volume of urine as the first step in detecting trace amounts of hypnotics in urine collected in drug-facilitated crime cases.	Detecting hypnotics in victim urine samples collected several days after drug-facilitated crime (DFC) is challenging because most of the drugs have already been excreted. In this study, a sample preparation method was developed for extracting trace amounts of hypnotics using most of the urine excreted at one sampling time (100 mL), and large amounts of matrices were efficiently removed.
40223021	Stabilization mechanism and remediation effectiveness of Pb and cd in agricultural soil using nonmetallic minerals.	Soil contaminated by Pb and Cd has aroused worldwide concern due to the environmental hazards they pose. The effects, mechanisms, and evaluation of Pb and Cd contaminated agricultural soil remediation by nonmetallic minerals are still poorly understood. In this study, solidification/stabilization experiments were used to screen nonmetallic mineral materials and optimize their dosages. Stabilization mechanisms of Pb and Cd by nonmetallic mineral materials were investigated by adsorption kinetics, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The effectiveness of soil remediation was further confirmed through a pot experiment with pak choi (Brassica rapa L. subsp. chinensis), an important non-heading leafy vegetable. Results demonstrated that the SL composite (composed of 2.5% sepiolite and 1.5% limestone, with a total dosage of 4.0%) exhibits the optimal stabilization effect on soil contaminated with Pb and Cd. In soils with low, medium, and high contamination levels, SL reduced the bioavailability of Pb by 97.97%, 96.78%, and 95.82%, and the bioavailability of Cd by 92.96%, 91.76%, and 91.02%, respectively. SL surfaces are rich in hydroxyl (-OH) and carbonate (CO3<sup>2-</sup>) groups, enabling binding with Pb and Cd ions to form hydroxide and carbonate precipitates. Such interactions suggest that chemical adsorption primarily drives Pb and Cd ion stabilization, reducing their bioavailability in soil. Pak choi grown in SL-remediated soil exhibited Pb and Cd contents compliant with China's food safety standards. These findings further validate the bioavailability reduction rate as a suitable metric for evaluating the remediation effectiveness of heavy metal pollution in agricultural soils. This study provides a new strategy for evaluating the remediation efficiency of heavy metal-contaminated agricultural soil.
40223020	Association between radiotherapy and overall survival or cancer-specific survival in patients with solitary plasmacytoma of bone at pre-B cell grade: a real-world study using the SEER database.	Limited real-world studies have compared radiation therapy (RT) to non-RT for patients with solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB). This study investigated the impact of RT on long-term survival outcomes in patients with SPB at the pre-B cell grade within a real-world context. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for patients diagnosed with SPB at the pre-B cell grade between 2010 and 2017. Patients were categorized into two groups based on receipt of RT. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to investigate the value of RT for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 1,922 individuals with SPB at the pre-B cell grade met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among these, 1,417 (74%) received RT, while 505 (26%) underwent non-RT. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed higher rates of OS (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.55-0.74, p < 0.0001) and CSS (HR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.56-0.82, p < 0.0001) in patients who received RT. These results remained consistent across sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Analysis of the SEER database suggests that RT is associated with improved OS and CSS and is the primary treatment for patients with SPB at the pre-B cell grade.

40223011	Leukoreduction filter derived NK cells offer a promising source for off the shelf CAR NK cell immunotherapy.	Immunotherapy employing natural killer (NK) cells has emerged as a transformative approach to treating hematological malignancies. The reprogramming of NK cells by incorporating a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) equipped with potent signaling domains has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing NK cell responses and improving specificity in recognizing cancerous cells. Despite these advancements, the primary challenge in implementing allogeneic NK cell therapy requiring a viable donor source for clinically relevant doses remains unresolved. This study tested NK cells obtained from leukoreduction filters (LRF) post-blood donation to address the need for an efficient and scalable supply of NK cells for generating anti-BCMA CAR NK cells. LRF-NK cells were isolated under sterile conditions and compared with peripheral blood (PB)-derived NK cells in terms of immunophenotype, proliferation capacity, and functional characteristics. Notably, no significant differences in inherent characteristics were observed between LRF-NK and PB-NK cells. Subsequently, both NK cell populations were employed to generate anti-BCMA CAR-NK cells. The data revealed a high specific cytotoxicity of Anti-BCMA CAR LRF-NK cells during co-culture with U266-B1 cells (70.3 ± 4.78%), surpassing that observed with CCRF-CEM cells (31.3 ± 2.35%) and similar to Anti-BCMA CAR PB-NK cells. Furthermore, the expression of IFN-γ and Granzyme B, following the co-culture of Anti-BCMA CAR LRF-NK cells with target cells, mirrored that observed in Anti-BCMA CAR PB-NK cells. This study provides the rationale and feasibility of utilizing LRF-NK cells as a safe, high-yield, accessible, and optimal cost-effective source for cancer immunotherapy.
40222977	The study of outdoor thermal comfort in open spaces of cold climate campus.	In the urbanization process, phenomena such as the urban heat island effect exacerbate climatic deteriorations, leading to environmental issues in cities. Campus areas, as significant ecological components within the urban environment, play a crucial role in environmental regulation. This paper investigates the impact of outdoor physical environments in campuses on users' thermal comfort from the perspective of thermal comfort. Using surveys, meteorological measurements, and behavioral analysis, this study examines four distinctive spaces within a campus in Xi'an, establishing a thermal comfort baseline for the population in Xi'an's campus spaces. The research results indicate: (1) Globe temperature (T<sub>g</sub>), air velocity (V<sub>a</sub>), air temperature (T<sub>a</sub>), and ground temperature (G) are the primary factors affecting students' thermal sensations in campus open spaces. Respondents tended to improve their thermal sensations through changes in humidity and solar radiation. (2) In the campus open spaces of Xi'an, the overall NPET of the subjects was 13.9 °C, with the NPETR ranging from 9.4 to 18.4 °C. (3) The preferred warmth temperature for university students in Xi'an is 15.15 °C, which is 1.25 °C higher than the NPET (13.9 °C).
40222976	Meplazumab, a CD147 antibody, for severe COVID-19: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial.	Meplazumab, a humanized CD147 antibody, showed favorable safety and clinical benefits in phase 1 and phase 2/3 seamless clinical studies. Further evaluation of its therapeutic efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19 is needed. In this phase 3 add-on study, we randomized patients with severe COVID-19 in a 1:1 ratio to receive 0.2 mg/kg meplazumab or placebo via intravenous injection, and evaluated efficacy and safety within 56 days. Between February 2023 and November 2023, 108 patients with severe COVID-19 were randomized to two groups, with their baseline characteristics generally balanced. The primary endpoint, 28-day all-cause mortality was 1.96% in the meplazumab group vs 7.69% in the placebo group (P = 0.1703). Supplementary analysis using composite strategy indicated a significant reduction of 28-day all-cause mortality in meplazumab compared to placebo (3.92% vs 15.38%, P = 0.044). Meplazumab also significantly reduced the mortality in smoking subjects on day 28 (P = 0.047) compared to placebo in supplementary analysis. The secondary endpoint, 56-day all-cause mortality, was 1.96% in the meplazumab group and 11.54% in the placebo group (P = 0.048), which was 3.92% and 15.38%, respectively (P = 0.044) by supplementary analysis. Additional secondary endpoints showed potential benefits, including increased hospital discharge rates, improved clinical outcomes, and improved viral nucleotide conversion rate. Meplazumab demonstrated good safety and tolerability, with no grade ≥ 3 TEAEs observed. These promising results indicate that meplazumab reduces mortality and enhances clinical benefits in severe COVID-19 patients with a good safety profile, providing effective and specific therapeutics for severe COVID-19 (the trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05679479)).
40222948	Through the mind's eye: mapping associations between hoarding tendencies and voluntary and involuntary mental imagery.	Preliminary evidence suggests that mental imagery may be an important clinical feature in hoarding. Individuals who hoard use objects as receptacles for memories, and experience more frequent, intrusive and distressing images compared with the general community. However, the specific nature of these associations remains poorly understood.
40222921	Possible correlation of specific bacteria detected by using a novel screening method and periodontal disease in dogs.	This study sought to create a simple method for screening and detecting oral bacteria associated with periodontal disease as well as to identify the bacterial species that had the strongest correlation with disease severity in dogs. Fifty-two dogs from the Kagoshima University Veterinary Teaching Hospital were included. The periodontal disease status, which included gingival recession, root surface exposure, and gingival redness, was determined through visual examination. Oral swab samples were taken from each dog's gingival margin or tooth cervix using a sterile cotton swab following a standardized protocol. The collected samples were applied to our nanotechnology named sugar chain immobilized magnetized gold nanoparticle/magnetic microparticle (SGNP/MMP) method to obtain bacterial DNA, which was then subjected to qualitative and semiquantitative PCR analyses for 6 genera and 8 species of bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Tannerella forsythia (T. forsythia), Treponema denticola (T. denticola), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), Prevotella intermedia (P. intermedia), Porphyromonas gulae (P. gulae), and Porphyromonas cangingivalis (P. cangingivalis). The severity of periodontal disease was most strongly correlated with T. denticola (associated with the gingival recession), followed by slight total bacteria and P. gingivalis+P. gulae, but no significant correlation was found with P. gulae. Within the scope of this study, the analytical method used may represent a useful standard for screening and detecting specific bacteria, and the quantity of T. denticola is linked to the severity of periodontal disease in dogs.
40222920	A case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor with epithelioid-like morphology in a guinea pig (Cavia porcellus).	Although gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare in guinea pigs, few cases have been reported recently. Here, we present a case of a GIST in a guinea pig that showed atypical cellular morphology with extensive epithelioid-like cells. The tumor was located between the small intestine and the tip of the cecum and originated from the jejunum. Histopathologically, the tumor cells were mixed with epithelioid-like or short spindle-shaped cells with round-to-oval nuclei. Multinucleated cells were also observed. The tumor metastasized to the peritoneal lymph node. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and c-kit. A mutation (large deletion) in exon 11 of the KIT gene was detected using PCR-direct sequencing. Including the previous five cases, GISTs in guinea pigs tended to exhibit nuclear atypia rather than the typical morphology observed in canine GISTs, despite being diagnosed as spindle-shaped. Additionally, the present case exhibited more nuclear atypia, which may be a characteristic feature of GISTs in guinea pigs.
40222919	Malignant myoepithelioma of the sublingual salivary gland in a Japanese Black cow.	A six years and four months old Japanese Black cow presented with a solid mass in the left and middle mandible. Treatment involved the administration of antibiotics and the mass was surgically removed. Recurrence of the mass was observed, and the cow exhibited hypersalivation and anorexia before dying naturally. A necropsy revealed a solid subcutaneous mass infiltrating the oral cavity and the left mandibular bone, with hemorrhage and necrosis. Histopathological examination revealed clear, plasmocytic, spindle-shaped, or polygonal neoplastic cells. The neoplastic cells were immunoreactive with cytokeratin, cytokeratin 5, vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and p63. Considering these findings, the mass was diagnosed as malignant myoepithelioma. This is the first report of malignant myoepithelioma arising from the salivary glands in a cow.

40222892	Close adherence to the Japanese diet is not associated with a high prevalence of hypertension: The Japan Epidemiology Collaboration on Occupational Health Study.	While the traditional Japanese diet has been suggested to increase blood pressure due to its high sodium content, whether the contemporary Japanese diet is associated with blood pressure remains elusive. We developed a traditional Japanese diet score (nine items: white rice, miso soup, soy products, vegetables, mushrooms, seaweeds, fish, salty food, and green tea) and a modified version by substituting white rice with whole-grain rice, reverse scoring for salty food and adding fruits, raw vegetables, and dairy foods using data from 12,213 employees from Japanese companies. Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or more or the use of antihypertensive drugs. A multilevel Poisson regression model with a robust variance estimator was used to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) while adjusting for covariates. The adjusted PRs (95%CIs) of hypertension for the lowest through highest quartiles of the traditional Japanese diet score were 1.00 (reference), 0.94 (0.88-1.02), 0.98 (0.90-1.06), and 0.96 (0.90-1.02), respectively (P for trend=0.29), while those for the modified Japanese diet score were 1.00 (reference), 0.96 (0.94-0.99), 0.95 (0.85-1.05), and 0.94 (0.87-1.01), respectively (P for trend=0.10). In this cross-sectional study, close adherence to the traditional Japanese diet was not associated with the prevalence of hypertension, whereas there was a suggestion of an inverse association between the modified Japanese diet and the prevalence of hypertension.

40222812	Quantifying senescence, death rates, and lifespans of trematode parthenitae.	For many trematode species, individual reproductive parthenitae in first intermediate host colonies senesce, die, and are replaced by newly born parthenitae. The times involved in these processes are poorly understood. Here, we present an approach to estimate parthenita death rates and lifespans that uses readily obtainable data on senescent parthenita frequencies, brood sizes, and offspring (cercaria) release rates. The onset of parthenita senescence is often marked by the degeneration and disappearance of the germinal mass, its source of new offspring. Following germinal mass loss, the remaining viable offspring in a senescent parthenita finish development and are birthed before parthenita death. Therefore, a senescing parthenita's remaining lifespan is the time it takes for all its viable offspring to mature and exit. We can estimate this time by measuring whole-colony (infected snail) cercaria shed rates, dissecting colonies to count reproductives, and then apply the per redia cercaria production rate to the observed brood sizes of senescent parthenitae. The per-capita parthenita death rate is then calculated as the proportion of parthenitae that are senescent divided by their average remaining lifespan. Reproductive parthenita lifespan is the inverse of this death rate. We demonstrate the approach using philophthalmid trematodes, first providing documentation of a free-floating germinal mass in 4 philophthalmids, and then, for 3 of those species, estimating parthenita senescence rates, death rates, and lifespans. This method should be broadly applicable among trematode species and help inform our understanding of trematode colony dynamics, social structure, and the evolution of parthenita senescence.

40222745	Clinical rating scales for assessing pain in newborn infants.	Six to nine per cent of all newborn infants require admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to either illness or prematurity. During their stay, these infants are often subjected to many painful procedures that can cause negative long-term consequences. To reduce the negative effects of pain exposure and ensure optimal and safe pain treatment, accurate assessment of pain is necessary. To achieve this, clinicians are dependent on the use of reliable, objective, and standardised clinical rating scales of pain, henceforth referred to as 'rating scales'. Numerous rating scales have been published; however, discrepancies in validity limit their overall applicability in clinical practice and research. Such limitations may lead to an over- or underestimation of pain, resulting in unnecessary sedation or inadequately treated pain, potentially jeopardising infant safety through treatment side effects, including withdrawal symptoms or prolonged discomfort. To date, the majority of rating scales have been developed to assess procedural pain, whilst fewer scales for prolonged pain are available. Premature infants further complicate matters, as they often have a reduced ability to display robust pain behaviour due to their immaturity. Research has also shown that the use of rating scales in clinical practice is suboptimal, due to both inadequate and infrequent implementation alongside inappropriate choice of scale for the specific pain, population, or setting under evaluation. Despite numerous studies investigating the burden of pain in newborn infants, little work has been done to summarise the current evidence on the appropriateness of rating scales for specific types of pain or infant conditions. This has likely been limited by the subjectivity of pain assessment and further complication of assessing such a non-verbal and immature patient population. The immense burden of neonatal pain worldwide has also led to the development of numerous rating scales in various languages, further hindering evidence summation.

40222743	Exploring Intersectionality in the Medical Care of a Latino Child With Autism.	Felix is a boy aged 10 years with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who presents to the pediatric emergency department for acute behavior change, including decreased interactivity, decreased speech, bruxism, and new urinary incontinence. He is admitted during the weekend, and scheduling of magnetic resonance imaging is delayed. Eventually, he has a computed tomography scan of his head, which shows an abnormal diffuse hypodensity involving the frontal lobe with extension into the cortex, all concerning for ischemia, and he is ultimately diagnosed with Moyamoya disease complicated by stroke. Felix and his family self-identify as Latino and Black and prefer to use a language other than English for medical discussions. Through this case, we (1) reflect on the barriers to clinical care faced by patients with autism; (2) define intersectionality and explore how neurodivergence, race, ethnicity, and parental-provider language discordance can augment and inhibit the provision of equitable care; and (3) discuss strategies that may mitigate the impact of oppression on clinical care.

40221883	The proteostasis burden of aneuploidy.	Aneuploidy refers to chromosome number abnormality that is not an exact multiple of the haploid chromosome set. Aneuploidy has largely negative consequences in cells and organisms, manifested as so-called aneuploidy-associated stresses. A major consequence of aneuploidy is proteotoxic stress due to abnormal protein expression from imbalanced chromosome numbers. Recent advances have improved our understanding of the nature of the proteostasis imbalance caused by aneuploidy and highlighted their relevance with respect to organellar homeostasis, dosage compensation, or mechanisms employed by cells to mitigate the detrimental stress. In this review, we highlight the recent findings and outline questions to be addressed in future research.

40219790	Genetic variants in <i>NUDT15</i> gene their clinical implications in cancer therapy.	Individual variations in the response to thiopurine-based anticancer drugs are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, making it challenging to optimize dosing and minimize toxicity. Among the key genes involved, genetic variations in the <i>nudix hydrolase 15</i> (<i>NUDT15</i>) gene affect on thiopurine metabolism, thus influencing drug efficacy and the risk of severe adverse effects, such as myelosuppression, These variations also contribute to inter-individual differences in drug tolerance and clinical outcomes. Despite the recognized impact of <i>NUDT15</i> variations, there has been limited comprehensive exploration of these variants and their clinical significance in thiopurine therapy. This review provides a thorough analysis of <i>NUDT15</i> genetic variants by synthesizing findings from prior clinical studies and employing <i>in silico</i> analyses to predict the functional effects of variants with uncertain significance. Comprehensive analysis of <i>NUDT15</i> variants and their interactions with other metabolic pathways could offer valuable insights for advancing personalized medicine in cancer treatment. This review aims to establish a foundation for integrating <i>NUDT15</i> genetic information into the clinical practice, reducing toxicity, and improved therapeutic outcomes in patients undergoing thiopurine-based chemotherapy.

40214408	Predicting Maximal Military Occupational Task Performance from Physical Fitness Tests using Machine Learning.	Purpose: Optimal performance in military tasks is crucial for operation success. These tasks are often simulated in training, assessing personnel performance within a military environment. However, these assessments are time-consuming and an injury risk. Physical characteristics such as muscular strength, power, aerobic endurance, and circumferences can be used to predict these dynamic and demanding tasks. Utilising machine learning models to predict assessment outcomes may lead to optimised management of personnel, time, and interventions in the military. Methods: This study recruited 35 participants to complete two physical sessions assessing multiple physical characteristics and lift-to-place and jerry-can-carry assessments. Machine learning models were developed to predict assessment outcomes based on a down-selection of physical characteristics metrics. Root mean square error (RMSE), normalised root mean square error (NRMSE), and coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) were used to evaluate the models' predictive capabilities. Results: The Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Ridge Models could predict the lift-to-place outcome to a RMSE of ±1.77 kg (NRMSE = 4.44%; CVRMSE = 0.18) and ± 2.33 kg (NRMSE = 5.84%; CVRMSE = 0.24) with four and three physical tests, respectively. The Multi-Layer Preceptor and SVR models predicted the jerry-can-carry outcome to ±3.36 laps (NRMSE = 23.06%; CVRMSE = 0.39) and ± 3.67 laps (NRMSE = 25.20%; CVRMSE = 0.42) with twelve and eight physical tests, respectively. Conclusions: The lift-to-place outcome can be accurately predicted, showing potential military implementation. The jerry-can-carry outcome shows promise; however, further model optimisation and training metrics are required to reduce error. Machine learning models demonstrate their applicability to optimise occupational selection pathways and training interventions for desirable performance in military settings.

40214305	Local Delivery of Various Hormonal Drugs Along With Bone Grafts to Improve Osteogenesis: A Systematic Review.	This review aimed to investigate the effect of local delivery of various hormonal drugs and bone grafts to improve osteogenesis. The study included a systematic literature search covering the time period from 1970 to December 2023 using PubMed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A structured search was performed to identify in vivo and in vitro studies. In total, 22 studies were covered after screening the articles based on title and abstract. All of the studies included were animal in vivo studies or in vitro studies and used parathyroid hormone (PTH), growth hormone (GH), and calcitonin. In addition, 87.5% of the studies that used GH reported better outcomes than the control groups; and 66.7% of the studies that used PTH achieved superior outcomes compared to the control group. Moreover, 60% of the studies that used calcitonin achieved superior outcomes compared to the control group. The findings indicated that locally administered hormonal drugs may positively affect osteogenesis in vivo and in vitro. This is especially true for PTH in the healing of surgical bone defects and peri-implant response and for GH in peri-implant bone response. Locally administered hormonal drugs may stimulate bone healing in surgical bone defects and enhance peri-implant bone response.

40213986	Photophysics of meta- and para-nitrophenolate. II. Electronic spectra and quantum dynamics.	The vibronic structure and nuclear dynamics underlying the first absorption bands of meta-nitrophenolate (m-NP) and para-nitrophenolate (p-NP) in the coupled manifold of S1-S2-S3-S4-S5 electronic states are investigated here. Attempts are specifically made to understand the broadening of the experimentally recorded gas phase electronic absorption spectra of both the molecules. Justification is also provided for the shorter lifetime of the S1 state of p-NP as compared to m-NP. First principles nuclear dynamics calculations are performed by both time-independent and time-dependent quantum mechanical methods. The model vibronic coupling Hamiltonians developed via extensive ab initio quantum chemical calculations in Paper I [Mondal et al., J. Chem. Phys. 162, 144314 (2025)] are employed for this purpose. The theoretical results presented in this paper are in good agreement with the available experimental data. While the resolved vibrational peaks are observed in the first absorption band of m-NP, the same for p-NP is highly broad and structureless. Occurrence of S1-S3 low-energy conical intersections relative to S1 equilibrium minimum energy in p-NP leads to a nonradiative internal conversion of the S1 state in ∼1.9 ps, whereas the high energy conical intersections of S1 state with other states in m-NP trapped the wave packet prepared on it and led to a much longer decay rate of ∼30.8 ps of the S1 state of m-NP.
40213985	Photophysics of meta- and para-nitrophenolate. I. The role of configuration, microsolvation, and solvation on the charge transfer transition.	The structure of the first five singlet excited electronic states of meta-nitrophenolate (m-NP) and para-nitrophenolate (p-NP) is investigated here in the gas phase, micro-solvent, and bulk solvent environments. The first excited state (S1) of m-NP was found to be a charge transfer state in the gas phase, whereas that of p-NP is a ππ* state. A stronger coupling between the donor and acceptor molecular orbitals in p-NP leads to a higher excitation energy of the S1 state as compared to m-NP. An examination of the topography of the potential energy surfaces reveals low energy conical intersections of the S1 state with the S2 and S3 states in p-NP. Such conical intersections in m-NP are located at higher energies relative to the S1 state minimum. Repulsion between the S1(1A') and S2(1A″) electronic states via the out-of-plane -NO2 torsional mode leads to a symmetrical double well topography of the S1 state of m-NP. Present results establish that while a single solvent molecule like water, methanol, and acetonitrile leads to a blue shift in the first absorption band maxima of m-NP, the electronic localization on the donor molecular orbital due to a single water molecule yields a red shift in the first absorption band of p-NP. However, the attachment of a single water molecule to the nitro site of p-NP facilitates electronic delocalization, leading to a blue shift in the S1 state excitation energy. As a result, in an aqueous medium, the first absorption band maximum was observed very near to that found in bare p-NP.
40213984	Accurate and efficient parameterization of an atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential for ammonia under extreme conditions.	We present a machine learning interatomic potential for ammonia designed to capture its complex multiphase behavior, including both molecular and superionic phases. The potential is based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) formulation and has been parameterized to facilitate high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations of ammonia under extreme conditions, for pressures up to 100 GPa and for temperatures above 500 K and up to 6000 K. A diverse range of configurations was generated through high-quality ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, covering insulating and superionic ice phases, liquid ammonia, molecular nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2), and metastable compounds that form upon dissociation, including NH4+, H3+, N2H4, and N3H. We demonstrate that the ammonia ACE potential accurately reproduces experimental and density functional theory predicted isotherms and Hugoniots. Crucially, the potential is able to capture the intricate phase behavior of ammonia, including the transition from insulating molecular fluid to the superionic phase. This work provides a robust interatomic potential that can be used for large-scale, accurate simulations of ammonia under extreme thermodynamic conditions, offering a powerful tool for investigating its behavior in various phases and applications.
40213983	Diagrammatic multiplet-sum method (MSM) density-functional theory (DFT): Completion of the two-orbital two-electron model (TOTEM) with an application to the avoided crossing in lithium hydride (LiH).	The Ziegler-Rauk-Baerends multiplet sum method (MSM) assumes that density functional theory (DFT) provides a good description of states dominated by a single determinant. It then uses symmetry to add static correlation to DFT. In our previous article (Article I) [J. Chem. Phys.159, 244306 (2023)], we introduced diagrammatic MSM-DFT as a tool to aid in extending MSM-DFT to include the nondynamic correlation needed for making and breaking bonds even in the absence of symmetry. An attractive feature of this approach is that no functional-dependent parameters need to be introduced, although choices are needed in making correspondences between wave function theory and MSM-DFT diagrams. The preliminary examples in Article I used the two-orbital two-electron model (TOTEM) less completely than could have been the case as we wanted to limit calculations to diagonalizing 2 × 2 matrices, which can be done by solving a simple quadratic equation. Diagrammatic MSM-DFT is extended here to treat the full TOTEM, and it is shown that the unsymmetric lithium hydride molecule dissociates into neutral atoms when diagrammatic MSM-DFT techniques are used to introduce a proper description of the avoided crossing between ionic bonding and covalent bonding states. This involves diagonalizing a 3 × 3 matrix, which requires going beyond solving a quadratic equation but is still trivial these days. The method is tested for Hartree-Fock and for three functionals (LDA, PW91, and B3LYP). All the functionals yield similar results as should be expected for a properly formulated parameter-free theory. Agreement with available estimates show that the magnitude of the coupling element introduced here is excellent. However, more work will be needed to obtain quantitative agreement between our diagrammatic MSM-DFT ground-state potential energy curve and that found from high-quality ab initio calculations.
40213982	Approximations of density matrices in N-electron valence state second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2). III. Large active space calculations with selected configuration interaction reference.	In multi-reference (MR) methods, addressing systems with large active spaces remains a challenge in the field. In Papers I and II of this series, we demonstrated that full rank N-electron valence state second-order perturbation theory (FR-NEVPT2) is a robust MR perturbation theory capable of computing strongly correlated systems with approximate density matrices. However, the previous FR-NEVPT2 implementation requires the computation and storage of fifth-order reduced density matrices (RDMs), limiting the usage of FR-NEVPT2 for systems with large active spaces. In the present work, as Paper III of the series, we report a new FR-NEVPT2 algorithm to handle systems with large active spaces. In the new algorithm, an approximate complete active space (CAS) self-consistent field (SCF) method, iterative configuration expansion (ICE) SCF, is employed to compute the reference wave functions for FR-NEVPT2. Then, the necessary Koopmans matrices of FR-NEVPT2 involving various RDMs are constructed using the intermediates designed by Kollmar et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 155, 234104 (2021)] to avoid storage bottlenecks. The performance of the new FR-NEVPT2 algorithm for systems with large active spaces is evaluated. Our results show that even with aggressive truncation parameters to truncate the ICE-SCF reference wave function, FR-NEVPT2 effectively recovers the missing static correlations of ICE-SCF. Several interesting systems with active spaces up to CAS(34,34) are studied using FR-NEVPT2 with ICE-SCF reference.

40208034	Signatures of rotation-translation couplings, symmetry-breaking, and intermolecular interactions in the rovibrational spectra of solid H2O@C60.	Some spectral features observed in the rovibrational spectra of solid H2O@C60 are shown to provide spectroscopic signatures of confinement-induced perturbations related to the coupling between the orientational and positional degrees-of-freedom of the water molecules. Their attribution to either para-H2O@C60 or ortho-H2O@C60 is established from their behavior during nuclear spin conversion. The frequency of the rovibrational transitions that emanate from their ground ro-translational (RT) states appears conspicuously redshifted from that of the corresponding transitions in the free water molecule in the gas phase. However, a few of the 21 hot band spectral features, and one ground state transition, observed in the infrared spectrum of solid H2O@C60 and reported here for the first time, cannot be straightforwardly assigned based on the softening of its intramolecular HOH bending and OH stretching vibrational modes due to confinement within C60. The most strongly perturbed transitions provide insights into the complex confinement-induced quantum nuclear dynamics arising from rotation-translation coupling, allowing the topology of the confinement potential to be revealed using a simple confined rotor model [Putaud et al., J. Chem. Phys. 162, 144313 (2025)]. While the line profiles exhibited by most of the transitions are consistent with symmetry-breaking interactions arising from merohedral disorder in solid H2O@C60, evidence for additional perturbations of the 10100 RT state, in the ground and vibrationally excited manifolds, is reported. Moreover, the line profiles displayed by the transitions emanating from the ground RT state of para-H2O@C60 and the observation of nominally forbidden Q-branch transitions, in the intramolecular HOH bending and symmetric OH stretching ranges of solid H2O@C60 samples with a fill ratio of 75%, are shown to provide a spectroscopic signature of intermolecular dipolar interactions between nearest-neighbor H2O@C60 molecules.
40207679	Influence of quantum corrections on the predicted isobaric heat capacity of polarizable water models.	The isobaric heat capacity (Cp) is frequently used as a benchmark property whenever a new model is proposed or when comparing different force fields with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, classical MD is not able to capture the quantum effects inherent in fluids and researchers have opted to apply quantum corrections in the post-processing when evaluating this property. Nevertheless, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the magnitude of quantum corrections for water, with reported values differing by up to a factor of 4. This term can account for up to one third of the Cp value and its erroneous prediction can lead to misleading conclusions. Therefore, we investigate different approaches to properly address quantum corrections when predicting Cp using classical MD. To accomplish this, the quantum correction methods proposed by Horn et al. and Berens et al. are considered, both of which use the single quantum harmonic oscillator approach but employ different strategies to address the frequency space. Two flexible polarizable water models are used in the evaluation, iAMOEBA and AMOEBA14. We show that the method of Berens et al. is a more robust approach to obtain the quantum corrections, as it accounts for all the frequency space by employing the vibrational spectra of the corresponding model under evaluation, making this approach a fully model-based method to determine Cp from MD. In addition, its capability of capturing the shift of low-frequency modes with temperature results in improved performance over the method of Horn et al.
40207678	Copula methods for modeling pair densities in density functional theory.	We propose a new approach toward approximating the density-to-pair-density map based on copula theory from statistics. We extend the copula theory to multi-dimensional marginals and deduce that one can describe any (exact or approximate) pair density by the single-particle density and a copula. We present analytical formulas for the exact copula in scaling limits, numerically compute the copula for dissociating systems with two to four particles in one dimension, and propose accurate approximations of the copula between equilibrium and dissociation for two-particle systems.
40207677	A simple confined rotor model to describe the ro-translational dynamics of water endofullerenes and to assign the ro-vibrational spectra of solid H2O@C60.	A simple Confined Rotor Model (CRM) is used to assign the thirty-nine ro-vibrational transitions observed through the HOH bending and OH stretching ranges of the solid H2O@C60 mid-infrared (MIR) spectra reported in the companion paper [Chartrand et al., J. Chem. Phys. (unpublished) (2024)]. Assuming that the intramolecular vibrations of the water molecules are separable from their rotational and translational motions, the CRM Hamiltonian describes confinement of H2O within C60 as an eccentric, but otherwise isotropic, 3D harmonic oscillator and as an asymmetric rigid rotor. The topology of the effective confinement potential is constrained using seven transitions observed in the HOH bending range of the MIR spectra of solid H2O@C60, yielding an effective force constant, k = (11.86 ± 0.03) J m-2, and an eccentricity, dCI = (7.55 ± 0.07) pm, in good agreement with DF-LMP2/cc-pVDZ results. While twenty-one broad and overlapping spectral features arising from hot band transitions were described and tentatively assigned by Chartrand et al., some of them appear very strongly perturbed compared to the gas phase. Using the CRM, it is shown that the conspicuous shifts displayed by certain very specific pairs of ro-vibrational transitions provide evidence for confinement-induced rotation-translation coupling between the orientational and positional degrees-of-freedom of endohedral water, resulting in a strong mixing between very specific pairs of ro-translational eigenstates of translational and rotational character. The CRM is shown to provide a satisfactory description of all observed ro-vibrational transitions along with a compelling interpretation for the complex confinement-induced quantum nuclear dynamics of endohedral water as revealed by the rotational and ro-vibrational spectra of solid H2O@C60.
40205682	MLST8 overexpression in RPE cells disrupts autophagy through novel mechanisms affecting AMD pathogenesis.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, with dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) central to disease pathogenesis. Using our uniquely developed MLST8 (MTOR associated protein, LST8 homolog) knock-in animal model with RPE-specific overexpression, which drives MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) upregulation, we demonstrate that increased MTOR complexes 1 and 2 in the RPE disrupts macroautophagy/autophagy by suppressing autophagosome formation genes and impairing MAP1LC3/LC3 processing. This leads to autophagosome accumulation and defective autolysosome formation, driving RPE dysfunction and AMD-like pathology, including subretinal debris build up and photoreceptor degeneration. Notably, MTOR inhibition with torin1 treatment or CRYBA1 overexpression rescues these defects, restoring autophagy and RPE integrity. Our findings reveal that autophagy disruption mediated by both MTORC1 and MTORC2 drives AMD-like pathology in our mouse model, establishing autophagy regulation as a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in this vision-threatening disease.
40205473	Running against the clock: exploring microbial diversity in an extremely endangered microbial oasis in the Chihuahuan Desert.	The Cuatro Ciénegas Basin is a biodiversity hotspot known for its unique biodiversity. However, this ecosystem is facing severe anthropogenic threats that are drying its aquatic systems. We investigated microbial communities at three sites with different physicochemical and environmental characteristics (Pozas Rojas, Archean Domes, and the Churince system) within the basin to explore potential connections to deep aquifers and determine if the sites shared microorganisms. Utilizing 16S rRNA gene data, we identified a core microbiota between Pozas Rojas (PR) and Archean Domes (AD). Sulfur reduction appears to shape the microbial connectivity among sites, since sulfur-reducing bacteria has the highest prevalence between samples from PR and AD: Halanaerobium sp. (88.46%) and Desulfovermiculus halophilus (65%); and between the Churince system and AD: Halanaerobium sp. (63%) and D. halophilus (60%). Furthermore, metagenome-assembled genomes from Ectothiorhodospira genus were found in both AD and Churince, suggesting microbial dispersal. An important finding is that microbial diversity in the AD system declined, from 2016 to 2023 the ecosystem lost 29 microbial phyla. If this trend continues, the basin will lose most of its water, resulting in the loss of various prokaryotic lineages and potential biotechnological solutions, such as enzymes or novel antibiotics. Our findings highlighting the need for water extraction regulations to preserve the basin's biodiversity.
40202149	Understanding nonlinear molecular responses in highly inhomogeneous electric fields: Insights from imidazole and pyrrole.	The study of molecules subjected to highly inhomogeneous electric fields, whether static or time-dependent, is relatively unexplored. Advances in this area, as shown in condensed matter physics, could lead to new insights into molecular physics and offer novel ways to control molecules, driving technological innovations. In this work, we numerically investigate the properties of imidazole and pyrrole under the influence of highly inhomogeneous static and dynamic electric fields, modeled by a new procedure employing charge configurations, using density functional theory calculations with the DALTON software package. We analyze their dipole moments, highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap energies, polarizability, and first and second hyperpolarizabilities across different field orientations. Our results show that inhomogeneous fields acting upon the molecule would induce changes in nonlinear optical properties, with the response depending on the nature of the inhomogeneity. These findings are relevant for fundamental research and practical applications. Tailored electric non-uniform fields can help unveil complex relationships among molecular orbitals that induce specific nonlinear optical phenomena. Moreover, they can enhance or suppress nonlinear responses, opening up new avenues for molecular engineering and device design.
40202148	Simulating inverse patchy colloid models.	Nano- to micro-sized particles with differently charged surface areas exhibit complex interaction patterns, characterized by both opposite-charge attraction and like-charge repulsion. While several successful models have been proposed in the literature to describe directional attraction, models accounting for both directional attraction and directional repulsion are much less numerous and often tailored to specific microscopic systems. Here, we present a simple and versatile patchy model, where the interaction energy of a pair of particles is a sum of interactions between sites of different types located within the particle volume. We implement different formulations of this model in both a self-developed Monte Carlo code and the widely used LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation software, providing basic toolkits for both simulation methods and, in the latter case, for different algorithms. By comparing physical observables and code performances, we discuss the different models, methods, and algorithms, offering insights into optimization strategies and tricks of trade.
40202147	Smart navigation through a rotating barrier: Deep reinforcement learning with application to size-based separation of active microagents.	We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (microagents), which self-propel through a rotating potential barrier in a static, viscous, fluid background. The microagent's motion begins at a specified origin and terminates at a designated destination. The potential barrier is modeled as a localized, repulsive Gaussian potential with finite support, whose peak location rotates at a given angular velocity about a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use the advantage actor-critic approach to train microagents for their origin-to-destination navigation through the barrier. By employing this approach, we demonstrate that the rotating potential (as opposed to a static one) enables size-based sorting and separation of the microagents. In other words, microagents of different radii arrive at the destination at sufficiently well-separated average times, facilitating their sorting. The efficiency of particle sorting is quantified by introducing specific separation measures. We also demonstrate how training the microagents in a noisy background, as opposed to a noise-free one, can improve the precision of their size-based sorting. Our findings suggest promising avenues for future research on smart active particles equipped with deep reinforcement learning to navigate complex environments, particularly in microscale applications.
40202146	Amino acid coating of Fe3O4 surfaces under dry and hydrated conditions.	This study explores the adsorption behavior of two amino acids (glycine - gly and glutamic acid - glu) as coating molecules for Fe3O4 nanoparticles to improve their biocompatibility for medical applications. Amino acid adsorption on the dry and hydrated reconstructed Fe3O4 (001) surface was investigated by means of quantum mechanical methods. According to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations (HSE06), the deprotonated form is favored over the zwitterion for both amino acids on the dry surface (by -0.14 and -0.59 eV for gly and glu, respectively), whereas the order is reversed under hydrated conditions (by +0.07 and +0.35 eV, for gly and glu, respectively). Given the small energy difference in the case of gly, deprotonated and zwitterionic adsorption modes are expected to compete and, probably, to coexist on the magnetite surface both under dry and hydrated conditions. Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB) method can only provide a qualitative energy order for amino acids adsorption on the dry magnetite surface due to excessive stabilization of the deprotonated adsorbed form (-0.54 and -1.24 eV for gly and glu, respectively). This overestimation favors the deprotonated form even under hydrated conditions (by -0.41 and -0.18 eV for gly and glu, respectively), which contradicts the more accurate DFT results. The approximate DFTB method presents limitations in correctly capturing the relative stability of different protonation states.
40202145	Trust the force, but pull wisely: Structural insights into non-equilibrium response forces from pulling MD simulations.	We analyze the coarse-grained equations of motion of molecular systems subject to external driving. As exemplary processes, we study by means of targeted and steered molecular dynamics simulations the dissociation of a sodium-chloride ion pair in water and ligand-protein unbinding of trypsin-benzamidine. We derive an exact generalization of Mori's Langevin equation that contains the memory kernel of the stationary process, an additive driving force, and a non-equilibrium response force describing the effects of the perturbed environment. We show that both the fluctuating force in the stationary case and the non-equilibrium response force in the driven cases exhibit spatial structure in their first and second moments. The latter depends sensitively on the employed driving protocols. For sodium chloride, we find that the first moment of the non-equilibrium response force matches the mean force for slow constrained pulling. In contrast, for all tested restrained pulling protocols, significant differences arise between the two properties in both systems. We conclude that the non-equilibrium response of the solvent needs to be taken into account carefully when analyzing data from pulling simulations.
40202144	Computing photodissociation cross sections and quasi-continuum properties of the NH radical.	Photodissociation cross sections of NH for 250 > λ > 100 nm are studied using (i) the recently reported spectroscopic model of the five lowest electronic states of NH, (ii) a new set of ab initio potential energy, (transition) dipole moment, spin-orbit, and electronic angular momentum curves covering the region up to 100 000 cm-1, and (iii) the recently suggested approach for time-independent calculations of continuum spectra of molecules (Pezzella et al., 2022). Quasi-dissociative properties, including predissociation lifetimes and linewidths, of the c1Π state are studied using four state-of-the-art predissociative methods: stabilization, Airy-boundary conditions within the WKB approximation, phase-amplitude, and complex-scaling approaches. The methodologies developed and tested in this work will be used to produce photoabsorption and photodissociation spectra of NH and other diatomic species as part of the ExoMol database (Q.-H. Ni et al., 2025) at www.exomol.com.
40202143	Using a basis of products of contracted intra-molecular and contracted inter-molecular functions to compute the rovibrational spectrum of H2O-HF.	In this paper, we report the J = 0-2 energy levels of H2O-HF calculated using our previous 9-D PES and compare the results with those of the experiment. The Schrodinger equation is solved variationally using a product contracted (PC) basis. The contracted basis functions are computed with the symmetry-adapted Lanczos method, and full-dimensional states are obtained from the PC basis by direct diagonalization. We compare the results with those of a previous calculation in which the monomers were constrained to be rigid. Allowing the monomers to be flexible has a significant effect on the low-lying inter-molecular vibrational levels due to coupling with intra-molecular coordinates. The R(1) transition frequencies, computed with flexible monomers, in different inter-molecular vibrational states, agree better with experiment than their rigid monomer counterparts. We calculate, for the first time, monomer excited states, vibrational shifts, and tunneling splittings. Although H2O-HCl and H2O-HF are similar, the number of contracted basis functions required for accurate predictions of intra- and inter-molecular levels is much larger for the H2O-HF dimer. This is the consequence of strong hydrogen bonding and important resonances between vibrational modes.
40202142	Systematic discrepancies between reference methods for noncovalent interactions within the S66 dataset.	The accurate treatment of noncovalent interactions is necessary to model a wide range of applications, from molecular crystals to surface catalysts to aqueous solutions and many more. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are considered two widely trusted methods for treating noncovalent interactions. However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules, recent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than 7.5 kcal/mol for larger systems. The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown. Moreover, the lack of systematic comparisons, particularly for medium-sized complexes, has made it difficult to identify which systems may be prone to such disagreements and the potential scale of these differences. In this work, we leverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the entire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions. Comparison to previous CCSD(T) references reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting stronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the binding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems. We show that the relative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of electrostatic and dispersion interactions, as obtained from energy decomposition analysis methods. Finally, we have pinpointed model systems: the hydrogen-bonded acetic acid dimer (ID 20) and dispersion-dominated uracil-cyclopentane dimer (ID 42), where these discrepancies are particularly prominent. These systems offer cost-effective benchmarks to guide future developments in DMC, CCSD(T), as well as the wider electronic structure theory community.
40197866	Scaling law of quantum confinement in single-walled carbon nanotubes.	Quantum confinement significantly influences the excited states of sub-10 nm single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), crucial for advancements in transistor technology and the development of novel optoelectronic materials, such as fluorescent ultrashort nanotubes (FUNs). However, the length dependence of this effect in ultrashort SWCNTs is not yet fully understood in the context of the SWCNT exciton states. Here, we conduct excited state calculations using time-dependent density functional theory on geometry-optimized models of ultrashort SWCNTs and FUNs, which consist of ultrashort SWCNTs with sp3 defects. Our results reveal a length-dependent scaling law of the E11 exciton energy that can be understood through a geometric, dimensional argument, which departs from the length scaling of a 1D particle-in-a-box. We find that this scaling law applies to ultrashort (6,5) and (6,6) SWCNTs, as well as models of (6,5) FUNs. In contrast, the defect-induced Esp3 transition, which is redshifted from the E11 optical gap transition, shows little dependence on the nanotube length, even in the shortest possible SWCNTs. We attribute this relative lack of length dependence to orbital localization around the quantum defect that is installed near the SWCNT edge. Our results illustrate the complex interplay of defects and quantum confinement effects in ultrashort SWCNTs and provide a foundation for further explorations of these nanoscale phenomena.
40197592	Energy conservation in real-time nuclear-electronic orbital Ehrenfest dynamics.	Real-time nuclear-electronic orbital Ehrenfest (RT-NEO-Ehrenfest) dynamics methods provide a first-principles approach for describing nonadiabatic molecular processes with nuclear quantum effects. For an efficient description of proton transfer within RT-NEO-Ehrenfest dynamics, the basis function center associated with the quantum proton can be allowed to move classically. This traveling proton basis (TPB) approach effectively captures proton quantum dynamics, although its energy conservation behavior is not yet fully satisfactory. Two recently proposed TPB approaches, in principle, conserve the extended energy, which includes both the system energy and the kinetic energy associated with the proton basis function center. Herein, a thermostatted TPB approach is proposed to improve the conservation of the system energy, excluding the kinetic energy associated with the proton basis function center. In this approach, the quantum proton dynamics are modulated by dynamically rescaling the proton momentum operator to maintain the system energy conservation. With the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer of o-hydroxybenzaldehyde as an example, this approach is shown to significantly improve the system energy conservation while preserving the accuracy of the quantum proton dynamics as achieved in the original TPB approach.
40197591	Excited-state-specific Kohn-Sham formalism for the asymmetric Hubbard dimer.	Building on our recent study [Giarrusso and Loos, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. In particular, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting v-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals-each state possessing a distinct correlation functional-we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.
40197590	Machine-learnt potential highlights melting and freezing of aluminum nanoparticles.	We investigated the complete thermodynamic cycle of aluminum nanoparticles through classical molecular dynamics simulations, spanning a wide size range from 200 atoms to 11 000 atoms. The aluminum-aluminum interactions are modeled using a newly developed Bayesian Force Field (BFF) from the FLARE suite, a cutting-edge tool in our field. We discuss the database requirements to include melted nanodroplets to avoid unphysical behavior at the phase transition. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of structural stability up to sizes as large as 3 × 105 atoms. The developed Al-BFF predicts an icosahedral stability range up to 2000 atoms, ∼2 nm, followed by a region of stability for decahedra, up to 25 000 atoms. Beyond this size, the expected structure favors face-centered cubic shapes. At a fixed heating/cooling rate of 100 K/ns, we consistently observe a hysteresis loop, where the melting temperatures are higher than those associated with solidification. The annealing of a liquid droplet further stabilizes icosahedral structures, extending their stability range to 5000 atoms. Using a hierarchical k-means clustering, we find no evidence of surface melting but observe some mild indication of surface freezing. In any event, the liquid droplet's surface shows local structural order at all sizes.
40197589	Dependence of energy relaxation and vibrational coherence on the location of light-harvesting chromoproteins in photosynthetic antenna protein complexes.	Phycobilisomes are antenna protein complexes in cyanobacteria and red algae. In phycobilisomes, energy transfer is unidirectional with an extremely high quantum efficiency close to unity. We investigate intraprotein energy relaxation and quantum coherence of constituent chromoproteins of allophycocyanin (APC) and two kinds of C-phycocyanin (CPC) in phycobilisomes using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. These chromoproteins produced by an Escherichia coli expression system have similar adjacent pairs of pigments α84 and β84, which are excited to delocalized exciton states. However, the kinetics and coherence of exciton states are significantly different from each other. Even CPCs with almost the same molecular structure display different 2D spectra when the locations in the phycobilisome are different. The spectra of the inner CPC in the phycobilisome are red-shifted relative to that of the outer one. This may promote the efficient and unidirectional energy transfer to the APC core. We observe low-frequency coherent vibrational motion of ∼200 cm-1 with large amplitude and a decay time of 200 fs. The wave packet motion involving energy relaxation and oscillatory motions on the potential energy surface of the exciton state is clearly visualized using beat-frequency-resolved 2D-ES.
40197588	Solvation enhances folding cooperativity and the topology dependence of folding rates in a lattice protein model.	The aqueous solvent profoundly influences protein folding, yet its effects are relatively poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the impact of solvation on the folding of lattice proteins by using Monte Carlo simulations. The proteins are modeled as self-avoiding 27-mer chains on a cubic lattice, with compact native states and structure-based Gō potentials. Each residue that makes no contact with other residues in a given protein conformation is assigned a solvation energy ɛs, representing its full exposure to the solvent. We find that a negative ɛs, indicating a favorable solvation, increases the cooperativity of the folding transition by lowering the free energy of the unfolded state, increasing the folding free energy barrier, and narrowing the folding routes. This favorable solvation also significantly improves the correlation between folding rates and the native topology, measured by the relative contact order. Our results suggest that the Gō model may overestimate the importance of native interactions, and a solvation potential countering the native bias can play a significant role. The solvation energy in our model can be related to the polar interaction between water and peptide groups in the protein backbone. It is, therefore, suggested that the solvation of peptide groups may significantly contribute to the exceptional folding cooperativity and the pronounced topology-dependence of folding rates observed in two-state proteins.
40197587	Signatures of glassy dynamics in highly ordered lipid bilayers with emergence of soft dynamic channels.	Over the last few decades, extensive investigations on spatial and dynamic heterogeneity have been performed on carefully reconstituted biological lipid membranes. Characterizing the molecular features in heterogeneous membranes is extremely challenging due to the experimentally inaccessible time- and length-scales of these emergent systems. In this context, simulations can provide important insights into molecular-level interactions leading to membrane heterogeneity and associated functions. To that end, we use the non-affine displacement (NAD) framework (a concept borrowed from the physics of granular materials) to faithfully capture molecular-scale local membrane order in simulated heterogeneous bilayers. In our latest application of NAD, we investigate the temperature-dependent spatial and temporal organization on microsecond trajectories of liquid-ordered bilayer systems at all-atom resolution (DPPC/DOPC/CHOL: 0.55:0.15:0.30; 40 × 40 nm2 with a total of 5600 lipids and 2 × 106 atoms). Lateral organization in these large bilayer patches shows noticeable dynamic heterogeneity despite their liquid-ordered nature. Moreover, our NAD analyses reveal soft fluid channels within the tightly packed membrane reminiscent of the classical two-component Kob-Andersen glass-forming binary mixture. Hence, we characterized these systems using classical glass physics markers for dynamic heterogeneities such as overlap, four-point susceptibility, Van Hove, and intermediate scattering functions to quantify the multiple time scales underlying the lipid dynamics. Our analyses reveal that highly ordered membrane systems can have glass-like dynamics with distinct soft fluid channels inside them. Biologically, these dynamic channels could act as conduits for facilitating molecular encounters for biological functions even in highly ordered phases such as lipid nanodomains and rafts.
40197586	Effect of protein binding on the twist-stretch coupling of double-stranded RNA.	The elasticities of RNAs are generally essential for their biological functions, and RNAs often become functional when interacting with their binding proteins. However, the effects of binding proteins on the elasticities of double-stranded (ds) RNAs, such as twist-stretch coupling, still remain little understood. Here, our extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that the twist-stretch coupling of dsRNAs can be reversed from positive to negative by their binding proteins. Our analyses revealed that such a reversing effect of binding proteins is attributed to the protein anchoring across the major groove of dsRNAs, which alters the dominating deformation pathway from a major-groove-mediated one to a helical-radius-mediated one through two base-pair parameters of slide and inclination. Meanwhile, the anchoring effect from binding proteins on dsRNAs is further ascribed to the strong electrostatic attractions between dsRNAs and the positively charged binding domain of the proteins.
40197585	The role of electron affinity in electrochemical anion adsorption on metals.	Anion adsorption is an important phenomenon in surface science, electrochemistry, and catalysis, where it can dictate (electro)catalyst performance and corrosion resistance. In recent work, we found that the adsorption energies of carboxylate anions to a metal electrode were linearly correlated with their acid dissociation constant (pKa) and electron affinity. To determine if these linear trends are general across anions, we have now used density functional theory to compare the thermodynamics of adsorption across a series of thiolates, carboxylates, alkoxides, and small molecular anions (OH*, SH*, SCF3*, and SCH3*) to a Pt(111) surface. We find that electron affinity is a general predictive descriptor of anion adsorption energy and, in fact, dominates over differences in the radical adsorption energy, representing the covalent contribution to adsorption, even across structurally different anions. In examining descriptors for radical adsorption, we find that the X-H bond dissociation energy (where X is the atom the radical uses to bind to the surface), used as a descriptor in prior work, only strongly correlates with radical adsorption energy for some species. This work highlights the importance of electron affinity in controlling adsorption and that the correlation between radical adsorption energy and (X-H) bond dissociation energy may not be as transferrable of a relationship as previously thought. Both these factors impact how we understand the physics and chemistry of adsorption, as well as the development of predictive descriptors of adsorption strength. A simple model using radical electron affinity and X-H bond dissociation energy to predict anion adsorption energetics is demonstrated.
40197584	Unraveling the influence of mesoscale solvophobic structure on the transport properties of ionic liquids-Decoupling ionic conductivity and viscosity.	Ion dynamics and transport properties of the ionic liquid 1-methyl-3-decylimidazolium chloride are investigated by broadband dielectric spectroscopy, shear rheology, and differential scanning calorimetry. This ionic liquid is known to undergo a low-temperature, liquid-liquid crystal (L-LC) phase transition previously associated with a transition or growth in the extent of mesoscale solvophobic aggregates. We find that the L-LC transition is accompanied by a significant change in both the timescale and the strength of dielectric and mechanical relaxation processes associated with the motions of the mesoscale solvophobic aggregates. However, no change is observed in faster, more-localized ion motions associated with ion diffusion. Due exclusively to the changes in the slow, supramolecular dynamics, the zero-shear viscosity of the ionic liquid is increased fivefold, while the ionic conductivity is unaffected. These results provide unique insight into the role of mesoscale solvophobic structure on the transport properties of ionic liquids, indicating that the supramolecular mesoscale solvophobic aggregates may, at times, have a sizable influence on the zero-shear viscosities while having a negligible influence on ion conduction, which is determined exclusively by the faster diffusive ion motions occurring at shorter length-scales.
40197583	Double-layer capacitance peaks: Origins, ion dependence, and temperature effects.	Differential capacitance (Cdl) is arguably the most important lumped parameter of electrical double layers (EDLs). Two peaks in the Cdl profile have been commonly attributed to the crowding of counterions within the EDL. More recent studies have suggested that the two peaks are primarily caused by orientational polarization of interfacial water molecules. Herein, this recent perspective is extended by considering orientation-dependent adsorption free energy of water and tested at Au(111)-aqueous solution interfaces. Our comparative analysis of the ion dependency of the Cdl profile corroborates the view that the capacitance peaks are caused mainly by the saturation of the orientational polarization of interfacial water molecules. In addition, the temperature dependency of the Cdl profile is consistently interpreted as a consequence of the temperature effects on the orientational polarization of interfacial water.
40197582	Directional control of singlet exciton diffusion in crystalline polythiophene films.	Understanding and controlling the direction of singlet exciton diffusion in conjugated polymer films is crucial for organic optoelectronic devices, such as organic photovoltaics. We previously demonstrated that singlet excitons generated in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) predominantly diffuse along the π-stacking direction due to a relatively strong H-aggregate character. In contrast, we also found that thin films of a novel naphthobisoxadiazole-based low-bandgap polymer, PNOz4T, exhibit two-dimensional (2D) exciton diffusion characteristics along both the π-stacking (interchain) and main chain (intrachain) directions. Detailed analysis revealed that 2D exciton diffusion is due to a relatively strong J-aggregate character of PNOz4T. However, it remains unclear whether this behavior is unique to PNOz4T or can be reproduced in other conjugated polymers when J-aggregate character is enhanced. Herein, we investigate how the direction of singlet exciton diffusion is controlled in PDCBT, a polythiophene with greater J-aggregate character compared to P3HT. We demonstrate that the preferential direction of the singlet exciton diffusion shifts from the π-stacking direction to the main chain direction with increasing J-aggregate character. We observe 2D exciton diffusion when these two diffusional components are balanced. This study highlights the importance of side-chain engineering to control the direction of singlet exciton diffusion and provides new insight into understanding the mechanism of exciton diffusion in conjugated polymer films.
40197581	Insights on the wall friction using squeeze flow of an electrorheological fluid.	In this paper, the squeeze flow of an electrorheological (ER) fluid has been studied under a constant electric field and squeezing speed to understand the link between the extent of structural arrest and the wall slip. The flow behavior during squeezing has been captured in terms of normal force as a function of gap under a parametric variation of electric field intensity for four different compression speeds to understand the impact of both these parameters on wall slip in terms of wall friction coefficient. Based on the growth rate of normal force with respect to inter-plate gap, these squeeze flow curves have been divided into four zones: elastic response, relaxation zone, slip flow, and squeeze-strengthening regime. The first two zones are very short-termed, whereas the major portion of the flow regime is slip flow. The squeeze strengthening effect is only pronounced at very low compression speeds for moderate/higher electric field strengths in the low gap regime. The slip flow regime has been modeled using a squeeze flow model, which renders the wall friction coefficient as a model parameter. The major finding of our analysis is that the friction coefficient is an increasing function of electric field strength at a fixed compression speed, whereas an increase in compression speed leads to a decrease in the extent of wall friction. Based on these observations, it has been established that electric field-induced structural jamming and compression-led breakage of structure in the ER fluids play a crucial role in controlling the wall friction during its squeeze flow. We have also modeled the slow squeezing-led structural strengthening regime by considering a particle-scale model, which accounts for the local electric field contribution. Finally, a broader physical picture has been provided to underline how the degree of the structural arrest/jamming affects wall friction during the squeeze flow of such field-responsive soft materials.
40197580	High-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of cryogenically cooled SiC.	We report high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of SiC- anions using a cryogenic ion trap combined with the slow-electron velocity-map imaging method. Photodetachment transitions to the neutral SiC ground state X 3Π and excited states (a 1Σ+, b 1Π) were observed, revealing the fine structure of the X 3Π band. A long-lived excited state (A 3Π) of SiC- was observed at 3380(101) cm-1 above the anionic ground state. The electron affinity (EA) was determined as EA(SiC) = 19 327(15) cm-1 or 2.396(2) eV. The spectroscopic constants of the ground state (X' 2Σ+) of SiC- were derived as ωe = 1016(21) cm-1 and ωexe = 5.20(22) cm-1.
40197579	Breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in Stillinger-Weber silicon.	We investigate the dynamical properties of liquid and supercooled liquid silicon, modeled using the Stillinger-Weber potential, to examine the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation. Toward this end, we examine the relationship among various dynamical quantities, including (i) the macroscopic transport coefficients-self-diffusion coefficient D and viscosity η, (ii) relaxation time τα, and (iii) lengthscale dependent relaxation times τα(q) over a broad range of temperature T, pressure P, and density ρ covering both equilibrium and metastable liquid state points in the phase diagram. Our study shows a weak breakdown in the SE relation involving D and η, and the loci of the breakdown of the SE relation (SEB) are found in the high T liquid phase. The τα, when used as a proxy to η, shows a distinct breakdown in the SE relation, whose loci are found in the supercooled liquid phase. Interestingly, certain parts of the phase diagram show that the loci of onset of slow dynamics lie below the loci of SEB, suggesting a regime that exhibits Arrhenius but non-Fickian behavior. Computation of τα(q) enables us to extract the lengthscale associated with the Fickian to non-Fickian behavior using which we show that the breakdown of the SE relation occurs only below a specific lengthscale at a given temperature. Furthermore, we also compare the SEB loci with other features of the phase behavior, including the loci of compressibility maximum, density maximum, and diffusivity maximum.
40197578	Dissociative multiple ionization of argon trimers and tetramers in two-color femtosecond laser fields.	We experimentally investigate the dissociative multiple ionization of argon trimers and tetramers induced by relative phase-controlled linearly and elliptically polarized two-color femtosecond laser fields. The momentum distributions and kinetic energy releases of the resulting fragments from various channels are measured in coincidence. The observed anisotropic momentum distributions indicate a preference for triple and quadruple ionization of argon trimers when one of the argon atoms is aligned parallel to the laser field polarization. By varying the relative phase of the two-color laser fields, we achieve directional control over the dissociative triple and quadruple ionization of argon trimers, facilitated by the mechanism of enhanced ionization. The measured relative phase-dependent asymmetry patterns exhibit similarity in both linearly and elliptically polarized two-color laser fields, suggesting a minimal role of electron recollision. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the dissociative quadruple ionization of argon tetramers. These findings provide valuable insights into the van der Waals bond breaking in complex clusters and contribute to the broader understanding of laser-driven molecular fragmentation.
40197577	Quantum calculation of the quasi-equilibrium constant involved in the formation of 49O3.	At the beginning of the 1980s, measurements in the stratosphere revealed an enrichment of the heavy isotopes 17O and 18O in ozone O3, described as anomalous because it was much higher than statistically expected. In addition, this was roughly equal between 17O and 18O. This effect, called mass-independent fractionation (MIF), remains unexplained despite numerous theoretical and experimental studies. However, it has been shown that the origin of MIF is directly linked to strong isotopic effects found in the recombination reaction O + O2 + M → O3 + M, where M is a third body that absorbs excess energy. Here, we are interested in one of the elementary processes involved in this reaction, namely the rapid quasi-equilibrium process O + O2⇌O3*, where O3* is metastable ozone. A fully quantum approach was used to calculate the quasi-equilibrium constant of this process, giving the most accurate value of this quantity to date for the 49O3 isotopic variant of ozone. The present work represents an important step toward a better understanding of ozone formation and may help contribute to unraveling the mystery of MIF.
40197576	Coarse-grained simulation of water: A comparative study and overview.	In spite of the tremendous increase in computational power over the last few decades, the problem of simulating atomistic systems containing large amounts of water molecules over longer lengths and time scales still remains. In this respect, the coarse-grained (CG) force field reduces the computational cost and, therefore, allows simulations of larger systems for longer times. However, the specific scope of the different CG water models is more limited compared to their atomistic counterparts. In this context, we conducted a comparative study on the molecular physical structure, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties of bulk water systems using six distinct CG water models and all-atom (AA) simulations. The six CG simulation procedures involved modeling with three variants of the water model coming from the MARTINI force field, one from the SPICA force field, and the two Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI) derived potentials from the AA simulations. The AA simulations have been performed using the SPC/E and TIP4P force fields. The IBI models, namely SPC/E-IBI and TIP4P-IBI, depict the structural features in close agreement with the atomistic samples. The explicit number of water molecules in the first coordination shell for the three MARTINI models and the SPICA force field is in excellent agreement with the SPC/E and TIP4P values. The ensuing simulated densities for the various water models align significantly with the literature data, indicating the reliability of our approach. The SPC/E and SPICA models stand out in predicting the enthalpy of vaporization among the all-atom and CG force fields, respectively. The two all-atom models and their IBI equivalents are better at representing the isobaric specific heat capacity compared to the other models. The isothermal compressibility is reproduced comprehensively by the SPC/E force field followed by TIP4P, while SPICA is the better choice within the CG models. With respect to the dynamics of the system, the diffusion coefficient of the SPICA force field is in perfect agreement with the experimental data, even better than the atomistic samples. The overall scores of the different models, indicative of their relative performances compared to the other models, have also been computed.
40197575	Systematic characterization of the homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrogen halide dimers.	This study systematically characterizes the four homogeneous and six heterogeneous hydrogen-bonded dimers formed by hydrogen halide pairs (HX/HY where X, Y = F, Cl, Br, and I). The notation HX⋯HY indicates the direction of the hydrogen bond from the HY donor to the HX acceptor. All stationary points reported for these ten dimer systems are fully optimized utilizing the MP2 and CCSD(T) ab initio methods in conjunction with quadruple-ζ correlation-consistent basis sets augmented with diffuse functions, and their nature is verified by harmonic vibrational frequency computations. The electronic dissociation energies (De) for all ten global minima are evaluated near the CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limit via extrapolation schemes. These values are 19.11, 8.32, 7.38, and 6.22 kJ mol-1 for the homogeneous dimers of HF, HCl, HBr, and HI, respectively. For the heterogeneous pairs, the lighter hydrogen halide is consistently the donor in the global minimum configuration, with De ranging from 12.23 kJ mol-1 for HCl⋯HF to 7.22 kJ mol-1 for HI⋯HBr near the CCSD(T) CBS limit. Interestingly, not all heterodimer donor/acceptor permutations correspond to minima. For example, the HCl⋯HBr configuration is identified as a local minimum at all levels of theory employed in this investigation, whereas the in-plane barrier for donor/acceptor exchange vanishes for HCl⋯HI and HBr⋯HI when larger quadruple-ζ basis sets are utilized. For the seven dimer systems containing Br and/or I, the structures, energetics, and vibrational frequencies computed using conventional valence-only electron correlation procedures are similar to those obtained using an expanded valence treatment that includes the (n - 1)d subvalence electrons associated with Br and I.
40197574	A new electronic transition in vanadium fluoride, VF.	The red-degraded [12.7]5Δ-X5Δ (0-0) band of gas-phase vanadium fluoride at 789 nm has been recorded by laser excitation spectroscopy and represents only the second reported rotational analysis of an electronic transition of VF. A hollow cathode discharge source was employed, with laser-induced fluorescence detected via the [12.7]5Δ-X5Δ (0-1) band. All five main (∆Ω = 0) subbands were identified, each containing only P and R branches, as expected in a parallel (∆Λ = 0) transition. The upper state displays the effects of strong local perturbations. Molecular constants describing the X5Δ (v = 0 and 1) levels and the [12.7]5Δ (v = 0) level were determined from least-squares fits using an effective Hamiltonian written in a Hund's case (a) basis. The equilibrium rotational constant of the ground state was determined to be Be = 0.38324(89) cm-1, which yields a molecular bond length of Re = 1.7829(21) Å.
40197573	Ion-dip and laser photoexcitation spectroscopy of high Rydberg states in N2.	N2 molecules in pulsed supersonic beams have been laser photoexcited from their X Σg+1 ground electronic state to selected singlet np and nf Rydberg states using a (2 + 1') two-color three-photon excitation scheme. This required the competition between (2 + 1) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization and (2 + 1') Rydberg state photoexcitation to be carefully balanced. This was achieved by performing ion-dip spectroscopy in which the signal from the N2+ cations generated by direct photoionization was selectively detected and seen to reduce under conditions in which the predissociative np Rydberg states, or long-lived nf Rydberg states, were populated. The predissocation rates of the np Rydberg states were determined from the n-dependence of the spectral widths of the transitions to them. The long-lived Rydberg states populated by excitation on nf resonances are suitable for deceleration and electrostatically trapping cold samples of N2 using inhomogeneous electric fields.
40197572	The electron localization function and the chemical interpretation of Fermi orbital descriptors in Fermi-Löwdin self-interaction correction calculations.	A set of Fermi orbital descriptors (FODs), representing "semi-classical" electronic positions, is a crucial ingredient in the Fermi-Löwdin orbital self-interaction correction (FLOSIC) method. The FODs are utilized to generate Fermi orbitals, which, in turn, are symmetrically orthogonalized to give the Fermi-Löwdin orbitals employed in FLOSIC calculations. It has been argued, based on empirical evidence, that FODs carry chemical bonding information and that FOD arrangements are reminiscent of electron distributions predicted by Lewis or Linnett theory. Here, we show that there is a formal connection between FODs and critical points of the electron localization function (ELF) and illustrate this fact for several cases where fully relaxed FODs from FLOSIC calculations closely resemble the structure of critical points (CPs). We also propose a new localization function, the SIC-ELF, based on the local mobility of the Fermi orbitals. In certain instances involving double and triple bonds, FLOSIC FODs offer a more precise interpretation of the chemical bonding structure suggested by Lewis theory than ELF or SIC-ELF. We suggest that the connection between FODs and CPs can be exploited to obtain initial FOD configurations for FLOSIC calculations.
40197571	Effects of electron transfer network topology on functioning of quantum cellular automata based on mixed-valence two-electron molecular squares.	Molecular quantum cellular automata (QCA) devices are typically based on the square planar two-electron mixed valence (MV) molecules playing the role of QCA cells. The functional properties of such cells are determined by the Coulomb repulsion between the two excess electrons, which stabilize antipodal charge configurations that encoding binary information. The inner sphere electron transfer of the excess electrons transforming different charge configurations into each other, as well as by the vibronic coupling, which tends to localize the mobile charges. Previously, the most topical and theoretically complex case of arbitrary Coulomb repulsion has been considered by implying essential restricting assumptions on the network of the electron transfer pathways. Therefore, the electron transfer occurring along the sides of the molecular square has been taken into account. Meanwhile, the effects of diagonal transfer have been discussed only for the limiting case of strong intracell Coulomb repulsion, which is peculiar to predominantly ionic compounds that are unlikely to be relevant to the MV cells. Here, we go beyond these simplifying assumptions and consider the general situation when all electron transfer pathways are involved, providing arbitrary interrelations between the key electronic and vibronic parameters. By solving the adiabatic and quantum-mechanical three-mode vibronic problems, we reveal the influence of electron transfer network topology on key properties of QCA, such as the stabilization of different spin-states in the free and interacting cells, the extent of localization of the pair of excess electrons, the shape of the cell-cell response functions, and the heat release necessarily occurring in the course of the non-adiabatic switching cycle.
40197570	Enhancing the prediction of TADF emitter properties using Δ-machine learning: A hybrid semi-empirical and deep tensor neural network approach.	This study presents a machine learning (ML)-augmented framework for accurately predicting excited-state properties critical to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. By integrating the computational efficiency of semi-empirical PPP+CIS theory with a Δ-ML approach, the model overcomes the inherent limitations of PPP+CIS in predicting key properties, including singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) energies, singlet-triplet gaps (ΔEST), and oscillator strength (f). The model demonstrated exceptional accuracy across datasets of varying sizes and diverse molecular features, notably excelling in predicting oscillator strength and ΔEST values, including negative regions relevant to TADF molecules with inverted S1-T1 gaps. This work highlights the synergy between physics-inspired models and machine learning in accelerating the design of efficient TADF emitters, providing a foundation for future studies on complex systems and advanced functional materials.
40197569	Linear-scaling quadruple excitations in local pair natural orbital coupled-cluster theory.	We present a fast, asymptotically linear-scaling implementation of the perturbative quadruples energy correction in coupled-cluster theory using local natural orbitals. Our work follows the domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) approach previously applied to lower levels of excitations in coupled-cluster theory. Our DLPNO-CCSDT(Q) algorithm uses converged doubles and triples amplitudes from a preceding DLPNO-CCSDT computation to compute the quadruples amplitude and energy in the quadruples natural orbital (QNO) basis. We demonstrate the compactness of the QNO space, showing that more than 95% of the (Q) correction can be recovered using relatively loose natural orbital cutoffs, compared to the tighter cutoffs used in pair and triples natural orbitals at lower levels of coupled-cluster theory. We also highlight the accuracy of our algorithm in the computation of relative energies, which yields deviations of sub-kJ mol-1 in relative energy compared to the canonical CCSDT(Q). Timings are conducted on a series of growing linear alkanes (up to 10 carbons and 608 basis functions) and water clusters (up to 49 water molecules and 2842 basis functions) to establish the asymptotic linear-scaling of our DLPNO-(Q) algorithm.
40197568	How local is "local"? Deep learning reveals locality of the induced magnetic field of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.	We investigate the locality of magnetic response in polycyclic aromatic molecules using a novel deep-learning approach. Our method employs graph neural networks (GNNs) with a graph-of-rings representation to predict nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS) in the space around the molecule. We train a series of models, each time reducing the size of the largest molecules used in training. The accuracy of prediction remains high (MAE < 0.5 ppm), even when training the model only on molecules with up to four rings, thus providing strong evidence for the locality of magnetic response. To overcome the known problem of generalization of GNNs, we implement a k-hop expansion strategy and succeed in achieving accurate predictions for molecules with up to 15 rings (almost 4 times the size of the largest training example). Our findings have implications for understanding the magnetic response in complex molecules and demonstrate a promising approach to overcoming GNN scalability limitations. Furthermore, the trained models enable rapid characterization, without the need for more expensive DFT calculations.
40197567	Fast and flexible long-range models for atomistic machine learning.	Most atomistic machine learning (ML) models rely on a locality ansatz and decompose the energy into a sum of short-ranged, atom-centered contributions. This leads to clear limitations when trying to describe problems that are dominated by long-range physical effects-most notably electrostatics. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, but efforts to make them efficient and widely available are hampered by the need to incorporate an ad hoc implementation of methods to treat long-range interactions. We develop a framework aiming to bring some of the established algorithms to evaluate non-bonded interactions-including Ewald summation, classical particle-mesh Ewald, and particle-particle/particle-mesh Ewald-into atomistic ML. We provide a reference implementation for PyTorch as well as an experimental one for JAX. Beyond Coulomb and more general long-range potentials, we introduce purified descriptors that disregard the immediate neighborhood of each atom and are more suitable for general long-range ML applications. Our implementations are fast, feature-rich, and modular: They provide an accurate evaluation of physical long-range forces that can be used in the construction of (semi)empirical baseline potentials; they exploit the availability of automatic differentiation to seamlessly combine long-range models with conventional, local ML schemes; and they are sufficiently flexible to implement more complex architectures that use physical interactions as building blocks. We benchmark and demonstrate our torch-pme and jax-pme libraries to perform molecular dynamics simulations, train ML potentials, and evaluate long-range equivariant descriptors of atomic structures.

40197564	Silicon quantum dot-molecule hybrid systems and their applications.	Si quantum dot (QD)-molecule hybrid systems have emerged as a popular architecture in many research fields due to the ability to select for the advantages conferred by the inorganic Si component and the organic sections. This perspective will focus on the optical properties of Si QDs, the parameters that affect Si QD photophysics or energy transfer in Si QD-molecule hybrid structures, and their resultant hybrid optoelectronic devices. Examples of recent applications that employ Si QD-molecule hybrid materials are presented. Finally, we discuss current issues involving basic structure-property relationships that need to be addressed for Si QDs and conclude with an outlook on the bright future of Si QD-molecule hybrid materials.
40193581	Prehospital Sepsis Recognition and Antibiotic Administration: A Retrospective Analysis.	Although earlier antibiotics are known to be beneficial in sepsis, very few emergency medical services (EMS) agencies have protocols for prehospital antibiotics for sepsis. Therefore, we sought to assess how well a large EMS agency that uses prehospital antibiotics for sepsis adheres to its sepsis protocol (when initiated), and to determine how soon antibiotics are typically given.
40190113	Benzoic acid as a dietary supplement mitigates inflammation and intestinal injury in acute enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i>-infected mice without adverse effects in healthy mice.	Benzoic acid is a naturally occurring compound found in fruits and is also commercially synthesized as an additive in the food, feed, and pharmaceutical industries. This study investigated the effects of benzoic acid as a dietary supplement on inflammation and intestinal injury in acute <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC)-infected or healthy mice. Thirty-six BALB/c mice were divided into three groups, with 12 mice in each group for a 16-day feeding trial. In group 1, mice were fed a basal diet, six mice were sacrificed, and six mice were intraperitoneally injected with phosphate-buffered saline on day 15. Groups 2 and 3 were fed a basal diet and a diet containing 0.6% benzoic acid, respectively. Half of the mice in each group were sacrificed, while the others were intraperitoneally injected with ETEC on day 15. The results indicated that benzoic acid had no adverse effects on healthy mice regarding growth, organ indices, inflammation, intestinal injury parameters, and cecal short-chain fatty acid levels. Importantly, benzoic acid reduced inflammation in ETEC-infected mice, as evidenced by decreased serum IL-1β, TNF-α, and INF-γ levels, along with increased jejunal <i>TLR-2</i> and <i>MyD88</i> mRNA expression. Besides, benzoic acid mitigated intestinal injury in ETEC-infected mice by increasing the jejunal villus height (VH) and the ratio of VH to crypt depth, elevating jejunal <i>Occludin</i> mRNA levels, decreasing serum D-lactate and diamine oxidase levels, and increasing the cecal acetic acid level. 16s rRNA sequencing revealed that benzoic acid altered the β-diversity of ETEC-infected mice and increased the abundances of <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i>, <i>Faecalibaculum</i>, and <i>Turicibacter</i> in their gut microbiota. Spearman correlation analysis further indicated that the protective effects of benzoic acid against ETEC infection were closely linked to specific gut microbiota, namely <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i>, <i>Faecalibaculum</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Limosilactobacillus</i>. Collectively, these findings suggest that benzoic acid could serve as a safe dietary supplement for healthy mice and may alleviate inflammation and intestinal injury in mice with acute ETEC infection.
40190095	Cocoa-carob blend acute intake modifies miRNAs related to insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic subjects: a randomised controlled nutritional trial.	Postprandial metabolic disturbances are exacerbated in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cocoa and carob, despite showing promising effects on these alterations in preclinical studies, have not yet been jointly tested in a clinical trial. Therefore, this acute, randomised, controlled, crossover nutritional trial evaluated the postprandial effects of a cocoa-carob blend (CCB) in participants with T2D (<i>n</i> = 20) and overweight/obesity. The subjects followed three treatments: hypercaloric breakfast (high-sugar and high-saturated fat, 900 kcal) as the control (treatment C); the same breakfast together with 10 g of the CCB, with 5.6 g of dietary fibre and 1.6 g of total polyphenols (treatment A); and the same breakfast after consuming the CCB (10 g) the night before (treatment B). Various analyses were performed, including the determination of the clinical markers of T2D (fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin, GLP-1, and glycaemic profile), satiety evaluation, analysis of exosomal miRNA expression and <i>ex vivo</i> determination of inflammation modulation. No effect on glucose homeostasis (glucose, insulin, and GLP-1) was found in the study population. However, eight exosomal miRNAs were found to be significantly modified owing to CCB supplementation compared with treatment C, with three of them (miR-20A-5p, miR-23A-3p, and miR-17-5p) associated with an improvement in insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, the CCB caused a decrease in hunger feelings (0-120 min), as assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS). Finally, treatment A caused a significant decrease in the glucose increment within 0-30 min of treatment in subjects with overweight. No significant modifications were found in the other assessed parameters. The acute intake of the CCB by subjects with T2D showed modest although significant results, which need to be validated in a long-term randomised controlled trial.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a terminally differentiated plasma cell hematological malignancy. The revised international staging system (RISS) is commonly used in patients with de novo MM, but it has limitations in predicting prognosis. Better biomarkers need to added to the staging system.
40186594	Novel therapeutic approaches for non-small cell lung cancer: an updated view.	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality globally. Most patients who undergo surgical procedures may encounter distant metastasis or local recurrence, necessitating supplementary treatments such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy as adjuvant alternatives. Recent advancements in molecular biology and immunotherapy have paved the way for innovative therapeutic approaches that target specific genetic mutations and promote the immune response against tumour cells. This review explores emerging therapies, including targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for actionable mutations (e.g., EGFR, ALK, ROS1), as well as the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that employ the body's immune system to combat cancer. Additionally, we discuss the potential of exosome therapies, as well as promising nanotherapeutic options for the treatment of NSCLC. This study attempts to provide a thorough overview of the changing landscape of NSCLC treatment and its implications for enhancing patient outcomes by presenting these innovative techniques.
40185124	Depth-of-interaction encoding techniques for pixelated PET detectors enabled by machine learning methods and fast waveform digitization.	<i>Objective</i>. Pixelated detectors with single-ended readout are routinely used by commercial positron emission tomography scanners owing to their good energy and timing resolution and optimized manufacturing, but they typically do not provide depth-of-interaction (DOI) information, which can help improve the performance of systems with higher resolution and smaller ring diameter. This work aims to develop a technique for multi-level DOI classification that does not require modifications to the detector designs.<i>Approach</i>. We leveraged high-speed (5 Gs s<sup>-1</sup>) waveform sampling electronics with the Domino Ring Sampler (DRS4) and machine learning (ML) methods to extract DOI information from the entire scintillation waveforms of pixelated crystals. We evaluated different grouping schemes for multi-level DOI classification by analyzing the DOI positioning profile and DOI positioning error. We examined trade-offs among crystal configurations, detector timing performance, and DOI classification accuracy. We also investigated the impact of different ML algorithms and input features-extracted from scintillation waveforms-on model accuracy.<i>Main results</i>. The DOI positioning profile and positioning error suggest that 2- or 3-level binning was effective for 20 mm long crystals. 2-level discrete DOI models achieved 95% class-wise accuracy and 83% overall accuracy in positioning events into the correct DOI level and 3-level up to 90% class-wise accuracy for long and narrow crystals (2 × 2 × 20 mm<sup>3</sup>). Long short-term memory networks trained with time-frequency moments were twice as efficient in training time while maintaining equal or better accuracy compared to those trained with waveforms. Classical ML algorithms exhibit comparable accuracy while consuming one order less training time than deep learning models.<i>Significance</i>. This work demonstrates a proof-of-concept approach for obtaining DOI information from commercially available pixelated detectors without altering the detector design thereby avoiding potential degradation in detector timing performance. It provides an alternative solution for multi-level DOI classification, potentially inspiring future scanner designs.
40185123	Towards improved prescription metrics in novel radiotherapy techniques: a machine learning study.	<i>Objective.</i>FLASH radiotherapy (RT), microbeam RT (MRT) and minibeam RT (MBRT) are novel RT techniques that have been shown to reduce normal tissue complication probabilities, by modulating the dose distributions through different parameters in space and time. This study aims to investigate the importance of these parameters for predicting biological outcomes using a machine learning (ML) approach and to compare the findings with previous correlation analyses in the context of the current understanding of these techniques.<i>Approach.</i>A ML algorithm was trained for predicting normal tissue toxicity, tumor control and increased lifespan (ILS) quantitative metrics on published datasets of preclinical MRT, MBRT and FLASH RT data. The influence of different variables on the performance of the model over unseen data was quantified, and their importance on its predictive power was ranked.<i>Main results.</i>An accuracy of 70% or superior was achieved for the prediction of most metrics, reduced for normal tissue toxicity to 60% in MBRT and 40% in FLASH RT. In MRT, valley dose was found as the most influencing physical parameter for normal tissue sparing, while in MBRT the peak dose was highlighted as one of the most influential parameters. Valley dose showed the greatest impact over ILS in a conjoint study of both techniques. In FLASH RT, the total dose, along with the tissue characteristics, were identified as the most influencing variables for tumor control and normal tissue toxicity. The importance of dose rate increased when considering therapeutic index.<i>Significance.</i>These results agree with previous studies that highlight how dose heterogeneity prevents normal tissue damage in MBRT and MRT and the need of prescribing under critical tissue specific valley and peak dose values respectively for optimal sparing and tumor control. The described findings are also consistent with FLASH RT tumor control being driven by the same mechanisms as in conventional RT.
40185117	Spin dynamics in linear magnetoelectric material Mn<sub>3</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.	We performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments on single crystal samples of a linear magnetoelectric material Mn<sub>3</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, which exhibits a collinear antiferromagnetic order, to reveal the spin dynamics. Numerous modes observed in the neutron spectra were reasonably reproduced by linear spin-wave theory on the basis of the spin Hamiltonian including eight Heisenberg interactions and an easy-plane type single-ion anisotropy. The presence of strong frustration was found in the identified spin Hamiltonian.
40183432	PERSPECTIVE: Challenging preoperative α-blockade in phaeochromocytoma surgery: beyond tradition, towards 'safer surgery'.	The rarity of phaeochromocytomas has left a gap in evidence supporting guideline recommendations for preoperative α-blockade dose-escalation. Despite recent studies questioning its efficacy, randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) are warranted before considering omitting preoperative α-blockade dose-escalation. Through an online survey, opinions on the ideal study design for this future RCT were gathered from specialists involved in phaeochromocytoma management in the Netherlands. Responses from 23 physicians suggest a non-inferiority-designed RCT that only excludes patients with severe comorbidities and incorporates clinical outcome measures as most suitable design. The survey furthermore revealed diverse opinions regarding study design and perioperative threats, emphasizing the importance of an inclusive, multidisciplinary approach in future research.
40183365	Esophageal Reconstruction with Myogenesis-Inducing Gene Transfected Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Seeded Film with Leaf-Stacked Structure.	In the domain of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, artificial replacements have been developed as viable options for esophageal reconstruction and serve as alternatives to traditional surgical procedures. Restoration of smooth muscle functionality is crucial in esophageal regeneration. We evaluated the efficacy of esophageal reconstructions in an animal model, using tissue-engineered films with a leaf-stacked structure (FLSS), seeded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which were genetically modified with myogenic genes. Esophageal partial defects were variously reconstructed in animals (<i>n</i> = 8 per group, except the no-implantation group), categorized as (1) normal rats; (2) rats implanted with naked FLSS; (3) rats implanted with FLSS with MSCs; (4) rats implanted using FLSS with myogenesis-inducing gene transfected MSCs; and (5) rats without implantation at the defect site (<i>n</i> = 3). The FLSS exhibited appropriate mechanical characteristics for transplantation. Successful repair of esophageal defects was observed with significantly enhanced epithelial regeneration in the MSC-seeded FLSS group compared to that in the naked FLSS group. Moreover, smooth muscle regeneration was notably higher in the FLSS with myogenesis-inducing gene transfected MSCs than in the group without myogenic gene transfection. The myogenesis-inducing gene-transfected MSC-seeded FLSS group showed a tendency toward increased smooth muscle regeneration, this indicates that FLSS with myogenesis-inducing genes transfected MSC may contribute positively to the maintenance of function in the reconstructed esophagus.
40179945	A dual-branch hybrid network with bilateral-difference awareness for collateral scoring on CT angiography of acute ischemic stroke patients.	<i>Objective.</i>Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with good collaterals tend to have better outcomes after endovascular therapy. Existing collateral scoring methods rely mainly on vessel segmentation and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often ignoring bilateral brain differences. This study aims to develop an automated collateral scoring model incorporating bilateral-difference awareness to improve prediction accuracy.<i>Approach.</i>In this paper, we propose a new dual-branch hybrid network to achieve vessel-segmentation-free collateral scoring on the CT Angiography (CTA) of 255 AIS patients. Specifically, we first adopt a data preprocessing method based on maximum intensity projection. To capture the differences between the left and right sides of the brain, we propose a novel bilateral-difference awareness module (BDAM). Then we design a hybrid network that consists of a multi-scale module, a CNN branch, a transformer branch and a feature interaction enhancement module in each stage. In addition, to learn more effective features, we propose a novel local enhancement module and a novel global enhancement module (GEM) to strengthen the local features captured by the CNN branch and the global features of the transformer branch, respectively.<i>Main results.</i>Experiments on a private clinical dataset with CTA images of 255 AIS patients show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 85.49% and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.9284 for 3-point collateral scoring, outperforming 13 state-of-the-art methods. Besides, for the binary classification tasks (good vs. non-good collateral scoring, poor vs. non-poor collateral scoring), our proposed method also achieves the best accuracies (89.02% and 92.94%).<i>Significance.</i>In this paper, we propose a novel dual-branch hybrid network that incorporates distinct local and GEMs, along with a BDAM, to achieve collateral scoring without the need for vessel segmentation. Our experimental evaluation shows that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing valuable support for improving the efficiency of stroke treatment.
40179238	Elucidation of the Ta(O,N)<sub>6</sub> Octahedral Arrangement in Flux-Grown BaTaO<sub>2</sub>N Photocatalysts by Experimental and Computational Structural Modeling.	BaTaO<sub>2</sub>N (BTON) is a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst used for water splitting. The flux method, which involves the use of a molten salt, is an effective synthetic strategy for achieving a high photocatalytic activity. Fluxes with alkali metal cations strongly affect the photocatalytic activity of the BTON crystals. In particular, RbCl flux-grown BTON exhibits hydrogen evolution activity over several times higher than that grown in other chloride fluxes, such as NaCl, under visible-light irradiation. One factor of this difference is presumably owing to the change in the Ta(O,N)<sub>6</sub> octahedral arrangement in the BTON triggered by the doping of alkali metal ions into the crystal lattice. However, the precise Ta(O,N)<sub>6</sub> octahedral arrangement remains unclear. Herein, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, structural analysis by neutron diffraction, and computational structural modeling based on comprehensive structural energy predictions were performed for two types of BTONs. The results suggested that the configuration manners of Ta(O,N)<sub>6</sub> octahedral units strongly depend on the flux composition. Specifically, in NaCl-flux-grown BTON crystals, the number of N20 cis planes parallel to the (100), (010), and (001) crystal planes in a TaO<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub> unit is anisotropic, resulting in differences in their electron-hole conduction characteristics. The findings indicate that in addition to lattice defects, the interconnections of mixed-anion units such as Ta(O,N)<sub>6</sub> should be taken into account to improve the photocatalytic activity of BTONs and develop other mixed-anion compounds.
40179027	Reversed Stability of Zirconium Oxide Dimer Isomers Triggered by Electron Gain or Removal.	The neutral zirconium oxide dimer and its cationic and anionic counterparts were investigated using advanced ab initio electronic structure methods and flexible basis sets. The exploration of the ground-state potential energy surfaces of (ZrO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, (ZrO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, and (ZrO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> led to the identification of stable isomeric structures and their relative energies. It was found that (ZrO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> adopts three distinct isomeric forms resembling <i>chair</i>-, <i>boat</i>-, and <i>scepter</i>-like structures in its neutral, cationic, and anionic forms. The energetic ordering of these isomers in the neutral dimer is reversed upon either electron attachment or detachment. The adiabatic ionization potential of (ZrO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> was determined to be 9.141 eV, while the adiabatic electron affinity was found to be 1.475 eV. The vertical electron detachment energies were predicted to be 1.949, 1.852, and 1.340 eV, while the vertical ionization potentials, not previously reported in the literature, were determined to be 9.282, 9.375, and 9.594 eV. In both cases, the values correspond to the <i>scepter</i>, <i>boat</i>, and <i>chair</i> isomers, respectively, with the electron detachment energies showing excellent agreement with experimental data. Finally, possible scenarios of isomeric interconversion within the same charge, driven by electron attachment or detachment, were described and analyzed.
40178640	Prehospital and Emergency Department Vital Sign Abnormalities Among Injured Children.	Vital signs are a critical component in the assessment of the injured child.

40178540	Work Function-Induced Electronic Modulation in NiCo Alloy for Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction.	The rational design of electrocatalysts is of great significance in the production of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) through a nitrate reduction reaction (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>RR). This article proposes a design approach to regulate electron redistribution and intermediate adsorption energy by adjusting the work function of alloy compounds. As an example, the NiCo alloy is successfully electrodeposited on carbon cloth (CC) using deep eutectic solvent (DES) as medium. The results show that the ammonia production rate of the NiCo alloy is as high as 1.55 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> at -0.38 V vs RHE, with the Faraday efficiency to be 84.94%, and the selectivity 94%. Experimental characterizations combined with density functional theory calculations confirm that alloying is beneficial for reducing the work function of Ni. This in turn adjusts the d-band center of the alloy to approach the Fermi level, changes the rate-determining step during the reduction reaction process, and consequently improves the performance. Eventually, an investigation is conducted on the Zn-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> battery fabricated with Ni<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>2</sub>/CC. This further exhibits the potential of Ni<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>2</sub>/CC within the energy conversion equipment. This study brings fresh design concepts and opportunities to the development of novel electrocatalysts for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>RR.
40178500	Polyoxometalate-Based Ag<sup>I</sup>-MOF for Promoting Catalytic Conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and Propargylic Alcohols under Mild Conditions.	The conversion of carbon dioxide to high-value chemicals is greatly significant to green chemistry. The cyclization reaction of CO<sub>2</sub> with propargyl alcohol to form α-alkylidene cyclic carbonates has attracted attention due to atomic economy. Silver (Ag<sup>I</sup>) has emerged as one of the most effective activators for alkynes, attributed to its distinctive electronic configuration affording a specific affinity with alkynes. Herein, two novel Ag<sup>I</sup>-based metal-organic frameworks containing Keggin PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub><sup>3-</sup> (abbreviated as {PMo<sub>12</sub>}), namely, {Ag<sub>3</sub>(btap)<sub>3</sub>[PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]}·H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>Ag-1</b>) and {Ag(Hbtap)<sub>2</sub>[PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]} (<b>Ag-2</b>, btap is 3,5-bis(1',2',4'-triazol-1'-yl)pyridine), were successfully synthesized. <b>Ag-1</b> exhibits both exceptional thermal and solvent stability, along with high catalytic activity in CO<sub>2</sub> cyclization with various substituted propargylic alcohols into α-alkyl cyclic carbonates at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The highly dispersed Ag<sup>I</sup> and {PMo<sub>12</sub>} sites are beneficial for the superior performance of <b>Ag-1</b>, by activating the C≡C bond and adsorbing carbon dioxide, respectively. Based on the catalytic results, structural analysis, and classical chemical bond theory, it is speculated that the three-coordinated silver in <b>Ag-1</b> has higher Lewis acidity compared with <b>Ag-2</b>, making it easier to activate the substrate. Notably, the <b>Ag-1</b> catalyst exhibits outstanding stability with negligible activity loss over at least five successive cycles.
40178442	Coexisting Isomers, Charge-State Dependent Bonding, Geometric Reorganization, and Symmetry-Driven Stabilization in RuSi<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> and RuSi<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup> Clusters.	Transition metal (TM)-doped silicon clusters represent critical model systems for understanding the interplay between electronic structures and geometric configurations in nanomaterials. This study combines mass-selected anion photoelectron spectroscopy with multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations to resolve the structural, electronic, and isomerization dynamics of RuSi<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> and RuSi<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup> clusters. Photoelectron spectra at 266 nm (4.66 eV) are analyzed alongside density functional theory (B3LYP) and coupled-cluster (CCSD(T)) simulations to determine adiabatic/vertical detachment energies, structural isomers, and reaction pathways. RuSi<sub>4</sub>̅ exhibits two coexisting low-energy isomers (Δ<i>E</i> = 0.04/0.13 eV), stabilized kinetically via small thermal barriers, while RuSi<sub>5</sub>̅ adopts a <i>C</i><sub>4v</sub>-symmetric tetragonal bipyramid with σ aromaticity. Charge redistribution and Wiberg bond indices calculations critically modulate Ru-Si bonding, with CCSD(T) outperforming B3LYP in predicting energy hierarchies. The work establishes a symmetry-driven framework for predicting structural stability in TM silicides and elucidates kinetic trapping mechanisms relevant to designing functional nanomaterials with tailored electronic properties.
40178395	CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>-Modified Oxygen-Doped g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> Heterojunctions for Sulfurization of Alkenes to Sulfoxides.	<i>Z</i>-scheme heterostructures have become a novel class of photocatalysts that hold substantial significance in the domains of environmental and energy-related applications. This can be attributed to their distinctive charge separation and transfer pathways, which endow <i>Z</i>-scheme heterojunctions with robust redox capabilities. In this paper, we report a straightforward method for fabricating a perovskite-based <i>Z</i>-scheme heterojunction by integrating CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals with oxygen-doped g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (OCN). This heterojunction exhibited a high photocatalytic activity in the selective sulfoxidation reaction of alkenes with thiols. Under aerobic conditions, moderate to excellent yields of high-value sulfoxides with good functional compatibilities were achieved. This heterojunction showcases outstanding photocatalytic performance, remarkable stability, operational simplicity, high atom efficiency, and eco-friendly energy sources. The formation of <i>Z</i>-scheme heterojunction was corroborated by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These spectra revealed a negative shift in the binding energies of Cs 1s, Pb 4f, and Br 3d in CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>, while a positive shift was observed for C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s in OCN upon light irradiation. This specific shift pattern effectively promotes the <i>Z</i>-scheme electron transfer from OCN to CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>, which is conducive to the separation of electrons and holes, thereby enhancing the photoredox catalytic activity.
40178359	Interaction of Arginine and Tryptophan-Rich Short Antimicrobial Peptides with Membrane Models: A Combined Fluorescence, Simulations, and Theoretical Approach.	The augmented increase in bacterial antimicrobial resistance necessitates the discovery of alternative antimicrobial molecules such as short antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with antimicrobial activity and low cytotoxicity. While many such peptides have been studied, their selective affinity for bacterial versus mammalian membranes remains unclear. Here, we propose a complementary approach using state-of-the-art fluorescence experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and theoretical techniques. The main goal of this approach is to unravel the energetics and molecular interactions of AMPs with different membrane models at the lipid-water interface. We use short Trp- and Arg-rich AMPs, pure phosphatidylcholine (PC), and an 85:15 mixture of PC with phosphatidylglycerol (PG) lipids for the mammalian and bacterial model membranes, respectively. First, we found that the electrostatic interaction of PG headgroups with Arg enhances the peptide interaction with mixed bilayers by 25-30%, leading to increased hydrogen bonding and stronger membrane adhesion. Second, the obtained Gibbs free energies revealed significantly distinct partitioning of the AMP at the interface for the two bilayers, suggesting a qualitatively different insertion method of cationic AMPs into each of the two membrane models. These results highlight the potential of our approach to <b><i>unravel</i></b> the membrane selectivity of an AMP in the context of AMP-based rational design of antibiotics.
40178194	Recent Advances in Peptide-Functionalized Hydrogels for Bone Tissue Engineering.	Efficient therapeutic approaches for bone regeneration are urgently required to address the significant challenges associated with the repair of large-scale or long-segment bone defects. Peptide-functionalized hydrogels (PFHs) have emerged as important bioactive materials in bone tissue engineering because they produce biomimetic microenvironments enriched with multiple biochemical signals. This review summarizes the key fabrication techniques for PFHs and discusses their diverse applications in different fields. Furthermore, we systematically highlighted the biochemical functionalization of PFHs, which includes basic functions such as cell adhesion, cell recruitment, and osteoinduction; improved functions such as angiogenesis, biomineralization, immune regulation, and hormone regulation; and other functions, including antimicrobial and antitumor effects. Finally, critical biosafety considerations associated with PFHs and perspectives on developing intelligent PFHs are addressed. This review aims to inspire further research on PFHs and accelerate their applications in bone tissue engineering.
40178174	Application of Deep Learning to Predict the Persistence, Bioaccumulation, and Toxicity of Pharmaceuticals.	This study investigates the application of a deep learning (DL) model, specifically a message-passing neural network (MPNN) implemented through Chemprop, to predict the persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity (PBT) characteristics of compounds, with a focus on pharmaceuticals. We employed a clustering strategy to provide a fair assessment of the model performances. By applying the generated model to a set of pharmaceutically relevant molecules, we aim to highlight potential PBT chemicals and extract PBT-relevant substructures. These substructures can serve as structural flags, alerting drug designers to potential environmental issues from the earliest stages of the drug discovery process. Incorporating these findings into pharmaceutical development workflows is expected to drive significant advancements in creating more environmentally friendly drug candidates while preserving their therapeutic efficacy.

40178087	Clearance of Cell-Free DNA: A Novel Target for Therapeutic Utilization in Multiple Systemic Disorders.	Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) holds significant promise for diagnostic and therapeutic advancements in medicine. This review delineates the utility of cfDNA in diagnostics and its therapeutic potential through clearance mechanisms for an array of diseases. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are endogenous molecules released by host cells during stress, or injury. As a trigger for inflammatory responses via damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cfDNA's removal via nanotechnological approaches can attenuate inflammation and promote tissue repair. While the application of cfDNA clearance is particularly auspicious in cancer, sepsis, and inflammatory conditions, it is confronted with challenges including toxicity, specificity, and the rigors of clinical trial validation. Collectively, this review delineates novel therapeutic targets to inform the development of innovative treatment strategies.
40177958	Purification of Xe and SF<sub>6</sub> through Adaptive Contractions in a Flexible Metal-Organic Framework.	Overcoming the trade-off effects between adsorption capacity, adsorption selectivity, and adsorption enthalpy of an adsorbent is very important but remains a huge challenge. Here, we report a flexible metal-organic framework (<b>FJI-H36</b>); it can selectively adsorb Xe from Xe/Kr mixtures with high adsorption capacity but very low adsorption enthalpy. Structural analyses show that such excellent adsorption performances come from the adaptive contraction of the flexible framework; pore shrinkage can enhance the interactions between adsorbed Xe and the framework and offset some of the adsorption heats. For SF<sub>6</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures, <b>FJI-H36</b> can also enhance the adsorption performance of SF<sub>6</sub> through adaptive contraction, resulting in both high adsorption selectivity and low adsorption enthalpy. This not only provides a new adsorbent for the purification of Xe/Kr/SF<sub>6</sub> but also offers a potential solution to overcome the trade-offs among adsorption capacity, adsorption selectivity, and adsorption enthalpy of a specific adsorbent.
40177954	Study of the Microstructure, Physical and Mechanical Properties of Zirconium Disilicide Ceramics: Synthesis, Experimental Characterization and Theoretical Calculations.	Zirconium disilicide (ZrSi<sub>2</sub>) is often used in high-temperature applications due to its excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability. This study aims to investigate the microstructure and physical and mechanical properties of ZrSi<sub>2</sub> ceramics prepared under high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) sintering conditions. The research results show that the density, Vickers hardness, and fracture toughness of the ZrSi<sub>2</sub> ceramic sample reach 4.7 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 10.547 GPa, and 6.905 MPa·m<sup>1/2</sup>, respectively. It is worth noting that the ZrSi<sub>2</sub> ceramic sample exhibits excellent oxidation resistance and its oxidation starting temperature is 1463 °C. The experimentally measured thermal diffusion coefficient of the ZrSi<sub>2</sub> ceramic sample is 2.815 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, and the specific heat capacity is 0.48 J/g·K, from which the thermal conductivity is calculated to be 6.354 W/m·K. The first-principles calculation results show that the crystal structure of ZrSi<sub>2</sub> has good dynamic stability, and the silicon atoms and zirconium atoms are connected by strong covalent bonds. At the same time, the ZrSi<sub>2</sub> ceramic sample obtained in this experiment has a uniform grain size distribution, a high dislocation density, and a strong texture. The results of this study are crucial for the preparation and application of ZrSi<sub>2</sub> ceramics.
40177864	Bioenzyme Inspired Heterointerface Construction of NiFeSe/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> for Improved Overall Water Splitting.	Electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production represents a crucial pathway toward establishing sustainable energy infrastructure and addressing environmental concerns, with the development of high-performance nonprecious metal catalysts being a central focus. While Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> demonstrates potential as an electrocatalyst, its limited functionality and suboptimal performance necessitate further enhancement. In this study, drawing inspiration from natural hydrogenases, we engineered a novel NiFeSe/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> composite electrocatalyst through the integration of NiFeSe with Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>. The synthesized catalyst displayed outstanding overall water-splitting performance in alkaline media, realizing current densities of 100 and 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at remarkably low overpotentials of 267.4 mV (vs RHE) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 105.6 mV (vs RHE) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Remarkably, the two-electrode electrolyzer incorporating NiFeSe/Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> achieved a current density of 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at a substantially reduced cell voltage of 1.586 V. Comprehensive analysis revealed that the strategic construction of biomimetic active centers and heterogeneous interfaces significantly modulates the electronic structure, improved charge transfer, and redistribution of electron density of the catalytic sites. This investigation provides valuable insights and a promising framework for the rational design of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for water-splitting applications.
40176723	Approaching Hypothetical RbTl in Experiments and Theory - X-ray Structure Determination of Cs<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Rb<i><sub>x</sub></i>Tl (<i>x</i> = 0.18, 0.42) and a Solid Solution K<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Rb<i><sub>x</sub></i>Tl (<i>x</i> ≤ 0.69).	Although the binary alkali metal thallides ATl with A = Li, Na, K, and Cs have been reported in the literature, binary RbTl at ambient pressure is still missing. Experiments with a 1:1 ratio of Rb:Tl, either according to Zintl's procedure in low-temperature experiments in liquid ammonia or classical solid-state synthesis at high temperature, did not result in the desired product. Therefore, several ternary compositions with mixtures of K/Rb and Cs/Rb have been prepared. For K/Rb mixtures, a solid solution in the KTl structure type, up to a proportion of 69% rubidium, could be obtained. Site occupancy preferences for rubidium on the alkali metal sites in the KTl type are observed in experiments and supported by theoretical calculations. In contrast to Rb/K mixtures being realizable in the KTl structure type, Rb/Cs mixtures did not allow for the isolation of materials according to the CsTl structure type. Instead, two new monoclinic compounds could be isolated (Cs<sub>0.82</sub>Rb<sub>0.18</sub>Tl: <i>C</i>2/<i>c</i>, <i>a</i> = 14.4136(4) Å, <i>b</i> = 11.1678(3) Å, <i>c</i> = 40.8013(11) Å, β = 96.353(2)°, <i>V</i> = 6527.4(3) Å<sup>3</sup>; Cs<sub>0.58</sub>Rb<sub>0.42</sub>Tl: <i>C</i>2/<i>c</i>, <i>a</i> = 14.2610(3) Å, <i>b</i> = 11.1116(2) Å, <i>c</i> = 27.5589(7) Å, β = 104.056(2)°, <i>V</i> = 4236.30(17) Å<sup>3</sup>). Detailed DFT calculations on both binary and mixed cation systems were performed and support the experimental results.
40176343	Excellent Upconversion Luminescence Obtained by Er<sup>3+</sup> Self-Sensitization for Temperature Sensing in Deep Tissues and Anticounterfeiting Application.	The development of high-efficiency upconversion (UC) luminescent materials with multifunctional applications, particularly those excited by wavelengths within the second near-infrared (NIR) biological window, holds a paramount scientific significance. Herein, Er<sup>3+</sup> self-sensitization UC performance excited by 1532 nm wavelength is first studied in the CaSc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> matrix. Strong green and red UC emission as well as <sup>4</sup>I<sub>11/2</sub> → <sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub> NIR transition are observed, though multipath optical thermometry with high sensitivity is realized. Moreover, the penetration depth of the <sup>4</sup>I<sub>11/2</sub> → <sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub> transition in the biological tissues can reach at least 6 mm, benefiting from its ideal excitation and emission wavelengths located in the biological window. Beyond that, CaSc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>: Er<sup>3+</sup> phosphor displays variable color luminescence under dual-wavelength excitation, including 980 and 1532 nm, which can be used for enhancing the security of anticounterfeiting materials. Our findings suggest that CaSc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>: Er<sup>3+</sup> phosphor with excellent UC properties is a promising candidate for the application in optical thermometry and anticounterfeiting field.
40175313	Microplastic biofilms as potential hotspots for plastic biodegradation and nitrogen cycling: a metagenomic perspective.	Microplastics are an emerging contaminant worldwide, with the potential to impact organisms and facilitate the sorption and release of chemicals. Additionally, they create a novel habitat for microbial communities, forming biofilms known as the plastisphere. While the plastisphere has been studied in select aquatic environments, those in estuarine ecosystems merit additional attention due to their proximity to plastic debris sources. Additionally, the role plastisphere communities play in nutrient cycling has rarely been examined. This study used metagenomic analysis to investigate the taxonomic composition and functional genes of developing plastisphere communities living on petroleum-based (polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride) and biopolymer-based (polylactic acid) substrates. Isolated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) showed plastisphere communities have the genes necessary to perform nitrification and denitrification and degrade petroleum and biopolymer-based plastics. The functions of these plastispheres have implications for estuarine nitrogen cycling and provide a possible explanation for the plastisphere microbes' competitiveness in biofilm environments. Overall, microplastics in the estuarine system provide a novel habitat for microbial communities and associated nitrogen cycling, facilitating the growth of microbes with plastic-degrading capabilities.
40175306	Controlled-Release of Dexamethasone via Light-Activated Implant for Potential Vocal Fold Scar Treatment.	This study investigates a novel light-activated implant system designed for injectable, dose-controlled, sustained drug delivery. The light-activated implant was developed by incorporating light-activated drug-releasing liposomes into a biodegradable polymeric capsule. The drug release kinetics from the implant at 0, 1, and 2 min of light activation were determined <i>in vitro</i> using a tissue mimic with varying depths. A pulsed near-infrared laser at 1064 nm, connected to an optical fiber, was used as the light source. The dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) release was tunable depending on the laser irradiation time, with an approximately 4% reduction in release as tissue depth increased by 2 mm. The implant was injected using a needle into <i>ex vivo</i> porcine vocal folds, and drug release kinetics were quantified by real-time fluorescence imaging. Mathematical models were also developed to understand diffusion mechanisms of the light-activated, controlled drug release profiles from the cylindrical implant. Finally, <i>in vivo</i> evaluations in a healthy rabbit vocal fold model confirmed comparable drug release through light activation. Histological assessments demonstrated the safety of the drug delivery system and the structural integrity of the implant within biological tissues after 6 weeks of implantation. These results support the potential clinical application of the drug delivery system, offering a promising solution for conditions requiring precise, controlled therapeutic delivery. Future work will focus on scaling the technology for clinical trials, including construct and tissue reactions in human tissue, to enhance treatment efficacy for various medical conditions.
40175286	A Specialized and Enhanced Deep Generation Model for Active Molecular Design Targeting Kinases Guided by Affinity Prediction Models and Reinforcement Learning.	Kinases are critical regulators in numerous cellular processes, and their dysregulation is linked to various diseases, including cancer. Thus, protein kinases have emerged as major drug targets at present, with approximately a quarter to a third of global drug development efforts focusing on kinases. Additionally, deep learning-based molecular generation methods have shown obvious advantages in exploring large chemical space and improving the efficiency of drug discovery. However, many current molecular generation models face challenges in considering specific targets and generating molecules with desired properties, such as target-related activity. Here, we developed a specialized and enhanced deep learning-based molecular generation framework named KinGen, which is specially designed for the efficient generation of small molecule kinase inhibitors. By integrating reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and a specialized reward module, KinGen leverages a binding affinity prediction model as part of its reward function, which allows it to accurately guide the generation process toward biologically relevant molecules with high target activity. This approach not only ensures that the generated molecules have desirable binding properties but also improves the efficiency of molecular optimization. The results demonstrate that KinGen can generate structurally valid, unique, and diverse molecules. The generated molecules exhibit binding affinities to the target that are comparable to known inhibitors, achieving an average docking score of -9.5 kcal/mol, which highlights the model's ability to design compounds with enhanced activity. These results suggest that KinGen has the potential to serve as an effective tool for accelerating kinase-targeted drug discovery efforts.
40173338	Zinc Sulfate Open Frameworks with Nonconventional Room-Temperature Phosphorescence for Selective Amine Vapor Detection.	Molecular-based afterglow materials have garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications. However, most studies focus on conventional luminophores, leaving nonconventional systems underexplored, particularly regarding the screening of new material subclasses and the development of applications such as sensing. Herein we report the successful preparation of two new two-dimensional ZnSO<sub>4</sub>-based open-framework materials (OFMs)─(H<sub>2</sub>DABCO)[Zn<sub>3</sub>(μ<sub>3</sub>-OH)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>1</b>) and (H<sub>2</sub>DABCO)[Zn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] (<b>2</b>)─through self-assembly of Zn<sup>2+</sup>/SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> with nonaromatic triethylenediamine (DABCO). Both compounds exhibit distinct delayed emission characteristics with lifetimes of 259.10 ms (<b>1</b>) and 49.62 μs (<b>2</b>), respectively. Frontier orbital analysis reveals the key role of charge transfer between sulfate groups to (H<sub>2</sub>DABCO)<sup>2+</sup> cations in the luminescence. Notably, <b>1</b> demonstrates exceptional performance as an afterglow probe for the selective detection of <i>n</i>-propylamine and <i>n</i>-butylamine vapors, achieving detection limits of 32.99 and 47.18 ppm, respectively. The sensing mechanism involves a phase-transition process, and the luminescence change can be observed by the naked eye. This work pioneers the integration of sulfate-based OFMs with nonconventional room-temperature phosphorescence properties, demonstrating their potential as afterglow probes for industrial and environmental monitoring.
40173326	Preparation, Conformational Structure, and Proteolytic Activity of Papain Covalently Conjugated to Poly(ethylene glycol)-Tethered Lipid Bilayer Membranes.	Conjugation of enzymes to lipid membranes is a key approach to reconstitute fascinating features of cell organelles and to deduce the nature of membrane-involved biological events. In this work, papain was covalently conjugated via a cross-linker to phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) tethered with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) at 25 °C and pH = 7.0, followed by chromatographic purification. The size of the PEG moiety and the type of cross-linker were optimized to obtain PEG-tethered liposome-conjugated papain (liposome-PEG-papain). Slight conformational changes of the membrane-conjugated papain in both its secondary and tertiary structures were revealed using circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence measurements. Notably, heat treatment of a liposome-PEG-papain dispersion at 77 or 84 °C caused permeabilization of the lipid membranes to 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Furthermore, liposome-PEG-papain exhibited the digestion activity of casein at 37 °C and pH = 7.6. The structural flexibility of liposomes as enzyme carriers may provide the opportunity to functionalize the membrane-conjugated biomacromolecules.
40173298	Molecular Switches Guided by a Reversible Access to Room-Temperature Phosphorescence and ESIPT Fluorescence.	This work contributes to luminescent molecular switches featuring several emission pathways, which can be activated by external stimuli. We designed Zn complexes with phenylbenzothiazole-based α-aminomethylphosphine oxide (L) and isolated them as crystalline phases, α-[ZnL<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>], [ZnL(EtOAc)Cl<sub>2</sub>], [ZnL<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]·1.5CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, and [ZnL<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]·1.5CHCl<sub>3</sub>. They feature an intramolecular hydrogen bond of medium strength, capable of excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), as well as able for intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet states. Since neither of these processes is predominant, one or the other can occur depending on a slight change in a molecular geometry. The crystalline phases reveal red-colored ESIPT fluorescence, while a metastable amorphous phase β-[ZnL<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] with a similar structure of the coordination center reveals yellow-colored room-temperature phosphorescence. Combined experimental and quantum-chemical TD-DFT study clarified the dual emission behavior for the polymorphs α-[ZnL<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] and β-[ZnL<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>], which is attributed to the high dependence of the probability of the excited-state processes on the geometry of the phenylbenzothiazole moiety. The reversible phase transition, accompanied by the change in the emission mechanism (ESIPT fluorescence vs phosphorescence), can be manipulated by fuming with CHCl<sub>3</sub> and Et<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. We have demonstrated good adhesive properties of the polymer-free β-[ZnL<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] film toward glass and plastic, naked-eye color response to fuming with Et<sub>2</sub>O, and easy recovery with CHCl<sub>3</sub>.

In this work, we have shown that the isolated tungsten blackberries, Fe<sub>3</sub>[W<sub>72</sub>Fe<sub>30</sub>O<sub>252</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>25</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>103</sub>]·180H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>{W</b><sub><b>72</b></sub><b>Fe</b><sub><b>30</b></sub><b>}</b><sub><b>NB</b></sub>) exhibit a modest proton conductivity of 3.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup> at 80 °C and RH 98% with an activation energy of 0.34 eV. We have used this POM-based solid electrolyte of moderate proton conductivity as the nanofiller in an organic polymer, poly [2,2'-(m-phenylene)- 5, 5'-benzimidazole] (m-PBI) to fabricate the POM-based polymer composite membranes that are doped with phosphoric acid (PA): <b>2</b>.<b>5% {W</b><sub><b>72</b></sub><b>Fe</b><sub><b>30</b></sub><b>}+PA@m-PBI</b> and <b>5% {W</b><sub><b>72</b></sub><b>Fe</b><sub><b>30</b></sub><b>}+PA@m-PBI</b> for their use as proton exchange membranes (PEMs) at a higher temperature (160 °C). The PEMs, <b>2</b>.<b>5% {W</b><sub><b>72</b></sub><b>Fe</b><sub><b>30</b></sub><b>}+PA@m-PBI</b> and <b>5% {W</b><sub><b>72</b></sub><b>Fe</b><sub><b>30</b></sub><b>}+PA@m-PBI</b>, exhibit the proton conductivity values of 0.126 S cm<sup>-1</sup> and 0.159 S cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, whereas the PA-doped host-organic polymer (<b>PA@m-PBI</b>) itself shows the conductivity value of 0.056 S cm<sup>-1</sup>, under an identical experimental condition. Thus, we have demonstrated that a giant <b>{W</b><sub><b>72</b></sub><b>Fe</b><sub><b>30</b></sub><b>}</b>-type POM compound showing a moderate proton conductivity in its solid state exhibits super proton conductivity upon its fabrication with an organic polymer, resulting in mixed matrix PEMs.
40173268	Structural, Optoelectronic, Magnetic, and Photoelectrochemical Consequences of Copper Insertion into Alkaline Earth Metal (Mg, Ca, or Sr) Pyrovanadate Compound Frameworks.	This study explores the manifold consequences of introducing copper into an alkaline earth metal (A = Mg, Ca, or Sr) pyrovanadate compound (A<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) framework. Thus, powder X-ray diffraction coupled with Rietveld refinement showed that phase pure alloys, namely, Mg<sub>0.67</sub>Cu<sub>1.33</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, CaCuV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and SrCuV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> could be obtained via solution combustion synthesis. Local structure distortions from copper insertion into the A<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> compound framework were revealed by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Importantly, the Cu<sub>2-<i>x</i></sub>A<sub><i>x</i></sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> alloy framework is shown below to be an excellent platform for demonstrating the complementarity of the two outcomes of bandgap photon absorption, namely, photovoltaic or photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity versus photoluminescence (PL). Thus, PL from the parent pyrovanadate was quenched when copper was introduced; concomitantly, PEC activity emerged for the semiconductor alloys. Changes in the electronic band structures on copper introduction were experimentally probed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and Kelvin probe measurements. These data were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, the magnetic attributes of the three alloys are discussed via both experiment and theory.
40172875	Novel pancreatic lipase inhibitory peptides derived from lotus seed protein: isolation, identification, and the interaction mechanism.	In this study, pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibitory peptides were identified from a lotus seed protein (LSP) hydrolysate and the potential mechanism was investigated. The LSP hydrolysate was isolated and purified, and six PL inhibitory peptides were screened; in particular, Phe-Leu-Leu (FLL) and Glu-Phe-Phe (EFF) exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity. Molecular docking results indicated that FLL and EFF interacted with residues around the PL active site through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The Lineweaver-Burk curve revealed that FLL acted as a mixed-type inhibitor, while EFF exhibited non-competitive inhibition of PL. Additionally, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrometry analyses confirmed that FLL and EFF altered the microenvironment and secondary structure of PL by increasing the β-sheet content and reducing the α-helix content, thereby decreasing the catalytic activity of PL. Molecular dynamics simulation further confirmed that PL-peptide complexes exhibited a more stable state and compact structure. In summary, FLL and EFF could be used in the development of food supplements for obesity prevention.
40172578	Unveiling the Dichotomy Between Cobalt(II)-Exchanged X and Y Faujasite Zeolites via Oxidative Carboxylation of Alkene to Cyclic Carbonate.	Cobalt(II)-exchanged X and Y zeolites with varying metal loadings were employed to convert CO<sub>2</sub> to cyclic carbonates starting from alkenes. The transformation was carried out using O<sub>2</sub> as an oxidant in a mixture of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> under atmospheric pressure, and a maximum yield of 35.7% cyclic carbonate was achieved. Studies revealed a stark difference among both the zeolites, primarily arising from a difference in their ion exchange behaviors. Their catalytic and recyclability properties differed as a result of this variation.
40172498	FRET-Mediated Photoswitchable Catalytic Metallacage with Tunable Activity for Organic Dye Degradation.	Photoswitchable catalysts provide a versatile strategy for controlling catalytic activities through light stimuli, presenting significant potential for the precise regulation of synthetic transformations. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel photoswitchable catalytic metallacage <b>MC</b> from meso-tetra-(2-pyridyl)-porphines (<b>TPP</b>) and Pt(II)-bisthienylethene (<b>DTE-1</b>) via coordination-driven self-assembly. The Pt(II)-bisthienylethene ligand within the metallacage exhibits a reversible conversion between its ring-opened and ring-closed isomers upon alternating UV and visible radiation, facilitating photoswitchable Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in <b>MC</b> systems. Notably, the two forms of the metallacage exhibit switchable performance between highly and poorly catalytical activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B. This work not only develops a novel metallacage-based photoswitchable FRET system but also provides a new avenue for constructing artificial photoregulated enzymes.
40172361	Organotin-Oxo Clusters with Enhanced π-Conjugation for Iodine Capture.	The sustainable development of nuclear energy raises significant challenges in handling radioactive iodine (I<sub>2</sub>). Tin-oxo clusters are multimetal aggregates composed of Sn-oxide motifs and surface ligands. Sn<sup>2/4+</sup> ions have a strong affinity for iodine, making tin-oxo clusters promising candidates for trapping I<sub>2</sub>. In this work, we constructed two BINOL (=1,1'-binaphthol)-based organotin-oxo clusters with bowl-shaped structures and used them in iodine absorption study. The BINOL-based organotin-oxo clusters demonstrated remarkable performance in an I<sub>2</sub> vapor adsorption experiment, with Sn<sub>6</sub>L<sub>4</sub> achieving an adsorption capacity of 1.36 g·g<sup>-1</sup> at 80 °C. Combining experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations, we found that the BINOL-based organotin-oxo clusters interact with iodine through charge transfer interactions and Sn-I bondings. Additionally, the introduction of a butyl group enhances the adsorption capacity by facilitating C-H-I interactions. The research paves the way for the development of tin-oxo cluster-based iodine adsorbents.
40172236	Personalized Energy Adaptation through Reweighting Learning (PEARL) Force Field for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins.	Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have garnered significant attention due to their critical roles in complex human diseases. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a valuable approach for studying IDPs, whose accuracy heavily depends on the accuracy of force fields. Despite this, the high conformational flexibility of IDPs presents limitations for current force fields in precisely capturing their conformational features. Here, we developed a tool for generating force field parameters, consisting of two main components: the construction and training of a model named DihedralProbNet to predict protein dihedral probability distributions and the DeepReweighting algorithm to optimize force field parameters. This personalized energy adaptation through reweighting learning was termed the PEARL force field. To evaluate its performance, 8 IDPs and 5 folded protein systems were used. The results demonstrate that the PEARL force field more accurately reproduces the conformational ensembles of IDPs than ff19SB and stabilizes the conformations of folded proteins. Therefore, by enabling a more accurate sampling of IDP conformations, PEARL has the potential to advance our understanding of the role of IDPs in biological processes and their involvement in disease mechanisms.
40172200	Engineering High-Performance Multifunctional Scaffolds from the Acellular Dermal Matrix for Abdominal Wall Defects Repair via a Dopamine Progressive Permeation-Cross-Linking Strategy.	Emergency repair of complicated full-thickness abdominal wall defects remains one of the most common and challenging surgical emergencies globally. Here, an integrated polydopamine permeating-cross-linking strategy was innovatively proposed to convert porcine acellular dermal matrix (pADM) into versatile, degradation-resistant biopatches (PDA-pADM) for efficiently repairing full-thickness abdominal wall defects. The strategy significantly addresses the challenge that natural-property improvement and biocompatibility of biomaterials are difficult to balance. Molecularly, dopamine (DA) molecules could fully permeate into the collagen fibers of the acellular dermal matrix and then automatically trigger the interfacial in situ polymerization of dopamine monomers among collagen fibers to achieve the efficient cross-linking of pADM. Surprisingly, the enzymatic durability of the biopatch shows significant improvements, extending the original duration from 3 to 20 d. Comprehensive in vivo experiments have shown that PDA-pADM can effectively promote angiogenesis and inhibit inflammatory response, so as to achieve regeneration and repair of abdominal wall damage.
40172120	TCnet: A Novel Strategy to Predict Target Combination of Alzheimer's Disease via Network-Based Methods.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with an unclear pathogenesis; the traditional ″single gene-single target-single drug″ strategy is insufficient for effective treatment. This study explores a novel strategy for the multitarget therapy of AD by integrating multiomics data and employing network analysis. Different from conventional single-target methods, TCnet adopts a mechanism-driven strategy, utilizing multiomics data to decompose disease mechanisms, construct potential target combinations, and prioritize the optimal combinations using a scoring function. TCnet not only advances our understanding of disease mechanisms but also facilitates large-scale drug screening. This approach was further employed to screen active compounds from Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang (HLJDT), identifying quercetin as a candidate targeting GSK3β and ADAM17. Subsequent <i>in vitro</i> experiments confirmed the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of quercetin. Overall, TCnet offers a promising approach for predicting target combinations and provides new insights and directions for drug discovery in AD.
40172104	Preparation of Colloidal Cadmium Sulfoselenide Nanoplatelets from Alloyed Quantum Dots.	We report a novel approach for synthesizing cadmium sulfoselenide nanoplatelets from alloyed quantum dots. The resulting nanoplatelets, with a zinc-blende crystal structure, display uniform morphology, sharp photoluminescence, and spatially homogeneous elemental distributions. Correlated analyses corroborate the evolution of cadmium sulfoselenide nanoplatelets derived from alloyed quantum dots prepared with selenium sulfide.
40171875	High-Performance Multiscale LNPs from Black Liquor as Repulpable Paper Coatings with Enhanced Water, Oil, and Vapor Resistance.	Technical lignin in alkaline pulping black liquor is usually combusted for energy in a soda recovery unit. To improve resource utilization, multiscale lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) were acid precipitated from black liquor and combined with gelatinized starch (SS) to produce a series of uniformly mixed surface coating agents to enhance the barrier properties of paper materials including water, oil, and water vapor resistance. The coating with 20%SS and 50%LNPs (based on oven-dried SS) with a diameter of 276 nm could significantly improve the barrier properties of the coated paper. Cobb 60 decreased by 79.6% from 67.98 to 13.86 g/m<sup>2</sup>, Kit rating improved from 0 to 10, and water vapor transmission reduced from ≥3000 to 441.69 g/m<sup>2</sup>·day. The coated paper presented superior mechanical properties, thermal stability, repulpability, and biodegradability. This work provides an effective strategy for the high-value application of pulping black liquor and holds promise for paper-based packaging.
40171844	Enlarging Environmental Asymmetry by the Site Tailoring to Enhance Luminescence Properties of Sm<sup>3+</sup> in the (Gd,Na)<sub>3</sub>(Ga,In)<sub>2</sub>(Ga,Ge)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub> Garnet.	A structural design strategy was employed to develop NaGd<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>InGe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Sm<sup>3+</sup> (NGGIG:Sm<sup>3+</sup>) garnet phosphors, optimizing the local coordination environment to enhance luminescence performance. By tailoring site occupation, Sm<sup>3+</sup> ions were incorporated into an asymmetric crystal field, where a statistical probability model confirmed that ∼97% of Sm<sup>3+</sup> ions reside in distorted coordination environments, promoting electric dipole(ED) transitions. The phosphors exhibit a high red-to-orange (<i>R</i>/<i>O</i>) intensity ratio of 2.97, contributing to enhanced red emission. CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.61, 0.39) indicate a significant shift toward the red region, and the phosphors retain over 70% of their luminescence intensity at 400 K, demonstrating good thermal stability. These characteristics make NGGIG:Sm<sup>3+</sup> a promising candidate for high-performance red phosphors in solid-state lighting applications, highlighting the effectiveness of site engineering in garnet structures for optimizing luminescence efficiency and stability.
40171675	Differential effects of ellagic acid on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice: grouped by urolithin A-producing capacity.	Ellagic acid (EA) exhibits protective effects on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the ability to produce urolithins and the health benefits associated with EA consumption differ considerably among individuals. Therefore, the different effects of EA on high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced NAFLD, considering variability in urolithin-producing ability, were explored. Our results showed that EA could effectively reduce body weight, lipid accumulation and insulin resistance, and improve oxidative stress and inflammation in NAFLD mice. The metabolomics analysis indicated that liver metabolism disorder induced by HFFD was obviously improved by EA mainly through the regulation of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism. In particular, the improvement effect of EA on NAFLD in mice with high urolithin A production was better than that in their low counterparts. Moreover, EA treatment reshaped the gut microbiota imbalance caused by HFFD. Specifically, compared to the model group, the lower abundances of <i>Faecalibaculum</i> (by 95.11%), <i>Ruminococcus_torques_group</i> (by 208.14%), <i>Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1</i> (by 449.37%), and <i>Ileibacterium</i> (by 172.64%), while higher abundances of <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i> (by 425.0%) were observed in the high-UroA-producing group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). This study provided new insights into EA's anti-NAFLD effectiveness and suggested that the response capacity of the gut microbiota to EA greatly determined the performance of EA in alleviating the development of NAFLD.
40170419	MOF-Supported Diphosphine Ligands for Iridium-Catalyzed C-H Borylation of Arenes.	Postsynthetic methods have been used to immobilize a carboxylate-functionalized diphosphine ligand, <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-bis[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]glycinate (dppmg), in different metal-organic framework (MOF) supports. H(dppmg) reacts quantitatively with Zn-OH groups in MFU-4<i>l</i>-OH (<b>1</b>) to provide solid-state ligands (<b>1-H-</b><i><b>x</b></i>) with controllable diphosphine loadings. Postsynthetic metalation with [Ir(OMe)(cod)]<sub>2</sub> (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) generates heterogeneous precatalysts (<b>1-Ir-</b><i><b>x</b></i>) that show excellent activity toward C-H borylation of arenes. This activity is dependent on both the catalyst site density and initial concentration of the borylating reagent. Homogeneous catalysts supported by analogous diphosphine ligands exhibit low catalytic activity, demonstrating the beneficial role of catalyst site isolation. Immobilization of dppmg-Ir catalysts at the Zr-based nodes of MOF-808 (<b>2-P-Ir</b>) and NU-1000 (<b>3-P-Ir</b>) results in materials with relatively poor catalytic activity toward C-H borylation of toluene, revealing the importance of the MOF support in catalyst design.
40169450	Polymer Applied in Hydrogel Wound Dressing for Wound Healing: Modification/Functionalization Method and Design Strategies.	Hydrogel wound dressings have emerged as a promising solution for wound healing due to their excellent mechanical and biochemical properties. Over recent years, there has been significant progress in expanding the variety of raw materials used for hydrogel formulation along with the development of advanced modification techniques and design approaches that enhance their performance. However, a comprehensive review encompassing diverse polymer modification strategies and design innovations for hydrogel dressings is still lacking in the literature. This review summarizes the use of natural polymers (e.g., chitosan, gelatin, sodium alginate, hyaluronic acid, and dextran) and synthetic polymers (e.g., poly(vinyl alcohol), polyethylene glycol, Pluronic F-127, poly(<i>N</i>-isopropylacrylamide), polyacrylamide, and polypeptides) in hydrogel wound dressings. We further explore the advantages and limitations of these polymers and discuss various modification strategies, including cationic modification, oxidative modification, double-bond modification, catechol modification, etc. The review also addresses design principles and synthesis methods, aligning polymer modifications with specific requirements in wound healing. Finally, we discuss future challenges and opportunities in the development of advanced hydrogel-based wound dressings.
40168628	Constrained Structure Minimizations on Hyperspheres for Minimum Energy Path Following.	In this work, a reliable and robust trust region method for restricted minimizations on hyperspheres is developed. The working equations of this new methodology are presented, together with their validation. The performance and characteristics of this new algorithm are discussed by a constrained minimization on a sphere using a two-dimensional Quapp model surface. The obtained results show that the proposed method for minimizations on hyperspheres guarantees convergence to constrained minima. Its enhanced numerical stability permits tight convergence criteria for constrained minimizations. The application of the new restricted minimizer in the framework of the hierarchical transition state finder and for the calculation of intrinsic reaction coordinates for 38 chemical reactions demonstrates its robustness and efficiency.
40168590	Elasticity Anisotropy of <i>Bombyx mori</i> Silkworm Silk Fiber by Brillouin Light Spectroscopy.	Silkworm silk has long been an important natural protein fiber for textile and medical applications, where its superior mechanical properties play a crucial role. Despite the many studies by conventional stress-strain tests, our understanding of the mechanical properties of silkworm silk remains limited. This work investigates the complete elastic properties of <i>Bombyx mori</i> silkworm silk in a noncontact, noninvasive manner by conducting Brillouin light spectroscopy experiments. The analysis of the angle-dependent sound velocities leads to the determination of the full elastic tensor and the engineering mechanical properties of the silkworm silk in natural and stretched states. In the natural state, the axial and lateral Young's moduli are 23.4 ± 1.0 and 10.4 ± 0.5 GPa, respectively, giving an elastic anisotropy of 2.3. Different from the strain-hardening behavior of the spider silk, the mechanical properties of the silkworm silk exhibit a weak strain-dependence up to the breakage strain (∼20%).
40168017	Single Crystal Structure Precludes Predicted Ferroelectricity of Uranium Trifluoride, UF<sub>3</sub>.	Single crystals of uranium trifluoride, UF<sub>3</sub>, were obtained for the first time via gas-phase crystallization, enabling the resolution of its crystal structure using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The study reveals that UF<sub>3</sub> crystallizes isotypic to the tysonite structure type in the trigonal space group <i>P</i>3̅<i>c</i>1 (No. 165, <i>hP</i>24, <i>gfda</i>) with lattice parameters <i>a</i> = 7.1510(2), <i>c</i> = 7.3230(4) Å, and <i>V</i> = 324.30(<sup>3</sup>) Å<sup>3</sup>, <i>Z</i> = 6, at <i>T</i> = 100 K, resolving long-standing structure model ambiguities from prior studies based on powder diffraction. Merohedral twinning complicates the diffraction data by simulating the wrong Laue class 6/<i>mmm</i>. Complementary quantum chemical calculations support the findings from this experiment, confirming its local energetic minimum. The inversion center in the crystal structure of UF<sub>3</sub> precludes the previously predicted ferroelectricity.
40167528	Vortioxetine: A Potential Drug for Repurposing for Glioblastoma Treatment via a Microsphere Local Delivery System.	Drug repurposing is an attractive route for finding new therapeutics for brain cancers such as glioblastoma. Local administration of drugs to brain tumors or the postsurgical resection cavity holds promise to deliver a high dose to the target site with minimal off-target effects. Drug delivery systems aim to sustain the release of the drug at the target site but typically exhibit drawbacks such as a poor safety profile, uncontrolled/rapid drug release, or poor control over synthesis parameters/material dimensions. Herein, we analyzed the antidepressant vortioxetine and showed <i>in vitro</i> that it causes a greater loss of viability in glioblastoma cells than it does to normal primary human astrocytes. We developed a new droplet microfluidic-based emulsion method to reproducibly produce vortioxetine-loaded poly(lactic-<i>co</i>-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microspheres with tight size control (36.80 ± 1.96 μm). The drug loading efficiency was around 90% when 9.1% (w/w) drug was loaded into the microspheres, and drug release could be sustained for three to 4 weeks. The vortioxetine microspheres showed robust antiglioblastoma efficacy in both 2D monolayer and 3D spheroid patient-derived glioblastoma cells, highlighting the potential of combining an antidepressant with sustained local delivery as a new therapeutic strategy.
40167475	Ultrathin Cu-Based Porphyrin Metal-Organic Framework Modified with ZnTe Promotes Highly Selective Photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction to CO.	The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into value-added chemical fuels is an effective strategy to address the fossil fuel crisis and global warming. Herein, a novel p-n junction composed of ZnTe nanoparticles and Cu-TCPP nanosheets was successfully constructed for efficient CO<sub>2</sub>-to-CO conversion. Structural and spectroscopic characterization confirmed the establishment of the p-n junction, which enhances charge separation and transfer. The ZnTe/Cu-TCPP composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction with CO as the primary product (120.53 μmol g<sup>-1</sup>), achieving 4.8- and 5.9-fold yield improvements over pristine ZnTe and Cu-TCPP, respectively. DFT calculations revealed a significantly enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption energy (-0.549 eV) on the ZnTe/Cu-TCPP heterojunction, promoting the reaction. In situ DRIFTS analysis confirmed the presence of key intermediates (*COOH, *CH<sub>3</sub>, and *CO), validating their roles in the selective CO<sub>2</sub>-to-CO conversion pathways. A mechanistic study further elucidated the contribution of each component in the reaction process. Additionally, the ZnTe/Cu-TCPP photocatalyst exhibited excellent stability, demonstrating its potential for sustainable CO<sub>2</sub> reduction.
40167386	Can Deep Learning Blind Docking Methods be Used to Predict Allosteric Compounds?	Allosteric compounds offer an alternative mode of inhibition to orthosteric compounds with opportunities for selectivity and noncompetition. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) of allosteric compounds introduces complications compared to their orthosteric counterparts; multiple binding sites of interest are considered, and often allosteric binding is only observed in particular protein conformations. Blind docking methods show potential in virtual screening allosteric ligands, and deep learning methods, such as DiffDock, achieve state-of-the-art performance on protein-ligand complex prediction benchmarks compared to traditional docking methods such as Vina and Lin_F9. To this aim, we explore the utility of a data-driven platform called the minimum distance matrix representation (MDMR) to retrospectively predict recently discovered allosteric inhibitors complexed with Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) 2. In contrast to other protein complex representations, it uses the minimum residue-residue (or residue-ligand) distance as a feature that prioritizes the formation of interactions. Analysis of this representation highlights the variety of protein conformations and ligand binding modes, and we identify an intermediate protein conformation that other heuristic-based kinase conformation classification methods do not distinguish. Next, we design self- and cross-docking benchmarks to assess whether docking methods can predict both orthosteric and allosteric binding modes and if prospective success is conditional on the selection of the protein receptor conformation, respectively. We find that a combined method, DiffDock followed by Lin_F9 Local Re-Docking (DiffDock + LRD), can predict both orthosteric and allosteric binding modes, and the intermediate conformation must be selected to predict the allosteric pose. In summary, this work highlights the value of a data-driven method to explore protein conformations and ligand binding modes and outlines the challenges of SBDD of allosteric compounds.
40167360	MXene-Incorporated Conductive Hydrogel Simulating Myocardial Microenvironment for Cardiac Repair and Functional Recovery.	Myocardial infarction (MI) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating advanced therapeutic strategies to address the resulting electrical disconnection and pathological remodeling. This study developed a conductive hydrogel by covalently cross-linking silk fibroin and hyaluronic acid, integrating MXene nanosheets to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM). Results demonstrated that the incorporation of MXene significantly enhanced the hydrogel's conductivity, with SH-M5 exhibiting the highest conductivity of 0.32 S/m. The SH-M5 hydrogel effectively improved electrical signal transmission and enhanced the recovery of the left ventricular function in myocardial infarction. These findings underscore the transformative role of MXene in enhancing the functional properties of hydrogels for myocardial repair. The conductive hydrogel demonstrated a unique capacity to integrate mechanical reinforcement, electrical conductivity, and biocompatibility, presenting a promising platform for treating myocardial infarction and advancing regenerative medicine.

40167236	A Heterodox Approach for Designing Iron Photosensitizers: Pentacyanoferrate(II) Complexes with Monodentate Bipyridinium/Pyrazinium-Based Acceptor Ligands.	The main obstacle in replacing well-established precious ruthenium photosensitizers with earth-abundant iron analogs is the short excited state lifetimes of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states due to relatively weak octahedral field splitting and relaxation via metal-centered (MC) states. In this study, we address the issue of short lifetime by using pentacyanoferrate(II) complexes and combat facile photodissociation by utilizing positively charged pyrazinium or bipyridinium ligands. We utilize femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy alongside quantum chemical calculations to probe the excited states of three 4,4'-bipyridinium- or pyrazinium-based pentacyanoferrate(II) complexes. The 4,4'-bipyridinium-based complexes exhibit <sup>3</sup>MLCT lifetimes of about 20 ps, while the pyrazinium-based complex exhibits a lifetime of 61 ps in an aqueous solution, setting a benchmark for cyanoferrate complexes. These results mark the foundation for a new group of easy-to-prepare iron photosensitizers that can be used for harvesting visible light.
40167185	Capture of an <i>In Situ</i> Formed Distanna-S-heterocyclic Carbene.	The planar, non-twisted distannene Sn<sub>2</sub>(TIPS)<sub>4</sub> (<b>1</b>, TIPS = Si<sup><i>i</i></sup>Pr<sub>3</sub>) reacts with CS<sub>2</sub> to form a tetrathiaethylene derivative via the dimerization of two S-heterocyclic carbenes (SHCs). These intermediary-formed SHCs can be transferred to palladium as ligands or captured with B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (BCF) and, furthermore, facilitate a new pathway for formation of the stannaethene SHC═Sn(TIPS)<sub>2</sub> by the reaction of <b>1</b> with (PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Pd-CS<sub>2</sub>. In addition to the characterization of the new complexes, theoretical calculations of the frontier orbitals were performed, which indicate a high π-acceptor character of the SHC.
40167167	Targeted Delivery of Acid-Responsive Rutin Nanoparticles Based on Aldehyde Adsorption for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury in Rats.	Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause irreversible nerve damage, imposing a significant burden on both patients and society. Methylprednisolone (MP), the recommended clinical drug, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. It improves nerve damage by inhibiting secondary pathological processes. However, high-dose MP administration may result in side effects, including diabetes, femoral head necrosis, and infections. Therefore, there is a need to identify safer alternatives to mitigate the issues associated with MP administration. Rutin, a natural small molecule, exhibits multifaceted therapeutic capabilities and high biosafety, making it a promising alternative to MP treatment. However, its poor solubility and rapid metabolism limit its <i>in vivo</i> bioavailability. In this study, a drug-free polypeptide (PAH) containing hydrazide groups on the side chains is designed, which can be used for mitigating secondary SCI through scavenging toxic aldehydes. Then, we utilize PAH to encapsulate rutin and develop aldehyde-responsive nanomedicine for intravenous administration in SCI rats, providing a novel approach for the clinical replacement of MP.
40165513	Importance of the Type of Bread: Comparing Uranocene, Bis(Phthalocyaninato)Uranium(IV), and Mixed Uranophthalocyanin-ocene.	Sandwich complexes usually have two similar ligands interacting with the central metal atom. In this work, a mixed sandwich with two different ligands, termed uranophthalocyanin-ocene U(COT)(Pc) (COT = cyclo-octatetraene<sup>2-</sup>; Pc = phthalocyaninato<sup>2-</sup>), has been synthesized from the reaction of UPcCl<sub>2</sub>·LiCl and K<sub>2</sub>COT. The crystal structure is reported, and the variable-temperature solid-state magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm the presence of a U(IV) center. This mixed-sandwich compound was compared to uranocene, U(COT)<sub>2</sub>, and bis(phthalocyaninato)uranium(IV), U(Pc)<sub>2</sub>, using density functional theory (DFT) and computational bonding analysis (ETS-NOCV). The geometrical structures have been optimized using DFT, and the obtained bond lengths are similar to the experimental results. From the energy decomposition analysis (EDA), it is evident that by replacing carbon atoms with nitrogen atoms, i.e., replacing COT with a Pc ligand, the covalent nature of the molecule increases.
40165010	Photodynamic Inactivation of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and Biomolecules by Free and Encapsulated Indium(III) Phthalocyanines in PHB Nanoparticles: The Influence of the Position of the Coumarin Group.	Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) is a promising alternative to inactivating resistant microorganisms. Metallic phthalocyanines (Pc) substituted with coumarin groups exhibit favorable photophysical properties for APDT; however, their hydrophobicity limits administration. This study investigates indium(III) Pc substituted with 7-oxy-3-(3',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)coumarin at nonperipheral (<b>3nInOAc</b>) and peripheral (<b>4nInOAc</b>) positions, both in their free form and encapsulated in polyhydroxybutyrate nanoparticles, for the photodynamic inactivation of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MSSA) bacteria. The photodynamic activity was also assessed through the photooxidation of tryptophan and bovine serum albumin. Theoretical calculations and molecular docking were performed to corroborate the experimental results, investigating the influence of molecular structure on the photodynamic and antimicrobial performance of Pc-loaded nanoparticles as well as their nanoparticulate properties. Overall, both free and encapsulated Pc were capable of photooxidizing biomolecules and exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity, with <b>4nInOAc</b> demonstrating superior efficacy, achieving an average reduction of 2 logs (99%) in MSSA and MRSA colonies.
40163903	Development of Thermostable and Immunogenic Block Copolymer Nanoparticles (BNPs) for mRNA Delivery.	Combining an amphiphilic block copolymer polybutadiene-<i>b</i>-poly(ethylene glycol) (PBD-<i>b</i>-PEO), an ionizable lipid, a helper lipid, and cholesterol produces thermostable BNPs. Luciferase mRNA-BNPs can be stored for over 1 year at 4 °C with no evidence of degradation to the mRNA or nanocarrier. In vivo, mRNA-BNPs exhibit a greater affinity for secondary lymphoid organs than mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and are efficiently taken up by macrophages and dendritic cells. Freshly fabricated ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA-BNPs elicit robust OVA-specific IgG and functional memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that persist for at least 5 months. Immunogenicity remains intact after 24 weeks of storage at 4 °C. Anti-PEG antibodies are not boosted by the repeated administration of mRNA-BNPs, unlike mRNA-LNPs. Syrian hamsters vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA-BNPs are protected against weight loss associated with infection and potently suppress pulmonary viral loads. Protective efficacy is comparable to that conferred by a Comirnaty biosimilar. Cumulatively, mRNA-BNPs are thermostable, immunogenic and possess the potential for clinical application.
40163897	Estimation of Absolute Binding Free Energies for Drugs That Bind Multiple Proteins.	The Gibbs energy of binding (absolute binding free energy, ABFE) of a drug to proteins in the body determines the drug's affinity to its molecular target and its selectivity. ABFE is challenging to measure, and experimental values are not available for many proteins together with potential drugs and other molecules that bind them. Accurate means of calculating such values are, therefore, highly in demand. Realizing that toxicity and side effects are closely related to off-target binding, here we calculate the ABFE of two drugs, each to multiple proteins, in order to examine whether it is possible to carry out such calculations and achieve the required accuracy. The methods that were used were free energy perturbation with replica exchange molecular dynamics (FEP/REMD) and density functional theory (DFT) with a cluster approach and a simplified model. DFT calculations were supplemented with energy decomposition analysis (EDA). The accuracy of each method is discussed, and suggestions are made for the approach toward better ABFE calculations.
40163893	Catalytic Hydroformylation of Alkenes to Branched Aldehydes by Triphenylphosphine-Based Porous Organic Polymer-Anchored Rhodium Cluster Catalysts.	Hydroformylation of alkenes to high-value-added aldehydes is one of the most important processes in the chemical industry. The use of heterogeneous hydroformylation catalysts encounters substantial challenges including low catalyst activity and stability as well as difficulties in achieving high selectivity for branched aldehydes. In this work, a porous organic polymer (POP) system with embedded triphenylphosphine ligands was prepared, and through impregnation, reduction, and anchoring, rhodium was immobilized on the PPh<sub>3</sub>-p-Ph<sub>4</sub> material as rhodium clusters. Triphenylphosphine exerts significant steric hindrance toward selective alkene hydroformylation, and using water as a solvent also demonstrated pronounced electronic effects, resulting in a high selectivity toward branched aldehydes with a branched-to-linear ratio of more than ten. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the reaction to the branched aldehydes follows pathways with lower reaction energy, thus achieving a high selectivity and yield (95.4%) of branched products. Importantly, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused while maintaining its activity and selectivity over five cycles without significant losses. The utilization of triphenylphosphine ligands for the preparation of POP supports for rhodium catalysts not only enables the heterogenization of homogeneous complex catalysts but also presents novel ideas and methodologies for future research on alkene hydroformylation to produce branched aldehydes.
40163594	Modulation of Electrocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Performance by β,β'-Functionalization of Ni(II) Porphyrins.	In this work, we present a methodology for modulating the HER and OER catalytic activities of nickel porphyrins by β,β'-modification. The syntheses of Ni2 with fused butano ring porphyrin and Ni3 with fused benzo porphyrin were achieved. The catalytic performance of Ni2 was found to be excellent for HER, while Ni3 exhibited superior performance for the OER. The present study demonstrates that the β,β-modification of porphyrins has a significant impact on the reactivity of the metal active site. The results provide new insights into the modulation of the HER and the OER properties by fine-tuning the electronic structure of porphyrins.
40163533	Azobenzene-Grafted Acrylate Coatings to Modulate Lens Epithelial Cells.	Polymeric intraocular lenses (IOLs) are prosthetics used to replace cataracts to restore vision. However, in 20% or more of cases, lens epithelial cells (LECs) remaining after surgery migrate along the IOL and posterior capsule, causing new vision anomalies, termed posterior capsule opacification (PCO). The surface of the polymeric IOL is identified as a leading factor for the development of their failure, and we hypothesize that specialized coatings could mitigate or prevent these failures. Azobenzene was grafted to coatings made of poly(methacrylic acid-<i>co</i>-isodecyl acrylate) (MAAcoIDA) and poly(methyl methacrylate-<i>co</i>-isodecyl acrylate) (MMcoIDA) to produce a library of acrylic coatings. The azobenzene on the surface of these coatings could reversibly photoisomerize with 365 nm light and complex with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). Human LEC cell line, B3-LECs, grown on these coatings had modulated protein and gene expression, with lower α-smooth muscle actin protein expression and inflammatory interleukin 6 gene expression in cells incubated on all of the variations of MMcoIDA compared to MAAcoIDA. Azobenzene modifications with and without UV and β-CD treatment also modulated cell behavior where cells on azobenzene-modified MAAcoIDA had decreased live/dead ratios after UV treatments, a potential method to reduce LEC viability. The cells on β-CD-treated azobenzene-modified MAAcoIDA had differences in cell adhesion after UV treatments, illustrating that UV light can be applied to modulate cell behavior in conjunction with β-CD. The different coatings present methods to modulate LEC adhesion, death, and behavior, temporarily when dependent on UV treatments.
40162722	Functional Models for the Dioxygen-Activating Cu(II)-2,4-QueD Enzymes: Incorporation of Diimine Coligands in Copper(II)-Flavonolate Complexes Enhances and Tunes the Dioxygenation Reactivity.	Five copper(II)-flavonolate complexes [Cu(diimine)(fla)](ClO<sub>4</sub>) <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>, where diimines are 2,2'-bipyridine (<b>1</b>), 1,10-phenanthroline (<b>2</b>), 5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (<b>3</b>), 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (<b>4</b>), and dipyrido[3,2-d:2',3'-<i>f</i>]-quinoxaline (<b>5</b>), and H(fla) is 3-hydroxyflavonone, have been prepared and studied as functional models for Cu(II) quercetin 2,4-dioxygenase. The complex <b>1</b> is monomeric, while <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are centrosymmetric dimers (EPR: Δ<i>M</i><sub>s</sub>, ±2, 1600 G), all containing a square pyramidal CuN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>O' coordination sphere (τ: <b>1</b>, 0.09; <b>2</b>, 0.10; <b>3</b>, 0.13). In DMF solution, all of the Cu(II)-flavonolate adducts decompose at 80 °C, upon exposure to pure dioxygen, to produce CO and depside, which is hydrolyzed to give the corresponding acids. The dioxygenase reactivities of the adducts are much higher than those of the model complexes reported so far, and the rates vary as <b>1</b> (<i>k</i><sub>O2</sub>: 1, 6.13 ± 0.02) <b>< 2</b> (1.80 ± 0.02) <b>< 3</b> (8.39 ± 0.01) <b>> 4</b> (2.87 ± 0.03) <b>> 5</b> (3.81 ± 0.01 M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The decreased π-backbonding of bpy (<b>1</b>) and 5,6-dmp (<b>3</b>) with Cu(II) enhances the π-backbonding of the antibonding π*-orbitals of conjugated C═O of fla<sup>-</sup> with Cu(II), causing an increase in their reactivity toward O<sub>2</sub>. The X-ray structures and DFT, FT-IR, and EPR spectral studies of the model complexes support the presence of the π-backbonding.
40162566	Copper Nanoparticle Decorated Multilayer Nanocoatings for Controlled Nitric Oxide Release and Antimicrobial Performance with Biosafety.	Biomedical device-related bacterial infections are a leading cause of mortality, and traditional antibiotics contribute to resistance. Various surface modification strategies have been explored, but effective clinical solutions remain limited. This study introduces a novel antibacterial nanocoating with copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) that triggers localized nitric oxide (NO) release. The multilayered nanocoating is created using branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) via a Layer-by-Layer assembly method. CuNP-decorated nanocoatings are formed by reducing copper ions coordinated with amine/carboxylic acid groups. In a physiological environment, CuNPs oxidize to Cu(I), promoting NO release from endogenous NO donors. The nanocoating's thickness is adjustable to regulate amount of CuNPs and NO flux. The optimal thickness for effective NO release against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is identified, preventing microbial adhesion and biofilm formation. Importantly, the coating remains cytocompatible due to minimal CuNPs, physiological NO levels, and stable coating properties under physiological conditions.
40160156	Lactobacillus complex fermentation of whey protein to reduce foodborne allergy symptoms in mice.	Bovine whey protein, a common ingredient in foods for infants and young children, represents the primary source of nutrition for this demographic. However, bovine whey protein contains β-lactoglobulin (β-LG), which is not found in human whey protein, and some α-lactalbumin (α-LA) with a different amino acid sequence, which has the potential to cause allergic reactions. Eating bovine whey protein can cause allergic reactions in the human immune system. This phenomenon refers to an allergy to bovine whey protein. It is estimated that this condition affects 1.9% to 4.9% of infants globally. <i>Lactobacilli</i> possess a robust protein hydrolysis system capable of disrupting epitopes associated with whey protein allergies while yielding hydrolyzed products and bioactive peptides. This process represents a safe and effective approach to reducing the allergenicity of milk. Consequently, we established a mouse model for whey protein allergy and evaluated the effects of fermented whey protein produced by <i>Lactobacillus</i> on allergic symptoms in mice using ELISA, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and HE staining techniques. Furthermore, we analyzed the intestinal flora of allergic mice through 16S rDNA sequencing to elucidate the relationship between <i>Lactobacillus</i>-mediated alterations in gut microbiota and allergic phenotypes within this study. The results showed that compared with the whey protein group, the levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), histamine and mast cell protease in the serum of mice in the lactic acid bacteria fermented whey protein group were significantly increased, and the secretion of T helper 2 (Th2) type cytokines was inhibited, the production of T helper 1 (Th1) type cytokines was promoted, and the inflammation caused by sensitized mice was significantly alleviated. Furthermore, the fermentation of whey protein by <i>Lactobacillus</i> resulted in an improvement in the intestinal flora of mice, accompanied by promotion of the growth of probiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>. This effectively alleviated the allergic reaction in mice. The findings of this experiment provide a theoretical basis for the development of hypoallergenic dairy products and offer a certain degree of guidance for the clinical treatment of allergic diseases.
40159995	Algorithm in chemistry: molecular logic gate-based data protection.	Data security is crucial for safeguarding the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of documents, currency, merchant labels, and other paper-based assets, which sequentially has a profound impact on personal privacy and even national security. High-security-level logic data protection paradigms are typically limited to software (digital circuits) and rarely applied to physical devices using stimuli-responsive materials (SRMs). The main reason is that most SRMs lack programmable and controllable switching behaviors. Traditional SRMs usually produce static, singular, and highly predictable signals in response to stimuli, restricting them to simple "BUFFER" or "INVERT" logic operations with a low security level. However, recent advancements in SRMs have collectively enabled dynamic, multidimensional, and less predictable output signals under external stimuli. This breakthrough paves the way for sophisticated encryption and anti-counterfeiting hardware based on SRMs with complicated logic operations and algorithms. This review focuses on SRM-based data protection, emphasizing the integration of intricate logic and algorithms in SRM-constructed hardware, rather than chemical or material structural evolutions. It also discusses current challenges and explores the future directions of the field-such as combining SRMs with artificial intelligence (AI). This review fills a gap in the existing literature and represents a pioneering step into the uncharted territory of SRM-based encryption and anti-counterfeiting technologies.
40159912	<i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> immune-enhancing effects of punicic acid and the action mechanisms as revealed <i>via</i> microbiome and lipid profiling.	Punicic acid (PA) is a chief component of pomegranate seed oil with several health benefits. In this study, the <i>in vitro</i> immunomodulatory activity of PA was assessed using RAW264.7 cells, revealing that PA activated the macrophages, facilitated the concentration of immune-related cytokines and enzymes, and regulated the immune-related NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Further, the <i>in vivo</i> immune-enhancing effect of PA was evaluated with the cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immune-compromised mouse model with 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and relative quantification of lipidome. Results indicated that high doses of PA (200 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) remarkably restored CTX-induced immune injury by enhancing the innate and adaptive immunity to stimulate the secretion of immune-related factors. In addition, PA improved gut microbiota dysbiosis and ameliorated lipid metabolism disorders. Our research provides a theoretical basis for the exploitation of PA as a functional component with immune-enhancing effects and adds to the potential health uses of pomegranate seed oil.
40159904	Identification, targeted separation, and <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> anti-vascular endothelial injury abilities of bioactive compounds from <i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i>.	<i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i> (Rupr. et Maxim.) Harms, a traditional medicinal and edible crop cultivated in China, exhibits extensive biological activities. In the present research, a screening and targeted isolation method using affinity ultrafiltration-UPLC-MS with GNPS (AUF-LC-MS-GNPS) methods was established and used to further verify the protective effect and potential mechanism of monomers on a vascular endothelial injury model. By utilizing the AUF-LC-MS-GNPS strategy, 9 potential active monomers were target isolated and 22 other compounds were obtained from <i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i>. The anti-endothelial injury activity of the monomers was further verified through <i>in vitro</i> cell experiments, which showed that the 9 monomers had protective effects on HUVECs damaged by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), and could increase the levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) while reducing the level of endothelin (ET)-1. Furthermore, an <i>in vivo</i> zebrafish experiment against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) damage proved the protective effects of the isolated monomers. Our research established a bioactive screening and targeted separation method by comprehensively utilizing an AUF, LC-MS and GNPS network. Concurrently, <i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i> may be a natural source of bioactive components, as well as possessing anti-endothelial injury activity.
40159647	Drug-Target Affinity Prediction Based on Topological Enhanced Graph Neural Networks.	Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in drug-target affinity (DTA) analysis, reducing the cost of drug development. Unlike traditional one-dimensional (1D) sequence-based methods, GNNs leverage graph structures to capture richer protein and drug features, leading to improved DTA prediction performance. However, existing methods often neglect to incorporate valuable protein cavity information, a key aspect of protein physical chemistry. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel topology-enhanced GNN for DTA prediction that integrates protein pocket data. Additionally, we optimize training and message-passing strategies to enhance the model's feature representation capabilities. Our model's effectiveness is validated on the Davis and KIBA data sets, demonstrating its ability to capture the intricate interplay between drugs and targets. The source code is publicly available on https://github.com/ZZDXgangwu/DTA.
40159639	Unveiling the Curvature Effect on the Activity of MoSe<sub>2</sub> for Piezo-Photocatalytic C-N Coupling of Benzylamine.	During the piezoelectric photocatalytic process, the surface curvature of the piezoelectric photocatalyst undergoes dynamic changes under the influence of external mechanical forces. However, the correlation between the surface curvature and catalytic performance remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that decreasing the radius of curvature of MoSe<sub>2</sub> significantly enhances its piezoelectric-photocatalytic activity for C-N coupling reactions, enabling imine synthesis from benzylamine. Comprehensive characterization and DFT calculations together show that the piezoelectric effect in the curved MoSe<sub>2</sub> structure inhibits photogenerated charge carriers from recombination, improving carrier utilization efficiency. Additionally, the surface curvature effect induced by ultrasonic driving reduces the band gap. It promotes the effective transfer of electrons from Mo atoms in MoSe<sub>2</sub> to -NH<sub>2</sub> in benzylamine, thereby facilitating the activation of the benzylamine molecule. As a result, the synergistic effects of the piezoelectric and curvature characteristics significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance of MoSe<sub>2</sub> toward the C-N coupling of benzylamine. This study not only provides new insights into interfacial reaction mechanisms in piezoelectric photocatalysis but also offers a novel perspective for designing high-performance catalytic systems.
40159092	Critical Assessment of RNA and DNA Structure Predictions via Artificial Intelligence: The Imitation Game.	Computational predictions of biomolecular structure via artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches, as exemplified by AlphaFold software, have the potential to model of all life's biomolecules. We performed oligonucleotide structure prediction and gauged the accuracy of the AI-generated models via their agreement with experimental solution-state observables. We find parts of these models in good agreement with experimental data, and others falling short of the ground truth. The latter include internal or capping loops, noncanonical base pairings, and regions involving conformational flexibility, all essential for RNA folding, interactions, and function. We estimate root-mean-square (r.m.s.) errors in predicted nucleotide bond vector orientations ranging between 7° and 30°, with higher accuracies for simpler architectures of individual canonically paired helical stems. These mixed results highlight the necessity of experimental validation of AI-based oligonucleotide model predictions and their current tendency to mimic the training data set rather than reproduce the underlying reality.
40156577	High diversity of nitrifying bacteria and archaea in biofilms from a subsea tunnel.	Microbial biofilm formation can contribute to the accelerated deterioration of steel-reinforced concrete structures and significantly impact their service life, making it critical to understand the diversity of the biofilm community and prevailing processes in these habitats. Here, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomics sequencing data to study the abundance and diversity of nitrifiers within biofilms on the concrete surface of the Oslofjord subsea road tunnel in Norway. We showed that the abundance of nitrifiers varied greatly in time and space, with a mean abundance of 24.7 ± 15% but a wide range between 1.2% and 61.4%. We hypothesize that niche differentiation allows the coexistence of several nitrifier groups and that their high diversity increases the resilience to fluctuating environmental conditions. Strong correlations were observed between the nitrifying families Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospinaceae, and the iron-oxidizing family Mariprofundaceae. Metagenome-assembled genome analyses suggested that early Mariprofundaceae colonizers may provide a protected environment for nitrifiers in exchange for nitrogen compounds and vitamin B12, but further studies are needed to elucidate the spatial organization of the biofilms and the cooperative and competitive interactions in this environment. Together, this research provides novel insights into the diverse communities of nitrifiers living within biofilms on concrete surfaces and establishes a foundation for future experimental studies of concrete biofilms.
40156545	Impact of Molecular Distortions on Bistability in Spin Crossover Complexes.	We present a simple model of molecular distortions in spin crossover complexes, based on crystal field theory and transition state theory. This allows us to model the effects of molecular distortions on <i>T</i><sub>1/2</sub>, the characteristic temperature of thermal crossover, and <i>T</i><sub>LIESST</sub>, the maximum temperature at which trapped excited high spin (HS) complexes are stable. <i>T</i><sub>1/2</sub> is a purely thermodynamic quantity, determined by the relative free energies of the HS and low spin (LS) states (Δ<i>G</i> = <i>G</i><sub>HS</sub> - <i>G</i><sub>LS</sub>). The average distortion across HS and LS species <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>[</mo><mover><mi>Σ</mi><mo>¯</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>Σ</mi><mrow><mi>H</mi><mi>S</mi></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>Σ</mi><mrow><mi>L</mi><mi>S</mi></mrow></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>]</mo></math> and the change in distortion between spin states (ΔΣ = Σ<sub>HS</sub> - Σ<sub>LS</sub>) have a significant impact on Δ<i>G</i>. However, the inner coordination sphere stiffness (<i>k</i>) has little impact on Δ<i>G</i>. Therefore, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mover><mi>Σ</mi><mo>¯</mo></mover></math> and ΔΣ have large effects on <i>T</i><sub>1/2</sub> whereas <i>k</i> does not. <i>T</i><sub>LIESST</sub> is largely determined by the height of the barrier (<i>E</i><sub>b</sub>) between the metastable HS state and the LS state. <i>E</i><sub>b</sub> is strongly affected by ΔΣ, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mover><mi>Σ</mi><mo>¯</mo></mover></math>, and <i>k</i>; thus <i>T</i><sub>LIESST</sub> is strongly dependent on all of these quantities. Thus, increasing both the relative and absolute distortion of SCO complexes increases <i>T</i><sub>LIESST</sub> and decreases <i>T</i><sub>1/2</sub>, providing a route to high temperature spin-state switching via molecular distortions.
40156541	Synergistic Effect of Topological Semimetal TiSi and Plasmonic Cu for Enhanced Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting of TiO<sub>2</sub> Nanorod Array.	Developing high-efficiency and low-cost catalysts for PEC water splitting is vital for solving the issues of energy consumption, environmental pollution, and global warming. In this study, we designed and prepared a composite photoanode TiO<sub>2</sub>/TiSi/Cu by depositing a topological semimetal TiSi film and plasmonic Cu nanoparticles onto a TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod array. Due to the synergistic effect of the topological bands of TiSi and the SPR effect of Cu, TiO<sub>2</sub>/TiSi/Cu exhibits significantly enhanced optical absorption in the visible-light region. Under wavelength (λ) > 420 nm light irradiation, the photocurrent density of TiO<sub>2</sub>/TiSi/Cu reaches 4.46 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.9 V vs RHE, about 17.84 times that of pure TiO<sub>2</sub>. The carrier lifetime is prolonged from 25.04 ns for pure TiO<sub>2</sub> to 31.13 ns for TiO<sub>2</sub>/TiSi/Cu. Furthermore, the TiO<sub>2</sub>/TiSi/Cu photoanode demonstrates good long-term cyclic stability, with an average hydrogen production rate of 8.12 μmol cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Our results indicate that the synergistic effect of topological semimetal TiSi and plasmonic Cu is an effective strategy to enhance the PEC performance of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This approach could be applied to other topological catalysts, providing new opportunities for developing novel and efficient catalysts.
40156540	MOF Etching-Induced NiCo-Embedded Hollow N-Doped Carbon Nanocube for Enhanced Ratiometric Molecularly Imprinted Electrochemical Sensing of Carbendazim.	Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon materials are commonly used as sensing materials, but their limited accessibility to active sites and specific surface area restrict their applications. In this study, we proposed a simple method involving facile tannic acid etching and calcination to create NiCo-embedded hollow N-doped carbon nanocubes (NiCo@HNC) using MOFs as sacrificial templates. The resulting NiCo@HNC material has a large specific surface area, improved mass transport channels, and enhanced exposure of electroactive sites due to its unique hollow structure and high porosity, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, with the utilization of NiCo@HNC as a substrate material and dopamine as a functional monomer, a ratiometric molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor was developed for the selective and sensitive detection of carbendazim (CBZ). This sensor demonstrated a wide linear range of 0.0003-10 μM and a low detection limit of 0.1 nM. In addition, the sensor was utilized for the accurate quantification of CBZ in actual carrot/strawberry samples with a recovery range of 96.0-103.0%, indicating its potential for practical application.
40156537	Tailoring of Unsaturated Metal Sites in Metal-Organic Frameworks to Promote the Conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into High-Value-Added Products.	Well-defined metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) provide an attractive platform for catalysis. Understanding the intrinsic structure-activity relationship of MOFs helps guide the design of novel catalysts. In this work, a new three-dimensional (3D) Mn<sup>II</sup>(salen)-based MOF (<b>1</b>) with strong adsorption capacity and high selectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> was synthesized. Through sequential demetallization and remetallization, the flexible tailoring of the metal centers was realized to obtain a series of remetallized MOFs (<b>r1</b><sup><b>M</b></sup>; M = Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, V). Among them, <b>r1</b><sup><b>Co</b></sup> was proved to be the most active catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO<sub>2</sub> and epoxides. Mechanistic studies reveal that <b>r1</b><sup><b>Co</b></sup> displays a high CO<sub>2</sub> affinity and Lewis acidity. In addition, kinetic studies suggest that <b>r1</b><sup><b>Co</b></sup> has a lower activation energy than the original MOF (<b>1</b>) and demetallized MOF (<b>d1</b>). Remarkably, <b>r1</b><sup><b>Co</b></sup> could be reused five times without affecting its catalytic activity.
40156535	Modulation of S and N Active Sites for Coordination Polymers to Achieve Enhanced Hg<sup>2+</sup> Sensing Performances.	It is challenging and vital to develop coordination polymers (CPs) with an outstanding sensing performance. In this work, CP-based sensors with active S and N sites are first exploited. Three new Cu-CPs [Cu(<b>L</b>)(SCN)<sub>2</sub>·2DMF]<sub>n</sub> (<b>1</b>), [Cu(<b>L</b>)(SCN)·2DMF]<sub>n</sub> (<b>2</b>), and [Cu(<b>L</b>)(CN)·2DMF]<sub>n</sub> (<b>3</b>) were successfully synthesized by 9,10-bis(di(pyrimidin-5-yl)methylene)-9,10-dihydroanthracene (<b>L</b>) and SCN<sup>-</sup>/CN<sup>-</sup> ligands. <b>1</b> demonstrates a 1D wavelike chain, fabricated by <b>L</b> bridges linking with Cu(SCN)<sub>2</sub> units. <b>2</b> exhibits a 2D (3,3)-connected network fabricated by SCN<sup>-</sup>, 3-connected <b>L</b>, and Cu units. <b>3</b> exhibits a 3D framework, built by 4-connected Cu centers, CN<sup>-</sup>, and <b>L</b> bridges. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> have good water, pH, and thermal stabilities. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> have uncoordinated S and N active sites and can detect Hg<sup>2+</sup> through the fluorescence enhancing ("turn-on") effect. Meanwhile, <b>3</b> only has uncoordinated N active sites and shows a negative Hg<sup>2+</sup> sensing ability. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> have ultrahigh Hg<sup>2+</sup> sensing sensitivity and selectivity. The K<sub>SV</sub> and LOD of <b>1</b> toward Hg<sup>2+</sup> are about 3 and 5 times superior to those of <b>2</b>, separately. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> represent the first S- and N-rich CP-based sensors and exhibit an excellent "turn-on" Hg<sup>2+</sup> sensing capacity. Their "turn-on" Hg<sup>2+</sup> sensing mechanism and difference sensing performances are discussed in detail.
40156520	Optimizing On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling for Complex RNA Systems: Sampling Free Energy Surfaces of an H-Type Pseudoknot.	All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer crucial insights into biomolecular dynamics, but inherent time scale constraints often limit their effectiveness. Advanced sampling techniques help overcome these limitations, enabling predictions of deeply rugged folding free energy surfaces (FES) of RNA at atomistic resolution. The Multithermal-Multiumbrella On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (MM-OPES) method, which combines temperature and collective variables (CVs) to accelerate sampling, has shown promise and cost-effectiveness. However, the applications have so far been limited to simpler RNA systems, such as stem-loops. In this study, we optimized the MM-OPES method to explore the FES of an H-type RNA pseudoknot, a more complex fundamental RNA folding unit. Through systematic exploration of CV combinations and temperature ranges, we identified an optimal strategy for both sampling and analysis. Our findings demonstrate that treating the native-like contacts in two stems as independent CVs and using a temperature range of 300-480 K provides the most effective sampling, while projections onto native Watson-Crick-type hydrogen bond CVs yield the best resolution FES prediction. Additionally, our sampling scheme also revealed various folding/unfolding pathways. This study provides practical insights and detailed decision-making strategies for adopting the MM-OPES method, facilitating its application to complex RNA structures at atomistic resolution.
40156514	SWEET Family Transporters Act as Water-Conducting Carrier Proteins in Plants.	Dedicated water channels are involved in the facilitated diffusion of water molecules across cell membranes in plants. Transporter proteins are also known to transport water molecules along with substrates; however, the molecular mechanism of water permeation is not well understood in plant transporters. Here, we show that plant sugar transporters from the SWEET (<b>s</b>ugar <b>w</b>ill <b>e</b>ventually be <b>e</b>xported <b>t</b>ransporter) family act as water-conducting carrier proteins via a variety of passive and active mechanisms that allow the diffusion of water molecules from one side of the membrane to the other. This study provides a molecular perspective on how plant membrane transporters act as water carrier proteins, a topic that has not been extensively explored in the literature. Water permeation in membrane transporters could occur via four distinct mechanisms, which form our hypothesis for water transport in SWEETs. These hypotheses are tested using molecular dynamics simulations of the outward-facing, occluded, and inward-facing states of AtSWEET1 to identify the water permeation pathways and the flux associated with them. The hydrophobic gates at the center of the transport tunnel act as barriers that restrict water permeation. We have performed in silico single and double mutations of the hydrophobic gate residues to examine the changes in water conductivity. Surprisingly, the double mutant allows water permeation to the intracellular half of the membrane and forms a continuous water channel. These computational results are validated by experimentally examining the transport of hydrogen peroxide molecules by the AtSWEET family of transporters. We have also shown that the transport of hydrogen peroxide follows a mechanism similar to that of water transport in AtSWEET1. Finally, we conclude that similar water-conduction states are also present in other SWEETs due to the high degree of sequence and structural conservation exhibited by this transporter family.
40155357	Zirconium Metal-Organic Frameworks as Micromotors with Enzyme-like Activity for Glutathione Detection.	Herein, we report a novel UiO-67-Co(bpy)<sub>0.35</sub> micromotor synthesized by a facile postsynthesis metalation via introducing cobalt salts ligated with 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'dicarboxylic acid into UiO-67-bpy<sub>0.35</sub> framework. The Co<sup>2+</sup> active sites can decompose H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to generate bubbles to power UiO-67-Co(bpy)<sub>0.35</sub>. Meanwhile, the UiO-67-Co(bpy)<sub>0.35</sub> micromotor exhibits robust peroxidase-like activity through catalyzing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to generate <sup>•</sup>OH under neutral conditions. Based on this, a sensing platform was constructed for the colorimetric detection of GSH. Due to the synergy of self-driven motion and excellent peroxide-like activity, UiO-67-Co(bpy)<sub>0.35</sub> micromotor can sensitively detect GSH with a low analytic limitation as 0.13 μM for GSH detection. This study provides a new sight of using the postsynthesis metalation method to prepare Zr(Co)-MOF micromotor for highly selective, sensitive, and facile detection of GSH.
40153942	The physical origin of electric polarizations in two dimensional ferroelectric monolayer materials.	Over the past decade, a new class of ferroelectric materials with atomic-level thickness, particularly monolayer materials, has been predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally. These two-dimensional ferroelectric materials, especially those exhibiting finite out-of-plane (OOP) polarizations, have garnered significant attention in both condensed matter physics and materials science. On one hand, they offer promising avenues for the miniaturization of ferroelectric devices. On the other hand, they reveal novel physical mechanisms that go beyond those found in conventional bulk ferroelectrics, enabling the emergence of OOP polarization under depolarization fields. Recent studies have identified various mechanisms capable of generating OOP polarization in monolayers, a phenomenon previously considered unlikely in traditional bulk materials like ferroelectric perovskites. This review article highlights the recent advancements in understanding two-dimensional ferroelectricity in monolayer candidates. We focus primarily on the exploration of these unique mechanisms, as investigated and rationalized in recent years. Furthermore, we discuss the promising prospects in this emerging field of ferroelectricity and the bright future of two-dimensional monolayer materials.
40153735	Oxygen Atom Migration in Ni<sub>2</sub>P/TiO<sub>2</sub> Heterostructures Dynamically Regulates the Electrocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction Pathway.	Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are widely applied in electrocatalytic reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their excellent physicochemical properties. However, when utilized in CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reactions, severe hydrogen evolution limits the activation of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules. In this study, oxygen atoms were successfully migrated from TiO<sub>2</sub> into Ni<sub>2</sub>P nanoparticles through a simple impregnation and low-temperature phosphidation process, constructing an O-Ni<sub>2</sub>P/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowire array electrode that modulates the surface electronic structure, inhibits hydrogen evolution, and promotes CO<sub>2</sub> activation. At a potential of -0.4 V (vs RHE), the CH<sub>4</sub> production rate reached 1.46 μmol·h<sup>-1</sup>·cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a Faraday efficiency of 11.8%, and maintained long-term stability during the 36-h electrocatalytic process. <i>In situ</i> infrared spectroscopy revealed that CO* and CH<sub>3</sub>* intermediates are easily formed on the surface of the material, which are key intermediates directly related to the CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub>. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the oxygen-doped Ni<sub>2</sub>P surface has a lower barrier for the formation of CHO*, thereby facilitating the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub>.
40153544	<i>Ganoderma lucidum</i> Polysaccharide/carboxymethyl Chitosan Hydrogels Modulate Macrophage Polarization for Wound Healing.	Wound healing remains a global challenge for clinical and experimental research. Hydrogels prepared from natural polysaccharides show great potential in the wound healing process. In this study, novel hydrogels (G-GLP) were prepared using oxidized <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i> polysaccharides (OGLPs) and carboxymethyl chitosan via the Schiff base reaction, which did not require the addition of any chemical cross-linking agent. The hydrogels showed excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Moreover, the hydrogels showed superior hemostatic performance in mouse liver trauma and tail amputation models. Importantly, G-GLP improved inflammation by promoting the polarization of the macrophage M2 subtype, inhibiting the M1 subtype and reducing intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. In vivo experiments demonstrated that G-GLP accelerated healing in a total defect wound model by reducing inflammation and promoting blood vessel repair and collagen deposition. These results demonstrate that G-GLP has potential as an effective wound repair dressing.
40152779	Double-Decker Ferrocene Analogue Derived from Flexible 14π Triphyrin(2.1.1) along with an Unusual Diels-Alder Adduct: Synthesis, Characterization, and Mechanistic Studies.	14π-Triphyrin(2.1.1) is used to synthesize a double-decker sandwich complex like ferrocene. The presence of only two meso-CF<sub>3</sub> substituents provides the macrocycle with enough flexibility to undergo bowl-shaped deformation in order to complex with Fe(II) ions, forming a low-spin diamagnetic complex. Further, the Cp ligand of the metal carrier [{Fe(CO)<sub>2</sub>(Cp)}<sub>2</sub>] forms a Diels-Alder adduct with the triphyrin macrocycle at higher temperatures, which does not undergo complexation. The plausible role of factors behind the formation of sandwich complexes in [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) was explored using first-principles molecular dynamics.
40152775	Prediction of Chromatographic Retention Time of a Small Molecule from SMILES Representation Using a Hybrid Transformer-LSTM Model.	Accurate retention time (RT) prediction in liquid chromatography remains a significant consideration in molecular analysis. In this study, we explore the use of a transformer-based language model to predict RTs by treating simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) sequences as textual input, an approach that has not been previously utilized in this field. Our architecture combines a pretrained RoBERTa (robustly optimized BERT approach, a variant of BERT) with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks to predict retention times in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The METLIN small molecule retention time (SMRT) data set comprising 77,980 small molecules after preprocessing, was encoded using SMILES notation and processed through a tokenizer to enable molecular representation as sequential data. The proposed transformer-LSTM architecture incorporates layer fusion from multiple transformer layers and bidirectional sequence processing, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 26.23 s, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.25%, and <i>R</i>-squared (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) value of 0.91. The model's explainability was demonstrated through attention visualization, revealing its focus on key molecular features that can influence RT. Furthermore, we evaluated the model's transfer learning capabilities across ten data sets from the PredRet database, demonstrating robust performance across different chromatographic conditions with consistent improvement over previous approaches. Our results suggest that the hybrid model presents a valuable approach for predicting RT in liquid chromatography, with potential applications in metabolomics and small molecule analysis.
40152418	Engineered Assemblies from Constitutionally Isomeric Peptides Modulate Antimicrobial Activity.	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of peptides consisting of cationic amino acid residues and a hydrophobic segment, which have been used as an alternative to antibiotics in treating multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, the relationship among the molecular design, assembled structures, and resultant efficacy remains elusive. Herein, we report a class of constitutionally isomeric AMPs assembled into filaments with similar dimensions. Spectroscopic characterizations demonstrated that subtle changes in the position of amino acids led to dramatic variations in molecular packing and surface charges, which were verified by molecular dynamics simulations. In vitro antibacterial assays showed that all AMPs exerted antibacterial activity against Gram-positive methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), but the efficacy was dependent on the molecular design. Given the good biocompatibility to eukaryotic cells, these AMPs could be potentially used as antibacterial agents. We believe that this finding provides an avenue to tune the bioactivity of AMPs by rational molecular design.
40152229	Carbon-dot growth on nanoconvex carbon wires for outstanding optical properties.	The appearance of carbon spheres, chemical nanostructures, and physical spheres on the surface of carbon wires demonstrates the ability to overcome the optical weaknesses of carbon wires. Carbon dots (CDs) present far superior advantages over these structures in terms of excellent optical properties, and the transfer of these advantages from CDs to carbon wires would improve the specificity of the optical properties of carbon wires, but has been challenging to date. Here, a novel strategy for the fabrication of CDs on nanoconvex carbon wires is developed by pre-treating a Si substrate with oxidation and nitrogen, depositing nanoconvex PAN wires on the pre-treated Si substrate with electro-hydrodynamic jetting, and subsequently implementing stabilization and carbonization. We find that this strategy exhibits the unexpected ability to form CDs on nanoconvex carbon wires and transform these CDs from being dispersed to being connected together by control over both their quantity and dispersion. Our results demonstrate the presence of two types of CDs - wire-broken CDs and continuous carbon-wire-surfaced CDs. The ability of the carbon wires based on these new CDs to show outstanding optical signals in Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra, creates an opportunity for research into novel physics and optical devices that have not previously been possible.
40152222	Fitting Atomic Structures into Cryo-EM Maps by Coupling Deep Learning-Enhanced Map Processing with Global-Local Optimization.	With the breakthroughs in protein structure prediction technology, constructing atomic structures from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps through structural fitting has become increasingly critical. However, the accuracy of the constructed models heavily relies on the precision of the structure-to-map fitting. In this study, we introduce DEMO-EMfit, a progressive method that integrates deep learning-based backbone map extraction with a global-local structural pose search to fit atomic structures into density maps. DEMO-EMfit was extensively evaluated on a benchmark data set comprising both cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and cryo-EM maps of protein and nucleic acid complexes. The results demonstrate that DEMO-EMfit outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, offering an efficient and accurate tool for fitting atomic structures into density maps.
40152095	Lactic acid bacteria target NF-κB signaling to alleviate gastric inflammation.	<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) infection and the resulting gastric inflammation are major contributors to gastric cancer development. Probiotics, particularly <i>Lactobacillus</i>, are promising for their anti-inflammatory potential, yet their exact mechanisms in inhibiting <i>H. pylori</i>-induced inflammation are unclear. In our previous study, <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> ZJ316 (<i>L. plantarum</i> ZJ316) demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory effects against <i>H. pylori</i> infection <i>in vivo</i>, but its precise mechanisms were not fully understood. Here, we aimed to investigate how <i>L. plantarum</i> ZJ316 inhibits the inflammatory response to <i>H. pylori</i> infection. Our results demonstrated that <i>L. plantarum</i> ZJ316 effectively reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in <i>H. pylori</i>-infected AGS cells. Mechanistically, <i>L. plantarum</i> ZJ316 inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathway by preventing the degradation of IκBα, suppressing p65 phosphorylation, and blocking the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated p65. Treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 further decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels, confirming the inhibitory effect of <i>L. plantarum</i> ZJ316 on the NF-κB pathway. In <i>H. pylori</i>-infected mice, oral administration of <i>L. plantarum</i> ZJ316 significantly alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced TNF-α and pepsinogen II (PGII) levels, and increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in serum. A comparative metagenomic analysis of the gastric microbiota revealed a decrease in <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, alongside an increase in <i>Ligilactobacillus</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>, supporting the protective effects of <i>L. plantarum</i> ZJ316 and correlating with their decreased inflammatory response. In summary, administration of <i>L. plantarum</i> ZJ316 demonstrated robust anti-inflammatory effects against <i>H. pylori</i> infection by suppressing NF-κB signaling and promoting favorable changes in the gastric microbiota composition. Therefore, <i>L. plantarum</i> ZJ316 holds promise as a novel functional food for protecting the body against <i>H. pylori</i> infection.
40151922	Oxygen-Sensitive Nanomaterials Synthesized in an Open System: Water-Triggered Nucleation and Its Controllability in the Growth Process.	A novel method has been developed for synthesizing the oxygen-sensitive nanomaterial W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>49</sub>, utilizing 1,3-propanediol as a solvent, with water-triggered nucleation and controllable crystal growth in an open system. The amount of water addition was precisely investigated for the effect of the crystal growth process. Furthermore, the incorporation of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid into the process led to the successful preparation of a functionalized nanocomposite polyester, W<sub>18</sub>O<sub>49</sub>/poly(propylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PTF), through in situ polymerization, exhibiting superior thermal insulation properties.
40151137	A Novel High-Strength Dental Resin Composite Based on BaSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> for Caries Restoration.	Dental resin composite (DRC) is the most widely used restorative material for caries filling treatments. However, DRC has limitations, including incomplete curing and suboptimal mechanical properties, which restrict its clinical application. In this study, we combined the mechanoluminescent material BaSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>:Eu<sup>2+</sup> (BSON) with DRC to create a novel DRC (BD) capable of emitting blue light under occlusal force. This study explored a resin composite with enhanced curing efficiency and improved mechanical properties. Characterization of the mechanical properties demonstrated that, as the BSON doping ratio increased (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 wt %), the compressive strength, flexural strength, and surface hardness of BD initially increased and then decreased. The composite doped with 4 wt % BSON (BD<sub>4</sub>) exhibited the best mechanical properties. Compared to DRC, BD<sub>4</sub> showed an 11% increase in compressive strength (211.9 ± 13.9 MPa), a 36% increase in flexural strength (71.9 ± 8.4 MPa), and a 7% increase in surface hardness (111.0 ± 6.4 HV). Based on these findings, BD<sub>4</sub> was selected for further experiments. The study of luminescent properties revealed that the mechanoluminescent wavelength of BD<sub>4</sub> (470-720 nm) partially overlapped with the wavelength range of the light-curing unit (420-490 nm). Additionally, after cyclic loading, BD<sub>4</sub>'s compressive strength and degree of conversion (DC) improved. After applying a cyclic load of 300 N for 240 s, BD4's compressive strength increased by 70% (142.2 ± 1.2 MPa), and the DC increased by 8% (74.4%). Moreover, biocompatibility evaluations showed that the cell survival rate of L929 fibroblast cells exceeded 90%. Thus, we developed an effective strategy to enhance DRC by incorporating BSON, resulting in a resin composite with superior mechanical properties, enhanced curing efficiency, and favorable biocompatibility, offering a promising new solution for caries restorations.
40150833	Hyperstable and Fibril-Forming Collagen-Mimetic Peptides in Shortest Triple Helices: Empowering the Capping by π-systems.	Developing collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) with short triple helices and fibril-forming ability remains challenging. Herein, we stabilized short CMPs (3-6 GPO repeats) by attaching extended aromatic π-system─fluorenyl groups at the N-terminus and tyrosine at the C-terminus. These modifications promoted triple helix folding through π-π interactions, acting as a "glue" to stabilize the structure and facilitate fibrillation. A single fluorenyl cap required 5 GPO repeats for helix formation, while double fluorenyl capping reduced this to 4 repeats. Notably, at pH 5.5, triple helices formed with only 3 GPO repeats. The double-capped CMPs exhibited hyperstability (<i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 76 °C) and formed fibrillar networks at physiological pH. Biophysical and computational studies confirmed the role of π-π and CH-π interactions, along with hydrogen bonding, in stabilization. The minimalistic CMPs supported cell viability, demonstrating their potential for biomedical applications. This strategy offers a method to design highly stable, short CMPs that form robust fibrillar networks.
40150804	DeePMD-GNN: A DeePMD-kit Plugin for External Graph Neural Network Potentials.	Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized molecular simulation by providing efficient and accurate models for predicting atomic interactions. MLPs continue to advance and have had profound impact in applications that include drug discovery, enzyme catalysis, and materials design. The current landscape of MLP software presents challenges due to the limited interoperability between packages, which can lead to inconsistent benchmarking practices and necessitates separate interfaces with molecular dynamics (MD) software. To address these issues, we present DeePMD-GNN, a plugin for the DeePMD-kit framework that extends its capabilities to support external graph neural network (GNN) potentials.DeePMD-GNN enables the seamless integration of popular GNN-based models, such as NequIP and MACE, within the DeePMD-kit ecosystem. Furthermore, the new software infrastructure allows GNN models to be used within combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) applications using the range corrected ΔMLP formalism.We demonstrate the application of DeePMD-GNN by performing benchmark calculations of NequIP, MACE, and DPA-2 models developed under consistent training conditions to ensure fair comparison.
40150798	Halogen-Driven Spin Dynamics: Exploring Correlation of Cooperativity and Spin Crossover in Solid-State Mononuclear Fe(III) Schiff-Base Complexes.	We report the synthesis, crystal structures, and magnetic properties of four new mononuclear iron(III) complexes, [Fe(5-X-sal<sub>2</sub>trien)]ReO<sub>4</sub> (X = F (<b>1</b>); X= Cl (<b>2</b>); X = Br (<b>3</b>); X = I (<b>4</b>)), where (5-X-sal<sub>2</sub>trien)<sup>2-</sup> is a halogen-substituted hexadentate Schiff-base (N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2-</sup> ligand. Magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrated that complex <b>1</b> maintains a high-spin (HS) state, while complexes <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> display a very gradual spin crossover (SCO) above 300 K. Complex <b>2</b> exhibits a unique two-step thermo-induced spin-state switching at <i>T</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 250 K (1) and 209 K (2) with symmetry breakings. Single-crystal X-ray structures of <b>2</b> are obtained at 300, 250, and 100 K, respectively, indicating two structural phase transitions (<i>Pccn</i>-<i>Pmmn</i>-<i>P</i>2<sub>1</sub>/<i>m</i>). The introduction of halogen substituents on (sal<sub>2</sub>trien)<sup>2-</sup> ligands has a great influence on cooperativity and finally the magnetic properties of Fe(III) SCO complexes.
40148279	In Situ Assembly Engineering-Induced 3D MOF-Driven MXene Framework for Highly Stable Na Metal Anodes.	Sodium metal, with its high theoretical capacity, low redox potential, and cost-effectiveness, presents a promising anode candidate for next-generation high-energy-density batteries. However, the development of Na metal anodes is significantly challenged by issues such as uncontrolled dendrite growth, uncontrolled volume expansion, and associated safety concerns. Designing and developing advanced materials to enhance the conductivity of sodium metal anodes and promote uniform sodium ion deposition are of urgent importance. Herein, a MXene-based hybrid material was developed by integrating MOF-derived Zn, Co, N, and C dopants with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene to serve as a hosting substrate for the Na metal anode. The MXene provided a conductive framework, while the MOF-derived dopants introduced sodiophilic sites, promoting uniform Na deposition and mitigating volume expansion. The optimized material demonstrated an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.99% over 3000 cycles and stable cycling for over 5000 h in symmetrical cells and maintained over 80% capacity retention at 3 C after 500 cycles in full-cell tests, highlighting its potential as a robust Na metal anode material.
40148262	Lipid-Modified PEI Derivative-Based Binary/Ternary Polyplex Formulations for the Delivery of pDNA and mRNA in Primary Cells.	A previous study has demonstrated the benefit of modification of polyethylenimine (PEI1.2k) by lipids through a p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (PHPA) linker and polyanion (PA), which is now extended in this report to several primary cells. The formulated binary (lipopolymer/NAs) and ternary (lipopolymer/NAs/PA) complexes displayed no significant toxicity (MTT/hemolysis assay). The pDNA/mRNA complexes with PEI1.2k-PHPA-Lin9 and PEI1.2k-PHPA-Lau5-Ole5 lipopolymers showed gene expression levels higher than those of other lipopolymers. The transfection efficiencies of the ternary polyplexes of these lipopolymers possessed higher gene expression than those of the binary polyplexes. The serum-stable ternary polyplexes of PEI1.2k-PHPA-Lau5-Ole5 maintained high levels of mRNA expression in the lungs along with the spleen after intravenous injection. As in in vitro studies, transgene expression was relatively weak with binary complexes in muscle; however, a 10-fold higher efficiency was obtained with ternary complexes. Overall, our results provide improved gene formulations for the transfections of primary cells in vitro, as well as in in vivo animal models.
40146921	Supramolecular Eu(III)<sub>4</sub>L<sub>4</sub> Tetrahedra-Based Films for Luminescence Sensing of Volatile Amines with Sub-ppt-Level Detection Limit.	Metal-organic cages are a class of discrete supramolecular architectures endowed with a well-defined cavity and diverse functionalities, offering a broad range of applications that, however, are predominantly confined to liquid phases. In this study, we present the self-assembly of supramolecular Eu(III)<sub>4</sub>L<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra, constructed from triarylborane-cored tritopic tridentate ligands, which were fabricated into spin-coated films with bright emission, smooth surfaces, and uniform thickness. These films demonstrated ultralow detection limits for a series of volatile amines, reaching the sub-ppt level. This work serves as a compelling example of the preparation and application of metal-organic-cage-based films, paving the way for broader application scenarios.
40146901	Luminescent Iridium-Peptide Nucleic Acid Bioconjugate as Photosensitizer for Singlet Oxygen Production toward a Potential Dual Therapeutic Agent.	A novel bioorganometallic PNA conjugate (<b>Ir-PNA</b>) was synthesized by covalently bonding a model PNA tetramer to a luminescent bis-cyclometalated Ir(III) complex that acted as a photosensitizer under light irradiation to generate singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>). The conjugate was prepared using an Ir complex bearing the 1,10-phenanthroline ligand functionalized with either a free primary amine (<b>Ir-NH</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>) or a carboxyl group (<b>Ir-COOH</b>) for the conjugation to PNA. The photophysical studies on the <b>Ir-COOH</b> and the <b>Ir-PNA</b> demonstrated that the luminescent properties were maintained after the conjugation of the Ir fragment to PNA. Furthermore, the abilities to produce <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> of <b>Ir-COOH</b> and <b>Ir-PNA</b> were confirmed in a cuvette under visible light irradiation employing 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene as a reporter, and the measured singlet oxygen quantum yield (Φ<sub>Δ</sub>) supported the <b>Ir-PNA</b> conjugate efficacy as a photosensitizer (Φ<sub>Δ</sub> = 0.54). Two-photon absorption microscopy on HeLa cells revealed that <b>Ir-PNA</b> localized in both the cytosol and nucleus, suggesting its potential as an intracellular carrier for PNA. Cytotoxicity assays by MTT tests showed that <b>Ir-PNA</b> was nontoxic in the absence of light, but induced cell death (EC<sub>50</sub> = 18 μM) after UV irradiation. Overall, the <b>Ir-PNA</b> conjugate represents a promising system for the intracellular delivery of the PNA and its application in PDT.
40146788	Adhesive and Antioxidant Hydrogel with Glucose/ROS Dual-Responsive Drug Release for Diabetic Oral Mucosal Wound Healing.	Diabetes mellitus is a global health threat, with chronic wounds, including oral mucosal wounds, being a severe complication. These wounds are characterized by delayed healing and increased inflammation due to hyperglycemia, affecting patients' quality of life. Current treatments for oral mucosal wounds cannot offer sustained management of these injuries in diabetic patients. Here, a glucose/ROS dual-responsive hydrogel incorporating sitagliptin was developed for the treatment of diabetic oral mucosal wounds. After chemical modification of tetra-armed poly(ethylene glycol) succinimidyl glutarate (tetra-PEG-SG) by dopamine (DA) and tetra-armed poly(ethylene glycol) amine (tetra-PEG-NH<sub>2</sub>) by phenylboronic acid (PBA), the resulting hydrogel was capable of rapid gelation, robust tissue adhesion, self-healing, antioxidant capacity, and dual response to glucose and reactive oxygen species (ROS), enabling the feasible injection and stable adherence in the moist oral environment while ensuring sustained therapeutic sitagliptin release. <i>In vivo</i> experiments on oral mucosal defects in diabetic mice revealed that the sitagliptin-loaded hydrogel could effectively reduce inflammation and promote wound healing. Collectively, this finding identifies a potential wound dressing as a therapeutic strategy for diabetic oral mucosal wounds.
40146594	Dual-Responsive Ultrathin Peptoid Nanofibers Assembled from Amphiphilic Alternating Peptoids with an Integration of Azobenzene and Histamine Moieties.	Ultrathin organic nanofibers (UTONFs) have favorable potential as emerging nanomaterials due to their large aspect ratio, lightweight nature, and mechanical flexibility. Achieving dual stimuli-responsive UTONFs is necessary to satisfy the on-demand requirements of smart and miniature devices but remains challenging. Herein, amphiphilic alternating peptoids (AAPs) modified with azobenzene and histamine groups were successfully synthesized using the solid-phase submonomer synthesis technique. Following subsequent solution self-assembly, photo/CO<sub>2</sub> dual-responsive ultrathin peptoid nanofibers (UTPNFs) with a diameter of ∼1.8 nm and a length of up to several micrometers were generated based on the pendant hydrophobic conjugate stacking mechanism. The photoisomerization of azobenzene was accountable for the reversible transformation from UTPNFs to spherical micelles (∼60 nm) under recyclable light irradiation. Owing to the protonation and the resulting electrostatic repulsion interaction, both UTPNFs and spherical micelles displayed a reversible variation in shape and physicochemical properties, including the size, diameter, zeta potential, and pH. Our work offers prospective guidance on the construction of dual-responsive ultrathin organic nanofibers with controllable shape transformation and performance transition.
40146533	Stacking Interactions of Druglike Heterocycles with Nucleobases.	Stacking interactions contribute significantly to the interaction of small molecules with RNA, and harnessing the power of these interactions will likely prove important in the development of RNA-targeting inhibitors. To this end, we present a comprehensive computational analysis of stacking interactions between a set of 54 druglike heterocycles and the natural nucleobases. We first show that heterocycle choice can tune the strength of stacking interactions with nucleobases over a large range and that heterocycles favor stacked geometries that cluster around a discrete set of stacking loci characteristic of each nucleobase. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory results indicate that the strengths of these interactions are modulated primarily by electrostatic and dispersion effects. Based on this, we present a multivariate predictive model of the maximum strength of stacking interactions between a given heterocycle and nucleobase that depends on molecular descriptors derived from the electrostatic potential. These descriptors can be readily computed using density functional theory or predicted directly from atom connectivity (e.g., SMILES). This model is used to predict the maximum possible stacking interactions of a set of 1854 druglike heterocycles with the natural nucleobases. Finally, we show that trivial modifications of standard (fixed-charge) molecular mechanics force fields reduce errors in predicted stacking interaction energies from around 2 kcal/mol to below 1 kcal/mol, providing a pragmatic means of predicting more reliable stacking interaction energies using existing computational workflows. We also analyze the stacking interactions between ribocil and a bacterial riboswitch, showing that two of the three aromatic heterocyclic components engage in near-optimal stacking interactions with binding site nucleobases.
40146209	The role of cecal metabolites and DNA methylation in deciphering the effects of maternal genistein intake on white fat browning in adult female offspring.	Maternal diets during pregnancy and lactation are critical determinants that regulate the metabolic homeostasis in offspring. Our previous research demonstrated that maternal genistein (GEN) intervention ameliorated the dysregulation of glucolipid metabolism induced by intrauterine overnutrition in adult offspring, accompanied by changes in the composition of gut microbiota; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we used a maternal overnutrition model induced by excess energy intake before and throughout pregnancy and lactation, with maternal GEN administered during the same period. The female offspring were raised on a standard chow diet until sacrificed at 24 weeks. The mRNA levels of browning markers were quantified in inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissues, followed by methylation analysis <i>via</i> the MassArray method. Cecal contents were collected for untargeted metabolomic analysis and a target quantitative analysis of methionine cycle metabolites. Spearman correlation analyses were used to assess whether cecal metabolites are involved in the methylation of browning-related genes and influence their expression. The results showed that maternal GEN supplementation reversed the downregulation of browning markers caused by perinatal high-fat diets in adult female offspring, consistent with a reduction in their methylation levels. Subsequently, we also found that maternal GEN consumption altered cecal metabolite profiles in offspring, promoting the production of bile acids, potent regulators of glucolipid metabolism, and reducing metabolites involved in the methionine cycle, key methyl donors for the methylation process. Furthermore, the abundances of these metabolites were significantly correlated with the methylation and expression levels of browning markers. Overall, this discovery suggested that maternal GEN intake decreased the methylation level of browning markers and induced browning in white adipose tissue of offspring, which correlated with alterations in cecal metabolites. We provide a novel theoretical basis for GEN as a promising nutritional supplement to break the vicious cycle of maternal metabolic disturbances being transmitted to offspring.
40146191	Energetics of Expanded PAM Readability by Engineered Cas9-NG.	The energetic basis for the enhanced PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) readability in engineered Cas9-NG (a variant of Cas9 from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (<i>Sp</i>Cas9)) with seven mutations: (R1335V, E1219F, D1135V, L1111R, T1337R, G1218R, and A1322R) remains a fundamental unsolved problem. Utilizing the X-ray structure of the precatalytic complex (<i>Sp</i>Cas9:sgRNA:dsDNA) as a template, we calculated the changes in PAM (TGG, TGA, TGT, or TGC) binding affinity (ΔΔ<i>G</i>) associated with each of the seven mutations in <i>Sp</i>Cas9 through rigorous alchemical simulations (sampling ∼ 53 μs). The underlying thermodynamics (ΔΔ<i>G</i>) accounts for the experimentally observed differences in DNA cleavage activity between <i>Sp</i>Cas9 and Cas9-NG across various DNA substrates. The interaction energies between <i>Sp</i>Cas9 and DNA are significantly influenced by the type and location of the amino acid mutations. Notably, the R1335V mutation disfavors DNA binding by disrupting critical interactions with the PAM. However, the destabilizing effect of the R1335V mutation is mitigated by four advantageous mutations (E1219F, D1135V, L1111R, and T1337R), which primarily introduce nonbase-specific interactions and enhance PAM readability. The hydrophobic substitutions (E1219F and D1135V) are particularly impactful, as they exclude solvent from the PAM binding pocket, strengthening electrostatic interactions in the low dielectric medium and increasing the stability of the noncognate PAM complexes by ∼2-5 kcal/mol. Additionally, L1111R and T1337R facilitate DNA binding by forming direct electrostatic contacts. In contrast, the charge mutations G1218R and A1322R do not effectively promote interactions with the negatively charged DNA, clearly demonstrating that the location of mutations is crucial in shaping these interaction energetics. We demonstrated that stabilization of the Cas9-NG: noncognate PAM complexes enables broader PAM recognition. This is primarily achieved through two mechanisms: (1) the establishment of new nonbase-specific interactions between the protein and nucleotides and (2) the enhancement of electrostatic interactions within a relatively dry and hydrophobic pocket. The findings revealed that mutation-induced desolvation can improve the recognition of noncognate PAMs, paving the way for the rational and innovative design of <i>Sp</i>Cas9 mutants.
40145937	Native Brazilian fruits: postprandial glycemic control and carbohydrate-enzyme inhibition - insights from a randomized crossover clinical trial.	Brazilian native fruits are excellent sources of polyphenols, especially berries, which are rich in anthocyanins. These compounds are associated with improvements in the insulin signaling pathway, reduced glucose absorption, and the inhibition of carbohydrate-digesting enzymes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of consuming native fruits, including grumixama (GM), Rio Grande cherry (RGc), and uvaia (UV), on the 2-hour postprandial glucose, plasma insulin, and inflammatory responses in healthy individuals. No study has evaluated the effects of these fruits on carbohydrate-digesting enzymes alongside glucose transporters. This was assessed using two methods: (i) post-bread glycemic response and (ii) post-glucose glycemic response. Healthy volunteers participated in a crossover study with control, consuming juices from GM, RGc, UV, or water, followed by white bread or a glucose solution. Capillary glucose, plasma insulin, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were measured. Additionally, the inhibitory activities of α-amylase and α-glucosidase by fruit extracts were evaluated <i>in vitro</i>. Molecular docking assessed the affinity of individual anthocyanins and flavonols. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was identified as the predominant flavonoid in GM and RGc, while quercetin 3-galactoside and rutin were the primary flavonols in GM and RGc, respectively. RGc juice significantly reduced 2-hour postprandial glucose levels, and juices rich in anthocyanins delayed the glucose peak to 45 minutes. Only GM juice delayed the insulin peak. Phenolic extracts from GM and RGc inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In silico</i> analysis showed high-affinity binding of anthocyanins and flavonols found in the GM and RGc extracts to both enzymes. Therefore, GM and RGc may be considered beneficial foods and serve as additional nutritional supplements in managing postprandial hyperglycemia.
40145870	Structural Descriptors for Subunit Interface Regions in Homodimers: Effect of Lipid Membrane and Secondary Structure Type.	A total of 1311 homodimers were collected and analyzed in three different categories to highlight the impact of lipid environment and secondary structure type: 422 cytoplasmic α-helix, 411 cytoplasmic β-strand, and 478 membrane complexes. Structural features of the interface connecting two monomers were investigated and compared to those of the non-interface surface. Every residue on the surface of each monomer was explored based on four attributes: solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), protrusion index (C<sub><i>x</i></sub>), surface planarity, and surface roughness. SASA and C<sub><i>x</i></sub> distribution profiles clearly distinguished the interface from the surface in all categories, where the rim of the interface displayed higher SASA and C<sub><i>x</i></sub> values than the rest of the surface. Surface residues in membrane complexes protruded less than cytoplasmic ones due to the hydrophobic environment, and consequently, the difference between surface and interface residues became less noticeable in that category. Cytoplasmic β-strand complexes displayed markedly lower SASA at the interface core than at the surface. The major distinction between the surface and interface was achieved through surface roughness, which displayed significantly higher values for the interface than the surface, especially in cytoplasmic complexes. Clearly, a surface which is relatively rugged favors the association of two monomers through multiple van der Waals interactions and hydrogen-bond formations. Another structural descriptor with strong distinguishing ability was surface planarity, which was higher at the interface than at the non-interface surface. Surface flatness would eventually facilitate the interconnectedness of an interface with a network of residue pairs bridging two complementary surfaces. Analysis of contact pairs revealed that hydrophobic pairs have the highest frequency of occurrence in the lipid environment of membrane complexes. However, despite the scarcity of polar residues at the interface, the likelihood of observing a contact between polar residues was markedly higher than that of hydrophobic ones.
40145780	Genre of Music Festivals as a Predictor for Medical Utilization Rate.	The medical utilization rates (MUR) can be applied to anticipate necessary medical resources at mass gatherings. The MUR describes the number of patients per thousand attendees. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate whether the type of music festival, Electronic Dance Music Festivals (EDMF) versus Mainstream, is related to the MUR and to drug-related incidents.
40145660	MultiCTox: Empowering Accurate Cardiotoxicity Prediction through Adaptive Multimodal Learning.	Cardiotoxicity refers to the inhibitory effects of drugs on cardiac ion channels. Accurate prediction of cardiotoxicity is crucial yet challenging, as it directly impacts the evaluation of cardiac drug efficacy and safety. Numerous methods have been developed to predict cardiotoxicity, yet their performance remains limited. A key limitation is that these methods often rely solely on single-modal data, making multimodal data integration challenging. As a result, we present a multimodal method integrating molecular SMILES, structure, and fingerprint to enhance cardiotoxicity prediction. First, we designed a fusion layer to unify representations from different modalities. During training, the model maximizes intramodal similarity for the same molecule while minimizing intermolecular similarity, ensuring consistent cross-modal representations. This study evaluates the inhibitory effects of candidate drugs on voltage-gated potassium (hERG), sodium (Nav1.5), and calcium (Cav1.2) channels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in cardiotoxicity prediction. We anticipate that this model will contribute significantly to the development and safety evaluation of cardiac drugs, reducing cardiotoxicity-related risks.
40143795	Lycopene improves cisplatin induced hepatointestinal injury in rats by modulating the microbe-gut-liver axis.	Cisplatin (CIS) is a commonly used antitumor drug in clinics, but its application is limited due to hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity. In recent years, a large number of studies have shown that the imbalance of intestinal flora is one of the important factors in the malignant development of diseases. Therefore, improving organ function by regulating intestinal flora may be an important strategy to prevent the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Lycopene (LYC) is found in a wide range of red foods and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing effects. So the purpose of this study was to explore its effect on hepatointestinal injury caused by chemotherapy drugs. The results of this study showed that CIS could significantly restore body weight, diet, water intake, and AST, ALT and other physiological and biochemical indexes of rats. HE staining, projective electron microscopy and TUNEL results showed that LYC alleviated morphological and ultrastructural damage of the liver and intestine. Then, ELISA results showed that LYC can reduce cell apoptosis by increasing the antioxidant capacity and reducing inflammatory response. Secondly, 16sRNA and metabolome results showed that LYC enriched beneficial bacteria (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria), reduced harmful bacteria (<i>E. coli</i>, <i>etc</i>.), enhanced metabolic pathway changes such as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and alleviated organ damage caused by CIS. Finally, network pharmacology, molecular docking and immunohistochemistry showed that LYC could reduce CIS induced hepatocyte inflammation and apoptosis by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. In summary, LYC alleviates the toxic side effects of chemotherapy drugs by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway and the intestinal microbiota-metabolite-liver axis.
40143756	Recent Advances in the Modeling of Ionic Liquids Using Artificial Neural Networks.	This paper reviews the recent and most impactful advancements in the application of artificial neural networks in modeling the properties of ionic liquids. As salts that are liquid at temperatures below 100 °C, ionic liquids possess unique properties beneficial for various industrial applications such as carbon capture, catalytic solvents, and lubricant additives. The study emphasizes the challenges in selecting appropriate ILs due to the vast variability in their properties, which depend significantly on their cation and anion structures. The review discusses the advantages of using ANNs, including feed-forward, cascade-forward, convolutional, recurrent, and graph neural networks, over traditional machine learning algorithms for predicting the thermodynamic and physical properties of ILs. The paper also highlights the importance of data preparation, including data collection, feature engineering, and data cleaning, in developing accurate predictive models. Additionally, the review covers the interpretability of these models using techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations to understand feature importance. The authors conclude by discussing future opportunities and the potential of combining ANNs with other computational methods to design new ILs with targeted properties.
40143560	Diboronate-Modified Hyaluronic Acid for Glucose-Responsive Insulin Delivery.	Diabetes requires precise insulin management to maintain glycemic control and prevent severe complications. Glucose-responsive delivery systems envision an autonomous approach to improve insulin therapy. Here, a glucose-sensitive insulin delivery system comprising hyaluronic acid conjugated with a diboronate glucose binder as a carrier for diol-modified insulin is shown. This approach seeks improved precision in insulin delivery, leveraging bidentate glucose binding to achieve enhanced glucose affinity and specificity. Modification of insulin with a diol motif preserves its native conformation and function. These insulin formulations correct blood glucose in diabetic mice, including glucose-responsive function when subjected to a glucose challenge. However, the absence of secondary interactions, such as electrostatic complexation, ultimately limits the duration of function relative to that of previous platforms. Integrating complementary interactions alongside dynamic-covalent glucose binders therefore enhances the functional duration and therapeutic efficacy in the design of glucose-responsive polymeric carriers, offering design insights into the development of new carriers for glucose-responsive insulin delivery.
40138663	Unraveling undiagnosed rare disease cases by HiFi long-read genome sequencing.	Solve-RD is a pan-European rare disease (RD) research program that aims to identify disease-causing genetic variants in previously undiagnosed RD families. We utilized 10-fold coverage HiFi long-read sequencing (LRS) for detecting causative structural variants (SVs), single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion-deletions (indels), and short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in previously studied RD families without a clear molecular diagnosis. Our cohort includes 293 individuals from 114 genetically undiagnosed RD families selected by European Reference Network (ERN) experts. Of these, 21 families were affected by so-called "unsolvable" syndromes for which genetic causes remain unknown and for which prior testing was not a prerequisite. The remaining 93 families had at least one individual affected by a rare neurological, neuromuscular, or epilepsy disorder without a genetic diagnosis despite extensive prior testing. Clinical interpretation and orthogonal validation of variants in known disease genes yielded 12 novel genetic diagnoses due to de novo and rare inherited SNVs, indels, SVs, and STR expansions. In an additional five families, we identified a candidate disease-causing variant, including an <i>MCF2</i>/<i>FGF13</i> fusion and a <i>PSMA3</i> deletion. However, no common genetic cause was identified in any of the "unsolvable" syndromes. Taken together, we found (likely) disease-causing genetic variants in 11.8% of previously unsolved families and additional candidate disease-causing SVs in another 5.4% of these families. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the potential added value of HiFi long-read genome sequencing in undiagnosed rare diseases.
40138576	MartiniGlass: a Tool for Enabling Visualization of Coarse-Grained Martini Topologies.	As molecular modeling gains ever more prominence in understanding cellular processes, high quality visualization of models and dynamics has never been more important. Naturally, much molecular visualization software is written to enable the visualization of atomic level details in structures. While necessary, this means that visualization of increasingly popular coarse-grained (CG) models remains a challenge. Here, we present a Python package, MartiniGlass, that facilitates the visualization of systems simulated with the widely used CG Martini force field using the popular visualization package VMD. MartiniGlass rapidly processes molecular topologies and accounts for important topological features at CG resolution, such as secondary structure restraints, preparing them for easy visualization of simulated trajectories.
40138572	Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence System for Drug Prioritization.	<i>In silico</i> drug prioritization may be a promising and time-saving strategy to identify potential drugs, standing as a faster and more cost-effective approach than <i>de novo</i> approaches. In recent years, artificial intelligence has greatly evolved the drug development process. Here, we present a novel computational framework for drug prioritization, <i>labyrinth</i>, designed to simulate human knowledge retrieval and inference to identify potential drug candidates for each disease. With the integration of up-to-date clinical trials, literature co-occurrences, drug-target interactions, and disease similarities, our framework achieves over 90% predictive accuracy across clinical trial phases and strong alignment with clinical practice in TCGA cohorts. We have demonstrated effectiveness across 20 different disease categories with robust ROC-AUC metrics and the balance between predictive accuracy and model interpretability. We further demonstrate its effectiveness at both the population and the individual levels. This study not only demonstrates the capacity for its drug prioritization but underscores the importance of aligning computational models with intuitive human reasoning. We have wrapped the core function into an R package named <i>labyrinth</i>, which is freely available on GitHub under the GPL-v2 license (https://github.com/hanjunwei-lab/labyrinth).
40138543	Bioactive Polymeric Scaffolds: Multivalent Functionalization by Thermal Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition with Alkynyl Dicarbamates.	Multivalency enables interactions with higher affinities and specificities than monovalent interactions. The strategy exploited by nature to modulate biorecognition has inspired the design of multivalent conjugates with therapeutic properties. However, chemical functionalization often requires coupling agents, additives, or metal catalysts that complicate isolation and purification. Herein, azide-alkyne cycloaddition (AAC) with alkynyl dicarbamates (Alk-R) is presented as a flexible, reliable, atom-economical, and user-friendly strategy for the multivalent functionalization of polymeric scaffolds. Alk-R functionalized with biologically relevant ligands have been prepared and used for the multivalent AAC functionalization of azide-bearing dendrimers and block copolymers. The resulting polymers with double multivalency reveal a platform for the development of bioinspired functional systems with promising applications in drug delivery: block copolymer micelles and multifunctional nanocarriers with synergistically integrated probes-ligands-drugs. The extension of this strategy to other ligands and scaffolds is expected to open up a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities.
40138522	NO-Releasing Metal-Organic Framework-Based Composite Coatings with Heparin-Mimicking Copolymers on Titanium Substrates: Impact on Vascular Cell Behavior.	Nitric oxide (NO), known for its anticoagulant and antiproliferative effects, holds great promise in anticoagulation therapy. Copper-based metal-organic frameworks, such as CuBTTri, catalyze NO formation, but their impact on vascular cells requires further study. In this work, polydopamine, polyethylenimine, and CuBTTri were codeposited on titanium substrates. To enhance cytocompatibility, heparin-mimicking copolymers were incorporated. By adjusting CuBTTri content, NO release rates and cytotoxicity toward vascular cells were regulated. The heparin-mimicking copolymers improved the cytocompatibility with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, while NO released from CuBTTri inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells. By integrating NO-releasing CuBTTri with heparin-mimicking copolymers, we successfully developed a composite coating that selectively modulates vascular cell behavior.
40138216	Cynarin protects against seizures and neuronal death in a rat model of kainic acid-induced seizures.	The potential therapeutic value of cynarin, a phenolic compound derived from artichoke, in treating epilepsy has not yet been reported. The present study evaluated the effects of cynarin on a kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure rat model and its potential mechanism. Cynarin was administered through oral gavage at a dosage of 10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> daily for 7 days before the induction of seizures with KA (15 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) <i>via</i> intraperitoneal injection. The results showed that pretreatment with cynarin effectively attenuated the KA-induced seizure score and electroencephalogram (EEG) changes and prevented neuronal loss and glial cell activation in the hippocampi of KA-treated rats. In addition, pretreatment with cynarin dramatically prevented the aberrant levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), p-IκB, p65-NFκB, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) induced by KA administration in hippocampal tissues. Additionally, KA substantially increased hippocampal glutamate levels and decreased cerebral blood flow, which were significantly alleviated by pretreatment with cynarin. The observed effects of cynarin were comparable to those of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the serum AST, ALT, creatinine, or bilirubin levels between the cynarin-treated rats and the control rats. Cynarin has a neuroprotective effect on a rat model of seizures induced by KA, reducing seizures, gliosis, inflammatory cytokines, and glutamate elevation and increasing cerebral blood flow. Thus, cynarin has therapeutic potential for preventing epilepsy.
40136079	Relative Binding Free Energy Estimation of Congeneric Ligands and Macromolecular Mutants with the Alchemical Transfer Method with Coordinate Swapping.	We present the Alchemical Transfer with Coordinate Swapping (ATS) method to enable the calculation of the relative binding free energies between large congeneric ligands and single-point mutant peptides to protein receptors with the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) framework. Similarly to ATM, the new method implements the alchemical transformation as a coordinate transformation and works with any unmodified force fields and standard chemical topologies. Unlike ATM, which transfers whole ligands in and out of the receptor binding site, ATS limits the magnitude of the alchemical perturbation by transferring only the portion of the molecules that differ between the bound and unbound ligands. The common region of the two ligands, which can be arbitrarily large, is unchanged and does not contribute to the magnitude and statistical fluctuations of the perturbation energy. Internally, the coordinates of the atoms of the common regions are swapped to maintain the integrity of the covalent bonding data structures of the OpenMM molecular dynamics engine. The work successfully validates the method on protein-ligand and protein-peptide RBFE benchmarks. This advance paves the road for the application of the relative binding free energy Alchemical Transfer Method protocol to study the effect of protein and nucleic acid mutations on the binding affinity and specificity of macromolecular complexes.
40135540	Investigation of Electrostatic Effects on Enyzme Catalysis: Insights from Computational Simulations of Monoamine Oxidase A Pathological Variants Leading to the Brunner Syndrome.	Brunner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impulsive aggressiveness and intellectual disability, which is linked to impaired function of the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) enzyme. Patients with specific point mutations in the <i>MAOA</i> gene have been reported to exhibit these symptoms, along with notably elevated serotonin levels, which suggest a decreased catalytic performance of the mutated MAO-A enzymes. In this study, we present multiscale molecular simulations focusing on the rate-limiting step of MAO-A-catalyzed serotonin degradation for the C266F and V244I variants that are reportedly associated with pathologies characteristic of the Brunner syndrome. We found that the C266F mutation causes an approximately 18,000-fold slowdown of enzymatic function, which is equivalent to a <i>MAOA</i> gene knockout. For the V244I mutant, a somewhat smaller, yet still significant 300-fold slowdown has been estimated. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of the impact of enzyme electrostatics on the catalytic function of the wild-type (WT) MAO-A and both aforementioned mutants (C266F and V244I), as well as on the E446K mutant investigated in one of our earlier studies. The results have shown that the mutation induces a noteworthy change in electrostatic interactions between the reacting moiety and its enzymatic surroundings, leading to a decreased catalytic performance in all of the considered MAO-A variants. An analysis of mutation effects supported by geometry comparison of mutants and the wild-type enzyme at a residue level suggests that a principal driving force behind the altered catalytic performance of the mutants is subtle structural changes scattered along the entire enzyme. These shifts in geometry also affect domains most relevant to catalysis, where structural offsets of few tenths of an Å can significantly change contribution to the barrier of the involved residues. These results are in full agreement with the reasoning derived from clinical observations and biochemical data. Our research represents a step forward in the attempts of using fundamental principles of chemical physics in order to explain genetically driven pathologies. In addition, our results support the view that the catalytic function of enzymes is crucially driven by electrostatic interactions.
40135274	Comparative assessment of flavonoid content in banana pulp and peel and their role in mitigating bone loss conditions and promoting osteoblast differentiation.	Banana fruit is widely grown and serves as a source of income across the tropics. It is known for its nutritional qualities and well-recognized medicinal applications. Given that banana pulp and peel are rich in flavonoids, such as naringenin, kaempferol, and quercetin, which are already known for their role in bone health, we hypothesize that banana pulp and peel can accelerate fracture healing, mitigate bone loss in post-menopausal conditions, and promote osteoblast differentiation. The current study was proposed to assess a comparative and parallel investigation of the differential flavonoid expression in banana pulp and peel and their concomitant bone anabolic effects. The pulp extract exhibited its osteogenic potential when administered orally for 2 weeks at doses of 250, 500 and 750 mg per kg per day in the osteotomy Balb/c mice model (<i>n</i> = 10), while the peel extract showed similar effects at comparatively much lower doses of 50, 100 and 250 mg per kg per day for the same duration. The effective lower doses in both cases, <i>i.e.</i>, 250 mg per kg per day for the pulp and 50 mg per kg per day for the peel, were used to further investigate the anti-osteoporotic potential <i>in vivo</i> over a span of 8 weeks (<i>n</i> = 10). Banana pulp ameliorated the microarchitectural deterioration of the bones by increasing the rate of bone formation while simultaneously limiting exaggerated resorption, as assessed by micro-CT, calcein labelling, TRAP staining, bone strength parameters and measurement of bone formation and resorption markers in serum. Similar results were obtained with the banana peel extract at considerably lower doses. The osteogenic potential of the pulp and peel extracts was also tested in an <i>in vitro</i> setup. Osteoblast viability and differentiation, as assessed by MTT, ALP, mineralization and RT-PCR, demonstrated that bone formation potential was observed at 2.5 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> and 5 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> of the pulp extract, whereas in the case of the peel extract, it was observed at 0.625 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> and 1.25 μg ml<sup>-1</sup>. These findings indicate that banana peel can exert similar osteogenic and osteoprotective effects as the pulp but at a much lower dose. This highlights banana peel as a prospective, sustainable feedstock for the healthcare sector, providing an alternative to its disposal.
40134323	Bioactive peptides from barley protein hydrolysate stimulate cholecystokinin secretion <i>via</i> calcium-sensing receptor signaling in enteroendocrine cells.	Anorexigenic hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), secreted by enteroendocrine cells (EECs), is known for its inhibitory role in appetite. The secretion of CCK is greatly affected by dietary ingredients. The search for functional components in food that stimulate CCK secretion is of great significance for weight control. Our previous study has demonstrated that barley protein hydrolysate (BPH) strongly stimulates CCK secretion from EECs <i>in vitro</i>, but the structural characteristics of the responsible components and their underlying mechanism of action have not yet been elucidated. Here, we monitor the plasma levels of CCK in mice after ingestion of BPH to demonstrate its <i>in vivo</i> activity in stimulating CCK secretion. Using size exclusion column chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we isolate and identify three novel CCK secretion-stimulating peptides, including VQVQIPF, VVTGVGGQ and PQQPQPFFQ. Among them, the peptide VVTGVGGQ exhibits the strongest activity in stimulating CCK secretion. Inhibition experiments show that the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is required for VVTGVGGQ to increase CCK gene transcription and secretion. Blockage of CaSR by NPS-2143 completely abolishes the activity of VVTGVGGQ. Moreover, the downstream signaling molecules including CaSR coupled G-protein subtype G<sub>q</sub> and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> are also involved in VVTGVGGQ-stimulated CCK secretion. Inhibition of G<sub>q</sub> and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> completely and partially abolish this peptide-induced CCK secretion, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of barley protein-derived hydrolysate and peptides as functional food ingredients for CCK secretion stimulation and weight control.
40134231	6S-1 pRNA 9-mers are a prominent length species during outgrowth of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> cells from extended stationary phase.	Bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAP) utilize 6S RNAs as templates to synthesize ultrashort transcripts (up to ~14 nt), termed product RNAs (pRNAs), that play a key role in reversing the blockage of RNAP by 6S RNA. Here, we resolved the pRNA length profile of 6S-1 RNA from <i>B. subtilis</i>, a major model system for the study of 6S RNA biology, during outgrowth of cells from extended stationary phase. 9-mers were found to be a particularly abundant pRNA length species, followed by 8-/10-/11-mers and 13-/14-mers. Consistent with <i>in vitro</i> data from the <i>Escherichia coli</i> system, these findings support the mechanistic model according to which the housekeeping sigma factor (σ<sup>70</sup> or σ<sup>A</sup>) dissociates from 6S RNA:RNAP complexes upon synthesis of pRNA 9-mers, followed by final dissociation of 6S RNA and RNAP upon synthesis of longer pRNAs (13-/14-mers). Methodologically, the identification of such ultrashort RNAs in total cellular extracts by RNA-Seq is inefficient with standard protocols using adapter ligation to RNA 3'-ends for reverse transcription and PCR-based cDNA sequencing. Here, we demonstrate that ultrashort RNAs can instead be incorporated into RNA-Seq libraries by polyA-, polyC- and potentially also polyU-tailing of their 3'-ends. At positions where a non-tailing nucleotide is followed by one or more tailing nucleotides, an algorithm that integrates RNA-Seq results from at least two different 3'-end tailings allows one to approximate the fraction of read counts at such ambiguous positions. Finally, methodological biases and potential applications of our approach to other short RNAs are discussed.
40132261	Medical adhesives for soft tissue wound repair with good biocompatibility, flexibility, and high adhesive strength.	Compared with traditional soft tissue wound closure methods such as sutures and staplers, bioadhesives have significant advantages in terms of tissue compatibility, ease of use, and wound adaptability, making them a hot topic among current wound repair materials. This study aimed to select polyurethane materials with good biocompatibility and high mechanical strength, optimize the prepolymer formula, develop new curing agents, and obtain a new dual-component polyurethane bioadhesive. Furthermore, key research will be conducted on its mechanical properties and tissue adhesion performance. The results show that through the optimization of prepolymer formulations and the development of novel curing agents, a dual-component polyurethane bioadhesive with good biocompatibility, flexibility, and high adhesive strength was obtained. This adhesive can quickly and effectively bond common soft tissue (skin, muscle) traumatic wounds, with an adhesive strength of up to 72 kPa. This adhesive matches well with the mechanical properties of soft tissues and safely and tightly adheres to the surface of soft tissues. Additionally, this dual-component polyurethane adhesive holds promise for repairing other soft tissues, such as the lungs and intestines, with broad application prospects.
40131228	Establishing a Bioink Assessment Protocol: GelMA and Collagen in the Bioprinting of a Potential <i>In Vitro</i> Intestinal Model.	Collagen and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) are widely studied biomaterials for extrusion-based bioprinting (EBB) due to their excellent biological properties and ability to mimic the extracellular matrix of native tissues. This study aims to establish a preliminary workflow for approaching EBB by assessing collagen and GelMA printability and biological performance. GelMA was selected for its cost-effectiveness and ease of synthesis, while our collagen formulation was specifically optimized for printability, which is a challenging aspect of bioprinting. A parallel evaluation of their printability and biological performance is provided to develop a preliminary 3D intestinal model replicating the submucosa, lamina propria, and epithelial layer. Rheological analyses demonstrated that both materials exhibit a shear-thinning behavior. Collagen (u-CI) displayed a shear-thinning parameter <i>p</i> = 0.1 and a consistency index <i>C</i> = 80.62 Pa·s, while GelMA (u-GI) exhibited a more pronounced shear-thinning effect and enhanced shape retention (<i>p</i> = 0.06, <i>C</i> = 286.6 Pa·s). Post-extrusion recovery was higher for collagen (85%), compared to GelMA (45%), indicating its greater mechanical resilience. Photo-crosslinking improved hydrogel stability, with an increase in storage modulus <i>G</i>' for both materials. Printing tests confirmed the suitability of both hydrogels for bioprinting, with GelMA demonstrating higher print fidelity than collagen. Dimensional stability assessments under incubating conditions revealed that collagen constructs maintained their shape for 14 days before degradation, whereas GelMA constructs exhibited a gradual decrease in diameter over 21 days. Cell culture studies showed that human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) and human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8) could be successfully cocultured in an optimized RPMI 1640-based medium. AlamarBlue assays and Live/Dead staining confirmed high cell viability and proliferation within both hydrogel matrices. Notably, HSFs in GelMA exhibited more elongated morphologies, likely due to the material's lower stiffness (380 Pa) compared to collagen (585 Pa). HCT-8 cells adhered more rapidly to GelMA constructs, forming colonies within 7 days, whereas on collagen, colony formation was delayed to 14 days. Finally, a layered intestinal model was fabricated, and immunostaining confirmed the expression of tight junction (ZO-1) and adhesion (E-cadherin) proteins, validating the epithelial monolayer integrity. These findings highlight the potential of collagen and GelMA in 3D bioprinting applications for gut tissue engineering and pave the way for future developments of <i>in vitro</i> intestinal models.
40131182	Bacteria-Responsive Drug Delivery System Utilizing Carboxymethyl Cellulose-Functionalized Metal-Organic Framework for Enhanced Antibacterial Efficacy.	Bacterial infections pose a significant threat to human health and economic stability. The overuse of antibiotics has exacerbated bacterial resistance, highlighting the urgent need for innovative strategies to combat this issue. Bacteria-responsive drug delivery systems present a promising solution to overcoming bacterial resistance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), versatile porous materials created by linking metal clusters with organic ligands, are ideal candidates for such applications. Here, we employed the zeolite imidazole framework 8 (ZIF-8) as a carrier for ceftiofur (EFT), enhanced with carboxymethyl cellulose to develop a smart drug delivery system (CMC-EFT@ZIF-8) responsive to pH and cellulase. <i>In vitro</i> tests demonstrated that this system released a higher quantity of EFT under acidic conditions and in the presence of cellulase, leading to more effective disruption of bacterial membranes and subsequent bacterial death. The CMC-EFT@ZIF-8 system achieved a 99% clearance of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> within 6 h and showed superior efficacy in a mouse skin wound model. These findings underscore the potential of our smart drug delivery system to significantly improve treatment outcomes for bacterial infections, representing a significant advancement in the fight against antibiotic resistance.
40131171	Injectable Functional Microspheres Capable of BMSC Recruitment and Osteogenic Induction for <i>In Situ</i> Bone Regeneration.	Currently, bone defects remain a major challenge in clinical treatment. Recruiting target cells at the defect site and inducing them to differentiate into bone tissue are effective treatment methods. In previous studies, we used the CD271 antibody to construct bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) recruitment microspheres for the treatment of bone defects. However, the osteoconductivity of the microspheres themselves was poor, and the system lacked osteoinductivity, which affected the repair efficiency. In this study, we prepared submillimeter-sized porous chitosan (CS) microspheres through process optimization, and the BMSCs were able to directly adhere and proliferate on their surfaces. After the bioconjugation of the CD271 antibody, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) was further loaded onto the pore structure of microspheres to obtain the injectable microspheres with BMSC recruitment and osteogenic differentiation induction functions. Microspheres could efficiently recruit BMSCs through the combined action of the CD271 antibody and BMP-2 and further induce the recruited BMSCs, differentiating into osteoblasts through BMP-2, which ultimately exhibited promising bone regeneration ability in rats. We expect that the novel functional microspheres have great potential in biomedical applications for <i>in situ</i> treatment of bone defects.
40131146	Physicochemical Properties of Freeze-Dried Bigel-Based Materials Composed of Sodium Alginate/Whey Protein Isolate Hydrogel and Ethylcellulose/Sunflower Oil Oleogel.	Freeze-drying bigels is a novel technique for developing functional materials for dermatological and cosmetic use, leveraging the benefits of two structured phases. This study optimized freeze-dried bigels composed of whey protein isolate (WPI)/sodium alginate/glycerin hydrogel and ethylcellulose (EC)/Span 80/sunflower oil oleogel at varying hydrogel/oleogel ratios. The materials showed swelling ratios from 50% to 255%, with higher values for a lower oleogel content and higher polymer concentration. The higher oleogel content extended the degradation from a few hours to 7 days. The polymer concentrations and hydrogel/oleogel ratios influenced Young's modulus (1.25-3.7 MPa). Porosity varied from 35% to 58%, and density varied from 100 to 200 mg/mL. The residual moisture content (5% to 20%) increased with EC content and decreased with WPI and oleogel content. These findings underscore the role of polymer concentrations and phase ratios in tuning the physicochemical properties of freeze-dried gels, positioning them as promising biomaterials for skincare and cosmetic applications.
40131123	Revealing Mechanopathology Induced by Dengue NS1 Using Organ Chips and Single-Cell Force Spectroscopy.	Capillary leakage is a hallmark of severe dengue, yet its precise mechanisms remain elusive. Emerging evidence highlights the dengue virus's targeting of mechanically active endothelial cells as a key contributor to dengue shock syndrome. The viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been identified as a central player, disrupting endothelial integrity and inducing vascular hyperpermeability independently of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study provides a direct assessment of NS1-induced endothelial pathology by combining single-cell force spectroscopy and a microvessel-on-a-chip platform. We demonstrate that NS1 significantly alters endothelial cell mechanics, reducing cell stiffness and compromising junctional integrity, thereby directly linking these mechanical alterations to vascular dysfunction. These findings establish a framework for understanding the mechano-pathology of dengue and offer a platform for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate severe disease outcomes.

The application's foundation lies in the UnitedAtom multiscale model, previously reported for predicting the adsorption energies of biopolymers and small molecules onto nanoparticles (NPs). <i>UANanoDock</i> offers insights into optimal protein orientations when bound to spherical NP surfaces, considering factors such as material type, NP radius, surface potential, and amino acid (AA) ionization states at specific pH levels. The tool's computational time is determined solely by the protein's AA count, regardless of NP size. With its efficiency (e.g., approximately 60 s processing time for a 1331 AA protein) and versatility (accommodating any protein with a standard AA sequence in PDB format), <i>UANanoDock</i> serves as a prescreening tool for identifying proteins likely to adsorb onto NP surfaces. An illustration of <i>UANanoDock</i>'s utility is provided, demonstrating its application in the rational design of immunoassays by determining the preferred orientation of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody adsorbed on Ag NPs.
40130959	Insights into Protein Unfolding under pH, Temperature, and Shear Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations.	Protein biologics hold immense potential in therapeutic applications, but their ephemeral nature has hindered widespread application. The effects of different stressors on protein folding have long been studied, but whether these stressors induce protein unfolding through different pathways remains unclear. Here, we conduct all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the unfolding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) under three distinct stressors: high temperature, acidic pH, and shear stress. Our findings reveal that each stressor induces unique unfolding patterns in BSA, indicating stressor-specific unfolding pathways. Structural analyses show that high temperature significantly disrupts the protein's secondary structure, while acidic pH causes alternations in the tertiary structure, leading to domain separation. Shear stress initially perturbs the tertiary structure, initiating structural rearrangements, which causes a loss of secondary structure similar to temperature. These distinct unfolding behaviors suggest that different stabilization strategies are required to enhance protein stability under different denaturation conditions.
40130648	Enhancing Biodegradable Bone Plate Performance: Stereocomplex Polylactic Acid for Improved Mechanical Properties and Near-Infrared Transparency.	The use of biodegradable materials in bone plates offers remarkable advantages; however, their application in bone fixation is limited by their brittleness. Moreover, treatments tailored to patient conditions are needed in orthopedics. In this study, bone plates were fabricated with stereocomplex polylactic acid (scPLA) and the effects of poly(d-lactic acid) molecular weight and scPLA blending ratios were analyzed. Although modulus values of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) and scPLA were similar, strain resistance improved at higher scPLA proportions. The enhanced elongation was owing to the presence of tie molecules within the scPLA as opposed to single PLA chains. The fabricated scPLA bone plates exhibited improved mechanical properties and transparency in the optical and near-infrared ranges. scPLA was characterized by a smaller crystallite size. These properties of scPLA combined with its biocompatibility indicate potential for various diagnostic and therapeutic orthopedic applications. Comparisons with commercial PLLA-based bone plates show no significant differences in in vivo bone-healing ability.
40130478	Phlorizin mitigates high glucose-induced metabolic disorders through the IIS pathway in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.	Phlorizin is a dihydrochalcone with various biological activities. To elucidate the mechanism of mitigating high glucose-induced metabolic disorders by phlorizin, the integrated approach combining metabolomics and gene expression profiling was used. The results demonstrated that phlorizin effectively mitigated the impact of high glucose on various growth indicators of <i>C. elegans</i>, as well as decreased lipofuscin, ROS, glucose and triglyceride levels. Metabolomics analysis revealed that phlorizin significantly affected the metabolic pathways of carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids in <i>C. elegans</i>, indicating its potential role in maintaining energy homeostasis. Gene expression analysis indicated that phlorizin reversed the downregulation of IIS, mTOR and lipid metabolism pathways and promoted the nuclear translocation of DAF-16. In the <i>C. elegans</i> mutant BQ1, the effect of phlorizin on lowering glucose and triglyceride levels was eliminated, meaning that AKT-1 was found to be a key target protein for phlorizin's hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering effects. Molecular docking results also indicated a strong interaction between phlorizin and AKT-1 protein. In summary, phlorizin alleviated metabolic disorders and gene expression imbalances induced by high glucose, and AKT-1 was first found as the key target protein for phlorizin achieving hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects.
40129391	Improving Complex Coacervate Tissue Adhesive Performance Using Bridging Polymer Chains.	Complex coacervates have emerged as promising tissue adhesives due to their excellent wet adhesion and tunable properties. However, maintaining stable adhesion on soft, dynamic tissues remains challenging. In this study, the use of a bridging polymer was investigated to enhance the adhesive properties of a complex coacervate adhesive (CCA) composed of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (pAH) and polysulfopropyl methacrylate (pSPMA). The CCA undergoes solidification as a result of a change in salt concentration, forming a robust adhesive under physiological conditions. Pretreatment with pAH, but not pSPMA, significantly improved adhesion energy on both model hydrogels and biological tissues by forming a polymer-rich bridging layer at the interface. The beneficial effect was driven by accumulation of pAH in superficial layers of both the CCA and the substrates. This enabled the CCA to withstand higher deformation before adhesive failure. These findings underscore the potential of bridging polymers to improve CCAs and other tissue adhesives for biomedical applications.
40129032	MFF-nDA: A Computational Model for ncRNA-Disease Association Prediction Based on Multimodule Fusion.	Noncoding RNAs(ncRNAs), including piwi-interacting RNA(piRNA), long noncoding RNA(lncRNA), microRNA(miRNA), small nucleolar RNA(snoRNA), and circular RNA(circRNA), contribute significantly to gene expression regulation and serve as key factors in disease association studies and health-related exploration. Accurate prediction of ncRNA-disease associations is crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and advancing therapeutic development. Recently, computational models based on a graph neural network have extensively emerged for identifying associations among various ncRNAs and diseases. However, existing computational models have not fully utilized integrative information on ncRNs and diseases, and reliance on GNN-based models alone may be limited in performance due to oversmoothing issues. On the other hand, existing models are mainly targeted at a specific type of ncRNA and may not be applicable to most ncRNAs. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, we propound a computational model MFF-nDA based on multimodule fusion. Specifically, we first introduce five types of similarity network information, including three types of ncRNA and two types of disease similarity information, in order to fully explore and optimize the multisource feature information on these entities. Subsequently, we establish three modules: heterogeneous network representation module based on Transformer, association network representation module based on graph convolutional network (GCN), and topological structure representation module based on graph attention network (GAT), which capture diverse features of nodes in heterogeneous networks and topological structure information reflected in association networks. The complementary effects of the three modules also help relieve the oversmoothing issue to some extent. By leveraging the multimodule fusion learning to comprehensively capture the diverse features of these entities, our model outperforms the available state-of-the-art methods, achieving an AUC greater than 0.9000 for each dataset. This demonstrates the highest predictive performance, making it a valuable tool for identifying potential ncRNA associated with diseases. The code of MFF-nDA can be accessed at https://github.com/Jack-Cxy/MFF-nDA.
40129029	Optimized Protein-Excipient Interactions in the Martini 3 Force Field.	The high doses of drugs required for biotherapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and the small volumes that can be administered to patients by subcutaneous injections pose challenges due to high-concentration formulations. The addition of excipients, such as arginine and glutamate, to high-concentration protein formulations can increase solubility and reduce the tendency of protein particle formation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide microscopic insights into the mode of action of excipients in mAb formulations but require large system sizes and long time scales that are currently beyond reach at the fully atomistic level. Computationally efficient coarse-grained models such as the Martini 3 force field can tackle this challenge but require careful parametrization, testing, and validation. This study extends the popular Martini 3 force field toward realistic protein-excipient interactions of arginine and glutamate excipients, using the Fab domains of the therapeutic mAbs trastuzumab and omalizumab as model systems. A novel all-atom to coarse-grained mapping of the amino acid excipients is introduced, which explicitly captures the zwitterionic character of the backbone. The Fab-excipient interactions of arginine and glutamate are characterized concerning molecular contacts with the Fabs at the single-residue level. The Martini 3 simulations are compared with results from all-atom simulations as a reference. Our findings reveal an overestimation of Fab-excipient contacts with the default interaction parameters of Martini 3, suggesting a too strong attraction between protein residues and excipients. Therefore, we reparametrized the protein-excipient interaction parameters in Martini 3 against all-atom simulations. The excipient interactions obtained with the new Martini 3 mapping and Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction parameters, coined Martini 3-exc, agree closely with the all-atom reference data. This work presents an improved parameter set for mAb-arginine and mAb-glutamate interactions in the Martini 3 coarse-grained force field, a key step toward large-scale coarse-grained MD simulations of high-concentration mAb formulations and the stabilizing effects of excipients.
40128096	Enhanced Photosensitizer-Embedded Glycopolymers through Self-Catalytic PET-RAFT Polymerization for Targeted PDT.	PET-RAFT polymerization enables precise polymer synthesis, yet conventional systems require an excess chain transfer agent (CTA) over unbound photocatalysts (PCs). Herein, a self-catalyzed strategy employing polymerizable porphyrin MTPPZnH as a dual-functional PC effectively embeds high photosensitizer content into glycopolymers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Three galactose-bearing monomers (acrylate, methacrylate, 4-vinylbenzoate) were polymerized via PET-RAFT under optimized light conditions, achieving satisfactory <i>M</i><sub><i>n</i></sub> and relatively narrow <i>Đ</i>. Mechanistic studies revealed that photoexcited MTPPZnH transfers electrons/energy to CTA via a PET process, initiating polymerization, with DMSO enhancing oxygen depletion. Water-soluble glycopolymeric photosensitizers exhibited high fluorescence and singlet oxygen quantum yield. <i>In vitro</i>, galactose-bearing photosensitizers showed superior ASGPR-mediated endocytosis in HepG2 cells over Huh-7 and MCF-7 cells, enabling targeted PDT. The incorporation of MTPPZnH contributes to an effective multifunctional strategy, offering a promising approach for the development of high photosensitizer-embedded polymeric photosensitizers for potential PDT applications.
40127309	Leveraging Transfer Learning for Predicting Protein-Small-Molecule Interaction Predictions.	A complex web of intermolecular interactions defines and regulates biological processes. Understanding this web has been particularly challenging because of the sheer number of actors in biological systems: ∼10<sup>4</sup> proteins in a typical human cell offer plausible 10<sup>8</sup> interactions. This number grows rapidly if we consider metabolites, drugs, nutrients, and other biological molecules. The relative strength of interactions also critically affects these biological processes. However, the small and often incomplete data sets (10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> protein-ligand interactions) traditionally used for binding affinity predictions limit the ability to capture the full complexity of these interactions. To overcome this challenge, we developed Yuel 2, a novel neural network-based approach that leverages transfer learning to address the limitations of small data sets. Yuel 2 is pretrained on a large-scale data set to learn intricate structural features and then fine-tuned on specialized data sets like PDBbind to enhance the predictive accuracy and robustness. We show that Yuel 2 predicts multiple binding affinity metrics, <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>, <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>, and IC<sub>50</sub>, between proteins and small molecules, offering a comprehensive representation of molecular interactions crucial for drug design and development.
40127295	Biobased Physicochemical Reversible Dual-Cross-Linked Hydrogel: Self-Healing, Antibacterial, Antioxidant, and Hemostatic Properties for Diabetic Wound Healing.	Skin wound healing remains challenging due to a lack of ideal wound dressings suitable for acute and chronic wounds. This study introduced a biocompatible hydrogel wound dressing, synthesized through a green chemistry approach, specifically designed to meet the dual needs of acute and chronic wound care. The innovative strategy utilized sustainable biomaterials, soy protein, and vanillin, to construct a physical-reversible chemical dual-cross-linked hydrogel exhibiting high mechanical strength, excellent adhesion, and toughness. Schiff base reversible covalent bonds enabled rapid self-healing within 10 s, significantly improving durability. In a rat liver hemorrhage model, the hydrogel rapidly sealed wounds, achieving effective hemostasis, indicating great potential for acute wound care. Furthermore, vanillin imparted the hydrogel with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, effectively accelerating diabetic chronic wound healing. This safe and efficient advanced biobased hydrogel offers a novel perspective for wound treatment and holds significant promise for clinical applications.
40127241	Hydrolysate of goat milk casein supplementation alleviates hyperuricemia and modulates gut microbiota in C57BL6/J mice.	Over the past two decades, the occurrence of hyperuricemia and its influence on health have drawn lots of concern all over the world. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of hyperuricemia in various studies, effective medications without side effects are not available. Nutraceutical supplements have attracted much attention due to their beneficial and non-toxic side effects compared to chemical compounds. In the present study, mice with hyperuricemia induced by potassium oxalate and hypoxanthine were given hydrolysate of goat milk casein (HGMC) to investigate its beneficial effects on hyperuricemia. HGMC significantly alleviated body weight loss and abnormal water consumption in hyperuricemic mice. Further study showed that HGMC effectively eliminated renal histological damage in mice with hyperuricemia. Real-time PCR and western blot results revealed that HGMC alleviated protein levels of inflammation-associated proteins and cellular pyroptosis-associated proteins, including NLRP3, TNF-α, Caspase1 and TGF-β. Intestinal microbial sequencing showed that supplementation of HGMC increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria and decreased pathogenic flora. In conclusion, our results suggest that the beneficial effects of HGMC on hyperuricemia are associated with regulating inflammation and modulating intestinal bacteria in mice.
40127128	A Deep Retrieval-Enhanced Meta-Learning Framework for Enzyme Optimum pH Prediction.	The potential of hydrogen (pH) influences the function of the enzyme. Measuring or predicting the optimal pH (pH<sub>opt</sub>) at which enzymes exhibit maximal catalytic activity is crucial for enzyme design and application. The rapid development of enzyme mining and de novo design has produced a large number of new enzymes, making it impractical to measure their pHopt in the wet laboratory. Consequently, in-silico computational approaches such as machine learning and deep learning models, which offer pH prediction at minimal cost, have attracted considerable interest. This work presents Venus-DREAM, an enzyme pH<sub>opt</sub> prediction model based on the <i>k</i>NN algorithm and few-shot learning, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in pHopt prediction. Venus-DREAM regards the pH<sub>opt</sub> prediction of an enzyme as a few-shot learning task: learning from the <i>k</i>-closest labeled enzymes to predict the pH<sub>opt</sub> of the target enzyme. The value of <i>k</i> is determined by the optimal <i>k</i>-value of the <i>k</i>NN regression algorithm. And the distance between two enzymes is defined as the cosine similarity of their mean-pooled embeddings obtained from protein language models (PLMs). The few-shot learner is based on the Reptile algorithm, which first adapts to the <i>k</i>-nearest labeled enzymes to create a specialized model for the target enzyme and then predicts its pH<sub>opt</sub>. This efficient method enables high-throughput virtual exploration of protein space, facilitating the identification of sequences with the desired pH<sub>opt</sub> ranges in a high-throughput manner. Moreover, our method can be easily adapted in other protein function prediction tasks.
40127113	Oxidized Xanthan Gum Cross-Linked N-O Carboxymethyl Chitosan Hydrogel Promotes Spheroid Formation of Murine Fibroblast by Increasing Cell-Cell Interaction and Integrin αv Expression.	Naturally derived Schiff-based hydrogels are widely fabricated for tissue engineering applications. However, limited studies have explored how the physicochemical and functional groups on polymer chains affect cell behavior in three dimensions. To address this limitation, we fabricated cytocompatible N-O carboxymethyl chitosan (NOCC) cross-linked with oxidized xanthan gum (OXG), incorporating various aldehyde (-CHO) contents (NO1, NO2, and NO3) while maintaining a constant concentration of NOCC, resulting in hydrogels with diverse viscoelastic and aldehyde content properties. The results demonstrated significant differences in storage modulus (<i>G</i>') and loss modulus (<i>G</i>″), attributed to cross-linking density through imine bonds (-C═<i>N</i>-). These differences influenced murine fibroblast aggregation, spheroid formation, and cell migration, proliferation, and viability over time. Both NO1 and NO2 exhibited good cell viability, with slight differences in spheroid morphology compared to those of NO3 and Matrigel samples. To further explore cell behaviors, integrin αV (CD51) expression was assessed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunofluorescence. The results aligned with prior observations, with the quantitative analysis of integrin αV expression, normalized to 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescence, revealing a notable 2.1-fold increase in fluorescence intensity for the NO2 hydrogel in comparison to NO1 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). These findings indicate that the hydrogel composed of 2% (w/v) NOCC cross-linked with 2% (w/v) OXG in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio represents the optimal condition for promoting murine fibroblast growth and spheroid formation. These results provide a robust foundation for future research aimed at modulating cell behavior through precise adjustments of scaffold properties, thereby advancing the potential for translational applications from laboratory research to clinical settings.
40126413	CGsmiles: A Versatile Line Notation for Molecular Representations across Multiple Resolutions.	Coarse-grained (CG) models simplify molecular representations by grouping multiple atoms into effective particles, enabling faster simulations and reducing the chemical compound space compared to atomistic methods. Additionally, models with chemical specificity, such as Martini, may extrapolate to cases where experimental data is scarce, making CG methods highly promising for high-throughput (HT) screenings and chemical space exploration. Yet no rigorous data formats exist for the crucial aspect of describing how the atoms are grouped (i.e., the mapping). As CG models advance toward true HT capabilities, the lack of mappings and indexing capabilities for the growing number of CG molecules poses a significant barrier. To address this, we introduce CGsmiles, a versatile line notation inspired by the popular Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) and BigSMILES. CGsmiles encodes the molecular graph and particle (atom) properties independent of their resolution and incorporates a framework that allows seamless conversion between coarse- and fine-grained resolutions. By specifying fragments that describe how each particle is represented at the next finer resolution (e.g., CG particles to atoms), CGsmiles can represent multiple resolutions and their hierarchical relationships in a single string. In this paper, we present the CGSmiles syntax and analyze a benchmark set of 407 molecules from the Martini force field. We highlight key features missing in existing notations that are essential for accurately describing CG models. To demonstrate the utility of CGsmiles beyond simulations, we construct two simple machine-learning models for predicting partition coefficients, both trained on CGsmiles-indexed data and leveraging information from both CG and atomistic resolutions. Finally, we briefly discuss the applicability of CGsmiles to polymers, which particularly benefit from the multiresolution nature of the notation.
40126388	<i>Malus hupehensis</i> leaves: a functional beverage for alleviating hepatic inflammation and modulating gut microbiota in diabetic mice.	<i>Malus hupehensis</i> leaves (MHL), consumed as a daily beverage in Chinese folk tradition and recently recognized as a new food material, are abundant in polyphenols and bioactive compounds that demonstrate hypoglycemic, lipid-lowering, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the antidiabetic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the protective mechanisms of <i>Malus hupehensis</i> leaves' extract (MHLE) against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The results showed that MHLE effectively ameliorated glucose and lipid metabolic abnormalities in db/db mice, and attenuated hepatic macrophage activation. Transcriptomic analysis of the liver revealed that MHLE primarily affects genes involved in inflammatory responses and inhibited the TLR4/MAPK pathway to reduce hepatic inflammation. Metagenomic sequencing identified changes in gut microbiota composition and showed that MHLE restored the abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae bacterium</i>, <i>Oscillospiraceae bacterium</i>, and <i>Clostridia bacterium</i> while reducing the abundance of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, thereby ameliorating gut dysbiosis. The integrated regulation of metabolism, immune response, and the microbial environment by MHLE significantly alleviated symptoms of T2DM. This study offers strong scientific evidence for the potential use of MHL as a functional food.
40126168	Assessing the impact of food-derived bioactives on digestive proteases by <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> approaches.	The interactions between food components and digestive tract enzymes can affect nutrient absorption and impact an individual's health. Certain components, particularly polyphenols, are reported to inhibit digestive enzymes and are commonly referred to as anti-nutritional factors. Reports on this subject often contradict each other, highlighting the need for consistent methodologies to assess the potential impact of bioactive compounds. This study evaluated the "<i>in vitro</i>" activity of pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin using ovalbumin, gluten, and haemoglobin as substrates in the presence or absence of twenty-five bioactive natural compounds belonging to different chemical classes at gastro-intestinal physiological concentrations (0.1 mM). The results indicate that bioactives may have opposite effects on proteolytic activity depending on the substrate/enzyme combination and bioactives structure. With ovalbumin as substrate, piceid and resveratrol were described as strong chymotrypsin activators (+1.46- and 1.17-fold change, respectively), phloridzin dihydrate as a weaker activator (+0.41-fold change), while phloretin was a strong inhibitor (-0.65-fold change). A computational approach based on molecular docking and dynamics simulations was used to investigate the interactions between selected bioactives, chymotrypsin and ovalbumin. The "<i>in silico</i>" study included piceid and phloridzin dihydrate, as well as their respective aglycones (resveratrol and phloretin). The results obtained through computational modelling indicate that all four bioactives can interact with chymotrypsin. However, only those bioactives that enhance <i>in vitro</i> proteolytic activity induce a partial unfolding of ovalbumin's structure. This suggests that the effect of bioactive compounds on protein digestion may be substrate-dependent, and may vary depending on the specific protein being digested.
40125929	Mechanistic Study of Protein Interaction with Natto Inhibitory Peptides Targeting Xanthine Oxidase: Insights from Machine Learning and Molecular Dynamics Simulations.	Bioactive peptides from food sources offer a safe and biocompatible approach to enzyme inhibition, with potential applications in managing metabolic disorders such as hyperuricemia and gout, conditions linked to excessive xanthine oxidase activity. Using a machine learning-based screening approach inspired by the bioactivity of natto, two peptides, ECFK and FECK, were identified from the <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> proteome and validated as xanthine oxidase inhibitors with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 37.36 and 71.57 mM, respectively. Further experiments confirmed their safety through cytotoxicity assays, and electronic tongue analysis demonstrated their mild sensory properties, supporting their edibility. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that these peptides stabilize critical enzyme regions, with ECFK showing a higher dissociation energy barrier (52.08 kcal/mol) than FECK (46.39 kcal/mol), indicating strong, stable interactions. This study highlights food-derived peptides as safe and natural inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, offering promising therapeutic potential for metabolic disorder management.
40125564	Animal Models of Orthopedic Implant-Associated Infections and Revisions.	Orthopedic implant-associated infections such as prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) lead to devastating complications for patients and impose significant financial burdens on the healthcare systems. Although the primary orthopedic implant associated infection rate is relatively low (0.3-9%), the reinfection rate after implant revisions can be as high as 20% to 40%. To evaluate novel therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating infections associated with primary and revision implants, it is essential to develop appropriate animal models that closely emulate clinical realities. Here we discuss existing animal models developed for orthopedic implant revision surgeries including small animal models in rats and mice, and larger animal models in rabbits, sheep, and mini-pigs. While larger animal models offer the advantage of more closely mimicking human surgical procedures, implant dimensions, and infection treatment protocols, rodent models are more cost-effective and better suited for screening experimental prophylaxes and therapeutics. Existing animal revision models have focused on primary infections established by <i>Staphylococcal aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) and revisions involving both one-stage and two-stage procedures. Further development of smaller animal implant revision models that implement more clinically relevant surgical procedures and recapitulate polymicrobial infections could facilitate the discovery and more rigorous evaluation of novel implant coating prophylaxes and therapeutics for reducing reinfection rates following implant revisions.
40123577	Correction: The comparative effects of ω-7 fatty acid-rich sea buckthorn oil and ω-3 fatty acid-rich DHA algal oil on improving high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia.	Correction for 'The comparative effects of ω-7 fatty acid-rich sea buckthorn oil and ω-3 fatty acid-rich DHA algal oil on improving high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia' by Jing Li <i>et al.</i>, <i>Food Funct.</i>, 2025, <b>16</b>, 1241-1253, https://doi.org/10.1039/D4FO04961F.
40119803	ATP-Pred: Prediction of Protein-ATP Binding Residues via Fusion of Residue-Level Embeddings and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network.	Accurately identifying protein-ATP binding residues is essential for understanding biological processes and designing drugs. However, current sequence-based methods have limitations, such as difficulties in extracting discriminative features and the need for more efficient algorithms. Additionally, methods based on multiple sequence alignments often face challenges in handling large-scale predictions. To address these issues, we developed ATP-Pred, a sequence-based method for predicting ATP-binding residues in proteins. This model applies transfer learning by using two recently developed pretrain protein language models, Ankh and ProstT5, to extract residue-level embeddings that capture protein functionality. ATP-Pred also integrates a CNN-BiLSTM network and a Kolmogorov-Arnold network to build the prediction model. To handle data imbalance, we introduced a weighted focal loss function. Experimental results on three independent test data sets showed that ATP-Pred outperforms most existing methods. Its generalizability was further validated on four protein-mononucleotide binding residue data sets, where it delivered promising results. These findings suggest that ATP-Pred is a robust and reliable predictor.
40119793	Hierarchical Deep Potential with Structure Constraints for Efficient Coarse-Grained Modeling.	Coarse-grained molecular dynamics is a powerful approach for simulating large-scale systems by reducing the number of degrees of freedom. Nonetheless, the development of accurate coarse-grained force fields remains challenging, particularly for complex systems, such as polymers. In this study, we introduce a novel framework, hierarchical deep potential with structure constraints (HDP-SC), designed to construct coarse-grained force fields for polymer materials. Our methodology integrates a prior energy term obtained through direct Boltzmann inversion with a deep neural network potential, which is trained using hierarchical bead environment descriptors. This framework facilitates the reproduction of structural distributions and the potential of mean force, thus enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the coarse-grained model. We validate our approach using polystyrene systems, demonstrating that the HDP-SC model not only successfully reproduces the structural properties of these systems but also remains applicable at larger scales. Our findings underscore the promise of machine learning-based techniques in advancing the development of coarse-grained force fields for polymer materials.
40118775	Hybrid Pectin-Fibroin Microgels with Supramolecular and Covalent Cross-Links.	Sugar beet pectin, an anionic polysaccharide, and silk fibroin, a high molecular weight protein, undergo gelation through ionic interactions and conformational changes, leading to hydrogel formation. Although many studies have focused on bulk gel systems involving polysaccharides and proteins, more research is needed to investigate their properties at the microscale level. In this context, we have developed a microgel system based on a pectin/fibroin combination and investigated its properties. We focused on two gelation mechanisms: physical cross-linking and enzymatic covalent cross-linking. The pectin/fibroin microgels were fabricated using droplet-based microfluidics, and the secondary structure, mechanical properties, and degradation profiles were investigated. Our experimental results show that the microgels exhibit an ordered β-sheet structure, a Young's modulus in the range of 10 to 20 kPa, and that degradation can be promoted using protease enzymes. Finally, the biocompatibility of the microgels is assessed using the Alamar Blue cell viability assay with human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPFs). This research presents a highly functional hybrid biomaterial produced from waste products and a structural protein, demonstrating its cell compatibility and potential in tissue engineering applications.
40118521	De novo antibody identification in human blood from full-length single B cell transcriptomics and matching haplotype-resolved germline assemblies.	Immunoglobulin (<i>IGH</i>, <i>IGK</i>, <i>IGL</i>) loci in the human genome are highly polymorphic regions that encode the building blocks of the light and heavy chain IG proteins that dimerize to form antibodies. The processes of V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation in B cells are responsible for creating an enormous reservoir of highly specific antibodies capable of binding a vast array of possible antigens. However, the antibody repertoire is fundamentally limited by the set of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) alleles present in the germline IG loci. To better understand how the germline IG haplotypes contribute to the expressed antibody repertoire, we combined genome sequencing of the germline IG loci with single-cell transcriptome sequencing of B cells from the same donor. Sequencing and assembly of the germline IG loci captured the <i>IGH</i> locus in a single fully phased contig where the maternal and paternal contributions to the germline V, D, and J repertoire can be fully resolved. The B cells were collected following a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination, resulting in a population of cells that were activated in response to this specific immune challenge. Single-cell, full-length transcriptome sequencing of these B cells results in whole transcriptome characterization of each cell, as well as highly accurate consensus sequences for the somatically rearranged and hypermutated light and heavy chain IG transcripts. A subset of antibodies synthesized based on their consensus heavy and light chain transcript sequences demonstrate binding to measles antigens and neutralization of authentic measles virus.
40117506	Enhanced Whole Tumor Cell-Based Vaccines by a RAFT and Protein Fusion Strategy for Tumor Immunotherapy.	Inactivated whole tumor cell-based vaccines (WTVs) are a promising strategy for tumor immunotherapy, but have exhibited limited antitumor effects clinically. Aiming at constructing enhanced WTVs, we developed glycopolymer-engineered WTVs (G-WTVs) using a Halo-Tag protein (HTP) fusion technique and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. In our study, G-WTVs with varying molecular weights of glycopolymers were constructed. Compared to unmodified tumor cells, all G-WTVs effectively induced the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype and promoted the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This enhanced immune response was attributed to the improved interactions between G-WTVs and the macrophages. Among the G-WTVs, the medium molecular weight variant demonstrated the most pronounced enhancement of antitumor immune responses. Notably, the administration of optimized G-WTVs effectively inhibited the growth of B16 melanoma in mice. Our findings provide a new approach to enhance the antitumor efficacy of WTVs via cell membrane glycopolymer engineering, offering a promising strategy for tumor immunotherapy.
40116538	DeepMFFGO: A Protein Function Prediction Method for Large-Scale Multifeature Fusion.	Protein functional studies are crucial in the fields of drug target discovery and drug design. However, the existing methods have significant bottlenecks in utilizing multisource data fusion and Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. To this end, this study innovatively proposes the DeepMFFGO model designed for protein function prediction under large-scale multifeature fusion. A fine-tuning strategy using intermediate-level feature selection is proposed to reduce redundancy in protein sequences and mitigate distortion of the top-level features. A hierarchical progressive fusion structure is designed to explore feature connections, optimize complementarity through dynamic weight allocation, and reduce redundant interference. On the CAFA3 data set, the <i>F</i><sub>max</sub> values of the DeepMFFGO model on the MF, BP, and CC ontologies reach 0.702, 0.599, and 0.704, respectively, which are improved by 4.2%, 2.4%, and 0.07%, respectively, compared with state-of-the-art multisource methods.
40116044	ChiGNN: Interpretable Algorithm Framework of Molecular Chiral Knowledge-Embedding and Stereosensitive Property Prediction.	Molecular chirality-related tasks have remained a notable challenge in materials machine learning (ML) due to the subtle spatial discrepancy between enantiomers. Designing appropriate steric molecular descriptions and embedding chiral knowledge are of great significance for improving the accuracy and interpretability of ML models. In this work, we propose a state-of-the-art deep learning framework, Chiral Graph Neural Network, which can effectively incorporate chiral physicochemical knowledge via Trinity Graph and stereosensitive Message Aggregation encoding. Combined with the quantile regression technique, the accuracy of the chiral chromatographic retention time prediction model outperformed the existing records. Accounting for the inherent merits of this framework, we have customized the Trinity Mask and Contribution Splitting techniques to enable a multilevel interpretation of the model's decision mechanism at atomic, functional group, and molecular hierarchy levels. This interpretation has both scientific and practical implications for the understanding of chiral chromatographic separation and the selection of chromatographic stationary phases. Moreover, the proposed chiral knowledge embedding and interpretable deep learning framework, together with the stereomolecular representation, chiral knowledge embedding method, and multilevel interpretation technique within it, also provide an extensible template and precedent for future chirality-related or stereosensitive ML tasks.
40115981	Integrative Computational Analysis of Common EXO5 Haplotypes: Impact on Protein Dynamics, Genome Stability, and Cancer Progression.	Understanding the impact of common germline variants on protein structure, function, and disease progression is crucial in cancer research. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the <i>EXO5</i> gene, which encodes a DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair that was previously associated with cancer susceptibility. We employed an integrated approach combining genomic and clinical data analysis, deep learning variant effect prediction, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the effects of common <i>EXO5</i> haplotypes on protein structure, dynamics, and cancer outcomes. We characterized the haplotype structure of <i>EXO5</i> across diverse human populations, identifying five common haplotypes, and studied their impact on the EXO5 protein. Extensive, all-atom MD simulations revealed significant structural and dynamic differences among the EXO5 protein variants, particularly in their catalytic region. The L151P EXO5 protein variant exhibited the most substantial conformational changes, potentially disruptive for EXO5's function and nuclear localization. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed that cancer patients carrying L151P EXO5 had significantly shorter progression-free survival in prostate and pancreatic cancers and exhibited increased genomic instability. This study highlights the strength of our methodology in uncovering the effects of common genetic variants on protein function and their implications for disease outcomes.
40114391	ROS-Responsive Cationic Polymers with Intrinsic Anti-Inflammatory Activity for Intracellular Protein Delivery.	The intracellular delivery of protein drugs via nanocarriers offers significant potential for expanding their therapeutic applications. However, the unintended activation of innate immune responses and inflammation triggered by the carriers presents a major challenge, often compromising therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present oligoethylenimine-thioketal (OEI-TK), a reactive oxygen species-responsive cationic polymer with intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties, to overcome this challenge. OEI-TK self-assembles electrostatically with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form stable nanoparticles (OTB NPs) with excellent encapsulation efficiency. In vitro studies confirmed that OTB NPs retained OEI-TK's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, enhanced biocompatibility, and efficiently delivered BSA into cells. Furthermore, OEI-TK facilitated the intracellular delivery of β-galactosidase while preserving its enzymatic activity, demonstrating its potential for functional protein transport. These findings highlight OEI-TK as a promising platform with dual benefits of inflammation modulation and intracellular protein delivery, holding potential for the synergistic treatment of inflammation-related diseases.
40114317	Application of Large Language Models in Drug-Induced Osteotoxicity Prediction.	Drug-induced osteotoxicity refers to the harmful effects certain drugs have on the skeletal system, posing significant safety risks. These toxic effects are a key concern in clinical practice, drug development, and environmental management. However, existing toxicity assessment models lack specialized data sets and algorithms for predicting osteotoxicity. In our study, we collected osteotoxic molecules and employed various large language models, including DeepSeek and ChatGPT, alongside traditional machine learning methods to predict their properties. Among these, the DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT o3 models achieved ACC values of 0.87 and 0.88, respectively. Our results indicate that machine learning methods can assist in evaluating the impact of harmful substances on bone health during drug development, improving safety protocols, mitigating skeletal side effects, and enhancing treatment outcomes and public safety. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of large language models in predicting molecular toxicity and their significance in the fields of health and chemical sciences.
40113266	Optical genome mapping enables accurate testing of large repeat expansions.	Short tandem repeats (STRs) are common variations in human genomes that frequently expand or contract, causing genetic disorders, mainly when expanded. Traditional diagnostic methods for identifying these expansions, such as repeat-primed PCR and Southern blotting, are often labor-intensive, locus-specific, and are unable to precisely determine long repeat expansions. Sequencing-based methods, although capable of genome-wide detection, are limited by inaccuracy (short-read technologies) and high associated costs (long-read technologies). This study evaluated optical genome mapping (OGM) as an efficient, accurate approach for measuring STR lengths and assessing somatic stability in 85 samples with known pathogenic repeat expansions in <i>DMPK</i>, <i>CNBP</i>, and <i>RFC1</i>, causing myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 and cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), respectively. Three workflows-manual de novo assembly, local guided assembly (local-GA), and a molecule distance script-were applied, of which the latter two were developed as part of this study to assess the repeat sizes and somatic repeat stability. OGM successfully identified 84/85 (98.8%) of the pathogenic expansions, distinguishing between wild-type and expanded alleles or between two expanded alleles in recessive cases, with greater accuracy than standard of care (SOC) for long repeats and no apparent upper size limit. Notably, OGM detected somatic instability in a subset of <i>DMPK</i>, <i>CNBP</i>, and <i>RFC1</i> samples. These findings suggest OGM could advance diagnostic accuracy for large repeat expansions, providing a more comprehensive genome-wide assay for repeat expansion disorders by measuring exact repeat lengths and somatic instability across multiple loci simultaneously.
40113264	Integration of transcriptomics and long-read genomics prioritizes structural variants in rare disease.	Rare structural variants (SVs)-insertions, deletions, and complex rearrangements-can cause Mendelian disease, yet they remain difficult to accurately detect and interpret. We sequenced and analyzed Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read genomes of 68 individuals from the undiagnosed disease network (UDN) with no previously identified diagnostic mutations from short-read sequencing. Using our optimized SV detection pipelines and 571 control long-read genomes, we detected 716 long-read rare (MAF < 0.01) SV alleles per genome on average, achieving a 2.4× increase from short reads. To characterize the functional effects of rare SVs, we assessed their relationship with gene expression from blood or fibroblasts from the same individuals and found that rare SVs overlapping enhancers were enriched (LOR = 0.46) near expression outliers. We also evaluated tandem repeat expansions (TREs) and found 14 rare TREs per genome; notably, these TREs were also enriched near overexpression outliers. To prioritize candidate functional SVs, we developed Watershed-SV, a probabilistic model that integrates expression data with SV-specific genomic annotations, which significantly outperforms baseline models that do not incorporate expression data. Watershed-SV identified a median of eight high-confidence functional SVs per UDN genome. Notably, this included compound heterozygous deletions in <i>FAM177A1</i> shared by two siblings, which were likely causal for a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Our observations demonstrate the promise of integrating long-read sequencing with gene expression toward improving the prioritization of functional SVs and TREs in rare disease patients.
40113263	Expanded methylome and quantitative trait loci detection by long-read profiling of personal DNA.	Structural variants (SVs) are omnipresent in human DNA, yet their genotype and methylation statuses are rarely characterized due to previous limitations in genome assembly and detection of modified nucleotides. Also, the extent to which SVs act as methylation quantitative trait loci (SV-mQTLs) is largely unknown. Here, we generated a pangenome graph summarizing SVs in 782 de novo assemblies obtained from Genomic Answers for Kids, capturing 14.6 million CpG dinucleotides that are absent from the CHM13v2 reference (SV-CpGs), thus expanding their number by 43.6%. Using 435 methylomes, we genotyped 4.06 million SV-CpGs, of which 3.93 million (96.8%) are methylated at least once. Nonrepeat sequences contribute 1.59 × 10<sup>6</sup> novel SV-CpGs, followed by centromeric satellites (6.57 × 10<sup>5</sup>), simple repeats (5.40 × 10<sup>5</sup>), <i>Alu</i> elements (5.07 × 10<sup>5</sup>), satellites (2.17 × 10<sup>5</sup>), LINE-1s (1.83 × 10<sup>5</sup>), and SVA (SINE-VNTR-<i>Alu</i>) elements (1.50 × 10<sup>5</sup>). Centromeric satellites, simple repeats, and SVAs are overrepresented in SV-CpGs versus reference CpGs. Similarly, methylation levels in SV-CpGs are more variable than in reference CpGs. To explore if SVs are potentially causal for functional variation, we measured SV-mQTLs. This revealed over 230,464 methylation bins where the methylation is associated with common SVs within 100 kbp. Finally, we identified 65,659 methylation bins (28.5%) where the leading QTL variant is an SV. In conclusion, we demonstrate that graph pangenomes provide full SV structures, the associated methylation variation, and reveal tens of thousands of SV-mQTLs, underscoring the importance of assembly based analyses of human traits.
40113261	Unraveling the hidden complexity of cancer through long-read sequencing.	Cancer is fundamentally a disease of the genome, characterized by extensive genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic alterations. Most current studies predominantly use short-read sequencing, gene panels, or microarrays to explore these alterations; however, these technologies can systematically miss or misrepresent certain types of alterations, especially structural variants, complex rearrangements, and alterations within repetitive regions. Long-read sequencing is rapidly emerging as a transformative technology for cancer research by providing a comprehensive view across the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, including the ability to detect alterations that previous technologies have overlooked. In this Perspective, we explore the current applications of long-read sequencing for both germline and somatic cancer analysis. We provide an overview of the computational methodologies tailored to long-read data and highlight key discoveries and resources within cancer genomics that were previously inaccessible with prior technologies. We also address future opportunities and persistent challenges, including the experimental and computational requirements needed to scale to larger sample sizes, the hurdles in sequencing and analyzing complex cancer genomes, and opportunities for leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies for cancer informatics. We further discuss how the telomere-to-telomere genome and the emerging human pangenome could enhance the resolution of cancer genome analysis, potentially revolutionizing early detection and disease monitoring in patients. Finally, we outline strategies for transitioning long-read sequencing from research applications to routine clinical practice.
40112343	Predicting Fluorescence Emission Wavelengths and Quantum Yields via Machine Learning.	The search for functional fluorescent organic materials can significantly benefit from the rapid and accurate predictions of photophysical properties. However, screening large numbers of potential fluorophore molecules in different solvents faces limitations of quantum mechanical calculations and experimental measurements. In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the fluorescence of a molecule, focusing on two target properties: emission wavelengths (WLs) and quantum yields (QYs). For this purpose, we employ the Deep4Chem database which contains the optical properties of 20,236 combinations of 7,016 chromophores in 365 different solvents. Several chemical descriptors, or features, were selected as inputs for each model, and each molecule was characterized by its SMILES fingerprint. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) technique was used to rationalize the results, showing that the most impactful properties are chromophore-related, as expected from chemical intuition. For the best-performing model, the Random Forest, our results for the test set show a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 28.8 nm (0.15 eV) for WLs and 0.19 for QYs. The developed ML models were used to predict, thus completing, the missing results for the WL and QY target properties in the original Deep4Chem database, resulting in two new databases: one for each property. Testing our ML models for each target property in molecules not included in the original Deep4Chem database gave good results.
40112214	Leveraging-Induced Polarization for Drug Discovery: Efficient IC50 Prediction Using Minimal Features.	Here, we use the frequency of the atomic hybridizations (s, sp, sp<sup>2</sup>, and sp<sup>3</sup>) of each atom type (H, C, N, O, S, etc.) within a molecule to predict the IC50s of drug-like molecules, focusing on compounds targeting the Thrombin, Estrogen Receptor alpha, and Phosphodiesterase 5A proteins. The Neural Network and Random Forest models yield high correlation coefficients (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) and low mean square error (MSE) using only 19 features. The atomic hybridizations have been used previously to calculate the molecular polarizability using a simple empirical model (Miller et al. <i>JACS</i> <b>1979</b>). We show that the atomic hybridizations may also be used to accurately predict the molecular polarizabilities of these molecules. The results show the importance of the induced polarization in protein-ligand binding. Furthermore, the variation in <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> and MSE for the different target proteins indicates that the contribution of the induced polarization to the binding energies is different for different target proteins.
40111927	Role of Cre Dynamics in Autoinhibition and Priming.	Cre recombinase, a powerful tool for genome engineering, associates into an intasome, a tetrameric complex of alternate active and inactive monomers that bring together two <i>loxP</i> sequences, stabilized by key protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. High-resolution structural information for free Cre is still missing, in contrast to the many structures found for Cre-DNA complexes in the Protein Data Bank, hindering understanding of the initial steps in intasome formation. To approach Cre structure and dynamics, we carried out 100 μs of molecular dynamics simulations of free Cre, starting from five Cre structures from different stages of intasome assembly. In the generated ensemble, the linker connecting the CBD and CAT domains is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that promotes different orientations of the two domains. The domains remain folded and interact with each other through short-lived interactions, retaining ∼70% of their surface available for interaction with <i>loxP</i>. The C-terminal Helix N in the CAT domain is also an IDR that interacts with the entire protein, including the active site, transiently forming an autoinhibited complex. The active site can be assembled in the absence of DNA, albeit inefficiently. The CAT domain has a clam-like motion, opening and closing the cavity where helix N docks, establishing protein-protein interactions in the intasome. Helix A in the CBD domain slides over the domain like a windshield wiper, sampling intasome-like conformations, among others. The wide range of intramolecular motion sampled by free Cre suggests that it uses conformational selection, using primed DNA-binding surfaces in both domains while assembling into the intasome.
40111465	Biomaterials in Relative Devices for Traumatic Cataract: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives.	Ocular trauma deprives one of the vision for high-quality life. Management of a traumatic cataract requires extensive surgical experience with a range of biomaterials and biomedical devices including intraocular lenses (IOLs), capsular tension rings (CTRs), prosthetic iris (PSI) implants, bandage contact lenses (BCLs), artificial corneas (ACs), and surgical sutures. Numerous demands, involving biocompatibility, cell toxicity, processability, mechanical strength, toughness/flexibility, transparency/opacity, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, and stability/biodegradability, are widely considered for fabricating these biomaterials and devices. Furthermore, a multifunction including drug-release and photothermal therapy is also endearing to those biomaterials in IOLs, CTRs, BCLs, and surgical sutures for anti-inflammational and antibacterial characteristics during traumatic cataract treatments. More recently, 3D printing has been demonstrated to effectively fabricate PSI and ACs with complex shapes to meet the personal requirements of patients. We summarize the main principles and the recent achievements of these advances. We also suggest the potential directions for their future development and discuss the remaining challenges.
40111406	Immunomodulatory All-Natural Kelp Decellularized Scaffold Prepared Using Deep Eutectic Solvent with Angiogenic Properties for Accelerating Diabetic Wound Healing.	Excessive oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and impaired vascularization are the main barriers to diabetic wound repair. A decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) with a native ECM structure is a promising biomaterial candidate for diabetic wound healing. However, the traditional decellularization process (reagents) can diminish the structural stability, mechanical properties, and bioactive components of dECM. To address these issues, we developed an intrinsically bioactive kelp decellularized scaffold (Im-Gly2) using natural and gentle deep eutectic solvents (DES) for accelerating diabetic wound healing. Im-Gly2 had a stable porous 3D structure (80.7 μm) and suitable mechanical properties, which could support cell growth, proliferation, and migration. Due to the retention of fucoidan, polyphenols (735.3 μg/g), and flavonoids, Im-Gly2 demonstrated intrinsic antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. It effectively reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in RAW264.7 macrophages and promoted their differentiation into the M2 phenotype. Notably, Im-Gly2 promoted tube formation through paracrine mechanisms by inducing the expression of transforming and proliferative cytokines from the RAW264.7 macrophage. In vivo, Im-Gly2 accelerated the healing of diabetic wounds by alleviating inflammation, angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and re-epithelialization. Taken together, our study provides a novel strategy for fabricating a bioactive kelp dECM without cross-linking with exogenous substances for accelerating chronic diabetic wound healing.
40111160	Enhanced Regioselectivity Prediction of sp<sup>2</sup> C-H Halogenation via Negative Data Augmentation and Multimodel Integration.	Efficient molecular editing is pivotal in synthetic chemistry, especially for developing drugs, materials, and high-value chemicals. Electrophilic aromatic substitution (S<sub>E</sub>Ar) reactions, specifically sp<sup>2</sup> C-H halogenation, face significant challenges due to electronic and steric factors, necessitating extensive trial-and-error. This study introduces an innovative machine learning-based model to predict halogenation sites in S<sub>E</sub>Ar reactions, achieving an average accuracy of 93% in 5-fold cross-validation. Employing ensemble techniques, particularly AutoGluon-Tabular (AG), the model demonstrates broad applicability across various aromatic halides, enhancing its utility in drug design, materials science, and more. By reducing experimental uncertainty and optimizing synthetic pathways, this model saves considerable time and resources, thereby accelerating innovation in synthetic chemistry.
40111004	SFM-Net: Selective Fusion of Multiway Protein Feature Network for Predicting Binding Affinity Changes upon Mutations.	Accurately predicting the effect of mutations on protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential for understanding the protein structure and function, as well as providing insights into disease-causing mechanisms. Many recent popular approaches based on the three-dimensional structure of proteins have been proposed to predict the changes in binding affinity caused by mutations, i.e. ΔΔ<i>G</i>. However, how to effectively use the structural information to comprehensively exploit complex interactions within proteins and integrate multisource features remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose SFM-Net, a powerful deep learning model constructed with GNN-based multiway feature extractors and a new context-aware selective fusion module that jointly leverages the sequence, structural, and evolutionary information. Such design enables SFM-Net to effectively and selectively use features from different sources to facilitate binding affinity change prediction. Benchmarking experiments and targeted ablation studies illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method for improving the binding affinity change prediction.
40108844	3D-Printed PEG-PLA/Gelatin Hydrogel: Characterization toward In Vitro Chondrocyte Redifferentiation.	The advancement of 3D printing technology offers a sophisticated solution for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Several printable hydrogels have been developed with specific designs for certain tissues. However, there are few effective 3D-printed hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering due to challenges with the hydrogel printability and the redifferentiation capacity of the articular chondrocytes on the hydrogel. This research study combined a PEG-PLA copolymer with gelatin to develop 3D-printed scaffolds for cartilage regeneration. Different hydrogel samples were prepared and studied regarding the effects of PLA chain length, gelatin content, and cross-linker concentration on the mechanical properties, swelling ability, and degradability of the hydrogels. An increase in the swelling ratio was observed, resulting in diminished compressive properties and accelerated degradation of the hydrogels with increased gelatin or decreased cross-linker and PLA chain length. Porcine articular chondrocytes were seeded onto the hydrogel scaffolds to assess cell adhesion, proliferation, and redifferentiation capability. Hydrogels with high swelling ability promoted the initial adhesion of cells on the scaffold, hence significantly increasing chondrocyte proliferation within 2 weeks of culture. Lowering the compressive modulus by increasing gelatin content improved chondrogenic redifferentiation. Glycosaminoglycan secretion was significantly enhanced when cells grew on hydrogels with greater amounts of gelatin. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of the cell-loaded hydrogels showed clusters of cells with a dense accumulation of a type II collagen network, a basis component of the cartilaginous matrix. Neither the PLA chain length nor the cross-linker amount affected chondrogenic function. The present study demonstrates that the PEG-PLA/gelatin hydrogels with increasing amounts of gelatin provide an optimal combination of swelling ratio, compressive modulus, and degradation rate, resulting in an appropriate environment to support the growth and redifferentiation of articular chondrocytes. This 3D-printed PEG-PLA/gelatin hydrogel will be useful for cartilage tissue engineering and possibly contribute to a new approach for cartilage defect treatment.
40108114	Unsupervised Machine Learning-Based Image Recognition of Raw Infrared Spectra: Toward Chemist-like Chemical Structural Classification and Beyond Numerical Data.	Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly improved spectral data analysis. In this study, we used unsupervised machine learning to classify chemical compounds based on infrared (IR) spectral images, without relying on prior chemical knowledge. The potential of machine learning for chemical classification was demonstrated by extracting IR spectral images from the Spectral Database for Organic Compounds and converting them into 208,620-dimensional vector data. Hierarchical clustering of 230 compounds revealed distinct main clusters (<b>A</b>-<b>G</b>), each with specific subclusters exhibiting higher intracluster similarities. Despite the challenges, including sensitivity to spectral deviations and difficulty of distinguishing delicate chemical structures in spectra with low transparency in the fingerprint area, the proposed image recognition approach exhibits good potential. Both principal component analysis and k-means clustering produced similar results. Furthermore, the method demonstrated high robustness to noise. The Tanimoto coefficient was used to evaluate the molecular similarity, providing valuable insights. However, some results deviated from chemists' intuitions. The study also highlighted that the scaling composition formulas and molecular weights did not affect the classification results because high-dimensional features dominated the process. A comparison of the clustering results obtained from molecular fingerprints, using the adjusted Rand index as a metric, indicated that the image data provided better classification performance than numerical data of the same resolution. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning with IR spectral image data for chemical classification and offers a novel perspective that complements traditional methods, although the classifications may not always align with chemists' intuitions. This approach has broader implications for fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and automated spectral analysis, where handling large, raw spectral data sets is essential.
40107724	Optical genome mapping identifies rare structural variants in neural tube defects.	Neural tube defects (NTDs) are the most common birth defects of the central nervous system and occur as either isolated malformations or accompanied by anomalies of other systems. The genetic basis of NTDs remains poorly understood using karyotyping, chromosomal microarray, and short-read sequencing, with only a limited number of pathogenic variants identified. Collectively, these technologies may fail to detect rare structural variants (SVs) in the genome, which may cause these birth defects. Therefore, optical genome mapping (OGM) was applied to investigate 104 NTD cases, of which 74 were isolated NTDs and 30 were NTDs with other malformations. A stepwise approach was undertaken to ascertain candidate variants using population and internal databases and performing parental studies when possible. This analysis identifies diagnostic findings in 8% of cases (8/104) and candidate findings in an additional 22% of cases (23/104). Of the candidate findings, 9% of cases (9/104) have SVs impacting genes associated with NTDs in mouse, and 13% of cases (14/104) have SVs impacting genes implicated in the neural tube development pathways. This study identifies <i>RMND5A, HNRNPC</i>, <i>FOXD4</i>, and <i>RBBP4</i> as strong candidate genes associated with NTDs, and expands the phenotypic spectrum of <i>AMER1</i> and <i>TGIF1</i> to include NTDs. This study constitutes the first systematic investigation of SVs using OGM to elucidate the genetic determinants of NTDs. The data provide key insights into the pathogenesis of NTDs and demonstrate the contribution of SVs in the genome to these birth defects.
40107723	Heterogeneous and novel transcript expression in single cells of patient-derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma organoids.	Splicing is often dysregulated in cancer, leading to alterations in the expression of canonical and alternatively spliced isoforms. We used the multiplexed arrays sequencing (MAS-seq) protocol of PacBio to sequence full-length transcripts in patient-derived organoid (PDO) cells of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The sequencing revealed a heterogeneous dysregulation of splicing across 2599 single ccRCC cells. The majority of novel transcripts could be removed with stringent filtering criteria. The remaining 31,531 transcripts (36.6% of the 86,182 detected transcripts on average) were previously uncharacterized. In contrast to known transcripts, many of the novel transcripts have cell-specific expression. Novel transcripts common to ccRCC cells belong to genes involved in ccRCC-related pathways, such as hypoxia and oxidative phosphorylation. A novel transcript of the ccRCC-related gene nicotinamide N-methyltransferase is validated using PCR. Moreover, >50% of novel transcripts possess a predicted complete protein-coding open reading frame. An analysis of the most dominant transcript-switching events between ccRCC and non-ccRCC cells shows many switching events that are cell- and sample-specific, underscoring the heterogeneity of alternative splicing events in ccRCC. Overall, our study elucidates the intricate transcriptomic architecture of ccRCC, underlying its aggressive phenotype and providing insights into its molecular complexity.
40107722	De novo detection of somatic variants in high-quality long-read single-cell RNA sequencing data.	In cancer, genetic and transcriptomic variations generate clonal heterogeneity, leading to treatment resistance. Long-read single-cell RNA sequencing (LR scRNA-seq) has the potential to detect genetic and transcriptomic variations simultaneously. Here, we present LongSom, a computational workflow leveraging high-quality LR scRNA-seq data to call de novo somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), including in mitochondria (mtSNVs), copy number alterations (CNAs), and gene fusions, to reconstruct the tumor clonal heterogeneity. Before somatic variant calling, LongSom reannotates marker gene-based cell types using cell mutational profiles. LongSom distinguishes somatic SNVs from noise and germline polymorphisms by applying an extensive set of hard filters and statistical tests. Applying LongSom to human ovarian cancer samples, we detected clinically relevant somatic SNVs that were validated against matched DNA samples. Leveraging somatic SNVs and fusions, LongSom found subclones with different predicted treatment outcomes. In summary, LongSom enables de novo variant detection without the need for normal samples, facilitating the study of cancer evolution, clonal heterogeneity, and treatment resistance.
40106333	Integrated Virtual Screening Approach Identifies New CYP19A1 Inhibitors.	The human cytochrome P450 19A1 (CYP19A1, aromatase) is a heme-containing protein catalyzing the final steps of the biosynthesis of the steroid hormone 17β-estradiol. It is a key target for the treatment of sex-hormone-related disorders due to its role in mediating the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Here, we report the development of a virtual screening workflow incorporating machine learning and structure-based modeling that has led to the discovery of new CYP19A1 inhibitors. The machine learning models were built on comprehensive CYP19A1 data sets extracted from the ChEMBL and PubChem Bioassay databases and subjected to thorough validation routines. Ten promising hits that resulted from the virtual screening campaign were selected for experimental testing in an enzymatic assay based on heterologous expression of human CYP19A1 in yeast. Among the seven structurally diverse compounds identified as new CYP19A1 inhibitors, compound <b>9</b>, a novel, noncovalent inhibitor based on coumarin and imidazole substructures, stood out by its high potency, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 271 ± 51 nM.
40105795	Identification and Experimental Validation of NETosis-Mediated Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Gene Signature Using Multi-omics, Machine Learning, and Mendelian Randomization.	Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disorder with limited therapeutic options. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are formed by a process known as "NETosis" that has been implicated in AAA pathogenesis, yet the roles and prognostic significance of NET-related genes in AAA remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify key AAA- and NET-related genes (AAA-NETs-RGs), elucidate their potential mechanisms in contributing to AAA, and explore potential therapeutic compounds for AAA therapy. Through bioinformatics analysis of multiomics and machine learning, we identified six AAA-NETs-RGs: DUSP26, FCN1, MTHFD2, GPRC5C, SEMA4A, and CCR7, which exhibited strong diagnostic potential for predicting AAA progression, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling. Immune infiltration analysis revealed a causal association between AAA-NETs-RGs and immune cell infiltration. Cell-cell communication analysis indicated that AAA-NETs-RGs predominantly function in smooth muscle cells, B cells, T cells, and NK cells, primarily through cytokine and chemokine signaling. Gene profiling revealed that CCR7 and MTHFD2 exhibited the most significant upregulation in AAA patients compared to non-AAA controls, as well as in <i>in vitro</i> AAA models. Notably, genetic depletion of CCR7 and MTHFD2 strongly inhibited Ang II-induced phenotypic switching, functional impairment, and senescence in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Based on AAA-NETs-RGs, molecular docking analysis combined with the Connectivity Map (CMap) database identified mirdametinib as a potential therapeutic agent for AAA. Mirdametinib effectively alleviated Ang II-induced phenotypic switching, biological dysfunction, and senescence. These findings provide valuable insights into understanding the pathophysiology of AAA and highlight promising therapeutic strategies targeting AAA-NETs-RGs.
40105716	Adaptive evolution of cytochrome b in songbirds.	The mitochondrial bc1 complex catalyzes the oxidation of ubiquinol by reducing cytochrome c. Cytochrome b, the catalytic core of bc1, generates superoxide during the oxidation of ubiquinol. Excessive superoxide production is known to accelerate aging and neurodegeneration. Songbirds (oscine, Passeri) exhibit lower production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and greatly accelerated evolution of cytochrome b, relative to all other modern birds, suggesting adaptive selection for lower generation of ROS. Here, we identified songbird-specific substitutions in modern bird's cytochrome b amino-acid sequences and examined the high-resolution structures of the chicken bc1 complex in an effort to predict the effect of these substitutions on the function of bc1. Many of the songbird-specific substitutions cluster around sites that are critical for the function of bc1. One cluster of substitutions interacts with heme BH. A second cluster of substitutions interacts with residues in the ubiquinone reduction site, Qi. Both groups of substitution may affect the rate of reduction of ubiquinone at the Qi site. Another cluster of cytochrome b substitutions interacts with the hinge region of the Rieske protein that transfers electron from cytochrome b to cytochrome c1. These songbird-specific substitutions appear to be selected to modulate the rate of both ubiquinol oxidation at the Qo site and ubiquinone reduction at the Qi site thereby modulating the rate of superoxide production. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that cytochrome b evolution in songbirds was driven by selection of substitutions that reduce the rate of superoxide production thereby increasing songbird lifespan and cognitive abilities.
40105360	Regulatory Interactions between APOBEC3B N- and C-Terminal Domains.	APOBEC3B (A3B) is implicated in DNA mutations that facilitate tumor evolution. Although structures of its individual N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) have been resolved through X-ray crystallography, the full-length A3B (fl-A3B) structure remains elusive, limiting our understanding of its dynamics and mechanisms. In particular, the APOBEC3B C-terminal domain (A3Bctd) is frequently closed in models and structures. In this study, we built several new models of fl-A3B using integrative structural biology methods and selected a top model for further dynamical investigation. We compared the dynamics of the truncated (A3Bctd) to that of the fl-A3B via conventional and Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Subsequently, we employed weighted ensemble methods to explore the fl-A3B active site opening mechanism, finding that interactions at the NTD-CTD interface enhance the opening frequency of the fl-A3B active site. Our findings shed light on the structural dynamics and potential druggability of fl-A3B, including observations regarding both the active and allosteric sites, which may offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention in cancer.
40105337	CPPCGM: A Highly Efficient Sequence-Based Tool for Simultaneously Identifying and Generating Cell-Penetrating Peptides.	Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are usually short oligopeptides with 5-30 amino acid residues. CPPs have been proven as important drug delivery vehicles into cells through different mechanisms, demonstrating their potential as therapeutic candidates. However, experimental screening and synthesis of CPPs could be time-consuming and expensive. Recently, numerous attempts have been made to develop computational methods as a cost-effective way for screening a number of potential CPP candidates. Despite significant advancements, current methods exhibit limited feature representation capabilities, thereby constraining the potential for further performance enhancements. In this study, we developed a deep learning framework called CPPCGM, which uses protein language models (PLMs) to identify and generate novel CPPs. There are two separate blocks in this framework: CPPClassifier and CPPGenerator. The former utilizes three pretrained models for simple voting, thereby accurately categorizing CPPs and non-CPPs. The latter, similar to a generative adversarial network, including a discriminator and a generator, generates peptides that are not present in the training data set. Our proposed CPPCGM has achieved remarkably high Matthews correlation coefficient scores of 0.876, 0.923, and 0.664 on three data sets based on the classification results. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the performance of our method is significantly improved. The results also demonstrated the generating potential of CPPCGM through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. Significantly, using PLM-based methods can optimize peptides for biochemical functions, benefiting drug delivery and biomedical applications.

40105208	KUTE: Green-Kubo Uncertainty-Based Transport Coefficient Estimator.	An algorithm for the calculation of transport properties from molecular dynamics simulations, kute, is introduced. The method estimates the integrals from the Green-Kubo theorem, taking into account the uncertainties of the correlation functions in order to eliminate arbitrary cutoffs or external parameters whose values could alter the result. In this contribution, the performance of kute is tested against other popular methods for the case of a protic ionic liquid for a variety of transport properties. It is found that kute achieves the same degree of accuracy as the equivalent formulation of the Einstein relations while performing better than other methods to calculate transport properties using Green-Kubo methods.
40103420	AI-Assisted Label-Free Monitoring Bone Mineral Metabolism on Demineralized Bone Paper.	Effective drug development for bone-related diseases, such as osteoporosis and metastasis, is hindered by the lack of physiologically relevant in vitro models. Traditional platforms, including standard tissue culture plastic, fail to replicate the structural and functional complexity of the natural bone extracellular matrix. Recently, osteoid-mimicking demineralized bone paper (DBP), which preserves the intrinsic collagen structure of mature bone and exhibits semitransparency, has demonstrated the ability to reproduce in-vivo-relevant osteogenic processes and mineral metabolism. Here, we present a label-free, longitudinal, and quantitative monitoring of mineralized collagen formation by osteoblasts and subsequent osteoclast-driven mineral resorption on DBP using brightfield microscopy. A Segment.ai machine learning algorithm is applied for time-lapse bright-field image analysis, enabling identification of osteoclast resorption areas and automated quantification of large image datasets over a three-week culture period. This work highlights the potential of DBP as a transformative platform for bone-targeting drug screening and osteoporosis research.
40102053	Double-Network Hydrogel Based on Methacrylated Chitosan/Hyaluronic Acid Coacervate for Enhanced Wet-Tissue Adhesion.	Developing robust wet tissue adhesives remains challenging due to interfacial water and irregular surfaces. While polyelectrolyte coacervates demonstrate promising hydrophobic/fluidic properties for wet adhesion, their low cohesion limits practical applications. Herein, a wet tissue bioadhesive based on coacervates formed from low- molecular-weight methacrylated chitosan (CSMA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) is reported. These homogeneous and transparent coacervates displayed high solid content (∼18.0%), fluidity (∼10<sup>5</sup> mPa·s), and tunable mechanical properties. Upon application to wet tissue surfaces, the coacervate can be photo-cross-linked to form a double-network hydrogel in situ, resulting in improved cohesion and durable adhesion. The resulting CSMA-HA hydrogel demonstrated robust adhesion to tissues, with a bursting pressure of 374 mmHg. Remarkably, the bursting pressure can be further enhanced (∼623 mmHg) after 24 h of PBS immersion due to dynamic bond reorganization and low swelling. The demonstrated stability under physiological conditions and robust wet adhesion position CSMA-HA coacervates as a transformative platform for tissue adhesive applications.
40102051	Assessing UFF and DFT-Tuned Force Fields for Predicting Experimental Isotherms of MOFs.	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas storage and separation applications due to their high tunability and porosity. The rational design of MOFs relies on accurate computational modeling, with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations frequently employed to model gas uptake. However, GCMC predictions often deviate from experimental observations, limiting their utility in MOF screening. These discrepancies primarily arise from three factors: inaccuracies in the force field, neglect of atomic motions, and neglect of structural imperfections in MOFs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of the first factor on the predictive accuracy of the GCMC simulations. We evaluate the widely used Universal Force Field (UFF) by comparing its predictions with experimental isotherms for four representative adsorbates, H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, across 379 isotherms from 142 MOFs. The results show that UFF consistently overestimates the gas uptake in GCMC simulations. To isolate the contribution of force field inaccuracies to errors in GCMC, we developed a practical scheme for fitting force field parameters to DFT-calculated energies for a large set of MOFs. While the refined force field improves the accuracy of interatomic interaction energies, its reduction of repulsion, combined with UFF's tendency to overestimate gas uptake, ultimately amplifies the overestimation of experimental gas uptake meaurement. Our analysis suggests that improving the agreement of gas adsorption prediction with experiments requires addressing atomic motion and structural defects in MOFs alongside force field refinements.
40101190	The Role and Future of Functional Graphenic Materials in Biomedical and Human Health Applications.	Functional graphenic materials (FGMs) are materials derived from graphene oxide (GO) that hold a plethora of applications from electronics to nanomedicine. In this Perspective, we examine the history and evolution of biomedical applications of this carbon-based macromolecule. Following the carbon nanotube (CNT) movement, GO and FGMs became nanocarbons of interest because of their low cost and versatile functionality. The tunable chemistry enabled our work on FGMs coupled with biomacromolecules and allows FGMs to plays an important role in many biomedical applications, from tissue regeneration to controlled delivery. As we work to develop this material, it is critical to consider toxicity implications─in fresh materials as well as in degradation products. With this understanding, FGMs also hold potential roles in human health and environmental sustainability, making FGMs an important contemporary biomacromolecule.
40100703	Characterizing RNA Oligomers Using Stochastic Titration Constant-pH Metadynamics Simulations.	RNA molecules exhibit various biological functions intrinsically dependent on their diverse ecosystem of highly flexible structures. This flexibility arises from complex hydrogen-bonding networks defined by canonical and noncanonical base pairs that require protonation events to stabilize or perturb these interactions. Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) methods provide a reliable framework to explore the conformational and protonation spaces of dynamic structures and to perform robust calculations of pH-dependent properties, such as the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of titratable sites. Despite growing biological evidence concerning pH regulation of certain motifs and its role in biotechnological applications, pH-sensitive <i>in silico</i> methods have rarely been applied to nucleic acids. This work extends the stochastic titration CpHMD method to include RNA parameters from the standard χOL3 AMBER force field. We demonstrate its capability to capture titration events of nucleotides in single-stranded RNAs. We validate the method using trimers and pentamers with a single central titratable site while integrating a well-tempered metadynamics approach into the st-CpHMD methodology (CpH-MetaD) using PLUMED. This approach enhances the convergence of the conformational landscape and enables more efficient sampling of protonation-conformation coupling. Our p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> estimates are in agreement with experimental data, validating the method's ability to reproduce electrostatic changes around a titratable nucleobase in single-stranded RNA. These findings provide molecular insight into intramolecular phenomena, such as nucleobase stacking and phosphate interactions, that dictate the experimentally observed p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> shifts between different strands. Overall, this work validates both the st-CpHMD method and the metadynamics integration as reliable tools for studying biologically relevant RNA systems.
40100100	Determinants of Response to Sequential Pembrolizumab with Trastuzumab plus Platinum/5-FU in HER2-Positive Gastric Cancer: A Phase II Chemoimmunotherapy Trial.	Adding pembrolizumab to first-line fluoropyrimidine (5-FU)/platinum chemotherapy plus trastuzumab improves outcomes in advanced HER2+ gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas, but the benefit is largely confined to dual HER2+ and PD-L1+ patients. To assess the contributions of components, we conducted a phase II trial evaluating 5-FU/platinum/trastuzumab and added pembrolizumab in cycle 2 in patients with metastatic HER2+ disease.
40100083	Probing the Effect of Protein and Inhibitor Conformational Flexibility on the Reaction of Rocelitinib-Like Covalent Inhibitors of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. A Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Study.	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase and a validated target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Drug discovery efforts on this target initially focused on traditional competitive, reversible ATP-binding site inhibitors; however, irreversible covalent binding EGFR inhibitors have become increasingly more popular. Covalent EGFR inhibitors have been developed using a range of different scaffolds, and unsurprisingly, the incorporation of an electrophilic acrylamide group can result in sizable orientation differences relative to the Cys797 nucleophile and the Asp800 general base. In this work, we report a QM/MM study aiming to better understand the aspects of covalent adduct formation, including the role of protein flexibility on chemical reactivity, the impact of electrophile location within the ATP binding site, and the impact of the acrylamide conformation (<i>s</i>-<i>cis</i> vs <i>s</i>-<i>trans</i>). We focus here on the diaminopyrimidine scaffold, as exemplified by Rocelitinib, where the electrophile is attached to its back pocket binding group. Our goal is to elucidate how electrophilic groups can be incorporated onto different inhibitor scaffolds targeting reactive active site residues. We find that irrespective of the EGFR MD conformation chosen, acrylamide, in both the <i>s</i>-<i>cis</i> or <i>s</i>-<i>trans</i>, can undergo reaction with rate-determining barriers of ∼20 kcal/mol. Interestingly, the nature of the rate-determining step for Rocelitinib-like inhibitors was found to be either direct nucleophilic attack or keto-enol tautomerization, depending on the precise protein and inhibitor conformation.
40100082	An Antibacterial Hydrogel Based on Silk Sericin Cross-Linking Glycyrrhizic Acid and Silver for Infectious Wound Healing.	Bioactive hydrogels are garnering increasing interest in wound management due to their porous structural features and versatile intrinsic biological activities. Importantly, the antibacterial capacity is a crucial requirement for hydrogel dressings in chronically infected wounds. In this study, we report an antibacterial hydrogel constructed from silk sericin (SS) cross-linked with glycyrrhizic acid (GA) and integrated with silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>) to accelerate the healing of bacterial-infected wounds. The resultant sericin-glycyrrhizic acid-Ag<sup>+</sup> hydrogel (SGA) demonstrates favorable mechanical properties, effectively preventing secondary injury to wounds. Moreover, <i>in vitro</i> studies indicated that the SGA hydrogel possesses excellent swelling ratios, degradability, and cytocompatibility, promoting cell growth and proliferation. Notably, the SGA hydrogel exhibited effective antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria through the release of Ag<sup>+</sup>. In a <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>-infected wound model, the SGA hydrogel efficiently eradicated bacteria, thus promoting wound repair. Overall, our work establishes a novel strategy for developing multifunctional hydrogel dressings based on natural materials for managing bacteria-infected wounds.
40099781	Understanding Conformation Importance in Data-Driven Property Prediction Models.	The prediction of molecular properties is essential in chemoinformatics and has many applications in drug discovery and materials design. Molecular representations play a key role in the prediction models to achieve high prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, appropriate molecular descriptors, including the utilization of conformational information, have been unclear due to a lack of systematic analysis of property prediction models and control. This study investigates the influence of using multiple conformers in machine learning-based property prediction, comparing two- and three-dimensional descriptors using three independent data sets: a large-scale quantum mechanical property, a medium-scale melting point, and small-scale enantioselective chemical reaction data sets. One unique aspect of this study is creating these carefully controlled data sets for models' performance evaluation in conformational diversity and the target property's dependence on conformation. Our findings show that using all available conformers as simple data augmentation consistently achieves high prediction accuracy among aggregation approaches, followed by mean aggregation. Furthermore, Uni-Mol, an end-to-end prediction model utilizing atomic coordinates and elements, combined with the ground-truth conformation, significantly outperformed traditional 2D and 3D descriptors and predicted conformational-sensitive properties with high accuracy. Although the prediction accuracy of the Uni-Mol model significantly decreased using the wrong conformers, it still outperformed two-dimensional extended connectivity fingerprints, which showed higher prediction accuracy than most of the tested 3D descriptors.
40099453	Structural codes of organic electrode materials for rechargeable multivalent metal batteries.	Rechargeable multivalent metal batteries (MMBs) are considered as promising alternatives to Li-ion and Pb-acid batteries for grid-scale energy storage applications due to the multi-electron redox capability of metal anodes. However, the conventional inorganic cathodes used in MMBs face challenges with the sluggish diffusivity and poor storage of charge-dense multivalent cations in their crystal lattice. Organic electrode materials (OEMs), on the other hand, offer several advantages as MMB cathodes, including flexible structural designability, high resource availability, sustainability, and a unique ion-coordination storage mechanism. This review explores the intrinsic connection between the structural features of OEMs and their charge storage performance, aiming to unveil key design principles for organic molecules used in various MMB applications. We begin with an overview of the fundamental aspects of different MMBs (<i>i.e.</i>, Zn/Mg/Ca/Al batteries), covering electrolyte selection, metal stripping/plating electrochemistry, and the fundamentals of cathode operation. From a theoretical understanding of redox activities, we summarize the properties of different redox sites and correlate the electrochemical properties of OEMs with various structural factors. This analysis further leads to the introduction of critical design considerations for different types of OEMs. We then critically review a wide range of organic compounds for MMBs, from small organic molecules to redox-active polymers and covalent-organic frameworks, focusing on their structure-property relationships, key electrochemical parameters, and strengths and shortcomings for multivalent ion storage. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges and propose potential solutions for further advancing OEMs in MMBs.
40099398	Fabricating N-Cadherin Mimetic Peptide-Based Diverse Self-Assembled Hydrogels in the Presence of Biologically Relevant Cations.	N-cadherin, a crucial extracellular matrix protein, is crucial in mediating cellular interactions and promoting cell migration. Herein, we have attempted to create N-cadherin mimetic peptide (NcMP) hydrogel scaffolds by incorporating cations as the external stimulus to create a suitable interface for favorable cellular interactions. Inspired by the Hofmeister series, we selected four biologically significant cations, classified as kosmotropes and chaotropes, and varied their concentrations to investigate how increasing ionic strength affects the self-assembly of the NcMP. Interestingly, the incorporation of these ions greatly influenced the self-assembling propensity of the Fmoc-HAVDI hydrogel, which resulted in diverse structural and mechanical properties. Such diverse physical properties led to differential cellular responses. Thus, we were able to access diverse physical and biological properties in a single gelator molecule by simply changing the nature and concentration of the biologically relevant cations. We anticipate that these diverse hydrogel systems hold great potential in various biomedical applications.
40099322	Decoding recombination dynamics in perovskite solar cells: an in-depth critical review.	The remarkable optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have established them as highly promising photovoltaic absorber materials, propelling the rapid advancement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that outperform many traditional alternatives in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, despite their advancements, PSC devices encounter significant non-radiative recombination losses, encompassing trap-assisted (Shockley-Read-Hall) recombination in bulk and interfaces of PSCs, which restricts their open-circuit voltage (<i>V</i><sub>OC</sub>) and overall PCE, dragging it below the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit. The ongoing debate regarding the role of grain boundary (GB) recombination, whether it primarily manifests as bulk or surface recombination, has spurred extensive research aimed at elucidating these mechanisms. This review provides a critical comprehensive analysis of the thermodynamic correlations related to <i>V</i><sub>OC</sub> losses, bridging the gap between the theoretical SQ limit and practical device performance. Subsequently, it delves into recent findings that aim to decipher the multifaced nature and origin of radiative and non-radiative recombination-induced losses within the device stack, assessing their impacts on overall performance. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the application of advanced machine learning techniques to discern dominant recombination mechanisms in PSCs. Finally, it summarizes the notable advanced strategies to mitigate undesirable non-radiative recombination losses, which pave the way to the thermodynamic efficiency limit.
40098257	SELFprot: Effective and Efficient Multitask Finetuning Methods for Protein Parameter Prediction.	Accurately predicting protein-ligand interactions and enzymatic kinetics remains a challenge for computational biology. Here, we present SELFprot, a suite of modular transformer-based machine learning architectures that leverage the ESM2-35M model architecture for protein sequence and small molecule embeddings to improve predictions of complex biochemical interactions. SELFprot employs multitask learning and parameter-efficient finetuning through low-rank adaptation, allowing for adaptive, data-driven model refinement. Furthermore, ensemble learning techniques are used to enhance the robustness and reduce the prediction variance. Evaluated on the BindingDB and CatPred-DB data sets, SELFprot achieves competitive performance with notable improvements in parameter-efficient prediction of <b>k</b><sub><b>cat</b></sub>, <b>K</b><sub><b>m</b></sub>, <b>K</b><sub><b>i</b></sub>, <b>K</b><sub><b>d</b></sub>, <b>IC</b><sub><b>50</b></sub>, and <b>EC</b><sub><b>50</b></sub> values as well as the classification of functional site residues. With comparable accuracy to existing models and an order of magnitude fewer parameters, SELFprot demonstrates versatility and efficiency, making it a valuable tool for protein-ligand interaction studies in bioengineering.
40097273	Analysis of HSA-PAA Complexation Using SEC-SAXS Combination: Unraveling Stoichiometry, Reversibility, and Interaction Specificity.	This work leverages the integration of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate the complex interactions between human serum albumin (HSA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). The SEC-SAXS approach is proven in this study to effectively eliminate aggregates, enhancing data quality and revealing intricate details of protein-polymer associations. Initial findings demonstrate that HSA maintains its native structure across pH 5-8 and that HSA shows no significant interaction with the neutral polyethylene glycol (PEG). This highlights the critical role of charge regulation and electrostatic forces in HSA-PAA complex formation previously reported and the specificity of this interaction. The study further reveals that the HSA-PAA complex stoichiometry is highly dependent on PAA size, with larger PAA chains forming more elongated structures. The binding stoichiometry is then shown to increase nonlinearly, suggesting a delicate balance between attractive HSA-PAA and repulsive HSA-HSA interactions. Notably, HSA-PAA complexes exhibit reversible behavior, dissociating at pH > 5 and in media devoid of PAA.
40097200	Closing the gaps, and improving somatic structural variant analysis and benchmarking using CHM13-T2T.	The complexities of cancer genomes are becoming more easily interpreted due to advancements in sequencing technologies and improved bioinformatic analysis. Structural variants (SVs) represent an important subset of somatic events in tumors. While the detection of SVs has been markedly improved by the development of long-read sequencing, somatic variant identification and annotation remain challenging. We hypothesized that the use of a completed human reference genome (CHM13-T2T) would improve somatic SV calling. Our findings in a tumor-normal matched benchmark sample and three patient samples show that the CHM13-T2T improves SV detection accuracy compared to GRCh38 with a notable reduction in false-positive calls, and thus supports improved prioritization. We also overcame the lack of annotation resources for CHM13-T2T by lifting over CHM13-T2T-aligned reads to the GRCh38 genome, therefore combining both improved alignment and advanced annotations. In this process, we assessed the current SV benchmark set for COLO829/COLO829BL across four replicates sequenced at different centers with different long-read technologies. We discovered instability of this cell line across these replicates; 346 SVs (1.13%) were only discoverable in a single replicate. We identify 54 somatic SVs, which appear to be stable as they are consistently present across the four replicates. As such, we propose this consensus set as an updated benchmark for somatic SV calling and include both GRCh38 and CHM13-T2T coordinates in our benchmark. Our work demonstrates new approaches to optimize somatic SV detection in cancer with potential improvements in other genetic diseases.
40094993	Dying in hospital: a retrospective medical record analysis on care in the dying phase in intensive care units and general wards.	Care in the dying phase is often suboptimal in hospitals outside specialized palliative care. Studies of the implementation of recommendations for care in the dying phase are rare. Medical records can provide information in this regard.
40094480	Temperature-Controlled pNIB/PTX Micelles for Improved Paclitaxel Delivery in Ovarian Cancer Treatment.	Paclitaxel (PTX) is a widely used anticancer drug for ovarian cancer treatment, but its clinical application is limited by poor water solubility and dose-limiting toxicities. To overcome these challenges, we developed a thermoresponsive, multistep drug delivery system, pNIB/PTX, designed to improve PTX solubility and provide controlled drug release. The pNIB/PTX-3 complex exhibited an initial rapid drug release phase followed by sustained slow release, optimizing both short-term and long-term therapeutic efficacy. At physiological temperatures, the complex demonstrated a precisely controlled drug release mechanism driven by changes in the polymeric micelle structure. <i>In vitro</i> studies showed that pNIB/PTX-3 significantly enhanced therapeutic effects in human ovarian cancer cell lines HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1, compared to PTX alone. In orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse models, a single intraperitoneal injection of pNIB/PTX-3 led to a substantial reduction in tumor size and prolonged survival. This multistep, thermoresponsive delivery system shows strong potential as a promising therapeutic option for dose-dense ovarian cancer treatments, providing improved drug stability, controlled release, and minimized side effects.
40094383	Polydopamine Nanoparticle-Loaded Antifreezing and Photothermal Organohydrogel Based on Pullulan for Frostbite Therapy.	Rapid rewarming is the standard and most common strategy for treating frostbite. Due to freezing susceptibility and lack of thermal effects, traditional therapeutic hydrogels are not suitable for being directly applied to frostbite therapy in cold conditions. Contrastively, antifreezing and photothermal hydrogels that are not apt to freeze and capable of rewarming frostbite wounds are deemed to hold great application potential in such therapy. Nevertheless, these hydrogels have rarely been researched. Herein, using glycerol as the cryoprotectant and polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) as the photothermal agent, a novel pullulan-based antifreezing and photothermal organohydrogel (CPG-PDA organohydrogel) was successfully developed to treat frostbite for the first time. The CPG-PDA organohydrogel formed through 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl)-mediated esterification reactions was found to possess certain mechanical stability, shear-thinning behaviors (injectability), excellent antifreezing properties, superb <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> photothermal performances, and outstanding cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility. Most noticeably, the photothermal rewarming and coating therapy using the CPG-PDA organohydrogel was observed to significantly accelerate the frostbite healing of rats. The CPG-PDA organohydrogel was opined to be a promising platform for the direct treatment of frostbite in a cold environment and would open a new avenue for the design of therapeutic strategies for frostbite.
40094320	Proteomic Learning of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Receptor-Mediated Anesthesia.	Anesthetics are crucial in surgical procedures and therapeutic interventions, but they come with side effects and varying levels of effectiveness, calling for novel anesthetic agents that offer more precise and controllable effects. Targeting Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, the primary inhibitory receptors in the central nervous system, could enhance their inhibitory action, potentially reducing side effects while improving the potency of anesthetics. In this study, we introduce a proteomic learning of GABA receptor-mediated anesthesia based on 24 GABA receptor subtypes by considering over 4000 proteins in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and over 1.5 millions known binding compounds. We develop a corresponding drug-target interaction network to identify potential lead compounds for novel anesthetic design. To ensure robust proteomic learning predictions, we curated a data set comprising 136 targets from a pool of 980 targets within the PPI networks. We employed three machine learning algorithms, integrating advanced natural language processing (NLP) models such as pretrained transformers and autoencoder embeddings. Through a comprehensive screening process, we evaluated the side effects and repurposing potential of over 180,000 drug candidates targeting the GABRA5 receptor. Additionally, we assessed the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of these candidates to identify those with near-optimal characteristics. This approach also involved optimizing the structures of existing anesthetics. Our work presents an innovative strategy for the development of new anesthetic drugs, optimization of anesthetic use, and a deeper understanding of potential anesthesia-related side effects.
40094314	Effects of polyphenols on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a case study of resveratrol.	The primary etiology of liver disease is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. The efficacy of plant-derived polyphenolic compounds has been extensively demonstrated with respect to various aspects and recently proved to be effective at preventing and treating NAFLD. To describe the sources and functions of polyphenolic constituents and clarify the therapeutic effects of polyphenolic constituents on NAFLD, resveratrol (RSV), which has significant therapeutic effects, was selected for a comprehensive analysis. Bibliometric and network pharmacology analyses revealed a strong correlation between insulin resistance (IR), oxidative stress, steatosis, and NAFLD, as well as the significance of intestinal flora and therapeutic interventions for NAFLD. This study reviewed the mechanisms by which RSV acted against NAFLD and explored techniques to enhance its bioavailability. These findings offer new insights into the treatment of NAFLD and the development of innovative RSV formulations.
40094306	Influence of Coverage Dependence on the Thermophysical Properties of Adsorbates and Its Impact on Microkinetic Models.	This work focuses on the impact of lateral interactions on the thermophysical properties of adsorbates. We present different parametrizations for coverage-dependent enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity in a mean-field microkinetic model. These models are tested against two systems, CO/Pt(111) and CO/Co(0001), using two different functionals. A detailed investigation into how coverage influences the thermophysical properties of CO* is presented. We place particular emphasis on studying the impact of coverage on the vibrational partition function and how this affects the entropy of adsorbates. Higher coverages typically lead to increased repulsive interactions, which should further constrain the large amplitude modes that contribute the most to the vibrational entropy. In some cases, however, the opposite effect occurred; the vibrational entropy actually increased because surface crowding forced adsorbates to different binding locations that had lower frequencies. Our results highlighted cases where coverage-dependent entropy should be included, such as for adsorbates with lateral vibrational modes and systems at high temperatures. These methods for including coverage-dependent properties into mean-field microkinetics in a thermodynamically consistent way are now available in the open-source software Cantera.
40091793	Synthetic strategies for the incorporation of metallocenes into anti-infective scaffolds.	With the rates of infectious diseases and (pan)drug-resistant pathogens constantly increasing, there is a pressing need for the development of new drug candidates. To fight this global health crisis, new medicines should propose improved or novel modes of action. A successful strategy to fight microbial resistance is the incorporation of metallocenes into drug scaffolds. This review aims at encouraging the scientific community to follow this approach by giving an overview of all published synthetic strategies either for the derivatization of anti-infective drug scaffolds with metallocenes or for the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of original metallocenyl anti-infectives. This should facilitate future research as published articles are classified depending on the reaction type that is employed for the incorporation of the metallocenes, namely addition-elimination, condensation, "click" chemistry, cross-coupling, nucleophilic substitution and other methods. Overall, this review exhibits the impressive but somewhat unexploited potential of anti-infective metallocenyl compounds to treat infectious diseases.
40091632	Accurate Prediction of CRISPR/Cas13a Guide Activity Using Feature Selection and Deep Learning.	CRISPR/Cas13a serves as a key tool for nucleic acid tests; therefore, accurate prediction of its activity is essential for creating robust and sensitive diagnosis. In this study, we create a dual-branch neural network model that achieves high prediction accuracy and classification performance across two independent CRISPR/Cas13a data sets, outperforming previously published models relying solely on sequence features. The model integrates direct sequence encoding with descriptive features and yields 99 key descriptive features out of 1553, extracted through statistical analysis, which critically influence guide-target interactions and Cas13a guide activity. By employing Shapley Additive Explanations and Integrated Gradients for feature importance analysis, we show that sequence composition, mismatch type and frequency, and the protospacer flanking site region are primary features. These findings underscore the importance of using descriptive features as complementary inputs to deep learning-based encoding and provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying guide-target interaction. All in all, this study not only introduces a reliable and efficient model for Cas13a guide activity prediction but also offers a foundation for future rational design efforts.

40087026	Multiple Pendants-Bearing Triglucosides for Membrane Protein Studies: Effects of Pendant Length and Number on Micelle Interior Hydration and Protein Stability.	Membrane proteins play central roles in cell physiology and are the targets of over 50% of FDA-approved drugs. In the present study, we prepared single alkyl-chained triglucosides decorated with multiple pendants, designated multiple pendant-bearing glucosides (MPGs), to enhance membrane protein stability. The new detergents feature two and four pendants of varying size at the hydrophilic-lipophilic interfaces, designated MPG-Ds and MPG-Ts, respectively. When tested with model membrane proteins, including the human adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR), the tetra-pendant-bearing MPGs (MPG-Ts) demonstrated superior performance compared to the dipendant analogs (MPG-Ds) and the gold standard DDM. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations results reveal that the four-pendant configuration of this detergent is remarkably effective in excluding water from the hydrophobic micelle interiors compared to the dipendant MPGs and DDM, an unprecedented feature of this new detergent. Our findings provide a novel strategy for designing water-resistant detergents, advancing the field of membrane protein research.
40086882	Biosurfer for systematic tracking of regulatory mechanisms leading to protein isoform diversity.	Long-read RNA-seq has shed light on transcriptomic complexity, but questions remain about the functionality of downstream protein products. We introduce Biosurfer, a computational approach for comparing protein isoforms, while systematically tracking the transcriptional, splicing, and translational variations that underlie differences in the sequences of the protein products. Using Biosurfer, we analyzed the differences in 35,082 pairs of GENCODE annotated protein isoforms, finding a majority (70%) of variable N-termini are due to the alternative transcription start sites, while only 9% arise from 5' UTR alternative splicing (AS). Biosurfer's detailed tracking of nucleotide-to-residue relationships helps reveal an uncommonly tracked source of single amino acid residue changes arising from the codon splits at junctions. For 17% of internal sequence changes, such split codon patterns lead to single residue differences, termed "ragged codons." Of variable C-termini, 72% involve splice- or intron retention-induced reading frameshifts. We systematically characterize an unusual pattern of reading frame changes, in which the first frameshift is closely followed by a distinct second frameshift that restores the original frame, which we term a "snapback" frameshift. We analyze the long-read RNA-seq-predicted proteome of a human cell line and find similar trends as compared to our GENCODE analysis, with the exception of a higher proportion of transcripts predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated decay. Biosurfer's comprehensive characterization of long-read RNA-seq data sets should accelerate insights of the functional role of protein isoforms, providing mechanistic explanation of the origins of the proteomic diversity driven by the AS. Biosurfer is available as a Python package.
40086881	Accurate fusion transcript identification from long- and short-read isoform sequencing at bulk or single-cell resolution.	Gene fusions are found as cancer drivers in diverse adult and pediatric cancers. Accurate detection of fusion transcripts is essential in cancer clinical diagnostics and prognostics and for guiding therapeutic development. Most currently available methods for fusion transcript detection are compatible with Illumina RNA-seq involving highly accurate short-read sequences. Recent advances in long-read isoform sequencing enable the detection of fusion transcripts at unprecedented resolution in bulk and single-cell samples. Here, we developed a new computational tool, CTAT-LR-Fusion, to detect fusion transcripts from long-read RNA-seq with or without companion short reads, with applications to bulk or single-cell transcriptomes. We demonstrate that CTAT-LR-Fusion exceeds the fusion detection accuracy of alternative methods as benchmarked with simulated and genuine long-read RNA-seq. Using short- and long-read RNA-seq, we further apply CTAT-LR-Fusion to bulk transcriptomes of nine tumor cell lines and to tumor single cells derived from a melanoma sample and three metastatic high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma samples. In both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, long isoform reads yield higher sensitivity for fusion detection than short reads with notable exceptions. By combining short and long reads in CTAT-LR-Fusion, we are able to further maximize the detection of fusion splicing isoforms and fusion-expressing tumor cells.
40086449	BERT-AmPEP60: A BERT-Based Transfer Learning Approach to Predict the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations of Antimicrobial Peptides for <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative for combating bacterial drug resistance. While current computer prediction models excel at binary classification of AMPs based on sequences, there is a lack of regression methods to accurately quantify AMP activity against specific bacteria, making the identification of highly potent AMPs a challenge. Here, we present a deep learning method, BERT-AmPEP60, based on the fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture to extract embedding features from input sequences. Using the transfer learning strategy, we built regression models to predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of peptides for <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EC) and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (SA). In five independent experiments with 10% leave-out sequences as the test sets, the optimal EC and SA models outperformed the state-of-the-art regression method and traditional machine learning methods, achieving an average mean squared error of 0.2664 and 0.3032 (log μM), respectively. They also showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.7955 and 0.7530, and a Kendall correlation coefficient of 0.5797 and 0.5222, respectively. Our models outperformed existing deep learning and machine learning methods that rely on conventional sequence features. This work underscores the effectiveness of utilizing BERT with transfer learning for training quantitative AMP prediction models specific for different bacterial species. The web server of BERT-AmPEP60 can be found at https://app.cbbio.online/ampep/home. To facilitate development, the program source codes are available at https://github.com/janecai0714/AMP_regression_EC_SA.
40086069	Reference dosimetry for MRI-Linacs: an addendum to the 2020 IPEM code of practice for high-energy photon therapy dosimetry.	The 2020 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine code of practice (COP) for megavoltage dosimetry (<i>Eaton et al</i>2020<i>Phys. Med. Biol.</i><b>65</b>195006) provides standardised and practical methods for measurement of absorbed dose to water, linked to calibration by the National Physical Laboratory. This report extends the use of that COP to MRI-Linacs through the addition of two correction factors: (1) to account for the influence of the magnetic field on the absorbed dose and model-specific chamber response; and (2) to account for differences in chamber response in the beam spectrum of the MRI-Linac and the Linac where the cross-calibration is performed. Guidance is provided on practical aspects of chamber calibration and dose measurement in MRI-Linac beams, including the use of liquid water, consistent chamber orientation and corrections for other influence quantities. Using this approach uncertainties are similar to other applications of the COP.
40085817	Artificial Bone Materials for Infected Bone Defects: Advances in Antimicrobial Functions.	Infected bone defects, caused by bacterial contamination following disease or injury, result in the partial loss or destruction of bone tissue. Traditional bone transplantation and other clinical approaches often fail to address the therapeutic complexities of these conditions effectively. In recent years, advanced biomaterials have attracted significant attention for their potential to enhance treatment outcomes. This review explores the pathogenic mechanisms underlying infected bone defects, including biofilm formation and bacterial internalization into bone cells, which allow bacteria to evade the host immune system. To control bacterial infection and facilitate bone repair, we focus on antibacterial materials for bone regeneration. A detailed introduction is given on intrinsically antibacterial materials (e.g., metal alloys, oxide materials, carbon-based materials, hydroxyapatite, chitosan, and Sericin). The antibacterial functionality of bone repair materials can be enhanced through strategies such as the incorporation of antimicrobial ions, surface modification, and the combined use of multiple materials to treat infected bone defects. Key innovations discussed include biomaterials that release therapeutic agents, functional contact biomaterials, and bioresponsive materials, which collectively enhance antibacterial efficacy. Research on the clinical translation of antimicrobial bone materials has also facilitated their practical application in infection prevention and bone healing. In conclusion, advancements in biomaterials provide promising pathways for developing more biocompatible, effective, and personalized therapies to reconstruct infected bone defects.
40085549	Deep-Learning Potential Molecular Dynamics Study on Nanopolycrystalline Al-Er Alloys: Effects of Er Concentration, Grain Boundary Segregation, and Grain Size on Plastic Deformation.	Understanding the tensile mechanical properties of Al-Er alloys at the atomic scale is essential, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer valuable insights. However, these simulations are constrained by the unavailability of suitable interatomic potentials. In this study, the deep potential (DP) approach, aided by high-throughput first-principles calculations, was utilized to develop an Al-Er interatomic potential specifically for MD simulations. Systematic comparisons between the physical properties (e.g., energy-volume curves, melting point, elastic constants) predicted by the DP model and those obtained from density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that the developed DP model for Al-Er alloys possesses reliable predictive capabilities while retaining DFT-level accuracy. Our findings confirm that Al<sub>3</sub>Er, Al<sub>2</sub>Er, and AlEr<sub>2</sub> exhibit mechanical stability. The calculated melting point of Al<sub>3</sub>Er (1398 K) shows a 57 K deviation from the experimental value (1341 K). With the Er content increasing from 0.01% to 0.064 at.% in Al-Er alloys, the grain boundary (GB) concentration of Er atoms increases from 0.03 to 0.07% following Monte Carlo (MC) annealing optimization. The Al-0.05 at.%Er alloy exhibits the highest yield strength, with an increase of 0.128 GPa (6.1%) compared to pure Al. For Al-0.05 at.%Er alloys with varying average grain sizes, the GB concentration of Er atoms increases by about 1.4-1.6 times after MC annealing compared to the average Er content. Additionally, the Al-Er alloys reach the peak yield strength of 2.214 GPa when the average grain size is 11.72 nm. The GB segregation of Er atoms lowers the system energy and thus enhances stability. Notable changes in the segregation behavior of Er atoms were observed with increasing Er concentration and decreasing grain size. These results would facilitate the understanding of the mechanical characteristics of Al-Er alloys and offer a theoretical basis for developing advanced nanopolycrystalline Al-Er alloys.

40085003	Employing Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) Methods to Facilitate the <i>In Silico</i> ADMET Properties Prediction.	The rationale for using ADMET prediction tools in the early drug discovery paradigm is to guide the design of new compounds with favorable ADMET properties and ultimately minimize the attrition rates of drug failures. Artificial intelligence (AI) in <i>in silico</i> ADMET modeling has gained momentum due to its high-throughput and low-cost attributes. In this study, we developed a machine learning model capable of predicting 11 ADMET properties of chemical compounds. Each model was constructed by combining one of 40 classification algorithms including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), support vector machine (SVM), and gradient boosting (GB) with one of three predefined hyperparameter configurations. This process can be efficiently performed using automated machine learning (AutoML) methods, which automatically search for the best combination of model algorithms and optimized hyperparameters. We developed optimal predictive models for 11 different ADMET properties using the Hyperopt-sklearn AutoML method. All of the developed models depicted an area under the ROC curve (AUC) >0.8. Furthermore, our developed models outperformed most of the ADMET properties and showed comparable performance in other properties when evaluated on external data sets and compared with published predictive models. Our results support the applicability of AutoML in ADMET prediction and will be helpful for ADMET prediction in early-stage drug discovery.
40084923	177Lu-LNC1004 Radioligand Therapy in Patients with End-stage Metastatic Cancers: A Single-Center, Single-Arm, Phase II Study.	Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts and certain tumor cells, making it a promising therapeutic target for various malignancies. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-Evans blue-FAP inhibitor (177Lu-LNC1004) radioligand therapy (RLT) for treating end-stage metastatic tumors.
40084909	Multitarget Natural Compounds for Ischemic Stroke Treatment: Integration of Deep Learning Prediction and Experimental Validation.	Ischemic stroke's complex pathophysiology demands therapeutic approaches targeting multiple pathways simultaneously, yet current treatments remain limited. We developed an innovative drug discovery pipeline combining a deep learning approach with experimental validation to identify natural compounds with comprehensive neuroprotective properties. Our computational framework integrated SELFormer, a transformer-based deep learning model, and multiple deep learning algorithms to predict NC bioactivity against seven crucial stroke-related targets (<i>ACE, GLA, MMP9, NPFFR2, PDE4D</i>, and <i>eNOS</i>). The pipeline encompassed IC50 predictions, clustering analysis, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)-based bioactivity profiling followed by molecular docking studies and experimental validation. Analysis revealed six distinct NC clusters with unique molecular signatures. UMAP projection identified 11 medium-activity (6 < pIC50 ≤ 7) and 57 high-activity (pIC50 > 7) compounds, with molecular docking confirming strong correlations between binding energies and predicted pIC50 values. <i>In vitro</i> studies using NGF-differentiated PC12 cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects of four high-activity compounds: feruloyl glucose, l-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, mulberrin, and ellagic acid. These compounds enhanced cell viability, reduced acetylcholinesterase activity and lipid peroxidation, suppressed <i>TNF-</i>α expression, and upregulated <i>BDNF</i> mRNA levels. Notably, mulberrin and ellagic acid showed superior efficacy in modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotrophic signaling. This study establishes a robust deep learning-driven framework for identifying multitarget natural therapeutics for ischemic stroke. The validated compounds, particularly mulberrin and ellagic acid, are promising for stroke treatment development. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating computational prediction with experimental validation in accelerating drug discovery for complex neurological disorders.
40084906	Side-Functionalization of Poly(l-methionine) for Ice Control.	Controlling ice growth is crucial during the cryopreservation of cells, but the current application of small molecules as cryoprotectants still remains a challenge. Inspired by structures of natural antifreeze (glyco)proteins, in this work, functionalized poly(l-methionine)s (PMets) are synthesized with different side groups including hydroxyl, threonine-mimetic with both methyl and hydroxyl groups (PMet-MOH), zwitterion with carboxyl and sulfonium (PMet-COOH), glycerol, and trehalose pendants. Results suggest that these functionalized PMets tend to self-assemble into 100-300 nm nanoparticles with positive charges in water. The functional structures have a remarkable influence on their ice control properties. It is supposed that PMet-MOH inhibits ice growth possibly through the adsorption mechanism by adjacent methyl and hydroxyl groups, whereas trehalose-tethered PMet can restrict diffusion of water molecules with the strongest ice recrystallization inhibition activity and zwitterionic PMet-COOH promotes ice nucleation obviously. This work offers valuable insight into the development of functional polypeptides as promising biocompatible cryoprotectants.
40084588	Freeze-tolerant crickets fortify their actin cytoskeleton in fat body tissue.	Animals that overwinter in temperate climates must prevent or repair damage to their cells to survive winter, but we know little about how they protect cellular structure at the cytoskeletal level. Both chilling (no ice formation) and freezing (ice formation) are hypothesized to cause substantial challenges to cell structure and the cytoskeleton. The spring field cricket Gryllus veletis becomes freeze tolerant following a 6 week acclimation to autumn-like conditions, during which they differentially express multiple cytoskeleton-related genes. We tested the hypothesis that G. veletis alter their cytoskeleton during acclimation to support maintenance of cytoskeletal structure during freezing and thawing. We used immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy to characterize changes in microfilaments (F-actin, a polymer of G-actin) and microtubules (a polymer of α- and β-tubulin) in three tissues. While we saw no effect of acclimation on microtubules, crickets increased the abundance of microfilaments in fat body tissue and Malpighian tubules. When we chilled or froze these freeze-tolerant crickets, there was no apparent damage to the actin or tubulin cytoskeleton in fat body tissue, but there was decreased cytoskeleton abundance in Malpighian tubules. When we froze freeze-intolerant (unacclimated) crickets, microfilament abundance decreased in fat body tissue, while microfilaments were unaffected by chilling to the same subzero temperature. Our study shows that freeze-tolerant crickets are able to prevent or rapidly repair ice-induced damage to the actin cytoskeleton in fat body tissue, likely as a result of preparatory changes in advance of freezing, i.e. during acclimation. We suggest future directions examining the mechanisms that underlie these structural changes.
40084539	Body fluid diagnostics using activatable optical probes.	<i>In vitro</i> diagnostics often detects biomarkers in body fluids (such as blood, urine, sputum, and cerebrospinal fluids) to identify life-threatening diseases at an early stage, monitor overall health, or provide information to help cure, treat, or prevent diseases. Most clinically used optical <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic tests utilize dye-labeled biomolecules for biomarker recognition and signal readout, which typically involve complex steps and long processing times. Activatable optical probes (AOPs), which spontaneously activate their optical signals only in the presence of disease biomarkers, offer higher signal-to-background ratios and improved detection specificity. They also have the potential to simplify detection procedures by eliminating multiple washing steps. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the use of AOPs for pre-clinical and clinical body fluid diagnostics across various diseases, including cancer, nephro-urological disorders, infectious diseases, and digestive diseases. We begin by discussing the molecular design strategies of AOPs to achieve different optical signal readouts and biomarker specificity. We then highlight their diagnostic applications in various disease models and body fluids. Finally, we address the challenges and future perspectives of AOPs in enhancing body fluid diagnostics and advancing precision medicine.
40080423	Regulating the Characteristic Networks of Biodegradable Poly(l-malic acid-ε-caprolactone) Shape-Memory Materials: From Plastics to Elastomers.	Developing new biodegradable polyesters with well-defined structures is of interest. We reported an attractive two-component aliphatic polyester-based thermoset, which was prepared via the esterification of biomass-derived l-malic acid oligomers and three-arm poly(ε-caprolactone) (3a-PCL) triols. The chemical network formed via the ester bonding and physical network caused by the crystallization of a 3a-PCL arm chain coexist in the thermoset, and the competition of the two characteristic networks leads to a negative correlation between the degree of covalent cross-linking and the degree of crystallization; thereby, the mechanical state of the thermosets can be easily tuned: from the plastic to elastomer state. Moreover, the crystallization temperature and melting point of the thermosets range in 30 °C ∼ 50 °C and -7 °C ∼ 18 °C, respectively, which are favorable for shape morphing as the thermosets are used as shape-memory materials. This work also provides valuable information about tailoring the mechanical and thermal properties of star-shaped polyester-based thermosets.
40079812	Breaking symmetry for better catalysis: insights into single-atom catalyst design.	Breaking structural symmetry has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning the electronic structure of catalytic sites, thereby significantly enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs). The inherent symmetric electron density in conventional SACs, such as M-N<sub>4</sub> configurations, often leads to suboptimal adsorption and activation of reaction intermediates, limiting their catalytic efficiency. By disrupting this symmetry of SACs, the electronic distribution around the active center can be modulated, thereby improving both the selectivity and adsorption strength for key intermediates. These changes directly impact the reaction pathways, lowering energy barriers, and enhancing catalytic activity. However, achieving precise modulation through SAC symmetry breaking for better catalysis remains challenging. This review focuses on the atomic-level symmetry-breaking strategies of catalysts, including charge breaking, coordination breaking, and geometric breaking, as well as their electrocatalytic applications in electronic structure tuning and active site modulation. Through modifications to the M-N<sub>4</sub> framework, three primary configurations are achieved: unsaturated coordination M-N<sub><i>x</i>(<i>x</i>=1,2,3)</sub>, non-metallic doping MX-N<sub><i>x</i>(<i>x</i>=1,2,3)</sub>, and bimetallic doping M<sub>1</sub>M<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>4</sub>. Advanced characterization techniques combined with density functional theory (DFT) elucidate the impact of these strategies on oxidation, reduction, and bifunctional catalytic reactions. This review highlights the significance of symmetry-breaking structures in catalysis and underscores the need for further research to achieve precise control at the atomic-level.
40079232	A dual-purification system to isolate mitochondrial subpopulations.	Mitochondria perform diverse functions, including producing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, synthesizing macromolecule precursors, maintaining redox balance among many others. Given this diversity of functions, we and others have hypothesized that cells maintain specialized subpopulations of mitochondria. To begin addressing this hypothesis, we developed a new dual-purification system to isolate subpopulations of mitochondria for chemical and biochemical analyses. We used APEX2 proximity labeling such that mitochondria were biotinylated based on proximity to another organelle. All mitochondria were isolated by an elutable MitoTag-based affinity precipitation system. Biotinylated mitochondria were then purified using immobilized avidin. We used this system to compare the proteomes of endosome- and lipid droplet-associated mitochondria in U-2 OS cells, which demonstrated that these subpopulations were indistinguishable from one another but were distinct from the global mitochondria proteome. Our results suggest that this purification system could aid in describing subpopulations that contribute to intracellular mitochondrial heterogeneity, and that this heterogeneity might be more substantial than previously imagined.
40078104	Clinical significance of sleepiness: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement.	Alertness is a necessity for well-being and performance, and sleepiness is associated with cognitive and functional impairments that can have a negative impact on performance, health, mood, safety, and quality of life. In severe cases, sleepiness can lead to debilitation, injury, or death. Sleepiness is a marker of insufficient sleep and is the major patient-reported symptom associated with disorders of sleep and wakefulness such as narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. Excessive sleepiness - the inability to stay awake and alert during the major waking episodes of the day - is reported by one-third of U.S. adults. It is the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that sleepiness is a critical patient-reported outcome that is associated with increased risk for adverse health effects and diminished quality of life. The evaluation and management of sleepiness is essential for patient safety and patient-centered care. The health care system must support the evaluation and management of sleepiness so that patients can experience restorative sleep and daytime alertness. More research and innovation are needed to improve the treatment of sleep-wake disorders, including studies in diverse populations that support the development of tailored therapies for daytime sleepiness.
40077987	UMPPI: Unveiling Multilevel Protein-Peptide Interaction Prediction via Language Models.	Protein-peptide interactions are essential to cellular processes and disease mechanisms. Identifying protein-peptide binding residues is critical for understanding peptide function and advancing drug discovery. However, experimental methods are costly and time-intensive, while existing computational approaches often predict interactions or binding residues separately, lack effective feature integration, or rely heavily on limited high-quality structural data. To address these challenges, we propose UMPPI (Unveiling Multilevel Protein-Peptide Interaction), a multiobjective framework based on the pretrained protein language model ESM2. UMPPI simultaneously predicts binary protein-peptide interactions and binding residues on both peptides and proteins through a multiobjective optimization strategy. By integrating ESM2 to encode sequences and extract latent structural information, UMPPI bridges the gap between sequence-based and structure-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrated that UMPPI successfully captured binary interactions between peptides and proteins and identified the binding residues on peptides and proteins. UMPPI can serve as a useful tool for protein-peptide interaction prediction and identification of critical binding residues, thereby facilitating the peptide drug discovery process.
40077925	Gadolinium Functionalized Carbon Dot Complexes for Dual-Modal Imaging: Structure, Performance, and Applications.	Gadolinium functionalized carbon dot complexes (Gd-CDs) have both the fluorescent properties of carbon dots and the magnetic characteristics of gadolinium ions, exhibiting excellent biocompatibility, high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and deep tissue penetration in bioimaging. As fluorescence (FL) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes, Gd-CDs have attracted significant attention in dual-modal biological imaging. This review summarizes recent advances in Gd-CDs, focusing on their structure, optical and magnetic properties, and applications in dual-modal imaging. First, according to the different existing forms of gadolinium in carbon dots, the structures of Gd-CDs are categorized into chelation, electrostatic interaction, and encapsulation. Second, the mechanisms and performances of Gd-CDs in dual-modal imaging are introduced in detail. The reported Gd-CDs have a maximum quantum yield of 69.86%, with a fluorescence emission wavelength reaching up to 625 nm, and the optimum longitudinal and transverse relaxivity rates are 35.39 and 115.6 mM<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, showing excellent FL/MRI capacities. Subsequently, the progress in their applications in dual-modal cellular imaging, <i>in vivo</i> imaging, and integrated cancer diagnosis and therapy is reviewed. Finally, the challenges and issues faced by Gd-CDs in their development are summarized, providing new insights for their controlled synthesis and widespread application in the biomedical field of dual-modal imaging.
40074672	Synthetic Strategy to Build High-Molecular-Weight Poly(L-tyrosine) and Its Unexplored β-Sheet Block Copolymer Nanoarchitectures.	Synthesis of high-molecular-weight polypeptides and their block copolymer macromolecular architectures from β-sheet-promoting L-amino acids is still an unresolved problem. Here, an elegant steric hindrance-assisted ring-opening polymerization (SHAROP) strategy is introduced to access β-sheet poly(L-tyrosine) having more than 250 units. The scope of the synthetic methodology is expanded to access unexplored poly(L-tyrosine)-based higher-order β-sheet block copolymer nanoassemblies. In this strategy, a <i>tert-</i>butyl benzyl unit is employed as a steric handle that imbibes the solubility by promoting the α-helical conformation in the propagating polypeptide chains. The living ROP process enables the synthesis of well-defined block copolymers initiated by poly(L-tyrosine) living-chain ends or growing the poly(L-tyrosine) chains from the pre-existing macroinitiators of poly(L-glutamate) or poly(L-lysine). Acid-catalyzed postpolymerization deprotection restores the poly(L-tyrosine) blocks in their nascent β-sheet conformations. Thioflavin-T fluorescence assay establishes the β-sheet core-shell structures of these nanoassemblies, which are found to be nontoxic to mammalian cell lines.
40073290	Inflammatory Microenvironment-Modulated Conductive Hydrogel Promotes Vascularized Bone Regeneration in Infected Bone Defects.	Infected bone defects show a significant reduction in neovascularization during the healing process, primarily due to persistent bacterial infection and immune microenvironmental disorders. Existing treatments are difficult to simultaneously meet the requirements of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory treatments for infected bone defects, which is a key clinical therapeutic challenge that needs to be addressed. In this study, a conductive hydrogel based on copper nanoparticles was developed for controlling bacterial infection and remodeling the immune microenvironment. The hydrogel not only effectively eliminates bacteria that exist in the infected bone defect region but also transmits electrical signals to restore the disordered immune microenvironment. In vitro studies have shown that the hydrogel has excellent biocompatibility and can modulate macrophage polarization by transmitting electrical signals to reduce inflammation and promote neovascularization. In vivo studies further confirmed that the hydrogel scaffold not only rapidly cleared clinical bacterial infections but also significantly induced the formation of vascularized new bone tissue within 4 weeks. This work provides a simple and innovative strategy to fabricate copper-containing conductive hydrogels that show great potential for application in the field of therapeutics for infected bone regeneration.
40072940	Accelerated Missense Mutation Identification in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Using Deep Learning.	We use a combination of Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation results and deep learning (DL) strategies for the rapid identification of large structural changes caused by missense mutations in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We used ∼6500 IDP sequences from MobiDB database of length 20-300 to obtain gyration radii from BD simulation on a coarse-grained single-bead amino acid model (HPS2 model) used by us and others [Dignon, G. L. <i>PLoS Comput. Biol.</i> 2018, 14, e1005941,Tesei, G. <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.</i> 2021, 118, e2111696118,Seth, S. <i>J. Chem. Phys.</i> 2024, 160, 014902] to generate the training sets for the DL algorithm. Using the gyration radii ⟨<i>R</i><sub>g</sub>⟩ of the simulated IDPs as the training set, we develop a multilayer perceptron neural net (NN) architecture that predicts the gyration radii of 33 IDPs previously studied by using BD simulation with 97% accuracy from the sequence and the corresponding parameters from the HPS model. We now utilize this NN to predict gyration radii of every permutation of missense mutations in IDPs. Our approach successfully identifies mutation-prone regions that induce significant alterations in the radius of gyration when compared to the wild-type IDP sequence. We further validate the prediction by running BD simulations on the subset of identified mutants. The neural network yields a (10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>6</sup>)-fold faster computation in the search space for potentially harmful mutations. Our findings have substantial implications for rapid identification and understanding of diseases related to missense mutations in IDPs and for the development of potential therapeutic interventions. The method can be extended to accurate predictions of other mutation effects in disordered proteins.
40071301	Bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphide chemistry: a half-century of advances across the periodic table.	Whilst bis(trimethylsilyl)amide has been used extensively as a ligand across the periodic table, the chemistry of its heavier group 15 congeners is relatively underdeveloped. However, bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphide coordination chemistry has provided unique structural motifs and has also shown potential applications in catalysis, materials science, and bioinorganic chemistry. This review, which marks 55 years since the first report of a bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphide complex, provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis, characterisation and reactivity of structurally authenticated s-, p-, d- and f-block metal complexes of this ligand, focusing on salient single crystal XRD and NMR spectroscopic data. We discuss the factors influencing the diverse coordination modes and reactivity profiles of bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphide complexes, together with an overview of their potential as precursors for novel solid-state materials, aiming to inspire future research endeavours using this ligand. We also review the small number of bis(triisopropylsilyl)phosphide complexes, in order to provide motivation for the future study of other bis(silyl)phosphide ligands.
40067950	Fabrication of pH- and Ultrasound-Responsive Polymeric Micelles: The Effect of Amphiphilic Block Copolymers with Different Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Block Ratios for Self-Assembly and Controlled Drug Release.	Stimuli-responsive polymeric vehicles can change their physical or chemical properties when exposed to internal or external triggers, enabling precise spatiotemporal control of drug release. Nevertheless, systematic research is lacking in preparing dual stimuli-responsive amphiphilic block copolymers with different hydrophilic/hydrophobic block ratios in forming self-assembled structures. Here, we synthesized two types of block copolymers consisting of the hydrophobic segments (i.e., pH-responsive 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DEA) and ultrasound-responsive 2-methoxyethyl methacrylate (MEMA)) and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) segments, forming mPEG<sub>X</sub>-<i>b</i>-P(DEA<sub>Y</sub>-<i>co</i>-MEMA<sub>Z</sub>). These amphiphilic block copolymers can self-assemble to form polymeric micelles, and their structures (e.g., size) and properties (e.g., critical vesicle concentration, stability, stimuli-responsiveness to pH and ultrasound, drug loading efficiency, and controlled drug release performance) were thoroughly investigated. <i>In vitro</i> cell studies further demonstrate that ultrasound can efficiently trigger drug release from polymeric micelles, emphasizing their potential for controlled drug delivery in therapeutic applications.
40067881	Surface-Vinylated Cellulose Nanocrystals as Cross-Linkers for Hydrogel Composites.	Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) fillers have been shown to significantly improve the performance of polymer composites and hydrogels, elevating both strength and toughness. Polymer grafting from the surface of the nanocrystals has been employed to enhance matrix-filler interactions and keep the fillers dispersed within the matrix. However, such approaches often rely on multistep syntheses and diligent process control. Here, we propose modifying the nanocrystal surface to carry vinyl moieties, turning the particles into cross-linking comonomers. Using allyl glycidyl ether in an aqueous modification route, we were able to decorate the CNCs with varying amounts of vinyl moieties. Subsequent dispersion in 2-hydroxy methacrylate and thermally initiated free radical polymerization yielded composite materials that showed superior mechanical performance compared to those obtained from monomeric cross-linkers and unmodified CNCs. The large discrepancies in the observed glass transition temperatures of the obtained materials suggest, however, that the impact of the fillers on the polymerization kinetics is significant and less easily explained.

40067283	Recent Advances and Challenges for Biological Materials in Micro/Nanocarrier Synthesis for Bone Infection and Tissue Engineering.	Roughly 1.71 billion people worldwide suffer from large bone abnormalities, which are the primary cause of disability. Traditional bone grafting procedures have several drawbacks that impair their therapeutic efficacy and restrict their use in clinical settings. A great deal of work has been done to create fresh, more potent strategies. Under these circumstances, a crucial technique for the regeneration of major lesions has emerged: bone tissue engineering (BTE). BTE involves the use of biomaterials that can imitate the natural design of bone. To yet, no biological material has been able to fully meet the parameters of the perfect implantable material, even though several varieties have been created and investigated for bone regeneration. Against this backdrop, researchers have focused a great deal of interest over the past few years on the subject of nanotechnology and the use of nanostructures in regenerative medicine. The ability to create nanoengineered particles that can overcome the current constraints in regenerative strategies─such as decreased cell proliferation and differentiation, insufficient mechanical strength in biological materials, and insufficient production of extrinsic factors required for effective osteogenesis has revolutionized the field of bone and tissue engineering. The effects of nanoparticles on cell characteristics and the application of biological materials for bone regeneration are the main topics of our review, which summarizes the most recent in vitro and in vivo research on the application of nanotechnology in the context of BTE.
40066752	In Vivo and In Vitro Study of a Multifunctional SF/nHAp Corrosion-Resistant Bio-Coating Prepared on MAO Magnesium Alloy via Ultrasonic Spraying.	Magnesium alloys are often used in bone repair surgeries due to their biodegradability and excellent elastic modulus, making them a promising alternative to traditional nondegradable implants like titanium alloys. However, their rapid degradation rate limits their use as implants in the body. To enhance the corrosion resistance and bioactivity of magnesium alloys, we applied an ultrasonic spray coating on microarc oxidized (MAO) AZ31 magnesium alloy, using a mixture of silk fibroin (SF) and nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp). This SF/nHAp composite embeds directly into the micropores on the MAO-treated surface without additional physical or chemical treatment, forming a stable interlocked coating structure. The effects of different spray parameters on coating adhesion and interface characteristics were investigated, leading to the development of a corrosion-resistant and highly biocompatible composite coating. Further biological evaluations were conducted through subcutaneous implantation, assessing the in vivo degradation of the samples and the surrounding tissue response from multiple perspectives. A novel concept of in vivo tissue-reactive coatings was proposed, suggesting that highly biocompatible coating materials, in the early stages postimplantation, enable surrounding fibrous tissues to closely adhere to the surface, thereby slowing material degradation. As a result, the highly bioactive MAO-SF/nHAp coating significantly enhances the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys, reduces hydrogen evolution, promotes regeneration of surrounding tissues, and minimizes postimplant inflammation. This approach offers a new strategy to improve the biocompatibility and corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys in vivo, suggesting that the overall evaluation of biodegradable magnesium alloys should focus more on assessing in-body corrosion.
40066672	Multifunctional Liposomes with Enhanced Stability for Imaging-Guided Cancer Chemodynamic and Photothermal Therapy.	Improvements in tumor therapy require a combination of strategies where targeted treatment is critical. We developed a new versatile nanoplatform, MA@E, that generates high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with effective photothermal conversions in the removal of tumors. Enhanced stability liposomes were employed as carriers to facilitate the uniform distribution and stable storage of encapsulated gold nanorods (AuNRs) and Mn-MIL-100 metal-organic frameworks, with efficient delivery of MA@E to the cytoplasm. In the targeted phagocytosis of tumor cells, MA@E can effectively deplete the reduced glutathione (GSH) with increased hydroxyl radicals that combine with Mn<sup>2+</sup> released from Mn-MIL-100 to trigger Fenton-like reactions, generating ROS that induces cell apoptosis. Exposure to near-infrared (NIR-II) irradiation results in a AuNRs-induced thermogenic effect that expedites the release of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and promotes Fenton-like reactions, achieving increased production of <sup>•</sup>OH. In the murine tumor model, MA@E effectively removed the implanted tumor tissue within 2 days without any obvious toxic effects. This response is attributed to a synergism involving the photothermal capability of AuNRs and ROS chemodynamic treatment. The proposed MA@E provides a new approach to utilizing unstable nanomaterials in effective tumor therapy.
40066591	Engineering magnetism in hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites.	The chemical and structural flexibility of hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) provides an ideal platform for engineering not only their well-studied optical properties, but also their magnetic ones. In this review we present HOIPs from a new perspective, turning the attention to their magnetic properties and their potential as a new class of on-demand low-dimensional magnetic materials. Focusing on HOIPs containing transition metals, we comprehensively present the progress that has been made in preparing, understanding and exploring magnetic HOIPs. First, we briefly introduce HOIPs in terms of composition and crystal structure and examine the synthesis protocols commonly used to prepare those showing magnetic properties. Then, we present their rich magnetic behavior and phenomenology; discuss their origin and guidelines for tuning them by changing the perovskite phase, chemical composition and dimensionality; and showcase their potential application in magneto-optoelectronics and spintronics. Finally, we describe the current challenges in the field, such as their integration into devices, as well as the emerging possibilities of moving from magnetic doping to pure transition metal-based HOIPs, which will motivate further studies in the future.
40065740	Apple peels as an edible source of phenolic bioactive compounds with antidiabetic and antiglycation properties.	Apples (<i>Malus domestica</i> Borkh.) are one of the most consumed fruits around the world with a high production of peels as wastes and by-products. In this work, peels from different commercial and local apple samples are explored as a source of phenolic bioactive compounds that could be directly related to the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Six different cultivars from local and commercial apple samples were processed to obtain the phenolic compounds by ultrasonication of the peels using methanol as the solvent. The phenolic content was explored using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and the quantification of 37 individual phenolic compounds was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Cellular viability was determined by performing the MTT assay in Caco-2 cell cultures exposed to the phenolic extracts. Subsequently, the capacity to inhibit α-glucosidase, α-amylase and pancreatic lipase enzymes, as well as antiglycation and antioxidant activities, was evaluated. These apple peel samples were considered a source of phenolic compounds with hyperoside, delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside, chlorogenic acid, phlorizin, epicatechin and procyanidin B2 as the main constituents. All samples neutralized the production of advanced glycation end-products and exhibited antiradical activities in a dose-dependent manner; four samples (Amarilla de Octubre, Manzana Helada, Verde Doncella and Pinova) inhibited α-glucosidase but only the sample known as "Amarilla de Octubre" was successful in inhibiting pancreatic α-amylase. Cytotoxicity was discarded in Caco-2 cell cultures at physiological concentrations considering these extracts as a source of phenolic compounds with antidiabetic, antiglycation and antioxidant properties.
40065192	Recent Advances in Modeling Tissues Using 3D Bioprinted Nanocellulose Bioinks.	Bioprinting creates 3D tissue models by depositing cells encapsulated in biocompatible materials. These 3D printed models can better emulate physiological conditions in comparison with traditional 2D cell cultures or animal models. Such models can be produced from human cells, possessing human genetics and replicating the 3D microenvironment found <i>in vivo.</i> Many different types of biocompatible materials serve as bioinks, including gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), alginate, fibrin, and gelatin. Nanocellulose has emerged as a promising addition to these materials. Nanocellulose─composed of cellulose chain bundles with lateral dimensions ranging from a few to several tens of nanometers─possesses key properties for 3D bioprinting applications. It can form biocompatible hydrogels, which have excellent physical properties, and its structure resembles collagen, making it useful for modeling tissues with high collagen content such as bone, cartilage, sink, and muscle. Here we review some of the recent advances in the use of nanocellulose in bioinks for the creation of bone, cartilage, skin, and muscle tissue specific models and identify areas for future progress.

40063925	Hybrid Anticancer Peptide Synergistically Improving Cancer Cell Uptake and Inducing Apoptosis Mediated by Membrane Fusion.	Anticancer peptides (ACPs) have exhibited tremendous potential in tumor treatment. However, low peptide delivery efficiency limits some ACPs' clinical application. Herein, we designed a hybrid peptide named AFP-KLA and investigated the tumor cell-specific targeting ability and proapoptotic properties. Our results revealed that AFP peptides primarily facilitated the selective binding of KLA peptides to tumor cell membranes, enabling the whole peptides to enter the cells via membrane fusion. Furthermore, AFP-KLA demonstrated superior colocalization within MCF-7 cells and induced cell apoptosis by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane. Subsequently, we constructed a tumor model subcutaneously in mice and tested the antitumor activity of the designed ACP in vivo. We observed that AFP-KLA could effectively inhibit tumor growth and displayed excellent antitumor activity. In summary, these results suggest that AFP-KLA is possibly a promising therapeutic agent for targeted therapy of breast cancer and can guide the future design of ACPs.
40063534	Spontaneous Hollow Coacervate Transition of Silk Fibroin via Dilution and Its Transition to Microcapsules.	Polymeric microcapsules are useful for drug delivery, microreactors, and cargo transport, but traditional fabrication methods require complex processes and harsh conditions. Coacervates, formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), offer a promising alternative for microcapsule fabrication. Recent studies have shown that coacervates can spontaneously form hollow cavities under specific conditions. Here, we investigate the spontaneous hollow coacervate transition of silk fibroin (SF). SF coacervates, induced by mixing SF with dextran, calcium ions, and copper ions, transition to hollow coacervates upon dilution. Adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) further transforms them into vesicle-like capsule coacervates, which solidify into microcapsules. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully loaded a high-molecular-weight polymer cargo into the hollow cavity and bioactive enzyme cargo into the capsule layer by simply mixing the cargo with the coacervate solution. Our results demonstrate a facile, organic-solvent-free approach for fabricating SF-based microcapsules and provide insight into the mechanisms driving hollow coacervate formation.
40059646	Synthesis of a Novel DMSP-Typed Zwitterion and Construction on PET Surface via Surface-Initiated RAFT Method.	Mimicked by the structure of dimethyl sulfoxide propionate (DMSP), a novel zwitterion monomer of <i>N</i>-methylacryloyl <i>S</i>-methyl l-cysteine methyl sulfonium salt (NMASMCMS) was synthesized and characterized for the first time through three steps using l-cysteine as a starting material. Poly(NMASMCMS) brushes were constructed on PET sheets via surface-initiated reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (SI-RAFT) polymerization. The physical and chemical structures were characterized by water contact angle (WCA), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The polymer brush grafted sheets (PET-B) had good hydrophilicity and high lubricity. Moreover, PET-B sheets exhibited excellent antifouling and hemocompatible properties with low protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, platelet adhesion, and hemolysis.
40059311	Controlling Protein Immobilization over Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) Microparticles Using Substrate Binding Domain from PHA Depolymerase.	Biointerface decoration with ligands is a crucial requirement to modulate biodistribution, increase half-life, and provide navigation control for targeted micro- or nanostructured systems. To better control the process of ligand functionalization over three-dimensional (3D) polyester surfaces, we report the characterization of hybrid proteins developed to enhance the anchoring efficiency over polymeric surfaces and preserve optimal spatial orientation: sfGFP, mRFP1, and the RBD proteins were attached to a polyester substrate binding domain (SBD) formed by the C-terminus region of PHA depolymerase. The binding ability was evaluated over poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) microparticles (MP) and two-dimensional (2D) surfaces. The PHB interfaces revealed a high affinity toward the proteins linked with SBD, displaying higher protein contents compared to untagged proteins. The MP decorated with RBD-SBD exhibited limited MRC5 internalization and cytotoxicity without a significant impact caused by the RBD protein, suggesting that the system might be adapted for targeted drug delivery and vaccine applications.
40058797	Improving porcine in vitro blastocyst development using fetal bovine serum, amino acids, and insulin-transferrin-selenium.	In vitro production of porcine-hatched blastocysts is important for various applications. However, the mechanobiology of blastocoel expansion and hatching remains poorly understood. Our study aimed to efficiently produce hatched blastocysts and investigate the hatching mechanics of late-stage porcine embryos using time-lapse assessment. In this study, fetal bovine serum (FBS), amino acids (AA), and insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) were added individually or in combination to culture day 5 parthenogenetic morulae and early blastocysts to investigate their developmental capacity. We found that FBS-AA-ITS supplementation significantly promoted blastocoel expansion (4.4-fold), accelerated early hatching (at day 6 vs. day 7.5) and improved hatching rates (39.59 ± 4.34% vs. 0 ± 0% on day 7, and 80.02 ± 2.93% vs. 2.78 ± 1.60% on day 8) compared with non-supplemented controls. It also increased the number of trophectoderm (2.5-fold) and inner cell mass (2.7-fold). Furthermore, FBS-AA-ITS elevated BCL2 expression and reduced BAX expression, potentially inhibiting apoptosis. In in vitro fertilized embryos, the combination also significantly improved the hatching rate (8.3-fold) and cell number (2.7-fold). Analysis of the effects of FBS on hatching dynamics revealed that FBS enhanced hatching by increasing the number of blastomeres and blastocoel diameter. Blastocysts supplemented with FBS had significantly smaller hatching sizes (320.09 ± 5.01 µm vs. 343.95 ± 5.67 µm) and faster rate of hatching progress (5.6-fold) compared with non-FBS groups. In conclusion, FBS-AA-ITS played a pivotal role in supporting the development of late-stage porcine embryos and significantly accelerated their progression through the embryonic developmental phase.
40057944	Effectiveness of The Umbrella Collaboration Versus Traditional Umbrella Reviews for Evidence Synthesis in Health Care: Protocol for a Validation Study.	The synthesis of evidence in health care is essential for informed decision-making and policy development. This study aims to validate The Umbrella Collaboration (TU), an innovative, semiautomatic tertiary evidence synthesis methodology, by comparing it with Traditional Umbrella Reviews (TUR), which are currently the gold standard.
40056101	Designing Biobased Poly(ethylene-<i>co</i>-isosorbide terephthalate) Copolyesters with Tunable Properties and Degradability.	Production of high-performance polyesters with tailored degradability remains a challenge. Here, a series of poly(ethylene-<i>co</i>-isosorbide terephthalate) (PEIT) copolyesters were synthesized by varying the isosorbide (IS) content (0-20 mol %) using tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) as the catalyst. By variation of the IS content, the thermal, mechanical, and optical properties of the copolyesters were effectively tailored. As the IS content increased, the <i>T</i><sub><i>g</i></sub> was raised from 80 to 101 °C, and the tensile strength from 58.8 to 68.7 MPa. Moreover, excellent transparency was maintained (up to 90% light transmittance). Interestingly, the susceptibility to hydrolytic degradation was significantly enhanced by the incorporation of IS, with PEIT-20 showing approximately 3.5 times higher weight loss compared to PET after 50 days of alkaline degradation in 0.1 M NaOH solution. This outlines an attractive approach for developing high-performance copolyesters with tunable properties and degradation rates, suitable for applications in transparent thermal packaging materials.
40054862	Assessing DNA methylation detection for primary human tissue using Nanopore sequencing.	DNA methylation most commonly occurs as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in the human genome and has been associated with human diseases. Recent developments in single-molecule sequencing technologies (Oxford Nanopore Technologies [ONT] and Pacific Biosciences [PacBio]) have enabled readouts of long, native DNA molecules, including cytosine methylation. ONT recently upgraded their Nanopore sequencing chemistry and kits from the R9 to the R10 version, which yielded increased accuracy and sequencing throughput. However, the effects on methylation detection have not yet been documented. Here, we performed a series of computational analyses to characterize differences in Nanopore-based 5mC detection between the ONT R9 and R10 chemistries. We compared 5mC calls in R9 and R10 for three human genome data sets: a cell line, a frontal cortex brain sample, and a blood sample. We performed an in-depth analysis on CpG islands and homopolymer regions, and documented high concordance for methylation detection among sequencing technologies. The strongest correlation was observed between Nanopore R10 and Illumina bisulfite technologies for cell line-derived data sets. Subtle differences in methylation data sets between technologies can impact analysis tools such as differential methylation calling software. Our findings show that comparisons can be drawn between methylation data from different Nanopore chemistries using guided hypotheses. This work will facilitate comparison among Nanopore data cohorts derived using different chemistries from large-scale sequencing efforts, such as the NIH CARD Long Read Initiative.
40054007	(Sr<sub>9</sub>N<sub>1.33(8)</sub>)(SrIn<sub>3</sub>)[CN<sub>3</sub>] and Sr<sub>4</sub>(Sr<sub>6</sub>N)<sub>2</sub>[In<sub>4</sub>][CN<sub>3</sub>]<sub>4</sub>: Two Fully Deprotonated Guanidinates Accessible from Pressureless Sodium Flux Synthesis.	Two novel compounds featuring the fully deprotonated guanidinate ion, CN<sub>3</sub><sup>5-</sup>, representing the true nitridocarbonate ion as the nitrogen analogue of the (oxido)carbonate ion CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, were obtained from essentially pressureless sodium flux synthesis. CN<sub>3</sub><sup>5-</sup> ions in (Sr<sub>9</sub>N<sub>1.33(8)</sub>)(SrIn<sub>3</sub>)[CN<sub>3</sub>] and Sr<sub>4</sub>(Sr<sub>6</sub>N)<sub>2</sub>[In<sub>4</sub>][CN<sub>3</sub>]<sub>4</sub> are embedded in frameworks of strontium nitride next to the indide In<sub>4</sub>- and In<sub>3</sub>-units. The CN<sub>3</sub><sup>5-</sup> ion in both compounds is coordinated by three-capped trigonal prisms of Sr. (Sr<sub>9</sub>N<sub>1.33(8)</sub>)(SrIn<sub>3</sub>)[CN<sub>3</sub>] shows fully trigonal planar <i>D</i><sub>3<i>h</i></sub> symmetry, but slightly distorted to nonplanar <i>C</i><sub>3<i>v</i></sub> symmetry is seen in Sr<sub>4</sub>(Sr<sub>6</sub>N)<sub>2</sub>[In<sub>4</sub>][CN<sub>3</sub>]<sub>4</sub> due to noncentrosymmetric coordination. C-N distances in the CN<sub>3</sub><sup>5-</sup> ion arrive at longer than typical C-O distances in the CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> ion, fully consistent with expectations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also suggest pseudomolecular features of CN<sub>3</sub>-, In<sub>4</sub>-, and In<sub>3</sub>-entities. The CN<sub>3</sub>-entity is formed via an electron-rich multicenter bonding mechanism, as evidenced by multicenter COBI, whereas multicenter COBI suggested that In<sub>4</sub>- and In<sub>3</sub>-entities are formed through an electron-deficient manner.
40053609	Effect of Spacers on the Affinity of Tyrosine-Modified Polymers to L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1.	L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), which takes up neutral amino acids such as tyrosine, is overexpressed on various cancer cells, and many researchers have developed LAT1-targeting drug delivery systems (DDSs) by modifying them with substrates of LAT1. However, none of the previous studies have examined the effects of spacers conjugated with substrates on the interaction between the DDSs and LAT1. Here, we developed polymers with tyrosine-based ligands on the side chains via propyl- or triethylene glycol spacers and compared their targetability to that of LAT1. While both polymers exhibited efficient cellular uptake in cancer cells through endocytosis in an LAT1-selective manner, the polymer with the triethylene glycol spacers exhibited higher cellular uptake efficiency than that with the propyl-spacers. Consistently, in the in vivo study with mice bearing subcutaneous tumors, the polymer with the triethylene glycol spacers showed significantly high tumor accumulation and thereby accomplished tumor-selective delivery of photosensitizers, permitting efficient antitumor activity upon photoirradiation. Our results indicate the importance of the spacer structure in designing DDSs targeting amino acid transporters.
40053317	Multifunctional Chitosan/Cellulose/Tannic Acid Biocomposite Sponge with Excellent Biocompatibility for Rapid Hemostasis.	Hemostatic materials should have efficient and rapid hemostasis, good biocompatibility, and nontoxicity. However, common hemostatic sponges often fail due to their weak mechanical strength, low biocompatibility, and slow hemostasis. Herein, we have developed novel and multifunctional chitosan/cellulose/tannic acid (CS/OMCC/TA) biocomposite sponges by a freeze-drying method without adding any chemical cross-linking agents. The water absorption rate of the biocomposite sponge is as high as 4404%, and the blood absorption rate is as high as 5460%. <i>In vitro</i> coagulation tests have shown that the coagulation ability of CS/OMCC/TA biocomposite sponges is significantly better than that of commercial hemostasis materials. DPPH radical scavenging test and antibacterial experiments demonstrated excellent antioxidant properties and inhibitory effects on <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Animal experiments showed that CS/OMCC/TA biocomposite sponges could rapidly hemostasize within 185 s and the blood loss was as low as 107 mg. These findings provide biocompatible and rapid hemostatic materials for the daily emergency trauma treatment and surgical hemostasis.
40052931	Metal pyrazolate frameworks: crystal engineering access to stable functional materials.	As the focus evolves from structure discovery/characterization (what it is) to property/performance exploration (what it is for), the pursuit of stable functional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been ongoing in terms of both fundamental research and industrial implementation. Under the guidance of crystal engineering principles, a plethora of research has developed pyrazolate MOFs (metal pyrazaolate frameworks, MPFs) featuring strong coordination M-N bonding. This attribution helps them retain their structures and functions under the alkaline conditions required for practical use. Based on poly-topic pyrazolate ligands, various classic MOFs, such as Co(bdp), Fe<sub>2</sub>(BDP)<sub>3</sub>, Ni<sub>8</sub>L<sub>6</sub>, PCN-601, and BUT-55, to name a few, have revealed fascinating architectures, intriguing properties, and record-breaking performances in applications during the past decade. This review will present the full scope of MPFs to date: (1) the superiority and significance of constructing MPFs through the crystal engineering approach, (2) synthetic strategies adopted in building and/or modifying MPFs, (3) structural features and stability of the MPF community, and (4) potential applications in energy and environmental related fields. The future opportunities of MPFs are also discussed for designing the next-generation of smart materials. Overall, this review attempts to provide insights and guidelines for the customization of pyrazolate-based MOFs for specific purposes, which would also promote the development of stable functional porous materials for addressing societal challenges.
40052897	Poly(3-hexylthiophene) nanoparticles as visible-light photoinitiators and photosensitizers in 3D printable acrylic hydrogels for photodynamic therapies.	The design of smart photoelectrodes capable of stimulating the localized production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on demand is of great interest for redox medicine therapies. In this work, poly(3-hexylthiophene) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (P3HT SPNs) are used with a dual role to fabricate light-responsive hydrogels. First, P3HT SPNs act as visible-light photoinitiators to induce the photopolymerization of acrylic monomers such as acrylamide (AAm), 2-(hydroxyethyl) acrylate (HEA), and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). This leads to the formation of acrylic hydrogels loaded with the P3HT SPNs, as demonstrated by photo-rheology and infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, P3HT SPNs are also successfully used as photoinitiators for digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing purposes to fabricate shape-defined intelligent hydrogels. Interestingly, P3HT SPNs retain their photoelectrochemical properties when embedded within the polymer hydrogels, showing photocurrent densities that range from ∼0.2 to ∼1.1 μA cm<sup>-2</sup> depending on the intensity of the visible light-lamp (<i>λ</i> = 467 nm). Second, they can be used as photosensitizers (PS) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), 12-15 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, on demand. The acrylic hydrogels containing P3HT SPNs do not exhibit cytotoxic effects under normal physiological conditions in the darkness against mouse glioma 261 (GL261) cells and <i>S. aureus</i> bacteria. However, they induce a ∼50% reduction GL261 cancer cell viability and a ∼99% <i>S. aureus</i> cell death in contact with them upon illumination (<i>λ</i> = 467 nm) due to the localized overproduction of ROS, which makes them attractive candidates for photodynamic therapies (PDT).
40052737	Supramolecular Polycations with a Linear-Star Architecture Containing Hydrophobic Poly[(<i>R</i>,<i>S</i>)-3-hydroxybutyrate]: Formation of DNA Micelleplexes Coated with Apolipoprotein E3 for Blood-Brain Barrier Penetrating Gene Delivery.	A novel blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating supramolecular gene delivery system was developed utilizing a host-guest block-building strategy to systematically screen and optimize various block compositions. Linear poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was coupled with hydrophobic poly[(<i>R</i>,<i>S</i>)-β-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) blocks of varying lengths with an adamantyl (Ad) end, giving the PEG-PHB-Ad guest polymers, which were complexed with the cationic 4-arm star-shaped β-cyclodextrin-poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (βCD-pDMAEMA) host polymer, resulting in the formation of linear-star pseudoblock PEG-PHB-Ad/βCD-pDMAEMA copolymers. These amphiphilic supramolecular copolymers were thoroughly characterized and assessed for the formation of DNA micelleplex nanoparticles as a gene delivery system. Through a rational selection process, an optimal host-guest configuration was identified, considering critical factors such as cytotoxicity, gene transfection efficiency, serum stability, cellular uptake, and hemolytic activity. The optimized host-guest copolymer was subsequently coated with the targeting protein apolipoprotein E3 (ApoE3), endowing it with BBB-penetrating capabilities, which was validated through an <i>in vitro</i> BBB transwell model.
40052735	Native Silk Fibers: Protein Sequence and Structure Influences on Thermal and Mechanical Properties.	Silk fibers produced by arthropods have inspired an array of materials with applications in healthcare, medical devices, textiles, and sustainability. Silks exhibit biodiversity with distinct variations in primary protein constituent sequences (fibroins, spidroins) and structures across taxonomic classifications, specifically the Lepidopteran and Araneae orders. Leveraging the biodiversity in arthropod silks offers advantages due to the diverse mechanical properties and thermal stabilities achievable, primarily attributed to variations in fiber crystallinity and repeating amino acid motifs. In this review, we aim to delineate known properties of silk fibers and correlate them with predicted protein sequences and secondary structures, informed by newly annotated genomes. We will discuss established patterns in repeat motifs governing specific properties and underscore the biological diversity within silk fibroin and spidroin sequences. Elucidating the relationship between protein sequences and properties of natural silk fibers will identify strategies for designing new materials through rational silk-based fiber design.
40052617	Alginate-Dialdehyde-Based Reporter Ink Enabling Online Detection of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity of Encapsulated Cells.	Biofabrication and three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting enable precise spatial arrangement of cells within biomaterial scaffolds. We developed an alginate-based and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-responsive "turn-on" reporter ink platform to enable real-time monitoring of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Three distinct MMP-cleavable turn-on peptide reporters were synthesized and characterized for their cell-specific cleavage profiles using recombinant MMPs, cell-derived media, and different cell cultures (NIH3T3, HEK293, and MelHo). All turn-on reporters were covalently and site-specifically incorporated into alginate dialdehyde (ADA) to yield an MMP reporter ink. The ADA reporter ink with an MMP 13 turn-on reporter was responsive to all tested cell types over time within the cast bulk constructs. The ADA reporter ink material blended with gelatin had comparable print resolution and structural fidelity as observed for ADA. The extrusion-based bioprinted MelHo cell grids, measuring 2 × 2 cm<sup>2</sup> and containing 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL, exhibited MMP activity responses comparable to those of the casted reporter ink system, with a 3-fold increase observed at 24 h. This study introduces a versatile, FRET-based alginate bioink platform for the real-time monitoring of MMP activities, expanding the toolkit to understand cellular performance in bioprinted 3D constructs.
40052540	Fe-Doped Carbon Dots-Incorporated In Situ Hydrogel for Near Infrared-Triggered Cascading Photothermal/Thermodynamic Therapy to Boost Cancer Immunity Cycle.	Photothermal therapy-triggered whole-tumor cell antigens release has revolutionized in situ cancer vaccine, but insufficient anticancer immunity cycle activation greatly limits its curative effect. Herein, we designed an NIR-triggered cascading in situ vaccine (FCDs-A/C@HGs) by incorporating the Fe-doped carbon dots (FCDs), azo-initiator (AIPH), and immune adjuvant (cyclophosphamide) into the thermosensitive hydrogel. Due to iron doping, the as-prepared FCDs exhibited high photothermal conversion performance and favorable MR imaging capability. Upon intratumoral injection, local hyperthermia mediated by FCDs-A/C@HGs and the subsequent generation of alkyl radicals from AIPH synergistically induced immunogenic cell death in tumor cells. Remarkably, the FCDs-A/C@HGs elicited strong anticancer immune activation by inhibiting regulatory T cells and promoting dendritic cell maturation, thereby enhancing differentiation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and memory T cells. This study presents an effective therapeutic platform for in situ tumor suppression and sustained activation of the anticancer immunity cycle.
40051399	Ultraviolet durable and recyclable radiative cooling covering for efficient building energy saving.	Passive radiative cooling (PRC) is a zero-energy thermal management technology used for efficient building energy saving. Polymer-based porous films are promising PRC materials, but their low ultraviolet (UV) durability and lack of recyclability limit their long-term and widespread application. Herein, a recyclable polymer-based porous radiative cooling film with excellent ultraviolet durability was developed as the covering of a building. Owing to the Mie scattering effect of the porous structure and strong infrared emittance of ethyl cellulose, the film demonstrated a radiative cooling capability of 10.6 °C at a solar irradiance of 510 W m<sup>-2</sup>. The calculated energy consumption results indicated that the average cooling consumption reached 429.4 kW h, and 31% of the cooling energy could be saved. Notably, owing to the conjugated benzene ring structure of styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS), the film blocked most of the incident UV radiation and diffused the absorptive energy through the delocalization effect of electron clouds. Thus, the film retained high solar reflectivity after continuous UV exposure for 240 h. Notably, the film could be cyclically utilized using a simple nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) approach. This research offers new insights into the design of UV-durable and recyclable PRC materials, providing a promising prospect for minimizing global building energy consumption and facilitating the development of sustainable buildings.
40050124	Integrating short-read and long-read single-cell RNA sequencing for comprehensive transcriptome profiling in mouse retina.	The vast majority of protein-coding genes in the human genome produce multiple mRNA isoforms through alternative splicing, significantly enhancing the complexity of the transcriptome and proteome. To establish an efficient method for characterizing transcript isoforms within tissue samples, we conducted a systematic comparison between single-cell long-read and conventional short-read RNA sequencing techniques. The transcriptome of approximately 30,000 mouse retina cells was profiled using 1.54 billion Illumina short reads and 1.40 billion Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads. Consequently, we identify 44,325 transcript isoforms, with a notable 38% previously uncharacterized and 17% expressed exclusively in distinct cellular subclasses. We observe that long-read sequencing not only matches the gene expression and cell-type annotation performance of short-read sequencing but also excel in the precise identification of transcript isoforms. While transcript isoforms are often shared across various cell types, their relative abundance shows considerable cell type-specific variation. The data generated from our study significantly enhance the existing repertoire of transcript isoforms, thereby establishing a resource for future research into the mechanisms and implications of alternative splicing within retinal biology and its links to related diseases.
40048381	Functionalized Poly(ethylene Glycol) Diacrylate Scaffolds for <i>In Situ</i> Immunomodulation of Dendritic Cells Targeting Melanoma Tumor.	Various immunotherapeutic strategies are being developed to fight cancer, which is one of the leading causes of mortality. Dendritic cells (DCs), being professional antigen-presenting cells, after efficient manipulation with tumor-associated antigens, can lead to effective T-cell recruitment and activation at the tumor site, resulting in cytotoxic T-cell-mediated cancer cell killing. To circumvent the inefficiencies of <i>ex vivo</i> DC modification and patient infusion, an alternative strategy involving <i>in situ</i> DC activation has been explored here. Here, the vaccine components are tumor lysates, as antigens, and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3) agonist, as an adjuvant. Our <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrate that complexing poly(I:C) with a carrier molecule, chitosan, enhances its stability and accessibility to TLR3 in the DC endosomal membrane. Material-based localized delivery of immunomodulatory factors is known to improve their stability and reduce their off-target side effects. Here, PEGDA-PLL-based macroporous scaffolds allow easy recruitment of host cells, thereby enabling effective interaction between the vaccine components loaded on them and the infiltrating immune cells. The vaccine components present in the scaffold facilitate efficient DC activation and migration, leading to subsequent T-cell activation and antitumor response, as shown by our <i>in vivo</i> studies.
40047239	DNA/RNA Origami Based on Different Scaffolds and Their Biomedical Applications.	Nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA, have been used extensively as building blocks to construct sophisticated nanostructures through complementary base pairing with predetermined shapes and sizes. With remarkable biocompatibility, spatial addressability, and structural programmability, self-assembled nucleic acid biomaterials have found widespread applications in various biomedical researches, including drug delivery, bioimaging, or disease diagnosis. Notably, as one of the representative nanostructures, DNA origami has drawn much attention. In this review, we summarize the latest developments in DNA/RNA origami design based on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) scaffolds for a range of biomedical applications, including drug delivery, gene regulation, immunomodulation, and receptor recognition. Additionally, the challenges and future opportunities of DNA/RNA origami in biomedical applications will be discussed.
40045810	Formulation principles and synergistic effects of high-voltage electrolytes.	The energy density of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is primarily determined by the working potential of devices and the specific capacity of cathode compounds. Carbonate-based electrolytes have received considerable attention due to their significance for advancing current cell-assembly process. However, the commercially available liquid LiPF<sub>6</sub> based electrolytes cannot withstand the harsh high-voltage environment and the effects of cathode, due to issues such as the undesired oxidative decomposition of ethylene carbonate (EC), the catalytic influence of dissolved transition metal ions (TMs), and the poor performance of interphases with unstable morphologies and components. Furthermore, the complex working mechanisms of high-voltage electrolytes (HVEs) are not fully understood. This review presents a comprehensive summary of the HVEs, including their physical properties, solvation structures, and interface chemistry. Specifically, chemical environment of high-voltage cathode compounds and failure mechanisms of commercial electrolytes are investigated, followed by a discussion of expected functions of HVEs. Then, screening criteria for single-component electrolytes, considering their oxidation resistance and decomposition mechanism, and screening mechanism of interphase species are explored based on their energy level positions. Next, a cross-scale evolution framework is proposed, from the solvation structure to interphase characteristics, aimed at uncovering the formulation principles and synergistic effects of HVEs. Operational mechanisms are systematically scrutinized, starting from the conventional tuning of solvation structure to the incorporation of multiple components and further to the role of entropy-driven effects, all of which will favor the understanding of formulation principles and synergistic effects. Finally, integration of advanced computational methods and mature experimental techniques is expected to foster the development of novel perspectives and promising electrolyte candidates.
40041949	Oxygen-Releasing Nanodroplets Relieve Intratumoral Hypoxia and Potentiate Photodynamic Therapy in 3D Head and Neck Cancer Spheroids.	Hypoxia in solid tumors, including head and neck cancer (HNC), contributes to treatment resistance, aggressive tumor phenotypes, and poorer clinical outcomes. Perfluorocarbon nanodroplets have emerged as promising drugs to alleviate tumor hypoxia. These versatile nanocarriers can also encapsulate and deliver various therapeutic agents, offering a multifunctional approach to cancer treatment. However, a detailed characterization of hypoxia alleviation, particularly the duration of hypoxia treatment drug residence, has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we developed and characterized perfluoropentane nanodroplets (PFP NDs) for the codelivery of oxygen and the photoactivatable drug benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) to hypoxic HNC spheroids. The PFP NDs exhibited excellent stability, efficient oxygen loading/release, and biocompatibility. Using 3D multicellular tumor spheroids of FaDu and SCC9 HNC cells, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of hypoxia within these spheroids and the ability of oxygenated PFP NDs to alleviate hypoxia. Our results showed that oxygen-loaded PFP NDs effectively penetrated the core of tumor spheroids, significantly reducing hypoxia, as evidenced by the downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Importantly, we demonstrated sustained hypoxia alleviation for up to 3 h post-treatment with PFP NDs. BPD-loaded PFP NDs successfully delivered the photosensitizer into the spheroid core in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of oxygen-dependent treatment modality, namely, photodynamic therapy (PDT) with BPD and oxygen-loaded PFP NDs compared to free BPD. The NDs formulation exhibited superior PDT outcomes, which were attributed to improved oxygen availability during the treatment. This study provides comprehensive evidence for the potential of PFP NDs as a codelivery platform to overcome hypoxia-mediated treatment resistance and enhance PDT efficacy in HNC. Our findings pave the way for further investigation of this promising approach in more complex <i>in vivo</i> models, potentially leading to improved therapeutic strategies for hypoxic solid tumors.
40040544	Efficient and Size-Controllable Method and Mechanism for Preparing Cellulose Nanospheres.	Cellulose nanosphere (CNS), reported as a novel cellulose material, has encountered significant challenges in achieving efficient and size-controllable preparation, which has considerably constrained its development. In this study, we have developed an innovative and size-controllable method that synthesizes CNS within only 7 min. A detailed investigation into the morphology, chemical structure, and crystalline structure of CNS was conducted, leading to the proposal of a formation mechanism for CNS. The mechanism is described as follows: cellulose dissolution, hydrophobic triethoxymethylsilane hydrolysis, condensation nucleation in supersaturation, growth through hydrogen-bonding interactions and condensation, and CNS forms in the critical supersaturation. The supersaturation level was controlled by adjusting the stirring speed, thus realizing the size-controllable preparation of CNS and verifying the proposed mechanism. The results demonstrate that the particle size of CNS increases from 63.4 ± 14.0 nm to 108.6 ± 27.1 nm as the stirring speed decreases from 1000 r/min to 300 r/min.
40040432	Revitalizing Antibiotics with Macromolecular Engineering: Tackling Gram-Negative Superbugs and Mixed Species Bacterial Biofilm Infections In Vivo.	The escalating prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, coupled with dwindling antibiotic development, has created a critical void in the clinical pipeline. This alarming issue is exacerbated by the formation of biofilms by these superbugs and their frequent coexistence in mixed-species biofilms, conferring extreme antibiotic tolerance. Herein, we present an amphiphilic cationic macromolecule, ACM-A<sub>Hex</sub>, as an innovative antibiotic adjuvant to rejuvenate and repurpose resistant antibiotics, for instance, rifampicin, fusidic acid, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. ACM-A<sub>Hex</sub> mildly perturbs the bacterial membrane, enhancing antibiotic permeability, hampers efflux machinery, and produces reactive oxygen species, resulting in a remarkable 64-1024-fold potentiation in antibacterial activity. The macromolecule reduces bacterial virulence and macromolecule-drug cocktail significantly eradicate both mono- and multispecies bacterial biofilms, achieving >99.9% bacterial reduction in the murine biofilm infection model. Demonstrating potent biocompatibility across multiple administration routes, ACM-A<sub>Hex</sub> offers a promising strategy to restore obsolete antibiotics and combat recalcitrant Gram-negative biofilm-associated infections, advocating for further clinical evaluation as a next-generation macromolecular antibiotic adjuvant.
40040245	Protein Interaction with Zwitterionic Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brushes as Observed by Small Angle X-ray Scattering.	Understanding how zwitterionic spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPB) fulfill their antifouling functions requires knowledge of their interactions with exogenous nanoparticles, such as proteins. In this study, zwitterionic SPB were synthesized by grafting 3-[(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)dimethylammonio]propanoate (CBMA) and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide (SBMA) onto a polystyrene core via photoemulsion polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering was employed to elucidate the interactions and protein adsorption behaviors of the zwitterionic SPB and proteins. SAXS results revealed that both PCBMA SPB and PSBMA SPB exhibit minimal protein adsorption compared with cationic and anionic SPB. PSBMA SPB maintained a consistent resistance to protein adsorption across various conditions. However, PCBMA SPB demonstrated tunable protein adsorption properties, enabled by the controllable ionization of carboxyl groups on the brush chains while maintaining consistently low overall adsorption. These insights enhance our understanding of zwitterionic SPB and offer an experimental and theoretical basis for their application in biomaterials and antifouling technologies.
40038266	Halogen-Atom-Substituted DOPA with Enhanced Wet Adhesion and Antioxidization Ability.	3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) has inspired the development of artificial adhesives, but efforts to enhance its adhesion strength and durability continue to evolve. However, it is tough work to improve DOPA wet adhesion by chemically decorating DOPA itself, despite the potential benefit of a concise and high-quality adhesion unit. Here, we synthesized a series of DOPA substituents by introducing different electron-withdrawing groups at the ortho position of the phenyl ring. This modification allowed us to effectively control the adhesion and antioxidation properties of DOPA. Combining atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SFMS) and cyclic voltammetry, we comprehensively investigated DOPA's antioxidation and adhesion capabilities. We found that adding a chlorine or bromine atom to the catechol ring significantly increases the DOPA wet adhesion strength. Additionally, halogen-substituted DOPA exhibited greater stability than dopamine in liquid solutions. Notably, chlorine-substituted DOPA maintained a strong adhesion ability even in salt water, offering potential benefits for bioadhesive applications.
40037844	Optimizing nanopore adaptive sampling for pneumococcal serotype surveillance in complex samples using the graph-based GNASTy algorithm.	Serotype surveillance of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (the pneumococcus) is critical for understanding the effectiveness of current vaccination strategies. However, existing methods for serotyping are limited in their ability to identify co-carriage of multiple pneumococci and detect novel serotypes. To develop a scalable and portable serotyping method that overcomes these challenges, we employed nanopore adaptive sampling (NAS), an on-sequencer enrichment method that selects for target DNA in real-time, for direct detection of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> in complex samples. Whereas NAS targeting the whole <i>S. pneumoniae</i> genome was ineffective in the presence of nonpathogenic streptococci, the method was both specific and sensitive when targeting the capsular biosynthetic locus (CBL), the operon that determines <i>S. pneumoniae</i> serotype. NAS significantly improved coverage and yield of the CBL relative to sequencing without NAS and accurately quantified the relative prevalence of serotypes in samples representing co-carriage. To maximize the sensitivity of NAS to detect novel serotypes, we developed and benchmarked a new pangenome-graph algorithm, named GNASTy. We show that GNASTy outperforms the current NAS implementation, which is based on linear genome alignment, when a sample contains a serotype absent from the database of targeted sequences. The methods developed in this work provide an improved approach for novel serotype discovery and routine <i>S. pneumoniae</i> surveillance that is fast, accurate, and feasible in low-resource settings. Although NAS facilitates whole-genome enrichment under ideal circumstances, GNASTy enables targeted enrichment to optimize serotype surveillance in complex samples.
40037842	Multisite long-read sequencing reveals the early contributions of somatic structural variations to HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis.	Somatic structural variations (SVs) represent a critical category of genomic mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the accurate identification of somatic SVs using short-read high-throughput sequencing is challenging. Here, we applied long-read nanopore sequencing and multisite sampling in a cohort of 42 samples from five patients. We found that adjacent nontumor tissue is not entirely normal, as significant somatic SV alterations were detected in these nontumor genomes. The adjacent nontumor tissue is highly similar to tumor tissue in terms of somatic SVs but differs in somatic single-nucleotide variants and copy number variations. The types of SVs in adjacent nontumor and tumor tissue are markedly different, with somatic insertions and deletions identified as early genomic events associated with HCC. Notably, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA integration frequently results in the generation of somatic SVs, particularly inducing interchromosomal translocations (TRAs). Although HBV DNA integration into the liver genome occurs randomly, multisite shared HBV-induced SVs are early driving events in the pathogenesis of HCC. Long-read RNA sequencing reveals that some HBV-induced SVs impact cancer-associated genes, with TRAs being capable of inducing the formation of fusion genes. These findings enhance our understanding of somatic SVs in HCC and their role in early tumorigenesis.
40037841	Deciphering the largest disease-associated transcript isoforms in the human neural retina with advanced long-read sequencing approaches.	Sequencing technologies have long limited the comprehensive investigation of large transcripts associated with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) like Usher syndrome, which involves 11 associated genes with transcripts up to 19.6 kb. To address this, we used PacBio long-read mRNA isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) following standard library preparation and an optimized workflow to enrich for long transcripts in the human neural retina. While our workflow achieved sequencing of transcripts up to 15 kb, this was insufficient for Usher syndrome-associated genes <i>USH2A</i> and <i>ADGRV1</i>, with transcripts of 18.9 kb and 19.6 kb, respectively. To overcome this, we employed the Samplix Xdrop System for indirect target enrichment of cDNA, a technique typically used for genomic DNA capture. This method facilitated the successful capture and sequencing of <i>ADGRV1</i> transcripts as well as full-length 18.9 kb <i>USH2A</i> transcripts. By combining algorithmic analysis with detailed manual curation of sequenced reads, we identified novel isoforms characterized by an alternative 5' transcription start site, the inclusion of previously unannotated exons, or alternative splicing events across the 11 Usher syndrome-associated genes. These findings have significant implications for genetic diagnostics and therapeutic development. The analysis applied here on Usher syndrome-associated transcripts exemplifies a valuable approach that can be extended to explore the transcriptomic complexity of other IRD-associated genes in the complete transcriptome data set generated within this study. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of the Samplix Xdrop System for capturing cDNA, and the optimized methodologies described can be expanded to facilitate the enrichment of large transcripts from various tissues of interest.
40037839	RAmbler resolves complex repeats in human Chromosomes 8, 19, and X.	Repetitive regions in eukaryotic genomes often contain important functional or regulatory elements. Despite significant algorithmic and technological advancements in genome sequencing and assembly over the past three decades, modern de novo assemblers still struggle to accurately reconstruct highly repetitive regions. In this work, we introduce RAmbler (Repeat Assembler), a reference-guided assembler specialized for the assembly of complex repetitive regions exclusively from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi reads. RAmbler (1) identifies repetitive regions by detecting unusually high coverage regions after mapping HiFi reads to the draft genome assembly, (2) finds single-copy <i>k</i>-mers from the HiFi reads, (i.e., <i>k</i>-mers that are expected to occur only once in the genome), (3) uses the relative location of single-copy <i>k</i>-mers to barcode each HiFi read, (4) clusters HiFi reads based on their shared barcodes, (5) generates contigs by assembling the reads in each cluster, and (6) generates a consensus assembly from the overlap graph of the assembled contigs. Here, we show that RAmbler can reconstruct human centromeres and other complex repeats to a quality comparable to the manually curated Telomere-to-Telomere human genome assembly. Across more than 250 synthetic data sets, RAmbler outperforms hifiasm, LJA, HiCANU, and Verkko across various parameters such as repeat lengths, number of repeats, heterozygosity rates, and depth of sequencing.
40036674	Nanocellulose/Graphene Oxide Composite Beads as a Novel Hemoperfusion Adsorbent for Efficient Removal of Bilirubin Plasma.	Conventional hemoperfusion adsorbents suffer from inefficiency and poor biocompatibility. Cellulose, a natural polysaccharide with biocompatible, biodegradable, and nontoxic properties, was combined with graphene oxide (GO) to fabricate composite beads (TGO) for blood purification. GO synthesized via a modified Hummers method was complexed with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCNs). Increasing GO content (2-20 wt %) enhanced TGO's specific surface area (256.4-289.0 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) while retaining an ∼10 nm pore size. TGO demonstrated exceptional adsorption capacities: bilirubin (418.4 mg g<sup>-1</sup>), creatinine (23.5 mg g<sup>-1</sup>), uric acid (146.6 mg g<sup>-1</sup>), and Cu<sup>2+</sup> (171.9 mg g<sup>-1</sup>). The beads exhibited excellent hemocompatibility (hemolysis rate <5%) and prolonged recalcification time (585 ± 5.2 s). Notably, TGO restored blood bilirubin levels to normal within 30 min, highlighting its potential for blood purification.
40036493	3D-Printed Silk Fibroin Mesh with Guidance of Directional Cell Growth for Treating Pelvic Organ Prolapse.	Damages to the supportive structure of the pelvic floor frequently result in pelvic organ prolapse (POP), which diminishes the quality of life. Surgical repair typically involves mesh implantation to reinforce the weakened tissues. However, the commonly used polypropylene (PP) mesh can lead to severe complications due to the mechanical mismatch of the mesh with the pelvic tissues. In this study, 3D-printed silk fibroin (SF) meshes are developed and optimized through cryogenic 3D printing followed by post-stretching treatment to enhance mechanical properties and biocompatibility for POP repair. Rheological analysis shows that the 30 wt % SF-based ink exhibited a zero shear viscosity of 1838 Pa·s and shear-thinning behavior, ensuring smooth extrusion during 3D printing. During the cryogenic incubation following 3D printing, self-assembly of SF occurs with the formation of β-sheet structures, leading to robust constructs with good shape fidelity. The post-stretching treatment further improves SF chain alignment and fibrilization, resulting in enhanced mechanical performance and a microstrip surface that promotes cell attachment, alignment, and differentiation. The SF mesh with a post-stretching ratio of 150% shows an ultimate tensile strength of 1.49 ± 0.14 MPa, an elongation at break of 104 ± 13%, and a Young's modulus of 5.0 ± 0.1 MPa at a hydrated condition, matching the properties of soft pelvic tissues. In vitro studies show that post-stretched SF meshes facilitated better cell alignment and myogenic differentiation than PP meshes. In vivo assessments demonstrate enhanced biocompatibility of the SF meshes, with better cellular infiltration and tissue integration than PP meshes in the long-term implantation, showing potential as a safe, effective alternative to traditional synthetic meshes for POP repair and other clinical applications.
40033796	Construction of a Mirror-Image RNA Nanostructure for Enhanced Biostability and Drug Delivery Efficiency.	The development of stable and efficient drug delivery systems is essential for advancing therapeutic applications. Here, we present an innovative approach using a mirror-image RNA (l-RNA) nanostructure to enhance the biostability and drug delivery efficiency. We engineered an l-RNA three-way junction structure conjugated with both small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MCL1 and the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin for targeted and synergistic drug delivery. This codelivery strategy leverages the combined effects of doxorubicin and MCL1 siRNA, achieving improved therapeutic outcomes. The l-RNA nanostructure demonstrates superior stability compared with natural d-RNA, resulting in reduced toxicity in healthy cells while maintaining therapeutic efficacy in cancer cells. This indicates that l-RNA nanostructures may offer enhanced biosafety when applied as therapeutic agents. The addition of folic acid (FA) to the nanostructure surface substantially increases both delivery specificity and endosomal escape efficiency, optimizing targeted delivery. Structural modeling also suggests a distinctive binding conformation of doxorubicin with l-DNA, setting it apart from native DNA interactions. This study highlights the potential of mirror-image nucleic acid nanostructures as robust and precise platforms for combinatorial drug delivery in cancer treatment.
40032587	Quality assessment of long read data in multisample lrRNA-seq experiments using SQANTI-reads.	SQANTI-reads leverages SQANTI3, a tool for the analysis of the quality of transcript models, to develop a read-level quality control framework for replicated long-read RNA-seq experiments. The number and distribution of reads, as well as the number and distribution of unique junction chains (transcript splicing patterns), in SQANTI3 structural categories are informative of raw data quality. Multisample visualizations of QC metrics are presented by experimental design factors to identify outliers. We introduce new metrics for (1) the identification of potentially under-annotated genes and putative novel transcripts and for (2) quantifying variation in junction donors and acceptors. We applied SQANTI-reads to two different data sets, a <i>Drosophila</i> developmental experiment and a multiplatform data set from the LRGASP project and demonstrate that the tool effectively reveals the impact of read coverage on data quality, and readily identifies strong and weak splicing sites.
40032585	Notable challenges posed by long-read sequencing for the study of transcriptional diversity and genome annotation.	Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies have revolutionized transcriptomic research by enabling the comprehensive sequencing of full-length transcripts. Using these technologies, researchers have reported tens of thousands of novel transcripts, even in well-annotated genomes, while developing new algorithms and experimental approaches to handle the noisy data. The Long-read RNA-seq Genome Annotation Assessment Project community effort benchmarked LRS methods in transcriptomics and validated many novel, lowly expressed, often times sample-specific transcripts identified by long reads. These molecules represent deviations of the major transcriptional program that were overlooked by short-read sequencing methods but are now captured by the full-length, single-molecule approach. This Perspective discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with LRS' capacity to unravel this fraction of the transcriptome, in terms of both transcriptome biology and genome annotation. For transcriptome biology, we need to develop novel experimental and computational methods to effectively differentiate technology errors from rare but real molecules. For genome annotation, we must agree on the strategy to capture molecular variability while still defining reference annotations that are useful for the genomics community.
40029811	Modeling of the Gelation Process in Cellulose Aerogels.	Cellulose aerogels are the most well-studied biopolymer-based systems in the literature, yet we lack a complete understanding of the underlying gelation mechanism, as well as that of the effect of solvent exchange on the topology of their network. This work presents a coarse-grained model describing the gelation kinetics in cellulose aerogel systems. A discrete element model is employed to generate the cellulose structure, and the solvents are modeled implicitly. Langevin dynamics is applied to solve the system of Newtonian equations. The model successfully generates the structure of the cellulose gel, hydrogel, alcogel, as well as aerogel. A model parameter sensitivity analysis is presented, and the results of the model are validated against the experimental data. The model provides insights into the mechanism of gelation while also shedding light on the morphological alterations resulting from the washing, solvent exchange, and drying steps.
40029610	EDA Fibronectin Microarchitecture and YAP Translocation during Wound Closure.	Fibronectin (Fn) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein with mechanosensitive structure-function. Extra domain A (EDA) Fn, a Fn isoform, is not present in adult tissue but is required for tissue repair. Curiously, EDA Fn is linked to both regenerative and fibrotic tissue repair. Given that Fn mechanoregulates cell behavior, EDA Fn organization during wound closure might play a role in mediating these differing responses. One mechanism by which cells sense and respond to their microenvironment is by activating a transcriptional coactivator, yes-associated protein (YAP). Interestingly, YAP activity is not only required for wound closure but similarly linked to both regenerative and fibrotic repair. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate how, during normal and fibrotic wound closure, EDA Fn organization might modulate YAP translocation by culturing human dermal fibroblasts on polydimethylsiloxane substrates mimicking normal (soft: 18 kPa) and fibrotic (stiff: 146 kPa) wounded skin. On stiffer substrates mimicking fibrotic wounds, fibroblasts assembled an aligned EDA Fn matrix comprising thinner fibers, suggesting increased microenvironmental tension. To evaluate if cell binding to the EDA domain of Fn was essential to overall matrix organization, fibroblasts were treated with Irigenin, which inhibits binding to the EDA domain within Fn. Blocking adhesion to EDA led to randomly organized EDA Fn matrices with thicker fibers, suggesting reduced microenvironmental tension even during fibrotic wound closure. To evaluate whether YAP signaling plays a role in EDA Fn organization, fibroblasts were treated with CA3, which suppresses YAP activity in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with CA3 also led to randomly organized EDA Fn matrices with thicker fibers, suggesting a potential connected mechanism of reducing tension during fibrotic wound closure. Next, YAP activity was assessed to evaluate the impact of EDA Fn organization. Interestingly, fibroblasts migrating on softer substrates mimicking normal wounds increased YAP activity, but on stiffer substrates, they decreased YAP activity. When fibroblasts on stiffer substrates were treated with Irigenin or CA3, fibroblasts increased YAP activity. These results suggest that there may be disrupted signaling between EDA Fn organization and YAP translocation during fibrotic wound closure that could be restored when reestablishing normal EDA Fn matrix organization to instead drive regenerative wound repair.
40029252	Novel Biomimetic Collagen-Based Corneal Repair Material Achieved via a "Killing Two Birds with One Stone" Strategy Using Carboxymethyl-β-Cyclodextrin.	Collagen, as the principal structural component of the cornea, has emerged as a promising biomaterial for artificial corneal owing to its excellent biocompatibility and degradability. However, the mechanical properties of current collagen membrane cannot match the requirements of artificial corneal materials. Inspired by the hierarchical lamellar organization of native corneal stromal collagen, a biomimetic collagen-based corneal repair material was designed via a "killing two birds with one stone" strategy. In this strategy, carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin (CM-β-CD) was incorporated into the collagen, serving dual functions: regulating the <i>in vitro</i> self-assembly process of collagen molecules and establishing multiple covalent cross-linking sites within the network. Concurrently, controlled external shear forces were applied to induce anisotropic alignment of collagen fibers, effectively replicating the highly organized structural hierarchy characteristic of native corneal stromal tissue. The resulting membrane exhibited a 67% enhancement in tensile strength (0.52 MPa) compared to pure collagen membranes. Notably, <i>in vivo</i> lamellar keratoplasty evaluations revealed accelerated tissue regeneration, achieving complete re-epithelialization within 14 days versus 28 days for controls. These findings establish the material's potential as an advanced artificial corneal for tissue engineering applications.
40025953	Impact of Noncanonical Disulfide Bond on Thermal Resistance and Binding Affinity of Shark-Derived Single-Domain Antibodies.	Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) often exhibit superior thermal stability compared to traditional antibodies. Efforts are currently focused on enhancing their structural robustness and thermal refolding ability through protein engineering to achieve greater thermal properties and functionality in practical applications. Thermal aggregation is a key factor hindering the reversible thermal denaturation of sdAbs. While studies have explored the role of noncanonical disulfide bonds in camelid-derived VHH aggregation, research on thermal aggregation in shark-derived sdAbs (also known as VNARs) remains scarce, limiting their potential for further optimization. In this study, the role of noncanonical disulfide bonds in VNAR structural robustness, aggregation, and affinity has been simultaneously investigated. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), circular dichroism, and intrinsic fluorescence were carried out to compare thermal antigen-binding stability, refolding abilities, and melting temperatures of four wild VNARs B7, 1N9, 2E6, and 2E11 specific for different antigens. Meanwhile, nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) was applied, for the first time, to monitor the thermal aggregation of VNARs. Notably, 2E11, which lacked the noncanonical disulfide bond, demonstrated impressive performance in many aspects. When alanine mutation was engineered to remove the CDR1-CDR3 disulfide bond in 2E6, its refolding rate was increased, and thermal aggregation was prevented significantly. Furthermore, 2E6 exhibited enhanced thermal antigen-binding stability despite reduced structural robustness and affinity. This study provides deeper insights and theoretical support for improving VNAR biophysical properties, with potential applications in enhancing immunoassay performance.
40023791	Upcycling of Livestock Industry Blood Waste into Bioplastics: Plasma Protein-Based Amyloid Fibrils.	This study presents a novel approach to harnessing the underutilized resource of livestock blood plasma proteins to produce bioplastic films based on amyloid fibrils. Upon acidic heating, a 20-h incubation period resulted in mature, semiflexible fibrils with an average length of 0.65 μm and a persistence length of 261 nm. Characterization using Thioflavin T intensity, circular dichroism, and FTIR spectroscopy revealed a cross-β-sheet structure stabilized by hydrogen bonding. The integration of plasma protein amyloid fibrils with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) or methyl cellulose (MC) yielded bioplastic films that exhibit smooth and homogeneous micromorphology, enhanced toughness, and water stability, with PVA-based films demonstrating an exceptional elongation of ∼300%, suitable for food packaging applications. Compared to petroleum-based plastics, plasma amyloid fibril-incorporated films demonstrated a superior sustainability footprint (∼92%). This work underscores the potential of plasma protein amyloid fibrils in bioplastic applications, aligning with the global imperative for eco-friendly waste management and a circular economy.
40021478	Foreign Mucins Alter the Properties of Reconstituted Gastric Mucus.	During the course of evolution, distinct mucin subtypes have evolved, that predominantly occur in specific mucus variants of the body. A loss of this clear regional assignment is often associated with pathophysiological conditions such as asthma or gastric cancer. We here reconstitute mucus from different mucin subtypes to elucidate the influence of MUC5B/MUC2 contaminations on physiologically relevant properties of acidic MUC5AC gels as found in the stomach. Our findings indicate that these properties may be critically altered by the presence of an atypical mucin species. A weak integration of a contaminating mucin subtype into the host network yields weak viscoelastic gels with increased barrier capabilities. Unravelling the complex properties of mucosal barriers under disease conditions is crucial for the understanding of mucosal disease progression and for developing drug-carriers to traverse this biological barrier. Here, our results provide useful insights into mechanistic principles governing the physical properties of gastro-intestinal mucus.
40020198	Synergistic Effects of Polycationic and Polyfluorinated Functionalities for Efficient Intracellular Protein Delivery.	Intracellular protein therapy is a promising strategy in biologics, including vaccine development, gene editing, and cancer therapeutics. However, protein-based drug delivery remains a significant challenge, particularly in penetrating cell barriers to reach intracellular targets. Inspired by transport adjuvants, we designed a series of polymeric vectors to achieve efficient functional protein trafficking with low cytotoxicity. With an adequate combination of guanidinium and fluorocarbon functionalities, a synergistic improvement of intracellular delivery is achieved in terms of both high intracellular transport and low cellular toxicity. The observed synergistic outcomes highlight new opportunities for delivery vehicle optimizations of intracellular biologics.
40015980	A prospective trial comparing programmable targeted long-read sequencing and short-read genome sequencing for genetic diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia.	The cerebellar ataxias (CAs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by progressive incoordination. Seventeen repeat expansion (RE) loci have been identified as the primary genetic cause and account for >80% of genetic diagnoses. Despite this, diagnostic testing is limited and inefficient, often utilizing single gene assays. This study evaluates the effectiveness of long- and short-read sequencing as diagnostic tools for CA. We recruited 110 individuals (48 females, 62 males) with a clinical diagnosis of CA. Short-read genome sequencing (SR-GS) was performed to identify pathogenic RE and also non-RE variants in 356 genes associated with CA. Independently, long-read sequencing with adaptive sampling (LR-AS) was performed to identify pathogenic RE. SR-GS provided a genetic diagnosis for 38% of the cohort (40/110) including seven non-RE pathogenic variants. RE causes disease in 33 individuals, with the most common condition being SCA27B (<i>n</i> = 24). In comparison, LR-AS identified pathogenic RE in 29 individuals. RE identification for the two methods was concordant apart from four SCA27B cases not detected by LR-AS due to low read depth. For both technologies manual review of the RE alignment enhances diagnostic outcomes. Orthogonal testing for SCA27B revealed a 15% and 0% false positive rate for SR-GS and LR-AS, respectively. In conclusion, both technologies are powerful screening tools for CA. SR-GS is a mature technology currently used by diagnostic providers, requiring only minor changes in bioinformatic workflows to enable CA diagnostics. LR-AS offers considerable advantages in the context of RE detection and characterization but requires optimization before clinical implementation.
40010404	[Prevention of childhood obesity: participatory development of municipal strategies to increase community readiness].	Community readiness (CR) describes the degree to which a municipality is prepared to actively address a health problem. It is a central condition for successful and sustainable prevention efforts. The CR for childhood obesity prevention is low in German municipalities, which makes it difficult to implement effective measures.The aim of this study was to develop strategies to increase CR for the prevention of childhood obesity in municipalities. In Bavarian municipalities, workshops (n=5) were conducted with municipal stakeholders after an initial CR assessment. Their specific results were analysed and based on this, strategies were developed in a participatory manner.The municipal strategies focused on three areas: (1) optimising resources for prevention efforts, (2) supporting knowledge about childhood obesity and prevention and (3) strengthening prioritisation of childhood obesity.The strategies offer practical approaches to promote CR and provide a basis for further development and implementation of effective prevention efforts. An evaluation of effectiveness can be made through follow-up measurements after implementation of the strategies.

39983011	Validation of a Digital Pathology-Based Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Biomarker in a Prospective, Real-World Prostate Cancer Cohort Treated with Prostatectomy.	A multimodal artificial intelligence (MMAI) biomarker was developed using clinical trial data from North American men with localized prostate cancer treated with definitive radiation, using biopsy digital pathology images and key clinical information (age, PSA, and T-stage) to generate prognostic scores. This study externally validates the biomarker in a prospective, real-world dataset of men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer at a tertiary referral center in Sweden.
39981712	Advancing super-resolution microscopy with metal complexes: functional imaging agents for nanoscale visualization.	Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) has transformed biological imaging by overcoming the diffraction limit, offering nanoscale visualization of cellular structures and processes. However, the widespread use of organic fluorescent probes is often hindered by limitations such as photobleaching, short photostability, and inadequate performance in deep-tissue imaging. Metal complexes, with their superior photophysical properties, including exceptional photostability, tuneable luminescence, and extended excited-state lifetimes, address these challenges, enabling precise subcellular targeting and long-term imaging. Beyond imaging, their theranostic potential unlocks real-time diagnostics and treatments for diseases such as cancer and bacterial infections. This review explores recent advancements in applying metal complexes for SRM, focusing on their utility in visualizing intricate subcellular structures, capturing temporal dynamics in live cells and elucidating <i>in vivo</i> spatial organization. We emphasize how rational design strategies optimize biocompatibility, organelle specificity, and deep-tissue penetration, expanding their applicability in multiplexed imaging. Furthermore, we discuss the design of various metal nanoparticles (NPs) for SRM, along with emerging hybrid nanoscale probes that integrate metal complexes with gold (Au) scaffolds, offering promising avenues for overcoming current limitations. By highlighting both established successes and potential frontiers, this review provides a roadmap for leveraging metal complexes as versatile tools in advancing SRM applications.
39970159	Incorporation of Adeno-Associated Virus Encoding Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor into a Biodegradable Elastomeric Scaffold for Improved Function in the Ischemic Rat Heart.	Ischemic heart disease morbidity and mortality ensue as the ventricle remodels, and cardiac function is lost following myocardial infarction. Previous studies have shown that applying a biodegradable, elastic epicardial patch onto the ischemic cardiac wall preserves the cardiac function and alters the remodeling process. In this report, the capacity to deliver a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was evaluated to determine if it would provide benefit beyond a patch alone. Coaxial electrospinning of a poly(ether ester urethane) urea generated microfibrous patches with fibers loaded in their core with VEGF-AAV in poly(ethylene oxide) or vehicle alone. In a rat infarction model, epicardial patches were placed 3 days post-infarction. Over an 8 week period following the intervention, end-diastolic area was lower and ejection fraction greater in the patch-VEGF group compared with the control patch and sham surgery groups. There was also a greater number of α-SMA-positive cells, blood vessels, and positive immunostaining for VEGF in the patch-VEGF group compared with groups having patches lacking VEGF. The approach of combining mechanical (patch) and biofunctional (controlled release angiogenic therapy) support through a scaffold-based gene vector transfer approach may be an effective option for dealing with the adverse ventricular wall remodeling that leads to end-stage cardiomyopathy.
39965935	Long-read single-cell RNA sequencing enables the study of cancer subclone-specific genotypes and phenotypes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors are effective for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) due to BTK's role in B cell survival and proliferation. Treatment resistance is most commonly caused by the emergence of the hallmark <i>BTK</i> <sup>C481S</sup> mutation that inhibits drug binding. In this study, we aimed to investigate cancer subclones harboring a <i>BTK</i> <sup>C481S</sup> mutation and identify cells with co-occurring CLL driver mutations. In addition, we sought to determine whether <i>BTK</i>-mutated subclones exhibit distinct transcriptomic behavior when compared to other cancer subclones. To achieve these goals, we use scBayes, which integrates bulk DNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to genotype individual cells for subclone-defining mutations. Although the most common approach for scRNA-seq includes short-read sequencing, transcript coverage is limited due to the vast majority of the reads being concentrated at the priming end of the transcript. Here, we utilized MAS-seq, a long-read scRNA-seq technology, to substantially increase transcript coverage and expand the set of informative mutations to link cells to cancer subclones in six CLL patients who acquired <i>BTK</i> <sup>C481S</sup> mutations during BTK inhibitor treatment. In two patients who developed two independent <i>BTK</i>-mutated subclones, we find that most <i>BTK</i>-mutated cells have an additional CLL driver gene mutation. When examining subclone-specific gene expression, we find that in one patient, <i>BTK</i>-mutated subclones are transcriptionally distinct from the rest of the malignant B cell population with an overexpression of CLL-relevant genes.

39960342	Exploring the potential of metal-organic framework based composites as key players in bisphenol detection.	The extensive usage of bisphenols in the production of plastics and other materials has raised concerns about their potential adverse effects on human and marine ecosystems. This comprehensive review paper aims to provide insights into the various types of bisphenols and their derivatives, as well as the multiple pathways through which human and marine life can be exposed to these compounds. Additionally, it highlights the growing importance of developing effective detection methods for bisphenols and their derivatives due to their potential health and environmental implications. The focus then shifts towards metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as promising materials for the detection of bisphenols.

This paper also addresses the significance of pristine MOFs and explores the potential of MOF-based composites for achieving enhanced detection performance. Subsequently, various detection techniques utilizing MOFs and their composites are reviewed. In the final sections, the recent strategic developments and challenges in this field, offering a concise summary of the principal findings of this review, novel approaches, limitations of current methodologies, and emerging trends for future directions, are discussed. This comprehensive exploration of the subject matter not only illuminates the current state of research on the detection of bisphenols but also provides valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges in this evolving field. In conclusion, this review underscores the critical importance of advancing the detection of bisphenols and their derivatives, with MOFs and their composites emerging as promising candidates for more efficient and sensitive detection. The potential for their applications in diverse fields, coupled with ongoing research efforts, suggests a bright future for MOF-based bisphenol detection technologies.
39957421	Pyramid-shaped quantum dot superlattice exhibiting tunable room-temperature coherent emission <i>via</i> oriented attachment.	Coherent emission, characterized by the collective photon emission from a dense ensemble of emitters, holds great promise for quantum optics and nanophotonics applications. However, achieving robust coherent emission, particularly superfluorescence, at room temperature remains challenging due to thermal decoherence. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature tunable coherent emission from perovskite quantum dot (QD) superlattices. Our approach involves the mesocrystallization of CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>-based QD superlattices driven by oriented attachment, which yields pyramidal-like solids with extended atomic coherency. This level of atomic-scale to nanoscale orientational structure control cannot be realized in previous QD superlattices, and it allows for quantum coherence to persist at ambient conditions. The resulting superlattices exhibit multiple narrowband emissions with exceptional spectral sharpness and tunability, reflecting the collective nature of the coherent emission. Our results establish superlattices as an emerging materials platform capable of robust quantum coherence without cryogenic constraints, opening up new possibilities for quantum optics and nanophotonics applications.
39952678	Genetic regulation of nascent RNA maturation revealed by direct RNA nanopore sequencing.	Quantitative trait loci analyses have revealed an important role for genetic variants in regulating alternative splicing (AS) and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) in humans. Yet, these studies are generally performed with mature mRNA, so they report on the outcome rather than the processes of RNA maturation and thus may overlook how variants directly modulate pre-mRNA processing. The order in which the many introns of a human gene are removed can substantially influence AS, while nascent RNA polyadenylation can affect RNA stability and decay. However, how splicing order and poly(A) tail length are regulated by genetic variation has never been explored. Here, we used direct RNA nanopore sequencing to investigate allele-specific pre-mRNA maturation in 12 human lymphoblastoid cell lines. We find frequent splicing order differences between alleles and uncover significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-splicing order associations in 17 genes. This includes SNPs located in or near splice sites as well as more distal intronic and exonic SNPs. Moreover, several genes showed allele-specific poly(A) tail lengths, many of which also have a skewed allelic abundance ratio. <i>HLA</i> class I transcripts, which encode proteins that play an essential role in antigen presentation, show the most allele-specific splicing orders, which frequently co-occur with allele-specific AS, APA, or poly(A) tail length differences. Together, our results expose new layers of genetic regulation of pre-mRNA maturation and highlight the power of long-read RNA sequencing for allele-specific analyses.
39937271	AZD8701, an Antisense Oligonucleotide Targeting FOXP3 mRNA, as Monotherapy and in Combination with Durvalumab: A Phase I Trial in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.	AZD8701 uses next-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology to selectively reduce human forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) expression in regulatory T cells, reversing their immunosuppressive function. FOXP3 ASO alone or with PD-(L)1 inhibition attenuated tumor growth in mice. We report a phase I study of AZD8701 alone or combined with durvalumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
39937237	Update on Cancer and Central Nervous System Tumor Surveillance in Pediatric NF2-, SMARCB1-, and LZTR1-Related Schwannomatosis.	Schwannomatosis (SWN) is a distinct cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline pathogenic variants in the genes NF2, SMARCB1, or LZTR1. There is a significant clinical overlap between these syndromes with the hallmark of increased risk for cranial, spinal, and peripheral schwannomas. Neurofibromatosis type 2 was recently renamed as NF2-related SWN and is the most common SWN syndrome, with increased risk for bilateral vestibular schwannomas, intradermal schwannomas, meningiomas, and less commonly, ependymoma. SMARCB1-related SWN is a familial SWN syndrome associated with peripheral and spinal schwannomas and an increased risk for meningiomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, even in the absence of radiation. These individuals do not develop bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Finally, patients with LZTR1-related SWN typically present with peripheral schwannomas, and unilateral vestibular schwannomas have been reported. The following perspective is intended to highlight the clinical presentation and international tumor surveillance recommendations across these SWN syndromes.
39932719	Can Longitudinal Biomarkers Guide Treatment Decisions? Time Will Tell.	Defining patterns of acquired resistance has important prognostic and therapeutic implications in patients with lung cancer. Longitudinal biomarker analysis has enhanced our understanding of tumor biology and treatment response. However, the role of temporally informed biomarkers in guiding clinical decisions, such as local therapy intervention, remains unproven. See related article by Mazzaschi et al., p. 1533.
39930327	Early Detection of Type 1 Diabetes in First-Degree Relatives in Saudi Arabia (VISION-T1D): Protocol for a Pilot Implementation Study.	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a growing global health concern, with a notable rise in incidence in Saudi Arabia. Despite the potential benefits of early detection through screening programs, such initiatives are currently lacking in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.
39927885	Results of the Phase I/II Study and Preliminary B-cell Gene Signature of Combined Inhibition of Glutamine Metabolism and EGFR in Colorectal Cancer.	EGFR-targeting mAbs are essential for managing rat sarcoma virus wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but their limited efficacy necessitates exploring immunologic and metabolic factors influencing response. This study evaluated glutamine metabolism targeting with EGFR inhibition to identify response biomarkers in patients with prior anti-EGFR treatment progression.
39924212	Suppression of porcine polyspermy using mechanical vibrations during in vitro fertilization.	The efficiency of porcine in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryo production remains low. Polyspermy is considered a contributing factor to this result. In this study, we investigated the effects of mechanical vibrations during the co-culture of oocytes and spermatozoa on fertilization parameters and subsequent embryonic development. The rate of polyspermy decreased significantly in all vibration culture groups compared with the stationary culture (control) group (P < 0.05). Regarding subsequent embryonic development, the blastocyst formation rate was significantly improved in the middle-vibration culture group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). However, the high-vibration culture group had the lowest sperm penetration rate and did not show any improvement in monospermy rate and normal fertilization efficiency. In addition, their in vitro developmental status was the lowest. These results indicate that moderate mechanical vibrations during insemination effectively suppress polyspermy and improve porcine IVF embryo production efficiency.
39909396	Use of artificial intelligence in submucosal vessel detection during third-space endoscopy.	While artificial intelligence (AI) shows high potential in decision support for diagnostic gastrointestinal endoscopy, its role in therapeutic endoscopy remains unclear. Third-space endoscopic procedures pose the risk of intraprocedural bleeding. Therefore, we aimed to develop an AI algorithm for intraprocedural blood vessel detection.Using a test dataset of 101 standardized video clips containing 200 predefined submucosal blood vessels, 19 endoscopists were evaluated for vessel detection rate (VDR) and time (VDT) with and without support of an AI algorithm. Endoscopists were grouped according to experience in endoscopic submucosal dissection.With AI support, endoscopist VDR increased from 56.4% (95%CI CI 54.1-58.6) to 72.4% (95%CI CI 70.3-74.4). Endoscopist VDT dropped from 6.7 seconds (95%CI 6.2-7.1) to 5.2 seconds (95%CI 4.8-5.7). False-positive readings appeared in 4.5% of frames and were marked for a significantly shorter time than true positives (0.7 seconds [95%CI 0.55-0.87] vs. 6.0 seconds [95%CI 5.28-6.70]).AI improved the VDR and VDT of endoscopists during third-space endoscopy. While these data need to be corroborated by clinical trials, AI may prove to be an invaluable tool for improving safety and speed of endoscopic interventions.
39908010	A Phase II Study of Abemaciclib for Patients with Retinoblastoma-Positive, Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.	Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors can significantly extend survival when given in combination with endocrine therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. However, their activity has been relatively underexplored in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).
39903492	The Mode of Action and Clinical Outcomes of Sacituzumab Govitecan in Solid Tumors.	Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a trophoblast cell-surface antigen-2 (Trop-2)-directed antibody-drug conjugate, is currently approved to treat metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and HR+/HER2- breast cancer and is under clinical investigation for a range of other tumor types. This review describes its mode of action, development, and clinical outcomes. SG is composed of SN-38 (a topoisomerase I inhibitor derived from irinotecan) covalently linked to an anti-Trop-2 mAb (sacituzumab; hRS7) via a hydrolyzable CL2A linker. SN-38 was chosen due to its potent antitumor activity; CL2A occupies the most effective position on SN-38 for maintaining stability during transport, with pH-sensitive payload release in the tumor, and the antigen target (Trop-2) is highly expressed on many solid tumors. SG has an ∼8:1 drug-to-antibody ratio and delivers therapeutic SN-38 concentration to Trop-2+-expressing tumor cells via rapid internalization and efficient payload release. Free SN-38 can subsequently enter the tumor microenvironment and kill adjacent tumor cells with or without Trop-2 expression (bystander effect). SN-38 induces DNA breakage and inhibits nucleic acid synthesis via a drug-induced topoisomerase 1:DNA complex that interferes with cell proliferation, causing apoptosis. Dose-finding studies support SG 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle as the monotherapy dose for clinical use; this was determined by therapeutic index improvement based on efficacy and safety. Payload-linker dynamics and SG potency ensure continued tissue penetration. Neutropenia and diarrhea are the most common grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events with SG, but they are manageable. The efficacy of SG has been demonstrated across a broad spectrum of solid tumors.
39900460	The additional diagnostic yield of long-read sequencing in undiagnosed rare diseases.	Long-read sequencing (LRS) is a promising technology positioned to study the significant proportion of rare diseases (RDs) that remain undiagnosed as it addresses many of the limitations of short-read sequencing, detecting and clarifying additional disease-associated variants that may be missed by the current standard diagnostic workflow for RDs. Some key areas where additional diagnostic yields may be realized include: (1) detection and resolution of structural variants (SVs); (2) detection and characterization of tandem repeat expansions; (3) coverage of regions of high sequence similarity; (4) variant phasing; (5) the use of de novo genome assemblies for reference-based or graph genome variant detection; and (6) epigenetic and transcriptomic evaluations. Examples from over 50 studies support that the main areas of added diagnostic yield currently lie in SV detection and characterization, repeat expansion assessment, and phasing (with or without DNA methylation information). Several emerging studies applying LRS in cohorts of undiagnosed RDs also demonstrate that LRS can boost diagnostic yields following negative standard-of-care clinical testing and provide an added yield of 7%-17% following negative short-read genome sequencing. With this evidence of improved diagnostic yield, we discuss the incorporation of LRS into the diagnostic care pathway for undiagnosed RDs, including current challenges and considerations, with the ultimate goal of ending the diagnostic odyssey for countless individuals with RDs.
39898596	Generalizable Metamaterials Design Techniques Inspire Efficient Mycelial Materials Inverse Design.	Fungal mycelial materials can mimic numerous nonrenewable materials; they are even capable of outperforming certain materials at their own applications. Fungi's versatility makes mock leather, bricks, wood, foam, meats, and many other products possible. That said, there is currently a critical need to develop efficient mycelial materials design techniques. In mycelial materials, and the wider field of biomaterials, design is primarily limited to costly <i>forward</i> techniques. New mycelial materials could be developed faster and cheaper with robust <i>inverse</i> design techniques, which are not currently used within the field. However, computational inverse design techniques will not be tractable unless clear and concrete design parameters are defined for fungi, derived from genotype and bulk phenotype characteristics. Through mycelial materials case studies and a comprehensive review of metamaterials design techniques, we identify three critical needs that must be addressed to implement computational inverse design in mycelial materials. These critical needs are the following: 1) heuristic search/optimization algorithms, 2) efficient mathematical modeling, and 3) dimensionality reduction techniques. Metamaterials researchers already use many of these computational techniques that can be adapted for mycelial materials inverse design. Then, we suggest mycelium-specific parameters as well as how to measure and use them. Ultimately, based on a review of metamaterials research and the current state of mycelial materials design, we synthesize a generalizable inverse design paradigm that can be applied to mycelial materials or related design fields.
39894567	Factors influencing in vivo embryo production in Japanese Black donors: The role of anti-Müllerian hormone and inflammation parameters.	In Japanese Black (JB) cattle, the number of transferable embryos produced after superovulation is crucial for the economic success of embryo production for both farmers and veterinarians. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) has emerged as a key reproductive marker for predicting the number of embryos produced in vivo and oocytes retrieved through transvaginal pickup. This study investigated the relationship between AMH, inflammatory markers, including serum amyloid A (SAA) and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio, and the number of embryos recovered and transferable after superovulation in JB cows. A total of 96 JB donor cows underwent artificial insemination after superovulation, and embryo recovery was performed 7 days later. Embryos recovered were classified based on the International Embryo Technology Society criteria, wherein "transferable embryos" included those with codes 1 or 2, while "total embryos" included transferable embryos as well as those with codes 3 and 4. Blood samples collected during embryo recovery were used to measure serum AMH, SAA, and A/G ratios. When grouped by AMH quartiles, the high-AMH and middle-high-AMH groups produced significantly more total embryos compared to the low-AMH group. The total number of embryos increased with higher AMH levels (r = 0.3336, P = 0.0009). Correlation analysis revealed associations between AMH, α<sub>1</sub>-globulin and SAA. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was observed between total and transferable embryos (r = 0.6339, P < 0.0001) and between AMH and the yield ratio (r = 0.25583, P = 0.0119). These findings confirm that AMH concentration is a valuable reproductive marker for predicting the total and transferable embryos produced by JB donor cows.
39884748	Enhancing nanopore adaptive sampling for PromethION using readfish at scale.	A unique feature of Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencers, adaptive sampling, allows precise DNA molecule selection from sequencing libraries. Here, we present enhancements to our tool, readfish, enabling all features for the industrial scale PromethION sequencer, including standard and "barcode-aware" adaptive sampling. We demonstrate effective coverage enrichment and assessment of multiple human genomes for copy number and structural variation on a single PromethION flow cell.
39880590	Rapid and accurate demultiplexing of direct RNA nanopore sequencing data with SeqTagger.	Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) enables direct measurement of RNA molecules, including their native RNA modifications, without prior conversion to cDNA. However, commercial methods for molecular barcoding of multiple DRS samples are lacking, and community-driven efforts, such as DeePlexiCon, are not compatible with newer RNA chemistry flowcells and the latest generation of graphics processing units (GPUs). To overcome these limitations, we introduce SeqTagger, a rapid and robust method that can demultiplex DRS data sets with 99% precision and 95% recall. We demonstrate the applicability of SeqTagger in both RNA002/R9.4 and RNA004/RNA chemistries and show its robust performance both for long and short RNA libraries, including custom libraries that do not contain standard poly(A) tails, such as Nano-tRNAseq libraries. Finally, we demonstrate that increasing the multiplexing up to 96 barcodes yields highly accurate demultiplexing models. SeqTagger can be executed in a standalone manner or through the MasterOfPores NextFlow workflow. The availability of an efficient and simple multiplexing strategy improves the cost-effectiveness of this technology and facilitates the analysis of low-input biological samples.
39869307	Receptor CDCP1 Is a Potential Target for Personalized Imaging and Treatment of Poor Outcome HER2+, Triple-Negative, and Metastatic ER+/HER2- Breast Cancers.	Receptor CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) was evaluated as a target for detection and treatment of breast cancer.
39864859	Involvement of nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCOR2) in estrogen-induced repression of arcuate Kiss1 expression in female rats.	Hypothalamic arcuate (ARC) kisspeptin neurons are considered the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator in rats. In virgin rats, the expression of the ARC kisspeptin gene (Kiss1) is repressed by proestrous levels of estradiol-17β (high E2) but not by diestrous levels of E2 (low E2). In lactating rats, ARC Kiss1 expression is repressed by low E2 during late lactation. This study aimed to investigate whether nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCOR2, encoded by Ncor2), an estrogen receptor α corepressor, is involved in the estrogen-induced repression of ARC Kiss1 expression in rats. Double in situ hybridization for Kiss1 and Ncor2 revealed that approximately 80% of ARC Kiss1-expressing cells co-expressed Ncor2 in ovariectomized (OVX) + low E2 virgin rats, while approximately 90% of ARC Kiss1-expressing cells co-expressed Ncor2 in OVX + low E2 lactating rats. To further examine the role of Ncor2, we studied the effects of Kiss1-dependent Ncor2 knockdown on ARC Kiss1 expression and luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses. An adeno-associated virus vector carrying Cre-activated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for Ncor2 was administered to the ARC in two Kiss1-Cre rat models: OVX + high E2 Kiss1-Cre virgin rats and OVX + low E2 Kiss1-Cre lactating rats. Ncor2-shRNA treatment significantly increased the number of ARC Kiss1-expressing cells and the intensity of Kiss1 signals in OVX + high E2 virgin rats but failed to fully restore low E2-induced Kiss1 repression in lactating rats. The Ncor2-shRNA treatment failed to affect LH pulses in both models. These findings suggest that NCOR2 in ARC kisspeptin neurons mediates high E2-induced repression of ARC Kiss1 expression in virgin rats.
39864845	Influences of 5-hydroxytriptamine on sperm hyperactivation and in vitro fertility in rats.	The neurotransmitter, 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT), is well known. Furthermore, it enhances the acrosome reaction, hyperactivation, and in vitro fertilization (IVF) success in hamsters and mice. In the present study, we examined whether 5-HT enhances hyperactivation and increases IVF success in rats. When rat sperm was exposed to 5-HT, hyperactivation was significantly enhanced. Only the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonists significantly enhanced hyperactivation. Additionally, both 5-HT and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonists significantly increase the success of IVF. These results suggested that 5-HT increases IVF success by enhancing hyperactivation and effects of 5-HT are associated with the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor. Therefore, in rats, 5-HT enhances capacitation and the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor is the key molecule for capacitation.

39849919	Advanced wood-inorganic composites: preparation, properties and perspectives.	In recent years, the widespread use of wood products has been observed in many fields. Wooden products have excellent green and environmentally friendly characteristics, but their performance often cannot meet people's needs. Many researchers have conducted in-depth research on wood-based composite materials and their modification methods in order to improve the performance of wood. This article provides a selective review of the types, modification methods, and properties of inorganic modifiers. The preparation methods are mainly divided into immersion methods, sol-gel methods, and hydrothermal synthesis. The flame retardancy, mechanical properties, hydrophobicity, and mold resistance of modified wood have been effectively improved. In addition, modified wood also has photoresponsive properties, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Finally, the challenges and perspectives on advanced wood-inorganic composites have been proposed for guiding future studies.

39838948	Mass production of robust hydrogel electrolytes for high-performance zinc-ion batteries.	Hydrogel electrolytes are crucial for solving the problems of random zinc dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reactions, and uncontrollable passivation. However, their complex fabrication processes pose challenges to achieving large-scale production with excellent mechanical properties required to withstand multiple cycles of mechanical loads while maintaining high electrochemical performance needed for the new-generation flexible zinc-ion batteries. Herein, we present a superspreading-based strategy to produce robust hydrogel electrolytes consisting of polyvinyl alcohol, sodium alginate and sodium acetate. The hydrogel electrolytes have a tensile strength of 54.1 ± 2.5 MPa, a fracture strain of up to 1113 ± 37%, and a fracture toughness of 374.1 ± 6.1 MJ m<sup>-3</sup>, showcasing endurance of 2500 cycles at 80% strain without damage. Besides, the hydrogel electrolytes feature a high ionic conductivity of 14 mS cm<sup>-1</sup> and a Zn<sup>2+</sup> transference number of 0.62, as interfacial regulation enables the symmetric cell to achieve 1300 hours of highly stable and reversible zinc plating/stripping. As a preliminary attempt toward mass production, soft-pack batteries assembled using modified hydrogel electrolytes demonstrate robust machinability, with minimal voltage change after being bent and deformed 100 times. This work is expected to pave the way for developing a convenient hydrogel electrolyte for effective and stable zinc-ion batteries.
39838847	High-<i>k</i> organic-inorganic hybrid dielectric material for flexible thin-film transistors and printed logic circuits.	A new photopolymerizable organic-inorganic (O-I) hybrid sol-gel material, AUP@SiO<i>x</i>-184, has been synthesized and utilized as a gate dielectric in flexible organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). The previously reported three-arm alkoxy-functionalized silane amphiphilic polymer has yielded stable O-I hybrid materials comprising uniformly dispersed nanoparticles in the sol state. In this study, a photosensitizer was introduced, facilitating curing effects under ultraviolet light. Photo-crosslinking enhances the stability of hydroxyl radicals within inorganic nanoparticles, thereby minimizing device hysteresis. This approach also contributes to achieving a low leakage current and a high dielectric constant (high-<i>k</i>) while maintaining reduced thickness. Moreover, AUP@SiO<i>x</i>-184 films are amenable to patterning through UV photopolymerization and can be successfully produced using printing techniques. Compared to other materials, they exhibit outstanding flexibility and improved insulating capabilities. Additionally, OTFTs incorporating AUP@SiO<i>x</i>-184 layers demonstrate extremely stable driving features on flexible substrates. Selective printing and specific patterning play crucial roles in the fabrication of logic circuits. This synthesis strategy has resulted in integrated logic devices that have successfully demonstrated their functionality, highlighting its value for producing functional O-I hybrid materials. Utilizing AUP@SiO<i>x</i>-184 as a gate dielectric in OTFTs showcases its potential to advance electronic technologies that are both flexible and high-performing.
39836024	Multifunctional applications enabled by tunable multi-emission and ultra-broadband VIS-NIR luminescence <i>via</i> energy transfer in Sn<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>-doped lead-free Zn-based metal halides.	Metal halides are widely applied in solid-state lighting (SSL), optoelectronic devices, information encryption, and near-infrared (NIR) detection due to their superior photoelectric properties and tunable emission. However, single-component phosphors that can be efficiently excited by light-emitting diode (LED) chips and cover both the visible (VIS) and NIR emission regions are still very rare. To address this issue, (TPA)<sub>2</sub>ZnBr<sub>4</sub>:Sn<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup> (TPA = [(CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>N]<sup>+</sup>) phosphors were synthesized by using the solvent evaporation method. The Sn<sup>2+</sup> doping significantly enhances the luminescence of (TPA)<sub>2</sub>ZnBr<sub>4</sub>, and shifts the weak emission of blue light to efficient emissions in the red and NIR zones. Spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the emissions are attributed to the different levels of <sup>3</sup>P<sub>1</sub>-<sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub> in the [SnBr<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> tetrahedron caused by Jahn-Teller distortion. More importantly, energy transfer from Mn<sup>2+</sup> to Sn<sup>2+</sup> enables ultra-broadband VIS-NIR emission across the 400-1000 nm range, with excitation-dependent tunable emission characteristics. These properties suggest that (TPA)<sub>2</sub>ZnBr<sub>4</sub>:Sn<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup> has great potential as a high-performance, single-component luminescent material for applications in general lighting, NIR light source, and anti-counterfeiting labels.
39835686	A Schiff-base-modified Cu nanocluster with redox dual-catalytic sites and fluorescence sensing for the degradation and detection of atrazine.	Atrazine is a widely used and heavily contaminating pesticide. In this work, we designed and synthesized a versatile catalyst for the degradation and fluorescent detection of atrazine. This catalyst consists of Cu clusters modified by a Schiff base. The combination of Cu clusters and Schiff base enables it to act as a catalyst with the dual roles of oxidation and reduction. The inclusion of the Schiff base also narrows the band gap of Cu clusters and accelerates the redox electron transfer, leading to the degradation of atrazine up to 98%. Furthermore, the red fluorescence of Cu clusters and the green fluorescence of Schiff base allow this catalyst to sense atrazine like a sensor by a change in fluorescence color. The limit of detection for atrazine is as low as 0.1 nM and visual limit of detection is 10 nM. The mechanisms of catalysis and fluorescence sensing of the catalyst are verified by mass spectrometry and density functional theory. This multi-functional catalyst has great application potential in environmental protection, health and safety and other fields.
39832126	Integrated artificial neurons from metal halide perovskites.	Hardware neural networks could perform certain computational tasks orders of magnitude more energy-efficiently than conventional computers. Artificial neurons are a key component of these networks and are currently implemented with electronic circuits based on capacitors and transistors. However, artificial neurons based on memristive devices are a promising alternative, owing to their potentially smaller size and inherent stochasticity. But despite their promise, demonstrations of memristive artificial neurons have so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a fully on-chip artificial neuron based on microscale electrodes and halide perovskite semiconductors as the active layer. By connecting a halide perovskite memristive device in series with a capacitor, the device demonstrates stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire behavior, with an energy consumption of 20 to 60 pJ per spike, lower than that of a biological neuron. We simulate populations of our neuron and show that the stochastic firing allows the detection of sub-threshold inputs. The neuron can easily be integrated with previously-demonstrated halide perovskite artificial synapses in energy-efficient neural networks.
39831844	High spin-orbit torque efficiency induced by engineering spin absorption for fully electric-driven magnetization switching.	Realizing spin-orbit torque (SOT)-driven magnetization switching offers promising opportunities for the advancement of next-generation spintronics. However, the relatively low charge-spin conversion efficiency accompanied by an ultrahigh critical switching current density (<i>J</i><sub>c</sub>) remains a significant obstacle to the further development of SOT-based storage elements. Herein, spin absorption engineering at the ferromagnet/nonmagnet interface is firstly proposed to achieve high SOT efficiency in Pt/Co/Ir trilayers. The <i>J</i><sub>c</sub> value was significantly decreased to 7.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> A cm<sup>-2</sup>, achieving a maximum reduction of 58% when a 4.0-nm Gd layer was inserted into the Co/Ir interface. A similar trend was observed in the trilayers with various rare metal insertions, suggesting the universality of this approach. Simultaneously, the highest effective spin Hall angle of 0.29 was obtained in the Pt/Co/Gd (4.0 nm)/Ir multilayers, which was approximately three times greater than that obtained in the Pt/Co/Ir trilayer. First-principles calculations together with polarized neutron reflectivity results revealed that spin mixed conductivity can be significantly enhanced due to a spontaneous interfacial CoGd alloy, which is critical for high SOT efficiency. In addition, the deterministic field-free switching polarity can be tuned by introducing Gd insertion. These findings provide a promising pathway for deeply understanding the spin-charge conversion mechanism, and further enable the design of low-consumption spintronic circuits.
39831825	Surfactant-based interface capture towards the development of 2D-printed photonic structures.	This study focuses on fabricating photonic crystals (PCs) by surfactant-based particle capture at the gas-liquid interface of evaporating sessile droplets. The captured particles form interfacial films, resulting in ordered monolayer depositions manifesting iridescent structural colors. The particle dynamics behind the ordered arrangement is delineated. This arrangement is influenced by the alteration in particles' hydrophobicity, charge, and internal flow introduced by the surfactant addition. The influence of surfactant and particle concentrations on the phenomenon is also investigated. The work demonstrates a drop-by-drop technique to scale up the formation of PCs. Furthermore, the work is extended towards demonstrating the utilization of this mechanism to fabricate arbitrary PCs efficiently by direct writing technique. The particle coverage in directly written patterns is influenced by printing speed and particle concentration, which are adjusted to achieve covert photonic patterns. Finally, the replication of colloidal PC onto a flexible polymer with minimal colloid transfer is demonstrated using soft lithography.
39831314	Anti-freezing conductive hydrogels with exceptional mechanical properties and stable sensing performance at -30 °C.	Conductive hydrogels with stable sensing performance are highly required in soft electronic devices. However, these hydrogels tend to solidify and experience structural damage at sub-zero temperatures, leading to material breakdown and device malfunction. The main challenge lies in effectively designing the micro/nano-structure to enhance mechanical properties and stable strain sensing while preventing freezing in hydrogels. Here, we present a rapid strategy for developing a MXene bridging double-network structure-based strain sensor using polyacrylamide and agar hydrogels that can maintain stable functionality even at an extremely low temperature of -30 °C. By incorporating MXenes as a catalyst to expedite free radical polymerization, we achieve outstanding mechanical and strain sensing properties at room temperature (a high response range of 1000%, a response signal linearity of 0.998, and a gauge factor (GF) value of 1.41). This sensing performance surpasses those reported for many other hydrogels. Importantly, we also observe that the stable micro-nanostructure in the hydrogel at an extreme temperature of approximately -30 °C results in exceptional strain-detection performance (a stable response range of up to 250%) with a linearity of 0.995 and a GF value of 1.25 due to its remarkably low freezing point (<-80 °C). These findings highlight the application of our hydrogel-based tactile sensor in low-temperature environments.
39820201	Application of advanced quantum dots in perovskite solar cells: synthesis, characterization, mechanism, and performance enhancement.	Quantum dots have garnered significant interest in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their stable chemical properties, high carrier mobility, and unique features such as multiple exciton generation and excellent optoelectronic characteristics resulting from quantum confinement effects. This review explores quantum dot properties and their applications in photoelectronic devices, including their synthesis and deposition processes. This sets the stage for discussing their diverse roles in the carrier transport, absorber, and interfacial layers of PSCs. We thoroughly examine advances in defect passivation, energy band alignment, perovskite crystallinity, device stability, and broader light absorption. In particular, novel approaches to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of quantum dot-enhanced perovskite solar cells are highlighted. Lastly, based on a comprehensive overview, we provide a forward-looking outlook on advanced quantum dot fabrication and its impact on enhancing the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. This review offers insights into fundamental mechanisms that endorse quantum dots for improved PSC performance, paving the way for further development of quantum dot-integrated PSCs.
39817866	Mechanical and thermal responsive chiral photonic cellulose hydrogels for dynamic anti-counterfeiting and optical skin.	Dynamic responsive structural colored materials have drawn increased consideration in a wide range of applications, such as colorimetric sensors and high-safety tags. However, the sophisticated interactions among the individual responsive parts restrict the advanced design of multimodal responsive photonic materials. Inspired by stimuli-responsive color change in chameleon skin, a simple and effective photo-crosslinking strategy is proposed to construct hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) based hydrogels with multiple responsive structured colors. By controlling UV exposure time, the structural color of HPC hydrogels can be effectively controlled in a full-color spectrum. At the same time, HPC hydrogels showcase temperature and mechanical dual-responsive structural colors. In particular, the microstructure of HPC hydrogels undergoes a transition from the chiral nematic phase to the nematic phase under the action of external stretching, leading to a significant reflection of circularly polarized light (CPL) to linearly polarized light (LPL). Given the diverse responsiveness exhibited by HPC hydrogels and their unique structural transition properties under external forces, we have explored their potential applications as dynamic anti-counterfeiting labels and optical skins. This work reveals the great possibility of using structural colored cellulose hydrogels in multi-sensing and optical displays, opening up a new path for the exploration of next-generation flexible photonic devices.
39817347	Mitigating triplet loss in 2D WSe<sub>2</sub>/non-fullerene heterostructures using halogenated acceptors.	Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) can be combined with organic semiconductors to form hybrid van der Waals heterostructures. Specially, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) stand out due to their excellent absorption and exciton diffusion properties. Here, we couple monolayer tungsten diselenide (ML-WSe<sub>2</sub>) with two well performing NFAs, ITIC, and IT-4F (fluorinated ITIC) to achieve hybrid architectures. Using steady state and time resolved spectroscopic techniques, we reveal sub-picosecond free charge generation in the heterostructure of ML-WSe<sub>2</sub> with ITIC, where however, bimolecular recombination of spin uncorrelated charge carriers with possible contributions from geminate charge recombination cause rapid formation of low-lying triplet (T<sub>1</sub>) states in ITIC. Importantly, this unwanted process is effectively suppressed when the fluorinated derivative of ITIC, IT-4F, is deposited on ML-WSe<sub>2</sub>. We observe a similar scenario when replacing the ML-TMDC with copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole acceptor meaning that triplet state formation is not driven by the spin-orbit coupling of ML-WSe<sub>2</sub>. From <i>ab initio</i> calculations based on density functional theory, we interpret the high triplet formation in the ML-WSe<sub>2</sub>/ITIC hybrid bilayer due to changes in the nature and energies of the interfacial charge transfer (CT) levels. Our results highlight the delicate balance between excitons and charges in such inorganic/NFA heterostructures.
39814371	Can thermoregulatory response to heat stress be improved in lactating dairy cows? Insights from counter-current heat transfer systems impacting reproduction.	Climate change has caused heat stress (HS) to become an increasingly severe problem for high-producing dairy herds. Although cooling systems allow milk production to remain nearly constant throughout the year, fertility decreases during summer. Physiological counter-current heat transfer mechanisms maintaining brain/hypothalamic and reproductive functions in cattle are vulnerable to HS. In this study, I propose strategies to improve cooling systems, particularly in zones with the highest risk of increased body temperature, such as milking areas. In addition, heat transfer mechanisms to protect the brain-hypothalamus axis from hyperthermia must be considered when implementing measures to reduce HS-related problems.
39812487	AUTOGRAPH: Chemical Reaction Networks in 3D.	Understanding and analyzing large-scale reaction networks is a fundamental challenge due to their complexity and size, often beyond human comprehension.

39812417	Structural relaxation chirality transfer enhanced circularly polarized luminescence in heteronuclear Ce<sup>III</sup>-Mn<sup>II</sup> complexes.	Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials have developed rapidly in recent years due to their wide application prospects in fields like 3D displays and anti-counterfeiting. Utilizing energy transfer processes to transfer chirality has been proven as an efficient way to obtain CPL materials. However, the physics behind energy-transfer induced CPL is still not clear. Herein, in a well-designed heteronuclear Ce<sup>III</sup>-Mn<sup>II</sup> complex system [(Ce((R/S)-L)Br(μ-Br))<sub>2</sub>]MnBr<sub>4</sub> [(R/S)-L = (2<i>R</i>,3<i>R</i>)- or (2<i>S</i>,3<i>S</i>)-2,3-dimethyl-1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane] with intra energy transfer from Ce<sup>III</sup> to Mn<sup>II</sup>, the luminescence dissymmetry factor of Mn<sup>II</sup> obtained by excitation of Ce<sup>III</sup> is around 10 times higher than that obtained by direct excitation of Mn<sup>II</sup>, while the Ce<sup>III</sup> center itself shows an almost negligible CPL. To address this unusual phenomenon, we proposed a new mechanism named structural relaxation chirality transfer (SRCT) where structural relaxation of the excited chiral donor amplified chirality transfer to the acceptor by intramolecular interactions. As an assistant proof, a mixture of Ce<sup>III</sup>-Zn<sup>II</sup> and La<sup>III</sup>-Mn<sup>II</sup> complexes with inter energy transfer showed no CPL amplification. These results will inspire more breakthroughs in the physics nature and development of energy-transfer induced CPL.
39810660	Highly sensitive temperature sensors based on the fluorescence intensity ratio of dual-emissive lead-free metal halides.	Given that optical thermometers are widely used due to their unique advantages, this study aims to address critical challenges in existing technologies, such as insufficient sensitivity, limited temperature measurement ranges, and poor signal recognition capabilities. Herein, we develop a thermometer based on the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of Sb-doped Cs<sub>2</sub>NaInCl<sub>6</sub> (Cs<sub>2</sub>NaInCl<sub>6</sub>:Sb). As the temperature increases from 203 to 323 K, the thermally induced transition from triplet to singlet self-trapped excitons (STEs) leads to enhanced 455 nm photoluminescence (PL) from singlet STE recombination. Thus, the FIR monotonically depends on temperature, allowing for temperature sensing with a high absolute sensitivity (<i>S</i><sub>A</sub>) of 0.0575 K<sup>-1</sup> and the maximum relative sensitivity (<i>S</i><sub>R</sub>) of 1.005% K<sup>-1</sup>. We demonstrate that spatial temperature distribution can be measured by mapping the PL spectra, even with a transparent medium screening the target. Furthermore, blue emissive Cs<sub>2</sub>NaInCl<sub>6</sub>:Sb is mixed with yellow emissive Cs<sub>2</sub>AgInCl<sub>6</sub>:Sb with a thermal quenching feature. The fluorescence color of the mixture dramatically depends on temperature, enabling a user-friendly colorimetric temperature sensing. Therefore, two operational modes are proposed to meet various practical application demands.
39810591	Penguin feather-inspired flexible aerogel composite films featuring ultra-low thermal conductivity and dielectric constant.	Given extremely high porosity, aerogels have demonstrated remarkable advantages in serving as thermal insulation and wave-transparent materials. Unfortunately, their practical applications are greatly confined by their inherent fragility. The recent emergence of polymer aerogels presents an ideal platform for the development of flexible aerogel films. However, additional cross-linking agents are necessitated for constructing a robust structure, complicating the production process. Herein, we report a flexible aerogel film based on <i>meta</i>-aramid composites, inspired by the porous structure of penguin feathers. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds function as natural cross-linking agents. Their disruption results in the dissolution of <i>meta</i>-aramid fibers, while their reconstruction facilitates localized rearrangement of <i>meta</i>-aramid chains during the sol-gel process, generating closed nanopores. Furthermore, fluorinated hollow glass microspheres are filled, compressing the nanopores situated near the interface to 75-150 nm. This meets the critical threshold required by the Knudsen effect, decreasing the thermal conductivity to levels below that of ambient air. At an optimized doping ratio of 3 wt%, the thermal conductivity is 21.6 mW m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, while achieving a low dielectric constant of 1.43. Simultaneously, aerogel films exhibit enhanced mechanical properties, and also show benefits of hydrophobicity, colorability, ultralightness, and flame retardancy, making themselves multifunctional materials suitable for practical applications.
39810590	Stretchable wrinkle-structured liquid metal sandwich films enable strain-insensitive electromagnetic shielding and Joule heating.	Stretchable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields with strain-insensitive EMI shielding and Joule heating performances are highly desirable to be integrated with wearable electronics. To explore the possibility of applying geometric design in elastomeric liquid metal (LM) composites and fully investigate the influence of LM geometry on stretchable EMI shielding and Joule heating, multifunctional wrinkle-structured LM/Ecoflex sandwich films with excellent stretchability are developed. The denser LM wrinkle enables not only better electrical conduction, higher shielding effectiveness (SE) and steady-state temperature, but also enhanced strain-stable far-field/near-field shielding performance and Joule-heating capability. More strikingly, compared to most previously reported stretchable EMI shields or electric heaters, the densely wrinkled film could achieve multidirectional strain-insensitive shielding behavior with slightly strain-enhanced or strain-invariant EMI SE under stretching parallel or perpendicular to the electric field of EM waves, as well as show ideal strain-insensitive Joule-heating behavior over a larger strain range of 250%. The current findings suggest an effective strategy for developing stretchable LM-based composites with strain-insensitive properties.
39808502	FDA Approval Summary: Tovorafenib for Relapsed or Refractory BRAF-Altered Pediatric Low-Grade Glioma.	On April 23, 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval to tovorafenib, a type II RAF kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of patients 6 months of age and older with relapsed or refractory pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) harboring a BRAF fusion or rearrangement or BRAF V600 mutation. Efficacy was evaluated in FIREFLY-1 (NCT04775485), a single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial that enrolled patients 6 months to 25 years of age with relapsed or refractory pLGG with an activating BRAF alteration who had received prior systemic therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure was the radiologic overall response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with complete response, partial response, or minor response as determined by blinded independent central review using Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology criteria. A key secondary endpoint was duration of response. In an efficacy population of 76 patients, the overall response rate was 51% (95% confidence interval, 40-63), and the median duration of response was 13.8 months (95% confidence interval, 11.3-not estimable). The required postmarketing clinical trial (FIREFLY-2) was well underway at the time of accelerated approval. This represents the first FDA approval of a systemic therapy for the treatment of patients with pLGG with BRAF fusions or rearrangements.
39806946	Environmentally tolerant multifunctional eutectogel for highly sensitive wearable sensors.	Flexible hydrogel sensors have found extensive applications. However, the insufficient sensing sensitivity and the propensity to freeze at low temperatures restrict their use, particularly in frigid conditions. Herein, a multifunctional eutectogel with high transparency, anti-freezing, anti-swelling, adhesive, and self-healing properties is prepared by a one-step photopolymerization of acrylic acid and lauryl methacrylate in a binary solvent comprising water and deep eutectic solvent (DES). The results from the molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory indicate that the hydrogen bonds between DES and water mixtures possess better stability than those between water molecules. On the other hand, DES breaks down hydrogen bonds in water, providing eutectogels with excellent anti-freezing even at -60 °C. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide is incorporated to establish stable hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic attractions with polymer chains in the eutectogel network, resulting in superior mechanical (elongation at break of 2890%) and anti-swelling (only 2% swelling in water over 7 days) properties. The eutectogel-based strain sensors exhibit remarkable sensitivity, achieving a gauge factor of up to 15.4. The multifunctional eutectogel sensors can monitor motion and transmit encrypted information at low temperatures, demonstrating considerable potential for applications in flexible electronics within low-temperature environments.
39806921	Moisture-responsive ultralow-hysteresis polymer ionogels for adhesion-switchable strain sensing.	Adhesion-switchable ultralow-hysteresis polymer ionogels are highly demanded in soft electronics to avoid debonding damage and signal distortion, yet the design and fabrication of such ionogels are challenging. Herein, we propose a novel method to design switchable adhesive ionogels by using binary ionic solvents with two opposite-affinity ionic components. The obtained ionogels exhibit moisture-induced phase separation, facilitating switchable adhesion with a high detaching efficiency (>99%). Moreover, before and after phase separation, the viscoelastic behavior of the ionogels is maintained in the rubbery plateau region within common frequency ranges with ultralow mechanical hysteresis (∼3%) under large strain, enabling accurate and stable strain and pressure sensing. Accordingly, the ionogel films can be used as functional elements in a smart clamp to realize flytrap-like selective activation, based on high sensitivity to the vibration intensity from the targeted prey. This work may inspire future research on the development of advanced soft electronics.
39805703	Nanopore-based consensus sequencing enables accurate multimodal tumor cell-free DNA profiling.	Shallow genome-wide cell-free DNA sequencing holds great promise for noninvasive cancer monitoring by providing reliable copy number alteration (CNA) and fragmentomic profiles. Single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) are, however, much harder to identify with low sequencing depth due to sequencing errors. Here, we present Nanopore Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA)-enhanced Consensus Sequencing (NanoRCS), which leverages RCA and consensus calling based on genome-wide long-read nanopore sequencing to enable simultaneous multimodal tumor fraction (TF) estimation through SNVs, CNAs, and fragmentomics. The efficacy of NanoRCS is tested on 18 cancer patient samples and seven healthy controls, demonstrating its ability to reliably detect TFs as low as 0.24%. In vitro experiments confirm that SNV measurements are essential for detecting TFs below 3%. NanoRCS provides an opportunity for cost-effective and rapid sample processing, which aligns well with clinical needs, particularly in settings where quick and accurate cancer monitoring is essential for personalized treatment strategies.
39804262	Highly polarized single-crystal organic light-emitting devices with low turn-on voltage and high brightness.	Linearly-polarized organic electroluminescent devices have gained significant attention due to their potential applications across various fields. However, traditional thin-film organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) face significant challenges, primarily due to the necessity of incorporating complex optical elements. In this study, we present linearly-polarized OLEDs (LP-OLEDs) based on organic single crystals that we have designed and prepared. These devices exhibit a degree of polarization (DOP) of up to 0.96 for photoluminescence and 0.95 for electroluminescence, values that are close to the ideal linearly-polarized light (DOP = 1). The LP-OLEDs demonstrate outstanding performance, with a low turn-on voltage of just 2.5 volts, an exceptionally high brightness of 200 000 cd m<sup>-2</sup>, and a current density surpassing 300 A cm<sup>-2</sup>. This is the best overall performance reported for single crystal-based OLEDs to date. These results open the door to the development of next-generation, low-power consumption displays, marking a significant step forward in the field of organic single crystal-based LP-OLEDs.
39804097	Porous polymers: structure, fabrication and application.	The porous polymer is a common and fascinating category within the vast family of porous materials. It offers valuable features such as sufficient raw materials, easy processability, controllable pore structures, and adjustable surface functionality by combining the inherent properties of both porous structures and polymers. These characteristics make it an effective choice for designing functional and advanced materials. In this review, the structural features, processing techniques and application fields of the porous polymer are discussed comprehensively to present their current status and provide a valuable tutorial guide and help for researchers. Firstly, the basic classification and structural features of porous polymers are elaborated upon to provide a comprehensive analysis from a mesoscopic to macroscopic perspective. Secondly, several established techniques for fabricating porous polymers are introduced, including their respective basic principles, characteristics of the resulting pores, and applied scopes. Thirdly, we demonstrate application research of porous polymers in various emerging frontier fields from multiple perspectives, including pressure sensing, thermal control, electromagnetic shielding, acoustic reduction, air purification, water treatment, health management, and so on. Finally, the review explores future directions for porous polymers and evaluates their future challenges and opportunities.
39794120	Single-cell Rapid Capture Hybridization sequencing reliably detects isoform usage and coding mutations in targeted genes.	Single-cell long-read sequencing has transformed our understanding of isoform usage and the mutation heterogeneity between cells. Despite unbiased in-depth analysis, the low sequencing throughput often results in insufficient read coverage, thereby limiting our ability to perform mutation calling for specific genes. Here, we developed a single-cell Rapid Capture Hybridization sequencing (scRaCH-seq) method that demonstrates high specificity and efficiency in capturing targeted transcripts using long-read sequencing, allowing an in-depth analysis of mutation status and transcript usage for genes of interest. The method includes creating a probe panel for transcript capture, using barcoded primers for pooling and efficient sequencing via Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. scRaCH-seq is applicable to stored and indexed single-cell cDNA, which allows analysis to be combined with existing short-read RNA-seq data sets. In our investigation of <i>BTK</i> and <i>SF3B1</i> genes in samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we detect <i>SF3B1</i> isoforms and mutations with high sensitivity. Integration with short-read single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data reveals significant gene expression differences in <i>SF3B1</i>-mutated CLL cells, although it does not impact the sensitivity of the anticancer drug venetoclax. scRaCH-seq's capability to study long-read transcripts of multiple genes makes it a powerful tool for single-cell genomics.
39785866	Ultrasensitive Detection and Monitoring of Circulating Tumor DNA Using Structural Variants in Early-Stage Breast Cancer.	The detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after curative-intent therapy in early-stage breast cancer is highly prognostic of disease recurrence. Current ctDNA assays, mainly targeting single-nucleotide variants, vary in sensitivity and specificity. Although increasing the number of single-nucleotide variants in tumor-informed assays improves sensitivity, structural variants (SV) may achieve similar or better sensitivity without compromising specificity. SVs occur across all cancers, linked to genomic instability and tumorigenesis, with unique tumor- and patient-specific breakpoints occurring throughout the genome. SVs in breast cancer are underexplored, and their potential for ctDNA detection and monitoring has not been fully evaluated.
39756939	Masticatory performance indicates the development of psychological frailty: A 6-year prospective cohort study by the SONIC study group.

39756936	Influence of 3D printing orientations on physico-mechanical properties and accuracy of additively manufactured dental ceramics.

39756891	Efficacy of different intraarticular injection materials in the arthrocentesis of arthrogenic temporomandibular disorders: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	Arthrogenic temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) that do not respond to conservative treatment necessitate the use of semi-conservative methods, such as arthrocentesis. However, the ranking of intraarticular devices used in arthrocentesis remains controversial. Therefore, a network meta-analysis and systematic review were conducted to compare the different materials used for arthrocentesis.
39756889	Comprehensive review of polyetheretherketone use in dentistry.	This study aimed to comprehensively summarize the current state, shortcomings, and challenges regarding the use of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) in various fields of stomatology.
39715684	Evaluation of strategies for evidence-driven genome annotation using long-read RNA-seq.	While the production of a draft genome has become more accessible due to long-read sequencing, the annotation of these new genomes has not been developed at the same pace. Long-read RNA sequencing offers a promising solution for enhancing gene annotation. In this study, we explore how sequencing platforms, Oxford Nanopore R9.4.1 chemistry or Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel II CCS, and data processing methods influence evidence-driven genome annotation using long reads. Incorporating PacBio transcripts into our annotation pipeline significantly outperformed traditional methods, such as ab initio predictions and short-read-based annotations. We applied this strategy to a nonmodel species, the Florida manatee, and compared our results to existing short-read-based annotation. At the loci level, both annotations were highly concordant, with 90% agreement. However, at the transcript level, the agreement was only 35%. We identified 4906 novel loci, represented by 5707 isoforms, with 64% of these isoforms matching known sequences in other mammalian species. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of using high-quality curated transcript models in combination with ab initio methods for effective genome annotation.
39694857	Taurine pangenome uncovers a segmental duplication upstream of <i>KIT</i> associated with depigmentation in white-headed cattle.	Cattle have been selectively bred for coat color, spotting, and depigmentation patterns. The assumed autosomal dominant inherited genetic variants underlying the characteristic white head of Fleckvieh, Simmental, and Hereford cattle have not been identified yet, although the contribution of structural variation upstream of the <i>KIT</i> gene has been proposed. Here, we construct a graph pangenome from 24 haplotype assemblies representing seven taurine cattle breeds to identify and characterize the white-head-associated locus for the first time based on long-read sequencing data and pangenome analyses. We introduce a pangenome-wide association mapping approach that examines assembly path similarities within the graph to reveal an association between two most likely serial alleles of a complex structural variant (SV) 66 kb upstream of <i>KIT</i> and facial depigmentation. The complex SV contains a variable number of tandemly duplicated 14.3 kb repeats, consisting of LTRs, LINEs, and other repetitive elements, leading to misleading alignments of short and long reads when using a linear reference. We align 250 short-read sequencing samples spanning 15 cattle breeds to the pangenome graph, further validating that the alleles of the SV segregate with head depigmentation. We estimate an increased count of repeats in Hereford relative to Simmental and other white-headed cattle breeds from the graph alignment coverage, suggesting a large under-assembly in the current Hereford-based cattle reference genome, which had fewer copies. Our work shows that exploiting assembly path similarities within graph pangenomes can reveal trait-associated complex SVs.
39670974	Longitudinal Blood Immune-Inflammatory and Radiomic Profiling to Decode Different Patterns of Acquired Resistance to Immunotherapy in Patients with NSCLC.	To uncover the underpinnings of acquired resistance (AR) to immunotherapy (IO), we determined whether distinctive clinicopathologic, radiomic, and peripheral blood (PB) immune-inflammatory features reflect oligo- and systemic (sys)-AR in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
39648588	Protein-Specific Crowding Accelerates Aging in Protein Condensates.	Macromolecular crowding agents, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), are often used to mimic cellular cytoplasm in protein assembly studies. Despite the perception that crowding agents have an inert nature, we demonstrate and quantitatively explore the diverse effects of PEG on the phase separation and maturation of protein condensates. We use two model proteins, the FG domain of Nup98 and bovine serum albumin (BSA), which represent an intrinsically disordered protein and a protein with a well-established secondary structure, respectively. PEG expedites the maturation of Nup98, enhancing denser protein packing and fortifying interactions, which hasten beta-sheet formation and subsequent droplet gelation. In contrast to BSA, PEG enhances droplet stability and limits the available solvent for protein solubilization, inducing only minimal changes in the secondary structure, pointing toward a significantly different role of the crowding agent. Strikingly, we detect almost no presence of PEG in Nup droplets, whereas PEG is moderately detectable within BSA droplets. Our findings demonstrate a nuanced interplay between crowding agents and proteins; PEG can accelerate protein maturation in liquid-liquid phase separation systems, but its partitioning and effect on protein structure in droplets is protein specific. This suggests that crowding phenomena are specific to each protein-crowding agent pair.
39638560	Rearrangements of viral and human genomes at human papillomavirus integration events and their allele-specific impacts on cancer genome regulation.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) integration has been implicated in transforming HPV infection into cancer. To resolve genome dysregulation associated with HPV integration, we performed Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing on 72 cervical cancer genomes from a Ugandan data set that was previously characterized using short-read sequencing. We find recurrent structural rearrangement patterns at HPV integration events, which we categorize as del(etion)-like, dup(lication)-like, translocation, multi-breakpoint, or repeat region integrations. Integrations involving amplified HPV-human concatemers, particularly multi-breakpoint events, frequently harbor heterogeneous forms and copy numbers of the viral genome. Transcriptionally active integrants are characterized by unmethylated regions in both the viral and human genomes downstream from the viral transcription start site, resulting in HPV-human fusion transcripts. In contrast, integrants without evidence of expression lack consistent methylation patterns. Furthermore, whereas transcriptional dysregulation is limited to genes within 200 kb of an HPV integrant, dysregulation of the human epigenome in the form of allelic differentially methylated regions affects megabase expanses of the genome, irrespective of the integrant's transcriptional status. By elucidating the structural, epigenetic, and allele-specific impacts of HPV integration, we provide insight into the role of integrated HPV in cervical cancer.
39636280	Cell Wall Dynamics in the Parasitic Plant (<i>Striga</i>) and Rice Pathosystem.	In the plant-plant pathosystem of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and the parasitic plant <i>Striga hermonthica</i>, cell walls from either plant are important defensive and offensive structures. Here, we reveal the cell wall dynamics in both <i>Striga</i> and rice using simultaneous RNA sequencing. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis to home in on cell wall modification processes occurring in interactions with a resistant rice cultivar (Nipponbare) compared with a susceptible one (IAC 165). Likewise, we compared the cell wall dynamics in <i>Striga</i> infecting resistant and susceptible rice. Our study revealed an intense battlement at the <i>Striga-</i>rice cell walls involving both parasite (offense) and host (defense) factors, the outcome of which makes the difference between successful or failed parasitism. <i>Striga</i> activates genes encoding cell wall-degrading enzymes to gain access to the host, expansins to allow for cell elongation, and pectin methyl esterase inhibitors for rigidity during infection. In the susceptible host, immune response processes are not induced, and <i>Striga</i>-derived cell wall-degrading enzymes easily breach the host cell wall, resulting in successful parasitism. In contrast, the resistant host invokes immune responses modulated by phytohormones to fortify the cell wall through polysaccharides and lignin deposition. Through these processes, the cell wall of the resistant host successfully obstructs parasite entry. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of practical agriculture in which cell wall modification can be used to manage parasitic plants.

39537359	Multisample motif discovery and visualization for tandem repeats.	Tandem repeats (TRs) occupy a significant portion of the human genome and are a source of polymorphisms due to variations in sizes and motif compositions. Some of these variations have been associated with various neuropathological disorders, highlighting the clinical importance of assessing the motif structure of TRs. Moreover, assessing the TR motif variation can offer valuable insights into evolutionary dynamics and population structure. Previously, characterizations of TRs were limited by short-read sequencing technology, which lacks the ability to accurately capture the full TR sequences. As long-read sequencing becomes more accessible and can capture the full complexity of TRs, there is now also a need for tools to characterize and analyze TRs using long-read data across multiple samples. In this study, we present MotifScope, a novel algorithm for the characterization and visualization of TRs based on a de novo <i>k</i>-mer approach for motif discovery. Comparative analysis against established tools reveals that MotifScope can identify a greater number of motifs and more accurately represent the underlying repeat sequences. Moreover, MotifScope has been specifically designed to enable motif composition comparisons across assemblies of different individuals, as well as across long-read sequencing reads within an individual, through combined motif discovery and sequence alignment. We showcase potential applications of MotifScope in diverse fields, including population genetics, clinical settings, and forensic analyses.
39537358	Multiple paralogs and recombination mechanisms contribute to the high incidence of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.	The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion disorder. Why the incidence of 22q11.2DS is much greater than that of other genomic disorders remains unknown. Short-read sequencing cannot resolve the complex segmental duplications (SDs) to provide direct confirmation of the hypothesis that the rearrangements are caused by nonallelic homologous recombination between the low copy repeats on Chromosome 22 (LCR22s). To enable haplotype-specific assembly and rearrangement mapping in LCR22 clusters, we combined fiber-FISH optical mapping with whole-genome (ultra-)long-read sequencing or rearrangement-specific long-range PCR on 25 families comprising several different LCR22-mediated rearrangements. We demonstrate that not only different paralogous SDs but also palindromic AT-rich repeats (PATRR) within LCR22s are driving 22q11.2 rearrangements. In addition, we show the existence of two different inversion polymorphisms preceding rearrangement, and somatic mosaicism. The existence of different recombination sites and mechanisms in paralogs and PATRRs, which are copy number expanding in the human population, is a likely contributor for the high 22q11.2DS incidence.
39472021	Geometric deep learning framework for de novo genome assembly.	The critical stage of every de novo genome assembler is identifying paths in assembly graphs that correspond to the reconstructed genomic sequences. The existing algorithmic methods struggle with this, primarily due to repetitive regions causing complex graph tangles, leading to fragmented assemblies. Here, we introduce GNNome, a framework for path identification based on geometric deep learning that enables training models on assembly graphs without relying on existing assembly strategies. By leveraging only the symmetries inherent to the problem, GNNome reconstructs assemblies from PacBio HiFi reads with contiguity and quality comparable to those of the state-of-the-art tools across several species. With every new genome assembled telomere-to-telomere, the amount of reliable training data at our disposal increases. Combining the straightforward generation of abundant simulated data for diverse genomic structures with the AI approach makes the proposed framework a plausible cornerstone for future work on reconstructing complex genomes with different degrees of ploidy and aneuploidy. To facilitate such developments, we make the framework and the best-performing model publicly available, provided as a tool that can directly be used to assemble new haploid genomes.
39472020	Long-read RNA sequencing reveals allele-specific <i>N</i> <sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine modifications.	Long-read sequencing technology enables highly accurate detection of allele-specific RNA expression, providing insights into the effects of genetic variation on splicing and RNA abundance. Furthermore, the ability to directly sequence RNA enables the detection of RNA modifications in tandem with ascertaining the allelic origin of each molecule. Here, we leverage these advantages to determine allele-biased patterns of <i>N</i> <sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modifications in native mRNA. We used human and mouse cells with known genetic variants to assign the allelic origin of each mRNA molecule combined with a supervised machine learning model to detect read-level m<sup>6</sup>A modification ratios. Our analyses reveal the importance of sequences adjacent to the DRACH motif in determining m<sup>6</sup>A deposition, in addition to allelic differences that directly alter the motif. Moreover, we discover allele-specific m<sup>6</sup>A modification events with no genetic variants in close proximity to the differentially modified nucleotide, demonstrating the unique advantage of using long-reads and surpassing the capabilities of antibody-based short-read approaches. This technological advance will further our understanding of the role of genetics in determining mRNA modifications.

39438112	<i>Candida albicans</i> isolates contain frequent heterozygous structural variants and transposable elements within genes and centromeres.	The human fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> poses a significant burden on global health, causing high rates of mortality and antifungal drug resistance. <i>C. albicans</i> is a heterozygous diploid organism that reproduces asexually. Structural variants (SVs) are an important source of genomic rearrangement, particularly in species that lack sexual recombination. To comprehensively investigate SVs across clinical isolates of <i>C. albicans</i>, we conducted long-read sequencing and genome-wide SV analysis in three distantly related clinical isolates. Our work includes a new, comprehensive analysis of transposable element (TE) composition, location, and diversity. SVs and TEs are frequently close to coding sequences and many SVs are heterozygous, suggesting that SVs might impact gene and allele-specific expression. Most SVs are uniquely present in only one clinical isolate, indicating that SVs represent a significant source of intraspecies genetic variation. We identify multiple, distinct SVs at the centromeres of Chromosome 4 and Chromosome 5, including inversions and transposon polymorphisms. These two chromosomes are often aneuploid in drug-resistant clinical isolates and can form isochromosome structures with breakpoints near the centromere. Further screening of 100 clinical isolates confirms the widespread presence of centromeric SVs in <i>C. albicans</i>, often appearing in a heterozygous state, indicating that SVs are contributing to centromere evolution in <i>C. albicans</i> Together, these findings highlight that SVs and TEs are common across diverse clinical isolates of <i>C. albicans</i> and that the centromeres of this organism are important sites of genome rearrangement.
39384398	The efficacy of occlusal appliance with a moisturizing gel pocket on sleep quality in patients with nocturnal xerostomia: A case series.	A case series of five patients (mean age, 77.0 years) with complaints of nocturnal xerostomia were subjected to occlusal appliance treatment with a reservoir of moisturizing gel during the night. An occlusal appliance covers the dental arch and hard palate, providing space in the midline of the hard palate to hold the moisturizing gel. Sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and sleep quality was assessed using the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI-J) before and after treatment. The total PSQI-J scores decreased in all patients after treatment. The ESS score, sleep time, and sleep efficiency improved or remained unchanged and none of the patients' symptoms worsened.

39198201	Morning headache caused by obstructive sleep apnea misdiagnosed as temporomandibular disorders-related headache: A case report.	A 67-year-old woman presented to our clinic with chief complaints of headache and mandibular heaviness. Physical examination revealed bilateral tenderness in the temporalis and masseter muscles, corresponding to the patient's chief complaint. Thus, a diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)-related headache was made. However, sleep disorders were identified after further consultation. Hence, sleep apnea-related headache was suspected due to a snoring habit with a Mallampati classification of Class IV. Out-of-center sleep testing (OCST) revealed a respiratory event index (REI) of 10.1/h and a low peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 76%. Consequently, a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was made, and treatment using the mandibular advancement device (MAD) was recommended. Following MAD treatment, the patient's sleep quality improved, and morning headaches ceased. Subsequent OCST performed while wearing the MAD showed a significant reduction in the REI to 1.6/h and an increase in the SpO<sub>2</sub> to 86%, indicating the therapeutic efficacy of the MAD in treating OSA.

38853001	Optimizing implant osseointegration, soft tissue responses, and bacterial inhibition: A comprehensive narrative review on the multifaceted approach of the UV photofunctionalization of titanium.	Titanium implants have revolutionized restorative and reconstructive therapy, yet achieving optimal osseointegration and ensuring long-term implant success remain persistent challenges. In this review, we explore a cutting-edge approach to enhancing implant properties: ultraviolet (UV) photofunctionalization. By harnessing UV energy, photofunctionalization rejuvenates aging implants, leveraging and often surpassing the intrinsic potential of titanium materials. The primary aim of this narrative review is to offer an updated perspective on the advancements made in the field, providing a comprehensive overview of recent findings and exploring the relationship between UV-induced physicochemical alterations and cellular responses. There is now compelling evidence of significant transformations in titanium surface chemistry induced by photofunctionalization, transitioning from hydrocarbon-rich to carbon pellicle-free surfaces, generating superhydrophilic surfaces, and modulating the electrostatic properties. These changes are closely associated with improved cellular attachment, spreading, proliferation, differentiation, and, ultimately, osseointegration. Additionally, we discuss clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of UV photofunctionalization in accelerating and enhancing the osseointegration of dental implants. Furthermore, we delve into recent advancements, including the development of one-minute vacuum UV (VUV) photofunctionalization, which addresses the limitations of conventional UV methods as well as the newly discovered functions of photofunctionalization in modulating soft tissue and bacterial interfaces. By elucidating the intricate relationship between surface science and biology, this body of research lays the groundwork for innovative strategies aimed at enhancing the clinical performance of titanium implants, marking a new era in implantology.
