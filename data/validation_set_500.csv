40058542	Iron at the helm: steering arsenic speciation through redox processes in soils.	The toxicity and bioavailability of arsenic (As) in soils are largely determined by its speciation. Iron (Fe) is widely present in soils with a strong affinity for As, and therefore the environmental behaviors of As and Fe oxides (including oxides, hydrates and hydrated oxides) are closely correlated with each other. The redox fluctuations of Fe driven by changes in the environment can significantly affect As speciation and its fate in soils. The interaction between Fe and As has garnered widespread attention, and the adsorption mechanisms of As by Fe oxides have also been well-documented. However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of how Fe redox dynamics affects As speciation depending on the soil environmental conditions. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms for As speciation transformation and redistribution, as well as the role of environmental factors in the main Fe redox processes in soils. These processes include the biotic Fe oxidation mediated by Fe-oxidizing bacteria, abiotic Fe oxidation by oxygen or manganese oxides, dissimilatory Fe reduction mediated by Fe-reducing bacteria, and Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of Fe oxides. This review contributes to a deeper understanding of the environmental behaviors of Fe and As in soils, and provides theoretical guidance for the development of remediation strategies for As-contaminated soils.	0	contr
40065997	The assembly and annotation of two teinturier grapevine varieties, Dakapo and Rubired.	Teinturier grapevines, known for their pigmented flesh berries due to anthocyanin production, are valuable for enhancing the pigmentation of wine, for potential health benefits, and for investigating anthocyanin production in plants. Here, we assembled and annotated the Dakapo and Rubired genomes, two teinturier varieties. For Dakapo, we combined Nanopore sequencing, Illumina sequencing, and scaffolding to the existing grapevine assembly to generate a final assembly of 508.5 Mbp. Combining <i>de novo</i> annotation and lifting over annotations from the existing grapevine reference produced annotation 36,940 gene annotations for Dakapo. For Rubired, PacBio HiFi reads were assembled, scaffolded, and phased to generate a diploid assembly with two haplotypes 474.7-476.0 Mbp long. <i>De novo</i> annotation of the diploid Rubired genome yielded annotations for 56,681 genes. Both genomes are highly contiguous and complete. The Dakapo and Rubired genome assemblies provide genetic resources for investigations into berry flesh pigmentation and other traits of interest in grapevine.	0	contr
40066500	Who cares about the dying? - Unpacking integration of palliative care and oncology in the Danish context.	Integrating palliative care into the trajectories of patients with incurable cancer has been a priority for years. Yet, the intended outcomes of this integration remain elusive. Many patients with advanced cancer continue to receive so-called aggressive treatments in the end-of-life phase or miss out on specialised palliative care entirely. To examine this impasse in the Danish context, we employ the concept of <i>professional value scripts</i> to analyse policy documents and guidelines aimed at guiding professionals working with this patient group. The three identified scripts - cancer treatment, medical palliation and holistic palliative care - embody a distinct understanding of integration, contributing to the challenges of forging an integrated approach. We argue that the central role of the cancer treatment script in patient trajectories creates an obligatory passage point, influencing both the symbolic and practical enactment of integrated palliative care throughout these trajectories.	0	contr
40064377	The stability and elimination of mammalian enveloped and non-enveloped respiratory viruses in indoor air: Testing using a room-sized aerobiology chamber.	We assessed the viability of aerosolized human betacoronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43; ATCC VR-1558), human rhinovirus-14 (RV-14; ATCC VR-284) and feline calicivirus (FCV; ATCC VR-782) as representative enveloped and non-enveloped respiratory viruses of mammals in indoor air under ambient conditions (relative humidity 50±10% and air temperature 22±2°C) using a room-sized (25 m<sup>3</sup>; 900 ft<sup>3</sup>) aerobiology chamber. All virus suspensions contained a soil load to simulate the presence of body fluids and they were separately aerosolized into the chamber using a six-jet Collison nebulizer. A muffin fan was used to uniformly mix the air inside the chamber and to keep the aerosols airborne. A slit sampler with Petri plates containing 3% (wt./vol) gelatin was used to collect the air samples. The gelatin was liquefied in an incubator and assayed for infectious virus as plaque-forming units (PFU). The rates of biological decay of HCoV-OC43, RV-14 and FCV were 0.0052±0.00026, 0.0034±0.0027 and 0.0081±0.0031 (as log<sub>10</sub> PFU/m<sup>3</sup>/min), respectively. We also assessed a HEPA filter-based stand-alone air purifier against the experimentally aerosolized viruses and the device could demonstrate >3-log<sub>10</sub> reductions in the viability of the three viruses in 46, 62 and 41minutes, respectively. Therefore, we can now investigate the stability of mammalian viruses in indoor air as well as air decontamination technologies against them under field-relevant conditions.	0	contr
40064517	Microdroplet-Mediated Enzyme Activity Enhancement for Potentiometric Sensing of Peroxidase in Soil.	On-site measurements of enzyme activity in complex solid matrices such as soil and sediment could offer invaluable insights for the soil health evaluation and sustainable management. As such, sensors for on-site measurements of soil enzyme activity are highly required but remain unachieved to date. Herein, a potentiometric sensor for rapid, direct, and in-field analysis of soil enzyme activity is proposed, in which soil particle separation and soil enzyme extraction can be achieved within a single device. More importantly, the enzyme activity mediated by microdroplets can be greatly enhanced for potentiometric measurements. By using a classic soil redox enzyme-peroxidase and an anti-interference substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as a model, the potentiometric sensor enables directly measuring peroxidase activity in the field with a detection limit that can reach as low as 10<sup>-7</sup> U mL<sup>-1</sup> within 5 min. Moreover, the potentiometric sensor was deployed for on-site analysis of the peroxidase activity of <i>Suaeda salsa</i> (L.) Pall. rhizosphere soil under salinity stress, showing excellent sensitivity and anti-interference capability, and retaining promising potential for evaluating the mechanisms and feedback in response to environment stresses.	0	contr
40066659	Inhibition of HDAC4 in granulosa cells improved co-cultured oocyte maturation in vitro independent of LH in porcine.	In domestic animals, the mechanisms by which the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge induces oocyte meiosis resumption and maturation through follicular somatic cells remain unclear. Given the pivotal roles of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in regulating gametogenesis, this study investigated the roles of HDACs in follicular granulosa cells (GCs) in mediating LH action during oocyte maturation in pigs. The results showed that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) levels in cultured GCs increased in a time-dependent manner with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation but significantly decreased with LH treatment. The LH-induced reduction of HDAC4 was mediated by the accumulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which subsequently increased H3K18 acetylation and promoted the recruitment of SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) to the promoter of the EGF-like growth factor amphiregulin (Areg). Notably, specific inhibition of HDAC4 promoted oocyte maturation independently of LH in vitro, and the developmental potential of these matured oocytes was comparable to those induced by LH in vitro. In conclusion, HDAC4 in follicular somatic cells serves as a gonadotrophin-responsive epigenetic modification factor that negatively regulates oocyte meiosis resumption in pigs.	0	contr
40066091	Advances in targeting protein S-palmitoylation in tumor immunity and therapy.	S-palmitoylation is a reversible and dynamic post-translational modification of proteins. A palmitoyl group is covalently attached to a cysteine residue of the protein by a thioester link. It regulates the transcription and expression of downstream target genes and cell signaling, influencing cellular functions. Research indicates a substantial correlation between S-palmitoylation and tumorigenesis and immunotherapy, where it plays a pivotal role in modulating T cell activation, cytokine signaling, autophagy, phagocytosis, and death. Moreover, palmitoylation contributes to drug resistance and immunological evasion in tumor cells, enabling them to circumvent the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and immune surveillance. Inhibitors that target S-palmitoylation have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy, offering a novel strategy for cancer treatment. Nonetheless, obstacles such as inhibitor specificity and efficacy persist, requiring more extensive investigations into the exact mechanisms of S-palmitoylation to develop more effective targeted therapeutics. This article summarizes recent developments in S-palmitoylation concerning tumor immunity and treatment. The article examines the regulatory function of S-palmitoylation, its modifying enzymes in tumor cell signaling, and novel tumor immunotherapies that target S-palmitoylation.	0	contr
40065044	Transcriptome combined with single-cell sequencing explored prognostic markers associated with T cell exhaustion characteristics in head and neck squamous carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) ranks among the most prevalent cancers worldwide, characterized by significant heterogeneity and a complex immune microenvironment. T cell exhaustion is pivotal in the pathogenesis of HNSC, where depleted T cells exhibit reduced proliferative capacity and diminished effector function, facilitating tumor immune escape and subsequent disease progression. A thorough understanding of the primary mechanisms driving T cell depletion within the tumor microenvironment is essential for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches in HNSC, with profound implications for patient outcomes. In this study, a single-cell atlas of HNSC was constructed, enabling an in-depth analysis of T cell heterogeneity. The differentiation trajectory of T cells, transitioning from normal tissue to HNSC, was characterized, revealing a predisposition toward depletion in the C2 T cell subgroup. A subsequent cross-analysis of significantly upregulated differentially expressed genes in the C2 T cell subset identified five characteristics pertinent to T cell C2, which informed the development of a clinical prognostic model. Additionally, maximum half inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values for various pharmacological agents were calculated, leading to the identification of eleven drugs relevant to the risk model, providing an intriguing starting point for further work in personalized cancer treatment. However, certain limitations of this study must be acknowledged. While T cell heterogeneity and differentiation trajectories were mapped, the interrelationships among these subpopulations remain poorly understood. Further research is required to elucidate the specific biological processes and molecular evolutionary mechanisms involved. The insights from this study provide a valuable foundation for future investigations into the molecular mechanisms and immune landscape associated with the progression from normal tissue to malignant squamous cell carcinoma.	0	contr
40057982	The myb transcription factor PtoPHL3 positively regulates poplar resistance to canker disease caused by Dothiorella gregaria.	Diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms impair plant growth, leading to reduced crop yields. While the molecular mechanisms of plant disease response are well understood in annual herbaceous species, they remain largely unknown in perennial woody plants. Here, we found that PtoPHL3, a key transcription factor in poplar's phosphorus starvation response, showed significant expression changes after treatments with salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and inoculation of Dothiorella gregaria that causes poplar canker disease. Overexpressing PtoPHL3 conferred increased resistance to D. gregaria in transgenic poplar, while RNA interference-mediated knockdown made the plants more sensitive to the pathogen. DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) identified PtoPHL3-bound chromatin regions associated with disease response. Additionally, PtoPHL3 was found to bind the promoter of TGA6 and the gene body region of ERF5, upregulating their expression, which activates responses to D. gregaria, JA and SA. These findings deepen our understanding of the pathogen response process in poplar and lay a theoretical foundation for research on disease resistance mechanisms and the breeding of disease-resistant germplasm.	0	contr
40068964	Identification and functional characterization of silk fibroin genes in leaf-folding behaviour, silk properties and development of the rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (lepidoptera: Pyralidae).	Outbreaks of the rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) poses a significant threat to rice production. Silk-spinning creates an enclosed leaf roll that protects larvae from predators and insecticides, while serving as a feeding site and facilitating host transfer and leaf-folding. Disrupting this behaviour could enhance control strategies. The silk fibroin gene, essential for silk production, remains poorly understood in C. medinalis.	1	pest
40071128	Unlocking the potential of ecofriendly guardians for biological control of plant diseases, crop protection and production in sustainable agriculture.	Several beneficial microbial strains inhibit the growth of different phytopathogens and commercialized worldwide as biocontrol agents (BCAs) for plant disease management. These BCAs employ different strategies for growth inhibition of pathogens, which includes production of antibiotics, siderophores, lytic enzymes, bacteriocins, hydrogen cyanide, volatile organic compounds, biosurfactants and induction of systemic resistance. The efficacy of antagonistic strains could be further improved through genetic engineering for better disease suppression in sustainable farming practices. Some antagonistic microbial strains also possess plant-growth-promoting activities and their inoculation improved plant growth in addition to disease suppression. This review discusses the characterization of antagonistic microbes and their antimicrobial metabolites, and the application of these BCAs for disease control. The present review also provides a comprehensive summary of the genetic organization and regulation of the biosynthesis of different antimicrobial metabolites in antagonistic strains. Use of molecular engineering to improve production of metabolites in BCAs and their efficacy in disease control is also discussed. The application of these biopesticides will reduce use of conventional pesticides in disease control and help in achieving sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural systems.	1	pest
40066386	Allergen Immunotherapy in Autoimmune Terrain: A Case Study.	"Allergen immunotherapy (AIT), or specific immunotherapy (SIT), is an effective treatment for inducing immune tolerance to specific allergens. It is widely used for allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and Hymenoptera venom allergies, with recent applications to food allergies and atopic dermatitis. Despite its benefits, the use of SIT in patients with autoimmune diseases is controversial due to concerns about its potential to induce or exacerbate autoimmune conditions. This report examines a case of autoimmune hypothyroidism developing during AIT and the management decisions involved. A 26-year-old female with a history of moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis and childhood asthma presented with severe malaise, weakness, and fatigue over the past three months. She had a family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The patient had been on AIT for six months and was using intranasal fluticasone furoate nasal spray daily. Initial laboratory investigations prior to AIT showed normal thyroid function. Three months into AIT, she developed hypothyroidism, confirmed by elevated TSH levels and positive anti-TPO antibodies. A causality assessment suggested a ""possible"" link between AIT and hypothyroidism. However, a risk-benefit analysis favored the continuation of AIT along with the initiation of L-thyroxine therapy. After six months of thyroid hormone replacement, her TSH levels normalized, and her allergic rhinitis symptoms significantly improved. This case underscores the complexity of managing coexisting allergic and autoimmune conditions. The decision to continue AIT, despite the onset of hypothyroidism, was based on a thorough risk-benefit analysis, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment plans. Understanding the immunological mechanisms, particularly the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, is crucial. Neutrophils play a significant role as both effectors and modulators of immune responses. The clinical pharmacologist's recommendation was informed by these factors and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy. The continuation of AIT was justified by its benefits in managing allergic rhinitis and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone therapy. This case highlights the importance of personalized medicine and continuous monitoring in treatment decisions for patients with coexisting conditions."	0	contr

40056345	Impact of planned urban development on urban heat island effect: resilient cities for a sustainable future.	This comprehensive study delved into the urban dynamics of Bangalore and Hyderabad, focusing on land cover changes, temperature variations, and their implications for sustainable urban development. Analyzing land cover trends from 2001 to 2021, the study revealed substantial urban expansion in both cities, with notable shifts in built-up, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies. The analysis indicated intensified urbanization, particularly in Hyderabad, raising environmental concerns. The study employed a random forest model to predict contrasting urbanization patterns for 2031, emphasizing the need for resilient and sustainable strategies. The model successfully predicted land surface temperature (LST) and land cover changes, offering insights for informed urban planning. Correlation analyses unveil the influence of factors like proximity to bare soil and built-up areas on LST. The model's performance is robust, outperforming other models, and is employed for 2021 land cover (LC) and LST predictions. Validation demonstrates the model's accuracy in predicting LC distribution and LST across diverse land cover types, urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the model is applied to forecast 2031 LC and LST, revealing contrasting urbanization trends. The study incorporates a hot spot analysis, categorizing thermal zones and highlighting the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The model showcases a capacity to project long-term temperature dynamics, making it a valuable tool for urban planning and climate resilience. The findings underscore the need for sustainable land use planning, emphasizing environmental preservation amid rapid urban growth.	0	contr
40064848	Liver fibrosis negatively impacts in vivo gene transfer to murine hepatocytes.	Liver fibrosis occurs in several genetic and acquired disease conditions, leading to alterations of the tissue and metabolism, which may adversely affect viral vector-mediated gene therapy. Here, we assessed the impact of liver fibrosis on in vivo gene transfer to hepatocytes mediated by lentiviral vectors or adeno-associated viral vectors. We exploited two chemically induced fibrosis mouse models characterized by tissue damage in different areas of the liver lobule. Moreover, we used Abcb11<sup>-/-</sup> and Agl<sup>-/</sup><sup>-</sup> mice, recapitulating features of inherited cholestasis and glycogen storage disease, as representative models of genetic disorders characterized by liver fibrosis. We report a general negative influence of liver fibrosis on hepatocyte transduction and alteration of the vector distribution within the liver lobule, with different outcomes according to the viral vector used and the state of the liver at the time of vector administration. This study bears implications for future developments and applications of in vivo liver-directed gene therapy.	0	contr

40065040	Cloning and expression analysis of RhHsf24 gene in Rose (Rosa hybrida).	Rose (Rosa hybrida) is one of the most important ornamental and perfume industry crops worldwide, both economically and culturally. Abiotic stresses, such as high temperature and salt are crucial factors influencing the quality of roses. In this study, RhHsf24 was isolated from rose (R. hybrida 'Samantha'), which encodes 295 amino acids (aa). Sequence comparison with members of Arabidopsis Hsfs family revealed that this gene is most closely related to AtHsfB1; phylogenetic tree analysis with proteins from other species showed that it clusters with R. rugosa (RrHSF24), Fragaria vesca (FvHSFB1a) and Argentina anserina (AaHSF24), which are the closest relatives and belong to the class B heat shock transcription factors. RhHsf24 was localized in the nucleus. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the gene was expressed in roots, stems, leaves, flowers and buds. Expression analysis of the gene in leaves subjected to various temperatures and durations of heat stress treatment demonstrated that RhHsf24 gene expression is induced by heat stress. Under salt stress, the expression of the RhHsf24 gene generally exhibited a high level of expression with increasing concentration. The above results preliminarily clarified the biological function of RhHsf24, and provide a genetic resource and theoretical reference for the resistance breeding of roses.	0	contr

Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the orbit, associated with a range of potential clinical sequelae. Tumor cells in TED overexpress pro-angiogenic factors, driving the formation of heterogeneous and immature neovascularization. This dysregulated angiogenesis often leads to a hypoxic microenvironment due to insufficient perfusion. Despite its importance, the role of angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) in TED pathophysiology remains poorly understood.	0	contr
40060186	Plant metabolomics: applications and challenges in the era of multi-omics big data.	Plant metabolites are crucial for the growth, development, environmental adaptation, and nutritional quality of plants. Plant metabolomics, a key branch of systems biology, involves the comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the composition, variation, and functions of these metabolites. Advances in technology have transformed plant metabolomics into a sophisticated process involving sample collection, metabolite extraction, high-throughput analysis, data processing, and multidimensional statistical analysis. In today's era of big data, the field is witnessing an explosion in data acquisition, offering insight into the complexity and dynamics of plant metabolism. Moreover, multiple omics strategies can be integrated to reveal interactions and regulatory networks across different molecular levels, deepening our understanding of plant biological processes. In this review, we highlight recent advances and challenges in plant metabolomics, emphasizing the roles for this technique in improving crop varieties, enhancing nutritional value, and increasing stress resistance. We also explore the scientific foundations of plant metabolomics and its applications in medicine, and ecological conservation.	0	contr
40064874	Berberine-inspired ionizable lipid for self-structure stabilization and brain targeting delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics.	Lipid nanoparticles have shown success in targeting major organs such as the liver, spleen, and lungs, but crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major challenge. Effective brain-targeted delivery systems are essential for advancing gene therapy for neurological diseases but remain limited by low transport efficiency and poor nucleic acid stability. Here, we report a library of ionizable lipids based on the tetrahydroisoquinoline structure of protoberberine alkaloids, designed to improve BBB penetration via dopamine D3 receptor-mediated endocytosis. These nanoparticles offer three key advantages: enhanced brain uptake, improved nucleic acid stability through poly(A) self-assembly, and minimal immunogenicity with inherent neuroprotective properties. In murine models, they demonstrate therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease, glioma, and cryptococcal meningitis. This berberine-inspired delivery system integrates precise receptor targeting with nucleic acid stabilization, offering a promising platform for brain-targeted therapeutics.	0	contr
40065084	Protein disulfide isomerase is essential for osteoblast differentiation in mice.	Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an oxidoreductase responsible for the formation, reduction and isomerization of disulfide bonds of nascent proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). So far, the role of PDI in bone biology has never been characterized using genetically-modified animal models. In this study we generated osteoblast- specific PDI-deficient mice by crossing PDI-floxed (PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice with Osx-Cre mice. Compared with their littermate control PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, homozygous osteoblast-knockout mice (Osx-Cre/PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup>) were embryonically lethal, but heterozygous knockout mice (Osx-Cre/PDI<sup>fl/wt</sup>) displayed significantly pronounced growth retardation and reduced bone length. Besides, the decreases in bone density, osteoblast and osteoclast numbers, collagen fiber content and bone formation rate were observed in Osx-Cre/PDI<sup>fl/wt</sup> mice. Osteoblast precursors isolated from PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were infected with Cre recombinant adenovirus to produce PDI-deficient osteoblasts, followed by induction of differentiation. Osteoblasts deficient of PDI had decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralizing capacity, and differentiation. Quantitative protein mass spectrometry analysis and immunoblotting showed that PDI deficiency markedly decreased the expression of the α-subunits of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (C-P4H), including P4HA1, P4HA2 and P4HA3. These results demonstrate that PDI plays an essential role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation and is required for the expression of the α-subunit of C-P4H in osteoblasts.	0	contr
40056820	Matrix preparation and workflow for microplastics analysis in soil.	One of the main difficulties in microplastic (MP) research is the lack of standardized, real-world methods such as matrix blank and simultaneous tracking of polymer particles for enumeration. Building on a previous study, a matrix preparation and experimental workflow for soil matrices is presented that addresses the challenges of purification to allow subsequent analysis using Nile Red-stained MPs as a surrogate. Key steps include peroxide digestion and density separation (NaI) followed by centrifugation for low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surrogates to assess recoveries in terms of number and size, based on fluorescence microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The results yielded false positive recoveries greater than 100% for stained MPs and overall mean recovery around 80% for virgin MPs. Staining reflected the effect of pretreatment on the morphological and fluorescence characteristics of PE and PVC particles. An instrumental approach for fast Raman measurements is also presented, which facilitates counting up to 83%. Although particles down to 21 μm have been tested, this approach appears promising down to single microns due to its traceable and reliable nature for MP particles <300 μm in soil or terrestrial environments. In conclusion, the MP research community should strive to address small polymeric particles that pose an obstacle by agglomerating and interfering with particle-based quantification by spectroscopic techniques.	0	contr

40060187	<i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 biocontrol against potato common scab involves significant changes in the soil microbiome and metabolome.	Potato common scab (CS) is a worldwide disease, caused by <i>Streptomyces</i> spp., and its presence reduces the market value of potatoes. A nontoxic and potentially effective approach in many control strategies is the use of antagonistic microbes as biocontrol agents. In this study, <i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 was isolated and assessed for its ability to protect against CS. Through integrated metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, changes in the soil microbial community structure and soil properties were analyzed to understand the effects of <i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 on CS. These studies revealed that DX-9 inoculation could significantly decrease CS disease rate, disease index, and the number of CS pathogens, along with an increase in soil N and P content. Our metagenomic assays identified 102 phyla and 1154 genera, and DX-9 inoculation increased the relative abundances of the phyla Pseudomonadota, Chloroflexota and Gemmatimonadota. Additionally, an increase in the relative abundance of genera, such as <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, <i>Agrobacterium</i>, and <i>Nitrobacter</i>, were significantly and positively correlated with soil N and P. Metabolomic analysis revealed that DX-9 inoculation significantly increased the soil levels of phytolaccoside A, 7,8-dihydropteroic acid, novobiocin, and azafrin. These compounds were enriched in microbe pathway metabolites, including xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. In summary, the use of <i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 against potato CS offers an alternative biocontrol method that can improve both soil microbial community and properties. This study provides insight into the potential mechanisms by which microbial inoculants can control CS disease.	0	contr
40063098	Towards quality-assured measurements of microplastics in soil using fluorescence microscopy.	Fluorescence microscopy is increasingly seen as a fast, user-friendly, and high-throughput method for detecting microplastics (MPs) in soil; however, its effectiveness across diverse MP types and soil properties remains underexplored. This study tested a fluorescence microscopy-Nile red (NR) staining approach on eight MP types, covering both biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastics, in three size ranges (≤ 150 µm, 100-250 µm, 500-1000 µm) across loamy, clayey, and sandy soils. Each sample, processed in triplicate, underwent a relatively quick and straightforward extraction procedure involving density separation, organic digestion, and NR staining, followed by fluorescence and bright-field microscopy. A new digital image analysis pipeline using Image J was developed to expedite and (semi)automate MP quantification. Recoveries ranged from 80% to 90% for MPs with a Feret diameter of 500-1000 µm, regardless of soil type. In contrast, the recovery of smaller MPs (Feret dia. ≤ 250 µm) varied depending on the soils and plastic types: recoveries for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) reached 85% in sandy soil and 90% in loamy soil, whereas those for biodegradable polybutylene adipate terephthalate/polylactic acid (PBAT/PLA) were only 60% and 10%, respectively. The lowest recovery rate was observed in clayey soil and for biodegradable plastics. The method was tested on non-agricultural soil samples, yielding a MP mean number concentration of 20.7 ± 9.0 MPs/g for MPs sized from dia. ≥ 25 µm, comparable to Fourier transform infrared (FPA-µ-FTIR) results of 13.1 ± 7.3 MPs/g (p > 0.05). We conclude that fluorescence microscopy with NR staining and automated particle quantification offers a time-efficient, reproducible, and accurate method for MP detection in light-textured soils, whereas limitations remain for reliable MP analysis in clay-dominated soils.	0	contr

We examine practices at each stage of the research lifecycle, including study design, conduct, and publishing, that can be optimised to facilitate the conduct of timely, accurate, and comprehensive evidence synthesis. These practices are anchored in open science and engaging with the broader research community to ensure evidence is accessible and useful to all stakeholders. We underscore the need for collective action from researchers, synthesis specialists, institutions, publishers and journals, funders, infrastructure providers, and policymakers, who all play a key role in fostering an open, robust and synthesis-ready research environment, for an accelerated trajectory towards integrated biomedical research and translation.	0	contr
40066429	Pterygopalatine Fossa- A Keystone Area in Disease Progression and Management in Rhino-Oculo-Cerebral Mucormycosis.	To analyze the involvement of disease in pterygopalatine fossa (PPF), its relation to regional extension of disease and the treatment outcome in rhino-oculo-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM). A prospective study was done including 50 patients diagnosed with ROCM. All patients were examined and evaluated with high resolution CT and MRI imaging. Intravenous liposomal Amphotericin B was started, and endoscopic debridement was done based on the disease extension. Liposomal Amphotericin B is given until complete response for atleast a total dose of 3-4 g. T. Posaconasole 300 mg is given for 3-4 months in case of orbital or intracranial disease. 58% (29) patients showed involvement of disease in PPF. In MRI T1 contrast images, 21 of these patients showed hypo-intense lesion in the PPF and had necrotic tissue in PPF during surgery. Whereas, hyper-intense lesion that depicts inflammatory tissue was seen in the 8 patients. The tissue from these lesions showed aseptate fungal hyphae elements in histopathology in all these patients. 96% of patients with orbital mucormycosis (25 patients), 92% of patients with palatal mucormycosis (24 patients) and all patients with intracranial (15 patients) involvement had correlating PPF involvement in the disease process. The pterygopalatine fossa is the nidus for spread of disease and an important prognostic factor for extent of spread. Radiological imaging with CT and MRI are useful to assess the involvement of disease in PPF, and it is important to remove this disease during endoscopic debridement.	0	contr
40066230	Sleep Disorders: Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Interventions.	Sleep disorder significantly disrupts the quality of life for patients. Although it is clinically acknowledged, the fundamental neuropathological mechanisms are still not understood. Recent preclinical research has been directed toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the sleep deprivation and sleep/wake dysregulation. Sleep disorder is linked to changes in the structure and function of the neural basis of cognition. We reviewed the neural circuits related to sleep disorders, along with alterations in connectivity and brain region functions, based on advancements in electrophysiology and optogenetic/chemogenetic techniques. We subsequently outline the cellular and molecular modifications linked to sleep disorders in preclinical studies, primarily involving changes in neuronal metabolism, electrophysiological activity, synaptic plasticity, and glial cells. Correspondingly, on the basis of the crosstalk between the brain and peripheral organs, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the involvement of celiac disease and hepatic disease in the pathogenesis of sleep disorders. In this review, we mainly discussed the pathogenesis at molecular, cellular, and neural circuit levels that contribute to sleep disorder.

Gastric cancer (GC) is a prevalent malignant tumor that originates from the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa, predominantly in the form of adenocarcinoma. Extensive research has confirmed the significant role of autophagy in the initiation, progression, and chemoresistance of GC. The potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to exert anti-tumor effects by modulating autophagy has been demonstrated, particularly in the context of GC prevention and treatment. Natural products (NPs) have great therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of GC by targeting autophagy-related genes and signaling pathways to intervene in the biological behaviors of gastric cancer cells such as proliferation, metastasis, invasion and death. This article describes the molecular mechanisms and key markers of tumor autophagy, the signaling pathways involved in GC-associated autophagy (PI3K/AKT/mTOR, AMPK, MAPK, p53), and summarizes the mechanism of autophagy and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection in GC, how autophagy interacts with apoptotic and iron-death processes and the wide-ranging influences that these factors play in the process. Finally, this paper systematically summarizes the natural compounds of terpenoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, saponins, and polysaccharides that modulate autophagy-related signaling pathways and potential targets for the treatment of GC, and evaluates the toxic effects of NPs, providing a more compelling rationale and direction for GC therapy.	0	contr
40064681	Assessment of L-cysteine Reductase Activity as an Indicator of Soil Health in Different Climatic Zones After Pollution by Oil.	The sulfur cycle in the soil regulates many vital processes in plants since it enters the composition of amino acids, vitamins, phytochelatins, and other substances. Soils of different climatic zones have different physicochemical properties and sulfur reserves, which, therefore, stipulates various activities of soil enzymes. The aim of the study was the assessment of L-cysteine reductase activity as an indicator of soil health in different climatic zones after oil pollution: semi-desert types, steppe types and forest types of soils. A model experiment was based on the pollution of 12 types of soil by oil (1%, 5%, and 10%) followed by the determination of the L-cysteine reductase activity in the soils after 30 days from the start of the experiment. The highest activity of L-cysteine ​​reductase in soils contaminated with oil was found in semi-desert (Haplic Solonchaks Aridic, Haplic Kastanozems Chromic) and forest (Luvic Phaeozems Albic and Luvic Stagnosols Dystric (Illuvial-Ferrugenous)) soils. The greatest sensitivity and informative content by oil pollution, assessed by the activity of L-cysteine reductase, were found in Haplic Kastanozems Chromic (semi-desert types of soils), Voronic Chernozems Pachic (ordinary) and Luvic Phaeozems Albic (steppe types of soils) and Luvic Stagnosols Dystric and Luvic Stagnosols Dystric (Illuvial-Ferrugenous) (forest types of soil). The results obtained can be used in diagnosing and assessing the ecological state and health of soils contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons.	0	contr
40066451	The role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification during macrophage metabolic reprogramming in human diseases and animal models.	Macrophage metabolic reprogramming refers to the process by which macrophages adjust their physiological pathways to meet survival and functional demands in different immune microenvironments. This involves a range of metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and cholesterol transport. By modulating the expression and activity of key enzymes and molecules within these pathways, macrophages can make the transition between pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes, thereby linking metabolic reprogramming to inflammatory responses and the progression of several diseases, such as atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and acute lung injury (ALI). N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification has emerged as a critical regulatory mechanism during macrophage metabolic reprogramming, broadly affecting RNA stability, translation, and degradation. Therapeutic strategies targeting m<sup>6</sup>A modification can regulate the onset of metabolic diseases by influencing macrophage metabolic changes, for instance, small molecule inhibitors of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) can affect glucose metabolism and inhibit IBD. This review systematically explores recent findings on the role and molecular mechanisms of m<sup>6</sup>A modification during macrophage metabolic reprogramming in human diseases and animal models, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.	0	contr
40062713	Wheat MAPK cascade mediates SGT1 nuclear entry targeted by a stripe rust effector.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a fundamental role in plant immunity by transducing external signals inside plant cells. Here, we defined a wheat MAPK cascade, composed of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) TaMKK2 and its downstream MAPK TaMAPK6, which phosphorylates the core immune regulator TaSGT1 (suppressor of G2 allele of Skp1), resulting in enhanced nuclear entry of TaSGT1, thereby conferring resistance against the devastating wheat pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Hence, we identified a TaMKK2-TaMAPK6-TaSGT1 signaling cascade that contributes to wheat stripe rust resistance. During infection, Pst secrets a haustorium-associated secreted protein 215 (HASP215), that targets TaMKK2 and interferes with the interaction of TaMKK2 with TaMAPK6 to suppress TaMAPK6 phosphorylation and activation, thereby leading to reduced capacity of TaMAPK6 to phosphorylate TaSGT1. Consequently, inhibition of TaMAPK6-mediated TaSGT1 phosphorylation resulted in decreased nuclear translocation of TaSGT1 and suppressed plant immunity. Our work elucidates the positive function of TaMKK2-TaMAPK6 cascade in wheat immunity by regulating the immune component TaSGT1, and its regulation by the rust effector HASP215, providing new insights into the MAPK cascade on crop immunity and the pathogenicity mechanism of obligate biotrophic fungus.	0	contr
40065427	A review of cerebrospinal fluid circulation with respect to Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia in brachycephalic dogs.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis by facilitating the clearance of metabolic waste and regulating intracranial pressure. Dysregulation of CSF flow can lead to conditions like syringomyelia, and hydrocephalus. This review details the anatomy of CSF flow, examining its contribution to waste clearance within the brain and spinal cord. The review integrates data from human, canine, and other mammalian studies, with a particular focus on brachycephalic dogs. Certain dog breeds exhibit a high prevalence of CSF-related conditions due to artificial selection for neotenous traits, making them valuable models for studying analogous human conditions, such as Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia associated with craniosynostosis. This review discusses the anatomical features specific to some brachycephalic breeds and the impact of skull and cranial cervical conformation on CSF flow patterns, providing insights into the pathophysiology and potential modelling approaches for these conditions.	0	contr

During a public health emergency, such as the widespread transmission of COVID-19 following loosened COVID-19 policies in China, people's mental health is impacted along with their physical well-being. In order to investigate ways to mitigate these negative effects, this study examined how dispositional awe can predict mental health outcomes during such emergencies using a three-wave longitudinal design. Five hundred twenty seven participants (mean age = 21.18, SD = 3.39; 368 males) took part in the study within the first 2 months after the implementation of loosened COVID-19 policies, with one-month intervals between waves. Cross-lagged analysis revealed that dispositional awe in Wave 1 significantly predicted higher positive and lower negative interpretation bias in Wave 2, which in turn promoted positive mental functioning in Wave 3. Furthermore, negative interpretation bias in Wave 2 acted as a mediator for the predictive role of dispositional awe in Wave 1 on psychosomatic symptoms in Wave 3. These findings suggest that dispositional awe can act as a protective factor for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic by influencing people's interpretation orientation.	0	contr

40056359	Rice grain size: current regulatory mechanisms and future perspectives.	Rice is a staple food for over half of the world's population. To feed the growing population, molecular breeders aim to increase grain yield. Grain size is an important factor for crop productivity, and it has been extensively studied. However, molecular breeders face a major challenge in further improving crop productivity in terms of grain yield and quality. Grain size is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes. Over the past few decades, genetic studies have identified various gene families involved in grain size development. The list of molecular mechanisms, and key regulators involved in grain size development is constantly expanding, making it difficult to understand the main regulators that play crucial roles in grain development. In this review, we focus on the major regulators of grain size, including G-protein signaling, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, transcriptional regulation, the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation (UPD) pathway, and phytohormone signaling. These molecular mechanisms directly or indirectly regulate grain size. We provided a comprehensive understanding of the genes involved in these mechanisms and cross discussions about how these mechanisms are interlinked. This review serves as a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern grain development and can aid in the development of molecular breeding strategies.	0	contr
40073671	Novel fluorescence-based and portable detection platforms using nitrogen-doped carbon dots for environmental monitoring of dichloran fungicide.	A novel fluorescence sensor utilizing label-free nitrogen self-doped carbon dots (NCDs) was developed for the sensitive, selective, and rapid determination of dichloran fungicide, popularly used in agricultural and horticultural fields. The NCDs were prepared from maleic anhydride and diethylenetriamine via a one-step pyrolysis process. They demonstrated strong blue fluorescence emission with a quantum yield of 12 %. With the addition of dichloran, the fluorescence emission of NCDs was quenched, attributed to the inner filter effect and dynamic quenching. They demonstrated outstanding sensitivity to dichloran with a linear range between 1.0 and 50.0 µM and a remarkably low detection limit of 7.6 nM, the best reported date. The sensing process could be repeatedly and rapidly generated within 30 s. Additionally, the NCDs exhibited selectivity towards dichloran amidst interferences, including common metal ions, organic chemicals, and other fungicides. The detection of dichloran in carrots, grapes, and drinking water was successfully accomplished using NCDs, yielding satisfactory recovery results ranging between 95.1 and 108.7 %. Moreover, a paper-based sensor based on NCDs as sensing probes was demonstrated to observe the fluorescence quenching towards dichloran, with a detection limit of 4.24 µM. It also showed high efficacy in distinguishing and selectively detecting dichloran against interferences. Therefore, this work contributes to the development of efficient and portable detection platforms with applications in environmental monitoring and agricultural fields.	1	pest

40052202	Timescale Matters: Finer Temporal Resolution Influences Driver Contributions to Global Soil Respiration.	Understanding the dynamics of soil respiration (R<sub>s</sub>) and its environmental drivers is crucial for accurately modeling terrestrial carbon fluxes. However, current methodologies often lead to divergent estimates and rely on annual predictions that may overlook critical interactions occurring at seasonal scales. A critical knowledge gap lies in understanding how temporal resolution affects both R<sub>s</sub> predictions and their environmental drivers. Here, we employ deep learning models to predict global R<sub>s</sub> at monthly (MRM) and annual (ARM) scales from 1982 to 2018. We then consider three main drivers potentially affecting R<sub>s</sub>, including temperature, precipitation, and a vegetation proxy (leaf area index; LAI). Our models demonstrate strong predictive capabilities with global R<sub>s</sub> estimation of 79.4 ± 5.7 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> for the MRM and 78.3 ± 7.5 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> for ARM (mean ± SD). While the difference in global estimations between both models is small, there are notable disparities in the spatial contribution of dominant drivers. The MRM highlights an influence of both temperature and LAI, while the ARM emphasizes a dominant role of precipitation. These findings underscore the critical role of temporal resolution in capturing seasonal variations and identifying key R<sub>s</sub>-environment relationships that annual models may obscure. High temporal resolution R<sub>s</sub> predictions, such as those provided by the MRM, are essential for capturing nuanced seasonal interactions between R<sub>s</sub> and its drivers, refining carbon flux models, detecting critical seasonal thresholds, and enhancing the reliability of future Earth system predictions. This work highlights the need for further research into monthly and seasonal R<sub>s</sub> variations, as well as higher timescale resolutions, to advance our understanding of ecosystem carbon dynamics in a rapidly changing climate.	0	contr

40058201	Quantification of microplastics in agricultural soils by total organic carbon -solid sample combustion analysis.	Accurate quantification of microplastics (MPs) in soils is a significant challenge due to the complex nature of the organo-mineral matrix. Fine mineral particles and organic matter often interfere with the efficiency of extraction, identification and quantification of MPs from soils. Here, an optimized MP extraction and quantification method is proposed, using total organic carbon analyser-solid sample combustion unit (TOC-SSM) analysis. The approach entails a field survey, digestion of organic matter by Piranha solution, density separation, and quantification. This method achieves a high total recovery rate of 97.39 ± 14.25 (SE) % for particles sized between 300 and 600 µm, and 94.80 ± 13.48 (SE) % for particles less than 300 µm with spiked soil as samples. The optimised method is then applied to strawberry farm soils that use plastic mulch films to quantify MP contamination levels. Our results indicate MP concentrations of 12.24 ± 3.65 (SE) mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (for particles of 300-2000 µm in size) and 2.62 ± 0.66 (SE) mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (for particles smaller than 300 µm). With improved simplicity and the ability to provide the actual weight of plastics for the extraction and quantification of MPs, this work offers a potential approach for assessing low-density plastics in the northeastern Australian agricultural soils with a dominant MP contamination, specifically polyethylene (PE).	0	contr

We explored breast cancer stem cell diversity and establish a methodology for selectively culturing breast cancer stem cells. We collected breast cancer tissues from surgical samples of treatment-naïve patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Following isolation, cells were subjected to spheroid culture on non-adherent plates. Of the 57 cases, successful culture was achieved in 48 cases, among which the average ratio of CD44+/CD24- breast cancer cells increased from 13.8% in primary tumors to 61.6% in spheroids. A modest number of spheroid cells successfully engrafted in mice and subsequently re-differentiated within the murine environment, confirming their stemness. ER expression in spheroid cells exhibited negative conversion in 52.1% of cases. The proportion of Twist-, Snail-, and Vimentin-positive cells increased from 43.8%, 12.9%, and 7.7-75.0%, 58.1%, and 37.7%, respectively. ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer stem cells were classified into two groups using DNA microarrays. Gene Ontology analysis unveiled higher expression of immune response-related genes in one group and protein binding-associated genes in the other. We demonstrated stable and selective culture of breast cancer stem cells from patient-derived breast cancer tissue using spheroid cultures.	0	contr

40065364	Fidgetin-like 2 knockdown increases acute neuroinflammation and improves recovery in a rat model of spinal cord injury.	Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause permanent dysfunction proceeding from multifaceted neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to damage and repair. Fidgetin-like 2 (FL2), a microtubule-severing enzyme that negatively regulates axon growth, microglial functions, and wound healing, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for central nervous system injuries and neuroinflammation. To test the hypothesis that FL2 knockdown increases acute neuroinflammation and improves recovery after SCI, we examined the effects of nanoparticle-encapsulated FL2 siRNA treatment after a moderate contusion SCI in rats. SCI significantly increased FL2 expression in the lesion site and rostral to the lesion 1 day post-injury (dpi). A single treatment of FL2 siRNA after injury led to modestly improved locomotor recovery consistent with the preservation of corticospinal tract function, accompanied by reduced inflammation and increased presence of oligodendrocytes. In determining the acute effects of treatment, RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that FL2 siRNA modulates early cellular responses, including chemokine signaling, both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune reactions, and neurotransmitter signaling pathways at 1, 4, and 7 dpi. Follow-up analyses at 4 dpi using dual in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that SCI increased FL2 mRNA and that FL2 was colocalized with microglia/macrophages. FL2 downregulation resulted in a marked accumulation of microglia at the lesion site, accompanied by increased inflammatory markers (IL-1β, TGF-β1, and CD68). The results suggest SCI induces an increase in FL2 expression that undermines acute inflammatory responses as well as spinal cord integrity and growth. Overall, our study suggests that targeting FL2 holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for treating SCI.	0	contr

40064078	Environmental determinants of spatial-temporal variability in ammonia oxidizing microorganisms across diverse Chinese agricultural soils.	Numerous studies investigated the variation of soil ammonia oxidizing microorganisms along the geographic distance, but few highlighted the associated influence of agricultural practices on ammonia oxidizing communities and functions. To make up this gap, we determined the variation of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacteria (AOB), and soil nitrification within eight typical agricultural plots across China. The current study revealed significant variations in soil potential nitrification rates (PNRs) and the diversity and composition of AOA and AOB communities across various plots. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant link between soil PNRs and alpha diversity, specific AOA and AOB taxa, but no significant correlation was found with amoA gene abundance. Structural equation modeling and canonical correspondence analysis showed that factors like MAT, clay content, CEC, and soil carbon and nitrogen levels significantly influenced the diversity and composition of AOA. In contrast, AOB were more significantly impacted by soil pH and carbon- and nitrogen-related nutrients, but less associated with MAP and soil clay content. Notably, soil PNRs were found to be closely linked to AOB diversity, soil pH, and ammonium nitrogen (NH4N) levels. This research highlights the contributing role of AOB group in soil nitrification and the related driving factors from agricultural practices.	0	contr

Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in plant nutrient supply and soil physical, chemical, and biological function regulation. Factors such as climate change, human activities, and farm management practices can adversely affect SOC. Here, paddy soil in the double-cropping rice area of Hunan Province of China was cultured with eight kinds of organic materials, and the effects of organic fertilization on SOC content, humus content, and soil carbon sequestration efficiency were analyzed. The addition of straw, green fertilizer, and organic fertilizer had a positive influence on active SOC content. Straw addition had the most prolonged impact on soil microbial biomass carbon content, and green manure had the most rapid influence on soil dissolved organic carbon content. All organic materials enhanced the soil humus content; furthermore, the addition of organic fertilizers significantly improved the carbon sequestration efficiency among all treatments. The results of controlled culture experiments in paddy soils established that applying organic materials can increase SOC content, active carbon components, soil humus content, and the carbon fixation rate, thereby improving soil fertility. This study provides a theoretical basis for the optimal fertilization of paddy soil with organic material addition in China.	0	contr

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard of care for locally advanced breast cancer, but the response to chemotherapy is unpredictable due to unknown information on the tumor drug sensitivity. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have recently been revealed to be a promising platform for assessing drug sensitivity in many cancers. A 46-year-old woman presented to the hospital due to an accidentally discovered mass in the left breast. Based on core-needle biopsies, pathologic examination showed invasive breast cancer in both breasts. In combination with immunohistochemistry, the patient was diagnosed with left breast cancer IIB with axillary lymphatic metastasis and right breast cancer IIA. The NAC with albumin-bound paclitaxel, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide was used. Although partial response was assessed overall, the left tumor did not lessen significantly; thus, organoids from bilateral breasts were cultured. After treatment with PDO-sensitive vinorelbine and carboplatin, partial response was achieved in the left compared with the initial tumor. Meanwhile, bilateral mastectomy was performed successfully, with pathological complete response achieved in the right. This typical case suggests that the PDOs from bilateral primary breast cancers can serve as a powerful tool to identify the sensitivity to NAC, thus providing novel treatment options at the patient-specific level.	0	contr

40066117	The Application of Machine Learning in Predicting the Permeability of Drugs Across the Blood Brain Barrier.	The inefficiency of some medications to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is often attributed to their poor physicochemical or pharmacokinetic properties. Recent studies have demonstrated promising outcomes using machine learning algorithms to predict drug permeability across the BBB. In light of these findings, our study was conducted to explore the potential of machine learning in predicting the permeability of drugs across the BBB. We utilized the B3DB dataset, a comprehensive BBB permeability molecular database, to build machine learning models. The dataset comprises 7,807 molecules, including information on their permeability, stereochemistry, and physicochemical properties. After preprocessing and cleaning, various machine learning algorithms were implemented using the Python library Pycaret to predict permeability. The extra trees classifier model outperformed others when using Morgan fingerprints and Mordred chemical descriptors (MCDs), achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 and 0.95 on the test dataset. Additionally, we conducted an experiment to train a voting classifier combining the top three performing models. The best-blended model, trained on MCDs, achieved an AUC of 0.96. Furthermore, Shapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was applied to our best-performing single model, the extra trees classifier trained on MCDs, identifying the Lipinski rule of five as the most significant feature in predicting BBB permeability. In conclusion, our combined model trained on MCDs achieved an AUC of 0.96, an F1 Score of 0.91, and an MCC of 0.74. These results are consistent with prior studies on CNS drug permeability, highlighting the potential of machine learning in this domain.	0	contr

A diabetic wound is the most frequent form of chronic wound. Because diabetic wounds have multiple factors contributing to their development, the best treatments involve using a combination of approaches. Herein we assessed whether bioactive and degradable bioengineered micro-porous collagen-based three-dimensional scaffold (CTS) encapsulated with adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs)-derived exosomes could accelerate the wound healing process in diabetic rats. Diabetic animals were assigned to the control group, CTS group, Exo group, and CTS+Exo group. Tissue samples were collected on days 7, 14, and 21 for evaluations including stereological, molecular, and tensiometrical assessments. The findings showed that in the treatment groups, there was a notably increase in wound closure rate, total volumes of newly formed epidermis and dermis, numerical densities of fibroblasts and blood vessels, collagen density, and biomechanical parameters than the control group, with the most noticeable changes seen in the CTS+Exo group. Additionally, there was a notably increase in the transcript of miRNA-146a, TGF-β, bFGF, and VEGF genes in the treatment groups than the control group, with the highest expression observed in the CTS+Exo group. In the CTS+Exo group, there was a much greater decrease in TNF-α and IL-1β expression, as well as in the number of neutrophils, compared to the other groups. These results validated that the combination of CTS and ASCs-derived exosomes has a greater effect on improving diabetic wound healing.	0	contr
40066509	Harnessing Lithiophilic Hetero-Interfacial Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries with Low Negative/Positive Capacity Ratios.	Lithium (Li) metal batteries hold great promise for next-generation energy storage due to their high energy density. However, their application is hindered by uncontrollable Li plating/stripping, leading to limited cycle life, especially under practical conditions with a low negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratio. Here, it is demonstrated that stable cycling of low N/P ratio Li metal batteries can be realized by harnessing hetero-interfacial redox chemistry to regulate Li nucleation and deposition behavior. It is shown that replacing pure Li metal with intercalated Li in graphite facilitates the formation of an increasingly lithiophilic heterointerface upon discharge, which homogenizes Li deposition during subsequent charge, resulting in highly reversible Li plating/stripping with minimal active Li loss under lean Li conditions. This enables Li metal cells with a Li/graphite hybrid anode to demonstrate remarkable improvements in cycling life, even with an N/P ratio as low as 0.4, compared to those with a pure Li metal anode. This strategy provides new insights into the role of hetero-interfacial chemistry in constructing highly reversible composite anodes for high-energy and long-cycling Li metal batteries.	0	contr
40056864	Unlocking the potential of Eudrilus eugeniae in mitigating the pollution risk of pesticides and heavy metals: Fostering machine learning tactics to optimize environmental health.	Agro-industrial waste management remains a critical challenge in sustainable development, particularly due to contamination with heterogeneous micropollutants such as heavy metals (HMs), pesticides, and polyphenols. This study explores an innovative vermistabilization approach using pineapple pomace (PP) to enhance the bioremediation of paper mill sludge (PMS) facilitated by Eudrilus eugeniae. The research demonstrates that the contrasting pH profiles of PMS (a highly alkaline substrate) and PP (a highly acidic substrate) have significantly contributed to nutrient enhancement and stabilization of end products for the mixed feedstock treatments (PP and PMS-based feedstocks) compared to the feedstock treatments in isolations. Results demonstrated a 2.1 fold increase in earthworm population density, and 4-5 fold reduction in organic carbon content confirming its effectiveness of biostabilization in a heterogeneous feed mixture. Vermicomposting enhanced nutrient availability (N, P, K) and microbial metabolic activity by 3-5 folds. Amongst tested ratios, PP + PMS + cowdung (CD) (1:2:1) achieved optimal remediation, reducing HMs (Cd, Pb, Zn, Hg, Ni, Cu, Cr), pesticides (chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, carbofuran), and polyphenols by 8-9 folds. Integration of Artificial Neural Networks coupled with Sobol sensitivity analysis also identified PP + PMS + CD(1:2:1) as the most effective combination in minimizing potential health risks. Furthermore, Taylor plot analysis determined the best-fit model for predicting health risks associated with various PP and PMS-based complex systems. The findings underscored the potential of utilizing PP along with PMS based feedstock for mitigating pollutants whilst simultaneously enhancing nutrient recovery during vermicomposting. Thus, the machine learning techniques could facilitate the optimization of feedstock compositions, advancing large-scale vermistabilization as a sustainable strategy for agro-industrial waste management.	1	pest
40056346	Acaricides in agriculture: balancing livestock health and environmental well-being in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya.	Extensive use of chemicals in food production, although useful, has profound implications. Acaricides, extensively used to control ticks and mites in livestock farming, can leave harmful residues that pose risks to unintended organisms such as plants, insects, people, and other animals. Thus, limiting non-target exposure to acaricides is critical. This study is aimed at assessing acaricide knowledge, use, and disposal methods among farmers and agrochemical dealers in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya, which is well-known for livestock farming. A purposive survey of stakeholders, including 100 farmers and 45 agrochemical shop attendants, revealed concerning practices. The findings revealed insufficient personal protection during acaricide application, with a minority of responders using gloves (33%), safety goggles (0%), masks (42%), or overalls (51%) for agrochemical dealers and gloves (8%), overalls (48%), safety goggles (2%), and masks (28%) for farmers. Furthermore, used acaricide containers and residues were not properly disposed of after spraying, potentially contaminating water sources, soil, and plants. Insects, particularly bees and house flies, were spotted consuming leftovers from unprotected disposal sites, entering food webs. Furthermore, animal drying sections in spraying regions included grass, allowing animals to ingest residues. Recommendations include improved acaricide monitoring and management by extension field staff and educating farmers and pesticide dealers about health concerns, proper disposal techniques, and the importance of wearing personal protective equipment. A regulation requiring agrochemical dealers to sell acaricides together with protective gear is recommended to limit dangers effectively.	0	contr
40066319	Impact of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Cognitive Outcomes in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by a set of deficits not limited to social communication, which is restricted and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of autism has been seen to be consistently increasing globally. Autism is multifactorial in its etiology, and it involves several physiological systems, including the central nervous system and the gut-brain axis. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for neural development and functionality, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). They both play a crucial role in not only reducing the neuroinflammation associated with autism but also supporting cognitive processing as well. Given the low levels of omega-3 noted in ASD individuals, this systematic review aims to assess the influence of omega-3 supplementation on cognitive outcomes in children with ASD. The systematic review was done following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, where different databases were assessed across PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Scopus. MeSH terms used included keywords ""Omega-3"", ""EPA"", ""DHA"" AND ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"" OR ""ASD"". Articles published between 2007 and 2023 that focused on ages 2 to 18 years were screened, and cognitive outcomes relevant to omega-3 supplementation were included. Studies with inadequate access to full text excluded non-human trials and older individuals. After generating 25,312 articles, 211 were selected for further review, with 11 meeting the inclusion criteria. The articles reviewed panned over five different countries that involved omega-3 supplementation lasting up to one year. Results suggested that DHA and EPA supplementation may improve cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and executive functioning in children with ASD. The prefrontal cortex development was associated with DHA supplementation, whereas EPA showed improved emotional regulation and reduced neuroinflammation. However, conclusive results were not reached as there was variability in study designs, different dosages, and assessment methods. The power of the studies conducted was also noted to be limited. While promising, extensive research and trials are required to standardize the dosage of omega-3 and the length of intervention. Future studies should aim to identify the long-term effects of omega-3 supplementation, understand the gut-brain axis, and investigate the combination of omega-3 with other therapies to improve cognitive functioning."	0	contr
40066107	Exploring functional connectivity in clinical and data-driven groups of preterm and term adults.	Adults born very preterm (i.e. at <33 weeks' gestation) are more susceptible to long-lasting structural and functional brain alterations and cognitive and socio-emotional difficulties, compared with full-term controls. However, behavioural heterogeneity within very preterm and full-term individuals makes it challenging to find biomarkers of specific outcomes. To address these questions, we parsed brain-behaviour heterogeneity in participants subdivided according to their clinical birth status (very preterm versus full term) and/or data-driven behavioural phenotype (regardless of birth status). Participants were followed-up in adulthood (median age 30 years) as part of a wider longitudinal case-control cohort study. The Network Based Statistic approach was used to identify topological components of resting state functional connectivity differentiating between (i) 116 very preterm and 83 full-term adults (43% and 57% female, respectively) and (ii) data-driven behavioural subgroups identified using consensus clustering (<i>n</i> = 156, 46% female). Age, sex, socio-economic status and in-scanner head motion were used as confounders in all analyses. <i>Post hoc</i> two-way group interactions between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels explored whether functional connectivity differences between very preterm and full-term adults varied according to distinct behavioural outcomes. Very preterm compared with full-term adults had poorer scores in selective measures of cognitive and socio-emotional processing and displayed complex patterns of hyper- and hypo-connectivity in sub-sections of the default mode, visual and ventral attention networks. Stratifying the study participants in terms of their behavioural profiles (irrespective of birth status) identified two data-driven subgroups: an 'At-Risk' subgroup, characterized by increased cognitive, mental health and socio-emotional difficulties, displaying hypo-connectivity anchored in frontal opercular and insular regions, relative to a 'Resilient' subgroup with more favourable outcomes. No significant interaction was noted between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels in terms of functional connectivity. Functional connectivity differentiating between very preterm and full-term adults was dissimilar to functional connectivity differentiating between the data-driven behavioural subgroups. We speculate that functional connectivity alterations observed in very preterm relative to full-term adults may confer both risk and resilience to developing behavioural sequelae associated with very preterm birth, while the localized functional connectivity alterations seen in the 'At-Risk' subgroup relative to the 'Resilient' subgroup may underlie less favourable behavioural outcomes in adulthood, irrespective of birth status.	0	contr
40060868	Risk Assessment of Mercury in Soil, Water, and Sediments Collected in a Region Impacted by Gold Mining.	This work reports the determination of mercury and the assessment of health risks in water, river sediments, and soil samples collected in the city of <i>Jacobina</i>, Brazil, located in a region impacted by gold mining. The mercury determinations were performed using the direct method analyzer (DMA) method, which was carefully validated according to the IUPAC recommendations. Total mercury contents ranged from 0.10 to 1.77 μg L<sup>-1</sup> in water samples, from 0.005 to 0.278 μg g<sup>-1</sup> in soil samples, and from 0.014 to 0.317 μg g<sup>-1</sup> in river sediment samples. The contamination factor (CF) and the ecological risk index were applied to the data obtained from soil and sediment analyses. Only one of the twenty-one soil samples had CF > 1 (1.11), denoting moderate contamination for this sampled site. All 20 other samples had CF < 1 (0.02 to 0.69), showing low mercury contamination in the soils collected throughout <i>Jacobina</i>. The results of the ecological risk index perfectly corroborated the results found by the CF, denoting that only one sample had a moderate potential ecological risk. Among the 13 sediment samples, two had CF > 1 and Er in the range of 40 to 80, denoting moderate contamination and moderate ecological risk in these two sampled locations. All 11 other samples had CF < 1 and Er less than 40, demonstrating that the sediments analyzed have low contamination and low potential for ecological risk due to mercury. All mercury levels found in water samples are below the maximum limit (2 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) established by the CONAMA, the Brazilian Government, for class 3 freshwater. The assessment of daily mercury exposure was also performed using the routes of exposure through dermal contact (ADIder), inhalation (ADIinh), ingestion (ADIing) in the soil samples, and dermal contact and ingestion in the water samples employing the health risk indices established by the USEPA. The results obtained did not indicate noncarcinogenic risks for adults and children.	0	contr
40066425	Global Prevalence of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has increased worldwide in recent years, becoming a significant public health concern. One of the most important complications experienced by individuals with OSA is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). This study aims to investigate the prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, and the Google Scholar search engine were systematically searched for studies investigating the prevalence of EDS in people with OSA up to December 2023. Data analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 2), employing a random effects model. The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I² index. In review of 15 studies with a combined sample size of 42,924 individuals found that the global prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA was 39.9% (95% CI: 34.4-45.7). The regression results indicated that as the sample size increased, the prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, an increase in the years of the studies conducted was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA, although this trend was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.856). Based on the results of this study, the global prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA is significant. Given the increasing prevalence of OSA, it is crucial for health decisionmakers to recognize the importance of this issue, raise public awareness, and address the dangerous effects of EDS on the population.	0	contr
40063235	Identification of Camellia Oil Adulteration With Excitation-Emission Matrix Fluorescence Spectra and Deep Learning.	Camellia oil (CAO), known for its high nutritional and commercial value, has raised increasing concerns about adulteration. Developing an accurate and non-destructive method to identify CAO adulterants is crucial for safeguarding public health and well-being. This study simulates potential real-world adulteration cases by designing representative adulteration scenarios, followed by the acquisition and analysis of corresponding excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) spectra. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was employed to characterize and explore the variations of fluorophores in the EEMF spectra of different adulterated scenarioss, which showed a linear correlation between the relative concentration of PARAFAC components and adulteration levels. A deep learning model named ResTransformer, which combines residual modules with Transformer, was proposed for both the qualitative detection of adulteration types and the quantitative detection of adulteration concentrations from local and global perspectives. The global ResTransformer qualitative models achieved accuracies of over 96.92% based on EEMF spectra and PARAFAC, and quantitative models showed determination coefficient of validation ([Formula: see text]) > 0.978, root mean square error of validation ([Formula: see text]) < 3.0643%, and the ratio performance deviation (RPD) > 7.6741. Compared to traditional chemometric models, the ResTransformer model demonstrated superior performance. The integration of EEMF and ResTransformer presents a highly promising strategy for rapid and reliable detection of CAO adulteration.	0	contr
40065118	Experimental study on gas permeability and radon control performance of red clay covering layer on uranium mill tailings pond.	The decommissioning of uranium mill tailings pond generally employs covering layer to diminish radon exhalation, with soil permeability, thickness, and moisture content being essential considerations in assessing the efficacy of radon reduction. This research uses a proprietary multi-field coupled seepage testing apparatus and a simulated covering layer radon exhalation device to evaluate samples' permeability and radon control effectiveness across different covering layer thicknesses, pressure gradients, and moisture content levels. The findings demonstrate that gas permeability diminishes with increasing covering layer thickness, exhibiting a more pronounced decline at pressures below 0.35 MPa. Moreover, both moisture content and covering layer thickness significantly influence the radon exhalation rate, which decreases nonlinearly with the rise of both variables. A positive link exists between the radon exhalation rate and permeability, aligning with a natural exponential function model.	0	contr
40065657	Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Promotes Glomerular Mesangial Cells Differentiation of Human Bone Marrow Hematopoietic Stem Cells - An In Vitro Study.	Glomerular filtration function and homeostasis are largely due to the cross-talk between podocytes, endothelial cells, and mesangial cells (MCs). Any disturbance in this association causes glomerular diseases (GD). Cell-based therapies are the best option in the treatment of GD. It is contemplated that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are best suited to regenerate these cells; earlier, we have shown the differentiation of HSCs into podocytes. In this study, MCs formation was initiated with retinoic acid (RA), BMP-7, and Activin A, resulting in comma-shaped intermediate mesoderm (IM) cells prominently expressing Osr1. Followed by inducing with EGF, FGF, and BMP-7, which resulted in elongated metanephric mesenchyme (MM) cells conspicuously expressing Pax2, Wt1, Foxd1, and Eya1. Finally, MM cells were induced with platelet-derived growth factor to form polygonal-shaped MCs expressing α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, CD44, and PDGFRβ. The growing MCs showed positivity to periodic acid Schiff's, and ANAE staining with a prominent expression of the Itga8 elucidating phagocytic property of MCs. These MCs showed conspicuous expression of CD133, notch-2, and telomerase, determining the quiescence nature with a 31.2% proliferation rate revealed through Ki-67 staining. The functionality of MCs was assessed by growing MCs in 5.5 and 25 mM glucose concentrations, and noticeable expression of angiotensinogen, angiotensin-I and II, angiotensin-converting enzyme, collagen-4, fibronectin, and TGFβ1 was observed in 25 mM concentration, while lowered expression of these genes was observed in 5.5 mM concentration explaining the role of MCs in regulating the filtration pressure. All these findings demonstrate that HSCs can rejuvenate the insulted glomerulus.	0	contr
40059570	Investigation of the Effects of Applying Bio-Magnesium Oxide Nanoparticle Fertilizer to Moringa Oleifera Plants on the Chemical and Vegetative Properties of the Plants' leaves.	Magnesium (Mg) is necessary for plants as a structural element or an enzyme cofactor. It also plays a significant role in the light and dark responses of photosynthesis. Moringa plants are considered one of the most important medicinal plants that humans need for nutrition. The aim of the study is to provide Mg to plants in an easy and simple way. Therefore, it is widely available in human food due to its nutritional importance. In this experiment, the treatment was done on the Moringa plant as, one of the medicinal plants that is increasingly used in fresh form. The experiment was conducted at the research farm of the National Research Center. Magnesium oxide has been extracted and prepared in a natural way that is safe for humans, plants, and soil. Trichoderma viride filtrate was used as a chelating agent in an environmentally friendly process to create magnesium oxide nanoparticle (MgO-NPs). FTIR, TEM, and SEM-EDX were utilized to analyze and characterize the synthesized. Plants were treated with different doses to determine the optimal concentration for the plant. The effect of treatment on plants was to improve vegetation such, as a number of leaves (232.15), leaf area (273.97 cm<sup>2</sup>), and fresh weight (3693.17 g). It also increased dry matter in the plant (171.8 g), chemical properties, and elements.	0	contr
40065098	Surface-mediated bacteriophage defense incurs fitness tradeoffs for interbacterial antagonism.	"Bacteria in polymicrobial habitats are constantly exposed to biotic threats from bacteriophages (or ""phages""), antagonistic bacteria, and predatory eukaryotes. These antagonistic interactions play crucial roles in shaping the evolution and physiology of bacteria. To survive, bacteria have evolved mechanisms to protect themselves from such attacks, but the fitness costs of resisting one threat and rendering bacteria susceptible to others remain unappreciated. Here, we examined the fitness consequences of phage resistance in Salmonella enterica, revealing that phage-resistant variants exhibited significant fitness loss upon co-culture with competitor bacteria. These phage-resistant strains display varying degrees of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) deficiency and increased susceptibility to contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism, such as the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Utilizing mutational analyses and atomic force microscopy, we show that the long-modal length O-antigen of LPS serves as a protective barrier against T6SS-mediated intoxication. Notably, this competitive disadvantage can also be triggered independently by phages possessing LPS-targeting endoglycosidase in their tail spike proteins, which actively cleave the O-antigen upon infection. Our findings reveal two distinct mechanisms of phage-mediated LPS modifications that modulate interbacterial competition, shedding light on the dynamic microbial interplay within mixed populations."	0	contr

40073043	Evaluation of long lasting insecticidal nets in experimental huts and WHO PQT/VCP compliance: A systematic review.	Malaria control in highly endemic regions relies heavily on vector control tools, particularly LLINs. The effectiveness of LLINs varies by eco-epidemiological conditions and brands. A comprehensive review of WHO interim-approved LLIN brands is necessary to address this variability. This systematic review screened 145 articles, refining them to 27 eligible publications, to assess the efficacy of WHO-recommended LLINs, focusing on synthetic pyrethroids and synergists like Piperonyl Butoxide or Pyriproxyfen. The review demonstrated that LLINs impregnated with synthetic pyrethroids, especially when used with synergists, are more effective than regular LLINs. However, adherence to WHO PQT/VCP (World Health Organization Prequalification Unit/Vector Control Product) checklists was inconsistent. Several LLIN pairs which includes candidate and comparator nets showed equal efficacy (100% in both arms), including Olyset Plus vs. Olyset Net, DuraNet vs. PermaNet 3.0, Interceptor G2 vs. Interceptor, MagNet vs. DuraNet, Dawa Plus 3.0 vs. Dawa Plus 2.0, and Veerralin vs. PermaNet 3.0 in terms of mosquito mortality. Significant efficacy differences were noted between various bed net pairs: Interceptor vs CTN (RR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.28-1.66); Olyset Net Duo vs Olyset Net (RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18); ICON Maxx vs CTN polyester (RR: 7.7, 95% CI: 3.6-16.31); Dawa Plus 3.0 vs Dawa Plus 2.0 (RR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.34-3.15); Interceptor G2 vs Interceptor G1 (RR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.77-0.96). These findings inform the development of improved net designs and ensure alignment with WHO guidelines, enhancing vector control measures. The review supports improved malaria control strategies and sustained LLIN utilization, highlighting the need for LLIN manufacturers to align with WHO guidelines.	1	pest
40061920	Nanoparticles for treatment of cadmium-contaminated cocoa-growing soils and beans: Performance on metal immobilization and removal.	Some areas of tropical soils where cocoa grows contain high cadmium (Cd) concentrations. The cocoa plant's need for nutrition causes the reticular system to uptake the toxic metal, translocate it, and accumulate it in roots, stems, and other edible parts such as cocoa beans and shells, threatening the health of cocoa consumers. To cope with this difficulty, different treatments have been applied to cadmium-contaminated soils, but they showed limited success. In this study, we prepared multicomponent nanoparticles (MCNPs) to treat cocoa soils in fixed-bed columns and field tests. Also, MCNPs were mixed with two varieties of cocoa beans, CNN51 and Fino de Aromain, during the fermentation, aiming to capture the cadmium. Our field investigations began by collecting soil samples from three Ecuadorian cocoa-producing farms to determine their physicochemical properties, cadmium, and iron contents. A few weeks later, a home-built prototype was installed in a cocoa plantation to fabricate the nanomaterials using commercial-grade chemicals and rainwater. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images showed MCNPs with an average size of 65.21 nm and the formation of chain-like aggregates. In contrast, MCNPs size was 76.6 nm, measured with Dispersed Light Scattering (DLS). The chemical composition of MCNPs was 90.7 % Fe0 and 1.81 % sulfur (S), analyzed by energy dispersal X-ray (EDX) and confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer measurements. Regarding the treatments, for the fixed-bed column tests, 0.28-1.08 L/kg was dosed into the soil, while for field treatments, 250, 500, and 835 mL/min MCNPs were injected in soil areas of 5 m<sup>2</sup> surrounding each cocoa tree (0.5-4.5 mg MCNPs/kg soil) at depths between 0 and 5 cm. Test results revealed that the procedure applied in the field did not reproduce the metal's immobilization (∼22 %) as in the fixed-bed columns (∼80 %). Moreover, cadmium removal was ∼20 % and ∼75 % after treating CCN51 and Fino de Aroma cocoa beans with 0.112 kg MCNPs/kg in the fermentation on-site and 0.034 kg MCNPs/kg in the laboratory. In this study, the size and chain-like aggregates of MCNPs notably influenced the field treatments as they precluded the filtration of MCNPs downwards. However, immobilizing cadmium could be more effective in soils with higher concentrations of the metal and multicomponent nanoparticles of smaller size, expanding our research scope and offering a practical solution to pollution issues in cocoa-growing regions.	0	contr
40057356	Influence of surface type on outdoor gait parameters measured using an In-Shoe Motion Sensor System.	The objectives of this study were to measure outdoor gait parameters using an In-Shoe Motion Sensor System (IMS) and evaluate how different types of surfaces affect various gait dynamics. Accurate outdoor gait data are crucial for effective fall risk assessment because surface irregularities and tripping hazards often result in falls during walking. An IMS was used in this study to collect spatiotemporal, spatial, and foot parameters from 27 healthy adults walking on indoor asphalt, soil, and grass surfaces. Data were recorded during a 6-minute walk test, with measurements taken every 2 min and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The results showed significant differences in foot clearance, heel height, and gait cycle across surfaces. Walking on grass significantly increased foot height, swing time, and roll angle of heel contact. These findings may help develop interventions to prevent falls.	0	contr

There is conflicting information about the association between egg intake and metabolic health status and no previous information on this association was found in Middle Eastern populations. This research aimed to investigate the relationship between egg consumption and metabolic health status in Iranian adults, focusing on the potential involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and adropin. This cross-sectional study was done on a sample of 527 individuals (45.7% female) aged between 20 and 65 years. Participants were selected using a multistage cluster random-sampling method. Dietary intakes of participants were evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Blood samples were collected while the individuals were fasting to assess biochemical markers. Metabolic health status of individuals was assessed based on the criteria established by Wildman. Collecting data on covariates was done using pre-tested procedures. Multivariable-adjusted model revealed a statistically significant association between egg consumption and a decreased odds of metabolically unhealthy (MU) status (OR<sub>T3 vs. T1</sub> = 0.47; 95%CI 0.24-0.92). Also, each tertile increase in egg consumption was significantly associated with decreased odds of MU status (OR = 0.68; 95%CI 0.49-0.96). This association was especially significant among males rather than females. Elevated high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were substantially reduced among individuals with the highest consumption of egg compared to the lowest intake. Additionally, there was a slight inverse association between egg consumption and high blood pressure. There were no relationships between egg intake and having low BDNF, and adropin levels. Increased consumption of egg was associated with a decreased chance of being metabolically unhealthy in Iranian adults, especially in male participants.	0	contr
40066506	Indirect ELISA-based detection of histatin 3 and cystatin D for the forensic identification of human saliva.	Analyzing forensically relevant body fluids contributes to proving criminal acts, and saliva is often left on the scene, especially in sexual assault cases. Currently, saliva is presumptively identified using its salivary α-amylase activity as an indicator. However, the specificity of saliva presumptive tests is low, and therefore, they cannot confidently prove the presence of saliva. This study aimed to develop and validate an indirect ELISA-based saliva confirmatory test using the novel human salivary protein markers histatin 3 and cystatin D. Histatin 3 and cystatin D are known to be uniquely expressed in human salivary glands, and the molecular evolution of both genes occurred after the divergence of hominoids; thus, the high specificity of human saliva for both markers was expected. As a result of the validation experiments, both histatin 3 and cystatin D markers were able to distinguish human saliva from other human body fluids and animal saliva using appropriate thresholds of the quantitative absorbance values. Our results indicate that both histatin 3 and cystatin D markers are human saliva-specific; thus, we consider that this method will be useful and practical in identifying human saliva.	0	contr
40066042	Characterization of the immune cell infiltration patterns in lung adenocarcinoma to facilitate immunotherapy.	Although Immunotherapy has emerged as an efficient treatment in lung carcinoma, merely a subset of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients could be benefited from it. Increasing evidence revealed that tumor immune cell infiltrating (ICI) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly related to patient prognosis and characteristics of the tumor. Thus far, the immune cell infiltration patterns of LUAD remain unclear. Herein, ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT algorithms were conducted to characterize the ICI patterns of 1155 patients with LUAD. Three ICI subtypes were determined, and the ICI score was constructed by performing PCA. A high ICI score group referred to increased activation of the signaling pathways related to immune activation and drug metabolism, reduced tumor mutation burden (TMB), as well as significantly higher expression levels of CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG3, and immune-activation-related genes. Patients who had high ICI scores showed better overall survival (OS) compared to those with low ICI scores, irrespective of TMB status. This study demonstrated that ICI scores serve as an original and effective indicator for independent prognostic prediction as well as customized immune therapy of LUAD. Establishing the ICI patterns of a larger patient population will extend our knowledg of TME, and it may facilitate the development of immunotherapies specific to LUAD.	0	contr

"Increasing the nutritional value of any crop plant through various Conventional or non-Conventional methods is known as Biofortification. Deficiency of proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals leads to ailing health and increased vulnerability to various diseases, which in turn lead to uncountable and unpredicted loss in Gross Domestic Product leading to poor economic growth of the country. It is forthcoming and cost-effective approach that will provide a balance of micronutrient deficiency among the people of developing & underdeveloped nations not having the availability to diverse nutritional access. The Biofortified varieties not only provide required calories but also essential nutrients needed for proper growth and development of an individual. It is advantageous in combating malnutrition and hidden hunger by enhancing the micronutrient content of commonly consumed fruits. By increasing essential vitamins, minerals, and beneficial compounds through methods like traditional breeding, genetic engineering, and agronomic practices, biofortified fruits provide a sustainable solution to address deficiencies in regions with limited access to diverse foods. For instance, mango, guava, papaya, and citrus have been improved to offer higher levels of nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin C, and beta-carotene. This makes biofortified fruits a cost-effective way to enhance nutrition, particularly for vulnerable populations, helping to reduce the risks associated with hidden hunger and malnutrition. One of the important targets of United Nation is to provide fortified food enriched with important minerals to the targeted undernourished population in different parts of the world. The lack of essential nutrients, notably minerals such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and vitamin A, is one of the main causes of ""hidden hunger"", especially in underdeveloped nations. The review covers most of the important aspects of Biofortification in important fruit crops."	0	contr

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly susceptible to metastasis, making early detection of metastases and associated risk factors crucial for effective management. This study aimed to assess the performance of <sup>18</sup>fluorine (<sup>18</sup>F)- fibroblast activation protein inhibitor-04 (<sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in detecting metastasis and predicting pathological characteristics and risk factors in 67 PDAC patients. Comparisons were made with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) PET/CT. Lesion identifications and radiotracer uptakes were evaluated through visual inspection and semiquantitative analysis using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). We analyzed the risk factors for metastasis and observed that <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04 identified more positive lesions and showed significantly higher SUVmax values than <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in both primary tumors and metastases, leading to upstaging in several cases. In primary tumors, <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04 was associated with higher levels of poorly differentiated PDAC, compared to those with moderately differentiated tumors. Notably, the SUVmax of 18F-FAPI-04 in primary tumors demonstrated a significant correlation with pathological differentiation and served as an independent prognostic factor for peritoneal metastasis, rather than lymph node or liver metastasis. Our findings suggested that <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04 PET/CT offers superior tumor detectability and improved node-metastasis (NM) staging in PDAC patients, positioning it as a more effective tool than <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT.	0	contr
40062550	The Response of Carbon Uptake to Soil Moisture Stress: Adaptation to Climatic Aridity.	The coupling between carbon uptake and water loss through stomata implies that gross primary production (GPP) can be limited by soil water availability through reduced leaf area and/or stomatal conductance. Ecosystem and land-surface models commonly assume that GPP is highest under well-watered conditions and apply a stress function to reduce GPP as soil moisture declines. Optimality considerations, however, suggest that the stress function should depend on climatic aridity: ecosystems adapted to more arid climates should use water more conservatively when soil moisture is high, but maintain unchanged GPP down to a lower critical soil-moisture threshold. We use eddy-covariance flux data to test this hypothesis. We investigate how the light-use efficiency (LUE) of GPP depends on soil moisture across ecosystems representing a wide range of climatic aridity. 'Well-watered' GPP is estimated using the sub-daily P model, a first-principles LUE model driven by atmospheric data and remotely sensed vegetation cover. Breakpoint regression is used to relate daily β(θ) (the ratio of flux data-derived GPP to modelled well-watered GPP) to soil moisture estimated via a generic water balance model. The resulting piecewise function describing β(θ) varies with aridity, as hypothesised. Unstressed LUE, even when soil moisture is high, declines with increasing aridity index (AI). So does the critical soil-moisture threshold. Moreover, for any AI value, there exists a soil moisture level at which β(θ) is maximised. This level declines as AI increases. This behaviour is captured by universal non-linear functions relating both unstressed LUE and the critical soil-moisture threshold to AI. Applying these aridity-based functions to predict the site-level response of LUE to soil moisture substantially improves GPP simulation under both water-stressed and unstressed conditions, suggesting a route towards a robust, universal model representation of the effects of low soil moisture on leaf-level photosynthesis.	0	contr
40066416	Assessment of Prevalence and Factors Affecting Trismus in Cases of Oral and Oropharyngeal Malignancies after Complete Treatment.	Trismus, or restricted mouth opening is a very common and often neglected side effect in oral and oropharyngeal malignancies owing to the disease itself as well as its treatment with surgery and/or chemoradiation. This study aims at assessing the prevalence of trismus occurring after complete treatment in diagnosed cases of oral and oropharyngeal malignancy and to assess various risk factors associated with development of trismus in these patients. A prospective, observational study conducted over a 2 years at a tertiary care hospital. All newly diagnosed cases of oral and oropharyngeal malignancy seeking treatment were included. Maximal mouth opening as the interincisoral distance measured using a Vernier Calliper was done so in each patient at presentation before initiation of treatment, before adjuvant therapy, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment and the results were analysed. The primary modality of treatment, type of surgery, reconstruction performed and patient's recovery were monitored. Out of 72 patients included, 60 had oral cancers and the remaining oropharyngeal. The overall prevalence was 61.1%. The following variables were found to be associated with higher prevalence of trismus- Tumour size, advanced primary disease (T3, T4 disease), oral submucous fibrosis and radiation. There is a high prevalence of trismus in treated patients of oral and oropharyngeal malignancies more so in cases of oral cancer undergoing surgery with adjuvant therapy. There is a need to find treatment modalities with better functional outcomes and direct oral rehabilitation strategies towards alleviation of trismus.	0	contr
40065282	Use of complement C5-inhibitor eculizumab in patients with infection-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome - a case-series report.	Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (AKI), remains a leading cause of pediatric AKI. The complement system has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and eculizumab (ECZ) was approved as standard of care for its treatment. The two widely characterized forms of infection-associated HUS are Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)-HUS and Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated (SP)-HUS. Extrarenal manifestations such as central nervous system (CNS) involvement occur approximately in 20% of the cases and are accompanied by higher mortality. Abnormalities of the alternative complement pathway may also contribute to the development of both STEC-HUS and SP-HUS, offering a potential treatment option for complement C5 inhibition. Beyond best supportive care as standard therapeutic approach, ECZ has been successfully used in both STEC-HUS and SP-HUS patients. We provide further support that early use of ECZ for infection-associated HUS with severe clinical manifestation and abnormal complement-activation profile may be an effective therapeutic approach.	0	contr
40065214	Tumor Prognostic Risk Model Related to Monocytes/Macrophages in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Machine Learning and Multi-Omics.	Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are crucial in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and invasion. This study explores monocyte/ macrophage-associated gene expression profiles in HCC, constructs a prognostic model based on these genes, and examines its relationship with drug resistance and immune therapy responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq) data from 10 HCC tissue biopsy samples, totaling 24,597 cells, were obtained from the GEO database to identify monocyte/macrophage-associated genes. A prognostic model was constructed and validated using external datasets and Western blot. Relationships between the model, clinical correlates, drug sensitivity, and immune therapy responses were investigated. From scRNA-seq data, 2,799 monocyte/macrophage marker genes were identified. Using the TCGA dataset, a prognostic model based on the single-gene UQCRH was constructed, stratifying patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on overall survival rates. High-risk group patients showed reduced survival rates and higher UQCRH expression in tumor tissues. Western blot analysis further confirmed the elevated expression of UQCRH in HCC cell lines. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed that high UQCRH expression co-localized with malignant cells in the tumor tissue. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that the high-risk group had lower sensitivity to sorafenib and axitinib. Immune therapy response analysis indicated poorer outcomes in the high-risk group, with more pronounced APC inhibition and a weaker IFN-II response. Clinical indicator analysis showed a positive correlation between high UQCRH expression and tumor invasion. Enrichment analysis of UQCRH and associated molecules indicated involvement in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial electron transport. This study introduces a prognostic model for HCC patients based on monocyte/macrophage marker genes. The single-gene model predicts HCC patient survival and treatment outcomes, identifying high-risk individuals with varying drug sensitivities and immune suppression states.	0	contr
40053144	Research on the traceability and treatment of nitrate pollution in groundwater: a comprehensive review.	The preservation of groundwater quality is essential for maintaining the integrity of the water ecological cycle. The preservation of groundwater quality is crucial for sustaining the integrity of the water ecological cycle. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) has emerged as a pervasive contaminant in groundwater, attracting significant research attention due to its extensive distribution and the potential environmental consequences it poses. The primary sources of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution include soil organic nitrogen, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, domestic sewage, industrial wastewater, landfill leachate, as well as organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and manure. A comprehensive understanding of these sources is imperative for devising effective strategies to mitigate NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> contamination. Technologies for tracing NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-polluted groundwater include hydrochemical analysis, nitrogen and oxygen isotope techniques, microbial tracers, and numerical simulations. Quantitative isotope analysis frequently necessitates the application of mathematical models such as IsoSource, IsoError, IsoConc, MixSIR, SIAR, and MixSIAR to deduce the origins of pollution. This study provides a summary of the application scenarios, as well as the strengths and limitations of these models. In terms of remediation, pump and treat and permeable reactive barrier are predominant technologies currently employed. These approaches are designed to remove or reduce NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in groundwater, thereby restoring its quality. The study offers a systematic examination of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution, encompassing its origins, detection methodologies, and remediation approaches, highlighting the role of numerical simulations and integrating multidisciplinary knowledge. Additionally, this review delves into technological advancements and future trends concerning the detection and treatment of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution in groundwater. It proposes methods to control the spread of pollution and acts as a guide for identifying and preventing pollution sources.	0	contr

40066047	A novel single-domain antibody obtained from immune Bactrian camels against botulinum toxin type A using SPR-based screening method.	Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a highly lethal toxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which leads to nerve paralysis following poisoning. At present, there is no specific drug officially approved. Antibodies, particularly single-domain antibodies, represent safe and effective candidates for specific drugs against BoNT. In this study, the receptor-binding domain of botulinum toxin (BoNT/AHC<sub>C</sub>) was utilized to immunize Bactrian camels, resulting in the generation of a nanobody phage library. From this library, a high-affinity binding antibody, designated A1, and a neutralizing antibody, named HM, were successfully obtained through SPR-based screening. The affinity constant of HM for botulinum toxin is 1.08E-11 M. Results from computer simulations indicate that HM binds at the same site as SV2C. Furthermore, experimental findings demonstrate that HM exhibits significant blocking activity at both the <i>in vitro</i> binding level and the cellular level. In mouse toxicity experiments, HM has been shown to offer protection against a 20 LD<sub>50</sub> dose of BoNT/A. Consequently, HM mitigates botulinum toxin poisoning in mice by obstructing the binding of AHC<sub>C</sub> to SV2C.	0	contr
40065595	Glucose Transport by Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Is Mediated Through the Akt/FOXO1 Pathway in Ovine Granulosa Cells.	Glycolysis in granulosa cells (GCs) is the primary location of energy metabolism and its substrates in oocytes and is closely related to follicular development in mammals. The complex morphological structure and physiological functions of GCs are regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but little is known about how FSH regulates glycolysis in GCs, and its mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which FSH activates the Akt/FOXO1 pathway, thereby regulating glucose metabolism in ovine GCs. Granulosa cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of FSH and a CCK-8 assay was used to measure the proliferation of the treated cells. Next, qRT-PCR was performed to measure the transcription of the target genes, glucose transporter (GLUT). Western-blot analysis of the phospho-Akt and -FOXO1 levels induced by FSH through the glucose signalling pathway, in addition to the effects of these proteins on the expression levels of the downstream GLUT genes, was measured. Results showed that the addition of 10ng/mL FSH to the culture medium increased the viability of granulosa cells. Transcription of GLUT1 and 4 was significantly up-regulated in FSH-treated cells through activation of the Akt/FOXO1 phosphorylation pathway, thereby affecting glucose metabolism. This study contributes to the current understanding of the metabolic features of and the associated developmental pathways of ovine follicular GCs.	0	contr
40029899	Mucilage produced by aerial roots hosts diazotrophs that provide nitrogen in Sorghum bicolor.	Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is an important food, feed, and fodder crop worldwide and is gaining popularity as an energy crop due to its high potential for biomass production. Some sorghum accessions develop many aerial roots and produce an abundant carbohydrate-rich mucilage after rain. This aerial root mucilage is similar to that observed in landraces of maize (Zea mays) from southern Mexico, which have been previously shown to host diazotrophs. In this study, we characterized the aerial root development of several sorghum accessions and the impact of humidity on this trait. We conducted a microbiome study of the aerial root mucilage of maize and sorghum and isolated numerous diazotrophs from field sorghum mucilage. We observed that the prevailing phyla in the mucilage were Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, and Bacillota. However, bacterial abundances varied based on the genotype and the location. Using acetylene reduction, 15N2 gas feeding, and 15N isotope dilution assays, we confirmed that these sorghum accessions can acquire about 40% of their nitrogen from the atmosphere through these associations on aerial roots. Nitrogen fixation in sorghum aerial root mucilage offers a promising avenue to reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers and promote sustainable agricultural practices for food, feed, fodder, and bioenergy production.	0	contr
40065301	SLC25A35 enhances fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis to promote the carcinogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by upregulating PGC-1α.	Mitochondria dysfunction has been closely linked to a wide spectrum of human cancers, whereas the molecular basis has yet to be fully understood. SLC25A35 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins. However, the role of SLC25A35 in mitochondrial metabolism reprogramming, development and progression in human cancers remains unclear. Here, we found that SLC25A35 markedly reprogramed mitochondrial metabolism, characterized by increased oxygen consumption rate and ATP production and decreased ROS level, via enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Meanwhile, SLC25A35 also enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis characterized by increased mitochondrial mass and DNA content. Mechanistic studies revealed that SLC25A35 facilitated FAO and mitochondrial biogenesis through upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) via increasing acetyl-CoA-mediated acetylation of PGC-1α. Clinically, SLC25A35 was highly expressed in HCC and correlated with adverse patients' survival. Functionally, SLC25A35 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the carcinogenesis in a DEN-induced HCC mice model. Moreover, we found that SLC25A35 upregulation is caused, at least in part, by decreased miR-663a in HCC cells. Together, our results suggest a crucial oncogenic role of SLC25A35 in HCC by reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism and suggest SLC25A35 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.	0	contr

40065718	Deficiency of H3K27 histone demethylase UTX in T cells blunts allergic sensitization and anaphylaxis to peanut.	Whether epigenetic factor UTX, a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, is critical for type 2 immunity, including allergic sensitization and antigen-driven anaphylaxis, is unclear. We used UTXfl/fl x Lck-Cre mice with UTX-deficient T cells (UTX-TCD) to determine whether T cell-specific UTX expression regulates antigen-specific IgE production after airway sensitization to peanut and anaphylaxis following intraperitoneal (i.p.) peanut challenge. UTX-TCD mice sensitized via the airway with peanut and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial component and environmental adjuvant found in house dust, made 2-fold less peanut-IgE and 3.5-fold less peanut-IgG1 than comparably sensitized UTXfl/fl mice, despite higher total IgE and total IgG1 serum antibody levels pre-sensitization. Peanut-induced anaphylaxis was blunted in UTX-TCD mice, with maximum drop in core body temperature after i.p. peanut challenge two-fold lower than in UTXfl/fl mice. Compared to UTXfl/fl controls, UTX-TCD mice had reduced frequencies of CD4+ T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells and germinal center B cells, but higher frequencies of IL-4+ T-helper (Th)2, Tfh2, and IL-13+ Tfh13 cells in airway-draining mediastinal lymph nodes. UTX-TCD mice also skewed toward type 2 antibody and T-helper immune responses independent of allergic sensitization, with fewer IL-10-producing splenic Treg and T-follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells. Our results suggest that UTX expression in T cells impact the production of antigen-specific antibody responses required for allergic sensitization and antigen-specific allergic reactions, suggesting a role for H3K27 histone demethylase UTX in regulating type 2 immunity.	0	contr

40065635	Intake, digestion, and rumen microbial impacts of black soldier fly larvae and frass provided as protein supplements to cattle consuming forage.	Insects reared in large-scale, commercial settings may be a sustainable alternative to conventional livestock feeds. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) has been researched as a potential protein supplement for cattle, but knowledge gaps remain in how BSFL affects rumen microbial populations. Further, frass and larval sheddings (FRS) are produced in greater quantities than larval biomass and are N rich but have not been investigated as feed. Accordingly, the objective of our study was to compare the effects of isonitrogenous levels of cottonseed meal (CSM), BSFL, and FRS on forage utilization responses and rumen microbial communities in cattle consuming low-quality forage. Angus steers (n=8; 240 ± 22.5 kg BW) with ad libitum access to low-quality forage (5.9% crude protein) were used in replicated 4 × 4 Latin squares. One of four treatments was provided daily: no supplemental protein (CON), CSM, partially defatted BSFL, or FRS all provided at 100 mg N/kg BW. There were four 16-d experimental periods which included an 8-d adaptation to treatments, 7-d measurement of intake and digestion, and 1-d for determination of ruminal fermentation and sampling of rumen content for determination of microbial populations. Rumen content samples were separated into liquid and solid fractions, extracted for genomic DNA, PCR amplified for the V3 to V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, sequenced on a MiSeq platform, and analyzed using the QIIME2 pipeline. Protein supplementation increased forage organic matter (OM) intake and total digestible OM intake (TDOMI) relative to CON (P≤0.01). For TDOMI, there were differences (P≤0.03) between CSM (2.84 kg/d) and BSFL (3.07 kg/d) and CSM and FRS (3.05 kg/d). Treatment did not affect OM (P=0.82) or neutral detergent fiber (P=0.43) digestibility. Relative abundances of certain bacterial genera (i.e., Butyrvibrio, NK4A214, Prevotellacaeae UCG003, and Veillonellacaeae) were significantly affected by treatment in either the liquid or solid rumen fraction, but diversity indices, phyla, and dominant families were not affected. These data indicate that BSFL and FRS stimulate forage utilization to a similar or greater extent than a conventional protein supplement. The minor observed impacts on microbial community composition suggests no adverse effects on the rumen microbiome associated with supplementation of BSFL or FRS. Ultimately, BSFL and FRS may be suitable protein supplements for beef steers consuming low-quality forage.	0	contr
40054248	Long-term trends of streamwater chemistry in an agricultural watershed: Effects of anthropogenic and climatic factors.	The chemistry of headwater streams is a key indicator of the health of riparian zones and surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. This chemistry is shaped by biogeochemical processes, including chemical weathering, and anthropogenic activities that interact with one another and are sensitive to climate. Elucidating trends in streamwater chemistry and the drivers that underpin them is essential for informing land-management decisions and anticipating water-quality issues that may affect downstream waters. In this work, we investigated the effects of anthropogenic and climatic factors on long-term variations in the chemistry of a first-order stream draining an agricultural catchment nested within the Sleepers River Research Watershed in Vermont, USA. We observed statistically significant increases in alkalinity and the concentrations of calcium and magnesium over a 31-year period for which 17 years of measurements were available. Through the application of generalized linear models, we found that the upward trends in alkalinity and calcium were associated with rising air temperatures, while a response to historical acid deposition played a minor role. We hypothesize that increased production of biogenic carbon dioxide and organic acids in soil and groundwater may lead to increases in chemical weathering rates under warmer climate conditions. This study emphasizes the important role of rising temperatures in the long-term increase in streamwater alkaline solutes, potentially overshadowing other influences like acidification recovery and agricultural practices. It also highlights the importance of comprehensive, long-term research to understand climate impacts on chemical weathering and inland water chemistry, which is critical for managing water quality and understanding regional and global carbon cycles.	0	contr
40056504	Antioxidant defense response mediated by DAF-16 attenuates toxicity of herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on Caenorhabditis elegans.	Glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are widely used herbicides in agriculture for weed elimination. These unused glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are discharged into environmental water, soil, and even in the food chain cycle, which greatly threatens ecosystems and human health. However, the toxicological mechanism of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms remains largely unknown. To investigate the toxic effects of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans which is directly exposed to various pesticides in the soil was selected as the object of study. In this study, our results showed that the locomotion, growth, reproduction, and lethality of C. elegans exposed to different concentrations of a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are suppressed. Exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium increases the production of reactive oxygen species, accelerating senescence and shortening the lifespan of C. elegans. The exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium activates antioxidant defense responses mediated by DAF-16 and autophagy mediated by SKN-1. Our research provides a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying antioxidant defense response-mediated detoxification of pesticide residues in soil non-target organisms.	0	contr

40059591	IIS/TOR network plays an essential role in ovarian development in the pupal stage of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda.	The ovary plays a crucial role in the female reproductive system of insects and is vital for the perpetuation of insect populations. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling network play a key role in controlling ovarian development and maturation during the adult stage. However, the pupal stage is a critical developmental phase in the reproductive system of holometabolous insects, and the regulatory role of the IIS/TOR network during this stage remains to be elucidated. In this study, we observed that during the pupal stage, the enlargement of ovarian development was accompanied by a corresponding increase in messenger RNA expression levels of genes within the IIS/TOR signaling pathway and insulin levels in the hemolymph. Decapitation experiments, serving as a pivotal approach to assess the regulatory role of the IIS signaling pathway in ovarian development, demonstrated that decapitation markedly inhibited ovarian development at this critical stage. Exogenous insulin administration significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of FOXO, S6K, and 4E-BP, thereby enhancing ovarian development and resulting in significant elongation of the ovarioles. In contrast, the injection of IIS/TOR pathway inhibitors, LY294002 and Rapamycin, reduced the phosphorylation of these proteins, inhibiting ovarian development during the pupal stage and leading to a significant shortening of the ovarioles, negatively impacting the reproductive performance of adult females. The current findings indicate that the IIS/TOR signaling network significantly regulates ovarian development during the pupal stage of Spodoptera frugiperda, providing new molecular insights for the development of pest management strategies.	0	contr
40060723	Temporal Variation in Bacterial Community Characteristics Shaped by Habitat in a Reservoir Buffer Strip in China.	Habitat and temporal variation can both influence microbial community dynamics, although their relative importance in reservoir buffer zones with complex hydrology regimes and dramatically altered environments remains controversial. To elucidate this, we investigated spatiotemporal variation in soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes from the flooding period to the dry period (April and June, respectively) using high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing in three habitats (abandoned cropland, grassland, and woodland) within the Chushandian Reservoir's buffer strip, China. The results showed that habitat was more important than temporal variation in shaping soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes in the reservoir buffer zone. Bacterial communities responded to temporal variation both in terms of species composition and function; temporal variation affected bacterial communities mostly by altering the abundance of shared species and by causing the resurgence or extinction of specific taxa within the same habitat. The main driver of these changes was the resilience capacity of habitats to the changing moisture environment. The magnitude and underlying mechanisms of the changes in bacterial community diversity and ecological processes differed markedly between the three habitats, owing mostly to the characteristics of their vegetation, thus the allocation ratios of different habitat vegetation types and landscape diversity should pay attention for the reservoir buffer zone management, improving the integrated ecological benefits of the reservoir ecosystem from a multiscale.	1	pest

40058053	Anaerobic fermentation integrated with pyrolysis for carbon resource recovery from food waste and biogas sludge: Effects of inoculation ratio and pyrolysis temperature.	In view of the food waste (FW) as well as its digestate are both the organic sources of municipal solid waste, this study explored the anaerobic fermentation (AF) and following pyrolysis carbonization to co-disposal the two wastes for carbon resource recovery, including short chain organic acid (SCOAs), pyrolysis gas and biochar. Results indicated that both the rate and yield of SCOAs production both increase with the rising ratio of biogas sludge (BS) to FW, enhancing the soluble carbon recovery. The highest SCOAs production of 474.33 mg/g-VS was achieved at the ratio of 2:1 in 72 h. To further utilize the carbon source, the solids from the fermented residue (FR) was pyrolyzed at 400, 600 and 800 °C, respectively. Findings showed that the carbon content in biochar decreases with the increasing pyrolysis temperature, while the carbon in pyrolysis gas exhibits the opposite trend. Integrating the AF and pyrolysis contributed to a carbon recovery about 56.39% when the FW and BS were co-fermented at a 2:1 ratio, followed by its FR was pyrolyzed at 600 °C. Additionally, the biochar prepared under these conditions displayed a specific surface area (SSA) of 313.10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, along with abundant pore structures and functional groups, indicating its potential applications as pollutant adsorbents and soil amendments. This research offers a new perspective on efficiently recovering high-value carbon sources through the co-treatment of FW and its digestate via AF integrated with pyrolysis.	0	contr

A brain tumor is regarded as one of the deadliest types of cancer due to its intricate nature.This is why it is important that patients get the best possible diagnosis and treatment options. With the help of machine vision, neurologists can now perform a more accurate and faster diagnosis. There are currently no suitable methods that can be used to perform brain segmentation using image processing recently neural network model is used that it can perform better than other methods. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the model, performing accurate brain segmentation in real images is not feasible. The main objective is to develop a novel method that can be used to analyze brain tumors using a component analysis. The proposed model consists of a deep neural network and an image processing framework. It is divided into various phases, such as the mapping stage, the data augmentation stage, and the tumor discovery stage. The data augmentation stage involves training a CNN to identify the regions of the image that are overlapping with the tumor space marker. The DCNN's predicted performance is compared with the test result. The third stage is focused on training a deep neural system and a SVM. This model was able to achieve a 99% accuracy rate and a sensitivity of 0.973%. It is primarily utilized for identifying brain tumors.	0	contr

Allele specific binding (ASB) data from Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments were paired with high sequence-identity DNA binding Domains assessed in Protein Binding Microarray (PBM) experiments. For each transcription factor a paired DNA binding Domain was selected from which we derived E-score profiles for reference and alternate DNA sequences of ASB events. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to predict whether these profiles were indicative of ASB gain/loss or no change in binding. 18211 E-score profiles from 113 transcription factors were split into train, validation and test data. We compared the performance of the trained model with other available platforms for predicting the effect of SNP on transcription factor binding. Our model demonstrated increased accuracy and ASB recall in comparison to the best scoring benchmark tools.	0	contr
40066456	Influence of gut microbial metabolites on tumor immunotherapy: mechanisms and potential natural products.	In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, individual differences in efficacy have been observed in clinical practice. There is increasing evidence that gut microbial metabolites influence the efficacy of distal tumor immunotherapy via the gut-liver axis, the gut-brain axis and the gut-breast axis, a process that may involve modulating the expression of immune cells and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we systematically explore the relationship between gut microbial metabolites and tumor immunotherapy, and examine the corresponding natural products and their mechanisms of action. The in-depth exploration of this research area will provide new ideas and strategies to enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy and mitigate adverse effects.	0	contr

40066205	Treatment of c-MET Antibody-Drug Conjugate Asymptomatic Pneumonitis with a Novel Steroid Regimen in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Case Report.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a potent class of antineoplastic drugs that deliver cytotoxic agents via targeting with monoclonal antibodies; however, ADCs are associated with high rates of lung toxicities, limiting the therapeutic potential in many patients. We report a case of a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer taking the ADC telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso V) plus osimtertinib who developed ADC-induced pneumonitis despite clinical benefit. This patient was able to tolerate treatment for a prolonged period on a novel steroid regimen, using steroids when pneumonitis was asymptomatic but radiologically evident and as a daily suppressant. This treatment strategy may have implications in the broader management of ADC-interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis and underscores its potential mechanisms.	0	contr

40065489	Soil pH-dependent nitrogen stimulation of plant biomass: magnesium and calcium as key constraints.	Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition can alleviate N limitation and stimulate plant growth in many terrestrial ecosystems. While theoretical models often emphasize phosphorus limitations as a constraint on this positive N effect, the impact of N-induced magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) deficits due to soil acidification has been largely overlooked. Here, we synthesized data from 243 experiments across diverse terrestrial ecosystems to investigate the role of Mg and Ca in plant biomass responses to N addition. We found that the effect of N addition on aboveground biomass (AGB) shifted from neutral in low pH (≤ 4.5) to positive in medium (4.5-7.5) and high pH (> 7.5) soils. By contrast, belowground biomass (BGB) responses to N addition were independent of soil pH, leading to asymmetric increases in AGB and BGB. These variations in biomass accumulation across pH levels were primarily explained by changes in foliar Mg and Ca concentrations, which were negatively affected by N addition in low-pH soils but remained stable in medium and high-pH soils. Our findings underscore the critical role of Mg and Ca in modulating plant responses to N fertilization, providing new insights for improving Earth system models and better predicting climate-biosphere feedback.	0	contr

40066487	Mesoporous Nanogel Sprays as Universal Evaporation Interface Modifiers for Boosting Water-Cluster Evaporation.	Accelerating water evaporation is vital for processes like photosynthesis, dehydration, and desalination. Optimizing the pore structure and interfacial properties of evaporative materials can reduce evaporation enthalpy and increase efficiency. However, integrating the evaporation interface with water transport channels poses significant design challenges and complicates low-enthalpy evaporation analysis. To address these challenges, a hydrophilic nanovesicle gel is developed with a hydrophobic mesoporous structure as an ideal spray. This spray effectively upgrades their interface of universal substrates (including PVA hydrogels, balsa wood, nanofiltration membrane, cellulose paper, nylon fabrics, etc.), enabling the simple preparation of evaporation materials. The sprayed samples, at a low spraying dose of 40 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>, achieved evaporation rates of 1.58 and 3.26 kg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> under 0.5 and 1 sun irradiance, which are 297% and 268% higher than their respective substrates. These nanogels offer benefits like edibility, low cost, ease of use, and compatibility with various substrates, showing great potential in seawater desalination, dehydration technology, crop yield enhancement, and coating/paint drying. More importantly, this work highlights the need for researchers to focus on the surface structure of materials, rather than merely using bulk gels, in the development of high-performance evaporative materials.	0	contr
40059346	Copper and Nitrogen Codoped CDs for Alleviating the Damage of Reactive Oxygen Species for Cucumber Seedlings under Salt Stress.	Dramatic changes in climate and soil environments have made growing conditions for crops more challenging. These crops are subject to a range of abiotic stresses in different environments, which can lead to significant yield losses, resulting in economic and environmental damages. Herein, we report a straightforward one-pot hydrothermal method for creating carbon dots codoped with copper and nitrogen (Cu,N-CDs). Under salt stress conditions, Cu,N-CDs demonstrate the ability to alleviate oxidative damage in cucumber seedlings by modulating antioxidant defense mechanisms and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cucumber seedling biomass accumulation is greatly enhanced by Cu,N-CDs treatment in the presence of a ROS burst, leading to a notable rise in the dry weight, plant height, and fresh weight. Cu,N-CDs mitigate oxidative damage in cucumber seedlings by activating antioxidant defense systems, specifically enhancing the activities of superoxide dismutase (+34.08%), catalase (+28.11%), peroxidase (+17.54%), and ascorbate peroxidase (+31.54%) to scavenge ROS. Furthermore, Cu,N-CDs can enhance the levels of nonenzymatic elements within the antioxidant system, such as polyphenols (+23.60%), flavonoids (+15.43%), and carotenoid content (+51.73%), which strengthen the scavenging ability of cucumber seedlings against ROS. Meanwhile, Cu,N-CDs can induce a significant increase of soluble sugar and soluble protein content by 27.27 and 32.58%, respectively, which improves the osmotic pressure as well as stress tolerance of plants. Additionally, the accumulation of biomass was aided by the increase in the photosynthetic pigment content that Cu,N-CDs treatment can produce.	0	contr
40066367	Expanding the Ingredient Basket in Aquaculture: Growth Performance and Feed Utilization of Australian Hybrid Abalone (<i>Haliotis laevigata × H. rubra</i>) Fed Methanotrophic Single Cell Protein.	There is growing interest in the use of single cell proteins (SCPs) derived from methanotrophic bacteria for inclusion in aquafeed to reduce reliance on other, potentially less sustainable proteins. This two-part experiment aimed to investigate first (i) the dose effect of replacing soy protein concentrate with SCP in Australian hybrid abalone diets (<i>Haliotis laevigata Haliotis rubra</i>) and second, (ii) the potential for improved palatability of the SCP by using commercially produced liquid protein hydrolysate (PH). This was assessed in a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design. The diets were formulated to be iso-proteic (~40% crude protein as fed) and iso-energetic (~18 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup> as fed). The diets (SCP 0%, SCP 5%, SCP 10%, SCP 20%, SCP 0% + PH, and SCP 20% + PH) were fed to the abalone (~9.25 g initial weight) once daily in the evening for 94 days to apparent satiation. The growth performance and feed utilization of abalone fed with up to 10% SCP was comparable to the control; however, there was a significant reduction in most parameters at the highest inclusion of 20%. In the second experiment, there was a decline in measured protein and energy retention in the abalone fed 20% SCP, with a concomitantly lower apparent biological value. Positively, there were significant improvements in the apparent digestibility of the diet at the 20% SCP inclusion. There was no significant impact of using the PH on growth performance or feed intake. No effects were observed on the digestive enzyme activity (<i>α</i>-amylase, lipase, and trypsin) examined among the treatments. Considering these results collectively, the maximum recommended inclusion of methanotrophic SCP meal should be 10% for hybrid abalone. Reasons for the decline in performance at the highest inclusion may be related to palatability; however, this remains to be fully confirmed.	0	contr
40057547	Effects of heavy metals on variation in bacterial communities in farmland soil of tailing dam collapse area.	Heavy metals are commonly present in polluted soil in mining areas. In this study, we investigated 10 sites of farmland soil in the heavy metal tailing dam collapse area (TDCA) with the dominant phyla Acidobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. The heavy metal dam collapse area is a composite contamination area of multiple heavy metals, with Cd, Pb and Zn being the most severely contaminated, and the levels of Hg and Cu exceeding the screening values at some of the sites. The Shannon, Chao1 and ACE indices revealed high microbial diversity but low relative abundance of microorganisms at the severely polluted TDCA1 and TDCA3 sites. The results of redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that Hg (Max = 4.31 mg/kg) and Cu (Max = 100 mg/kg) were important factors affecting soil microbial community in the TDCA compared to other heavy metals. Correlation analysis of heavy metals with microbial communities showed that RB41 (Acidobacteria) was more resistant to high concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn pollution. The genera of UTCFX1 (Chloroflxi) and norank_TRA3-20 had strong tolerance to the heavy metal Hg. Cu was significantly negatively correlated with norank_WD2101_soil_group (P < 0.05). Therefore these can be used as indicators for monitoring potential heavy metal contamination. The results can be used to predict the changes in the ecosystem of the mining area to maintain its ecological balance and health.	0	contr
40060268	Individual and Interactive Effects of Temperature and Watering Regime on Canola Growth and Physiological Characteristics.	Although many studies have considered the effects of temperature and water on plants, the combined effects of these factors on canola (<i>Brassica napus</i>) growth, physiological traits, and fatty acids require more attention. Canola is an important oilseed crop in Canada and around the world and fatty acids act as regulators of stress signaling. We grew plants under two temperature regimes (22°C/18°C and 28°C/24°C; 16 h light and 8 h dark) and two watering regimes (well-watered and water stressed) in controlled-environment growth chamber for 3 weeks after 1 week of initial growth under 22°C/18°C. We measured growth, biomass, photosynthesis, fatty acids, and other physiological traits of plants. With respect to plant growth and physiological traits, as individual factor, higher temperatures decreased stem diameter, specific leaf mass, leaf water potential, and flavonoids, whereas water stress decreased stem height and diameter, leaf area and number, leaf mass, net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, transpiration, and stomatal conductance, but increased leaf mass ratio (leaf dry mass/plant dry mass). In terms of interaction, higher temperatures increased plant biomass, chlorophyll (Chl) <i>a</i>, carotenoids, and total Chl in the well-watered plants, but decreased all these traits in the water-stressed plants. With respect to fatty acids as individual factor, higher temperatures decreased tricosanoic acid (C23:0), but increased heptadecanoic acid (C17:0). In terms of interaction, higher temperatures decreased <i>cis</i>-10-heptadecenoic acid (C17:1), elaidic acid (C18:1), arachidic acid (C20:0), and <i>cis</i>-11,14-eicosadienoic acid (C20:2) in the water-stressed plants. Lower temperatures also decreased C17:1, C18:1, and C20:2 in the water-stressed plants. Overall, palmitoleic acid (C16:1) was higher in the stem than in the leaf. This study revealed that higher temperatures combined with water stress decreased some physiological traits and fatty acids and, in turn, plant biomass. Further studies are required to determine the effects of multiple climate change components on fatty acids in canola and other oilseed crops.	0	contr
40066371	Robotic animals as new tools in rodent neuroscience research: proposed applications of zooinspired robots for mouse behavioral testing.	Bioinspired robots are machines which reproduce structural or functional features of a living organism. In particular, the bioinspired robots which reproduce features of animals can be more specifically defined as zooinspired robots. Currently, the applications of animal robots are various and range across different fields, such as, for instance, nature conservation, search and rescue of humans after natural or man-made disasters, exploration of extraterrestrial environments and robotic pets for elderly people under care for dementia. Several animal species have been imitated up to now, from lizards to butterflies, and from fish to dogs. Animal robots used to investigate the social behavior of an animal species through animal-robot interactions are called ethorobots. Intriguingly, ethorobots are able to reproduce in the laboratory behaviors that are generally produced spontaneously in nature and are difficult or impossible to evoke and modulate in captive animals, which makes these animal robots particularly useful tools for experimental ethology and ethological neuroscience. Rodents, primarily mice and rats, are the most common animal model in biomedical research. Coherently with the importance of these species for scientific research, robotic mice and rats have been attracting increasing efforts in bioinspired robotics over the course of the past five decades. The technological advancement of animal robots will make their employment for scientific research increasingly useful. However, clear experimental applications of animal robots should be identified in order to challenge engineers to design robots that can serve these experimental scopes. In the present work, we will describe possible practical applications of robotic animals for mouse behavioral testing across six different behavioral domains, namely courtship, parental care, antipredatory behavior, helping behavior, predation and territory defense-related aggression. In particular, we will outline how robotic animals could be employed to interact with living mice in a series of specific tests of social behavior. Finally, in the conclusion we will consider the ethical and epistemological advantages of the use of robotic animals in behavioral neuroscience. Indeed, robotic animals can benefit scientific research on social behaviors both in terms of optimized animal welfare of the tested subjects and of extended opportunities of experimental designing due to an unprecedented control over the independent variables.	0	contr

40066286	Connexin hemichannels and early atrophic signaling in muscle during sepsis.	Sepsis pathogenesis is complex, and effective treatments are limited, leading to high mortality rates between 20% and 55%. Early identification of factors contributing to sepsis-related muscle dysfunction is critical for risk stratification and potential therapeutic development. The immune response during sepsis affects skeletal muscles, contributing to organ dysfunction and worsening prognosis. In this study, we explore the role of connexin hemichannels (Cx HCs) in the early changes in muscle homeostasis during sepsis. Using a cecal ligature and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis model, we assessed IL-6 levels, weight loss, myofiber cross-sectional area, resting membrane potential, and connexin expression in control and Cx43/Cx45-deficient mice. CLP induced IL-6 elevation, sarcolemma permeabilization, reduced membrane potential, and activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in control mice, while Cx43/45-deficient mice exhibited reduced all CLP-induced muscle alterations. These findings suggest that Cx43 and Cx45 are involved in the early development of muscle alterations during sepsis.	0	contr

40066462	Exploring the plant growth promoting attributes of pteridophyte-associated microbiome for agricultural sustainability.	Pteridophytes, encompassing ferns and fern allies, are integral components of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. These vascular plants characterized by their spore-based reproduction, fulfil various ecological roles such as influencing biodiversity, soil stability, nutrient dynamics, and ecological succession. Similar to higher plants, pteridophytes too are known to have close symbiotic associations with a diverse array of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. Exploring the microbial diversity in pteridophytes has prospects both in pure and applied research. Research on pteridophyte microbial communities have revealed their role in plant growth promotion, nutrient acquisition and tolerance against stresses. Besides, it would be interesting to unravel the microbial diversity associated with pteridophytes, which are the first vascular plants. Further, study of pteridophytes-associated microbes would also help in conservation programmes of these rare and endangered group of plants. In spite of the immense potential of pteridophyte microbiome, only few studies have been undertaken in this area, thereby creating a huge research gap. Hence, this review compiles pteridophyte microbiome research, and explores its prospects in agricultural sustainability. Our literature survey sheds light on the tremendous potential of pteridophyte-associated microbes as plant growth promoters and biocontrol agents for sustainable agriculture, which is highly relevant in the era of climate change.	0	contr
40065001	Constraints of weathering intensity in different climate zones on coal accumulation environment.	There are currently multiple hypotheses regarding coal accumulation models, each with certain limitations in applicability. This article investigates the relationship between modern sedimentation, soil and climate to analyze the distribution of coal across different geological periods, aiming to explain the coal accumulation environment within a unified theoretical framework. The research concludes that the intensity of weathering in various climate zones is a determining factor influencing coal formation, which also affects the distribution of two other climate-sensitive sedimentary deposits - evaporite and bauxite. These three types of sedimentary minerals can be considered as paleoclimatic indicators: cold and humid, warm and dry, and hot and humid. Furthermore, the impact of temperature on the mineralization of organic matter is significantly greater than that of redox conditions; in general, the mineralization of organic matter in high-temperature environments at mid-to-low latitudes exceeds productivity, resulting in low carbon sequestration rates. The conclusion drawn is that the optimal environment for peat or coal enrichment exists in a cold-humid climate zone characterized by low primary productivity, rather than in a tropical zone with high primary productivity. Additionally, the latitudinal shifts of cold temperate climate-controlled coal distribution, and the sediment types in these three climate zones sufficiently constrain coal-forming environments.	0	contr
40063773	First Report of Brown Stripe Disease Caused by <i>Paracidovorax oryzae</i> on Rice in Guangxi (China).	Rice, being the most important food crop in China, is also the world's largest producer and consumer, accounting for 30% of global production and consumption. In 2023, brown stripes were observed on the leaf sheaths of diseased rice seedlings in a Jingxi rice field (22°51'N, 105°56'E) in Guangxi, China. The investigated area of rice fields, which was about 1.5 hectares, had an estimated disease incidence of 15 ± 5%. Leaf samples exhibiting symptoms of suspected brown stripe disease was collected and stored at 4 °C for bacterial isolation. The junction margins of lesions were surface-sterilized with 75% ethanol-saturated cotton swabs, and sterilized scissors were used to excise leaf sections (5 mm × 5 mm) from the diseased-healthy tissue interfaces. Within a sterile environment, these leaf fragments were soaked in 75% ethanol for three minutes, then ground and cultured on KB medium at a temperature of 28 °C for two days. A single colony (strain JX258) was then inoculated into sterile KB medium and incubated at 28 °C with a rotation speed of 220 rpm for 15 hours to obtain a bacterial suspension. Universal primers (27F/1492R) (Kinoshita et al., 2021) were used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene from strain JX258. A 1,394 bp fragment (GenBank PQ465223) amplified from strain JX258 was obtained and showed 97.80% sequence identity with Paracidovorax oryzae ATCC 19882 (Li, X et al. 2017). Specific primers (Aaaf3/ Aaar2, Aaaf3/ Aaar2) (Osdaghi E. 2023) successfully confirmed that this particular strain is indeed responsible for causing brown stripe disease in rice plants. Rice seeds were soaked in a bacterial suspension (1 × 10^6 CFU·mL⁻¹) for two days before undergoing germination followed by sowing in perlite under moist conditions (Supplemental Figures 1A-D). Brown lesions developed on leaves by 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), whereas mock-inoculated controls (10 mM MgCl₂) remained symptom-free. The seedlings soaked in a suspension of strain JX258 exhibited significantly reduced viability, germination, height, and growth rate, ultimately leading to seed mortality. Moreover, healthy rice leaves that were treated with a bacterial suspension (1 × 10^4 CFU·mL⁻¹) via spray inoculation, resulted in the manifestation of brown rice stripe disease symptoms within 7 days post-inoculation, P. oryzae was reisolated from the infected rice leaves, similar to those observed in the field, fulfilling Koch's postulates (Supplemental Figures 1E-F). The whole genome of JX258 was sequenced using the Sanger method, assembled, and analyzed to identify the strain at the species level. Whole-genome sequencing of JX258 (GenBank JBHJCP000000000.1) revealed 91.20% digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and 98.14% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with P. oryzae ATCC 19882 (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013; Yoon et al., 2017). In the Biolog Microbial Identification System, Version 4.2 (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA), JX258 showed a similarity with a match probability of 73% to Paracidovorax avenae. The utilization of the unique carbon source on BIOLOG GEN III reagent strip by JX258 is shown in Supplemental Table 1. The pathogen was identified as Paracidovorax oryzae based on technological means of pathogenicity assessment, biochemical analysis, phylogenetic analysis (Supplemental Figure 1G), and molecular characterization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Paracidovorax oryzae causing brown stripe disease on rice in Guangxi, China. Therefore, phytosanitary measures have to be implemented to prevent the introduction and spread of the pathogen in other areas.	0	contr

40054360	Localized nutrient management practices enhance the environmental-economic sustainability in potato production of China.	Potatoes, as the fourth most important staple crop in China, play a crucial role in ensuring national food security. However, potato production is heavily reliant on inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, leading to significant environmental challenges that compromise the sustainability of this production. A systematic evaluation of the current state of potato production sustainability in China and its potential for improvement is an urgent scientific issue that needs to be addressed. This study employs emergy sustainability index (ESI), energy return on investment (EROI), energy efficiency cost (EEC), and energy exchange ratio (EnER) methods to assess the environmental and economic aspects of potato production at the county level in China. Results indicate that, in 2015, the average ESI, EROI, EEC, and EnER for potato production in China were 1.37 (0.1-5.4), 2.21 (0.18-7.44), 0.06 (0.01-0.48) $/MJ, and 13.52 (2.68-112.40) MJ/$, respectively, with considerable spatial heterogeneity at the county level. Regions with higher sustainability in potato production are primarily concentrated in the northwest, which is also China's main potato-growing area. The random forest analysis identified yield, phosphorus, and nitrogen fertilizers as key factors influencing the sustainability of potato production. Regionally differentiated fertilizer management strategies led to a 43% and 35% increase in ESI and EROI, respectively, while EEC and EnER decreased by 50% and 47%. This study systematically explores the relationship between the environmental and economic dimensions of potato production from an energy perspective and proposes optimized management strategies for synergistic environmental-economic development. It provides methodological support and scientific guidance for promoting sustainable potato production and offers insights for global potato sustainability systems.	0	contr

Atherosclerosis (AS)-related cardiovascular disease and depression are often comorbid, with patients with cardiovascular disease facing an increased risk of depression, which worsens AS. Both diseases are characterized by oxidative stress and lipid metabolism disorders. Ferroptosis, a form of cell death characterized by iron overload and harmful lipid peroxide accumulation, is found in various diseases, including AS and depression. Consistent with the iron deposition and lipid peroxidation (LPO) that characterize the ferroptosis mechanism, disturbances in iron and lipid metabolism are also crucial pathogenic mechanisms in AS and depression. The comorbid mechanisms are complex, posing challenges for clinical treatment. Chinese herbs hold significant potential owing to their multi-target pharmacological effects. Therefore, this review aims to investigate iron overload, LPO, and ferroptosis across various cell types, the shared pathogenesis of AS and depression with ferroptosis, and research on Chinese herbal medicine targeting ferroptosis in the treatment of anti-AS co-depression. This provides a comprehensive understanding of AS co-depression disease from the perspective of ferroptosis.	0	contr

Head injuries are a major health care concern that can produce many long lasting cognitive, mental, and physical problems. An emerging literature indicates increased impulsivity in patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). In a recent study, Veterans with clinically-assessed history of mild TBI had increased cognitive, but not motor, impulsivity. Cognitive impulsivity refers to a preference for smaller immediate rewards (<i>i.e.</i>, less willing to wait for larger rewards) while motor impulsivity refers to difficulty inhibiting a motor response.

40066098	An overview of the current evidences on the role of iron in colorectal cancer: a review.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and lethal malignancy that affects millions of people worldwide. Iron is an essential micronutrient that plays a vital role in various biological processes, but also has pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects that may contribute to carcinogenesis. The relationship between iron and CRC is complex and influenced by multiple factors, such as dietary intake, absorption, storage, metabolism, and excretion of iron, as well as genetic and environmental factors that modulate iron homeostasis. This review article aims to provide an overview of the current evidences on the role of iron in CRC, discussing the potential mechanisms by which iron may affect CRC development and progression, as well as the implications for prevention and treatment. This review tries to focus on the following aspects: an introduction to iron and its role in CRC, role of heme and non-heme iron in CRC, dietary patterns, nutrition, and CRC, iron overload in CRC, iron deficiency and its role in CRC especially in surgery outcome and iron therapy and blood transfusion in CRC.	0	contr
40066272	The landscape of biofilm models for phage therapy: mimicking biofilms in diabetic foot ulcers using 3D models.	Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) affect up to 15-25% of patients suffering from diabetes and are considered a global health concern. These ulcers may result in delayed wound healing and chronic infections, with the potential to lead to amputations. It has been estimated that 85% of diabetes-related amputations are preceded by a diagnosis of DFU. A critical factor in the persistence of this disease is the presence of polymicrobial biofilms, which generally include <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The involvement of diabetic comorbidities such as ischemia, hyperglycemia, and immune-compromised status creates a perfect niche for these bacteria to evade the body's immune response and persist as biofilms. Bacteriophage therapy can target and lyse specific bacteria and is emerging as an effective treatment for biofilm-related infections. While this treatment shows promise in addressing chronic wounds, our current models, including animal and static systems, fail to capture the full complexity of DFU.

40065769	Unveiling functional module associated with fungal disease stress in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>).	Fungal infections pose a considerable threat to the cultivation of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and often limit the crop yield. During infection, the transcriptome undergoes extensive reprogramming involving several regulatory pathways. To address this complexity, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis and co-expression network analysis using rigorously curated RNA-seq datasets from three different fungal diseases. Pre-processing of the data, including batch effect correction, ensured high-quality integration of the datasets. Module-trait relationship (MTR) analysis identified functional modules associated with fungal disease response. Hub genes within these modules were prioritized by multi-model centrality analyses using Cytoscape, which considered the metrics Degree, Closeness, Betweenness and Maximum Clique Centrality together with the MCODE algorithm to detect densely connected subclusters. These hub genes were further validated by cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and achieved AUC values greater than 0.7, confirming their robustness. A total of 6688 consistently expressed genes were identified, including 879 upregulated and 701 downregulated genes. Co-expression networks revealed 19 different gene modules, six of which were significantly associated with the response of barley to fungal infection. The blue module in particular was associated with immune responses such as activation of the MAPK cascade and pathogen recognition, while the green module correlated with defence mechanisms and secondary metabolism. The hub genes within these modules showed high predictive power for fungal resistance, as shown by the AUC values of the ROC curve of over 0.7, emphasizing their potential as biomarkers. This study uniquely integrates multiple RNA-seq datasets to identify novel regulatory networks and hub genes, including 345 transcription factors (TFs) from different families, with MYB and bHLH being particularly abundant. The results provide valuable insights into regulatory networks associated with fungal disease response in barley. These results can support genomic selection and marker-assisted breeding programs and accelerate the development of resistant varieties.	0	contr

40052072	﻿Just the tip of the iceberg: uncovering a hyperdiverse clade of African <i>Russula</i> (<i>Basidiomycota</i>, <i>Russulales</i>, <i>Russulaceae</i>) species with signs of evolutionary habitat adaptations.	"The diversity within the ectomycorrhizal genus Russula (Basidiomycota) in West Africa is largely unexplored. The study area was Benin, where only ten out of the 159 species endemic to tropical Africa have been previously reported. We focused on ""<i>Afrovirescentinae</i>"", which is a monophyletic lineage within Russulasubgen.Heterophyllidiaesister tosubsect.Virescentinae. The phylogenetic placement of this clade was analysed using sequence data from ITS, LSU, mtSSU, <i>tef1</i>, <i>rpb1</i> and <i>rpb2</i> regions. Ten ""<i>Afrovirescentinae</i>"" species are recognised, described and illustrated from Benin. Four of them, <i>R.carmesina</i>, <i>R.hiemisilvae</i>, <i>R.inflata</i> and <i>R.sublaevis</i>, were previously published. Five species, <i>Russulaacrialbida</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, <i>R.beenkenii</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, <i>R.coronata</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, <i>R.florae</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> and <i>R.spectabilis</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, are newly described. Species within this group are characterised by densely reticulated spore ornamentation, but they exhibit considerable variation in field appearance and pileipellis structure. In gallery forests, their basidiomata are ephemeral, small and their basidiospores have prominent ornamentation; while in savannah woodlands, the basidiomata are fleshy, large and basidiospores present low ornamentation. We suggest that these morphological traits may represent evolutionary adaptations to a specific environmental condition. We analysed the species richness, ecological range and distribution of the ""<i>Afrovirescentinae</i>"" clade globally based on data from the UNITE database, estimating a total diversity of 94 species primarily distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in the Neotropics. Four additional previously described species not detected in Benin were assigned to this clade, based on holotype sequencing. Several species are widely distributed across tropical Africa and do not show specificity regarding their associated plant symbionts."	0	contr

Abnormal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications were associated with the occurrence, development, and metastasis of cancer. However, the functions and mechanisms of m6A regulators in cancer remained largely elusive and should be explored. Here, we identified that insulin like growth Factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) was specifically overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, IGF2BP3 promoted HCC cells progression in an m6A-dependent manner, IGF2BP3 silencing significantly inhibited proliferation and migratory ability of tumor cells in vitro and in in vivo. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 interacted with minichromosomal maintenance complex component (MCM10) mRNAs to prolong stability of m6A-modified RNA. Therefore, our findings indicated that m6A reader IGF2BP3 contributed to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis, providing a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.	0	contr

40055393	Seasonal dynamics of thraustochytrids in mangrove rhizospheres for microbial interactions, PUFA production.	This study investigated seasonal variations of thraustochytrids in rhizosphere soil collected from two mangrove species Rhizophora apiculata and Avicennia marina in natural and planted mangrove stands. Thraustochytrid counts were higher in the natural mangrove stand than in the planted site. The counts varied seasonally, being highest in the post-monsoon season followed by summer, monsoon, and pre-monsoon. Thraustochytrid counts exhibited positive correlations (p < 0.01) with counts of Total heterotrophic bacteria (THB), azotobacters, actinobacteria, fungi, yeasts, and Trichoderma. However, a negative correlation was observed with cyanobacteria. The counts also had positive correlation with silt, clay, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, chromium, copper, magnesium, cadmium, zinc and redox potential, but, negative correlations with temperature, pH, pore water salinity, total organic carbon and sand content of the soil samples. In the present study, 113 thraustochytrid strains were isolated from mangrove habitats. However, only 48 pure cultures survived after being sub-cultured three times. Based on survivability, color, and shape, two isolates from each sampling site in each season were selected. The predominant 24 isolates were identified based on their morphological, and molecular characteristics and were classified under five genera: Thraustochytrium, Schizochytrium, Botryochytrium, Parietichytrium, and Aurantiochytrium. Among the isolates, Aurantiochytrium sp. (AKTSK-06) produced the highest biomass of 15.71 g/L in the post-monsoon season (January-March, 2023), and Aurantiochytrium sp. (PVTSK-03) accumulated the highest lipid content of 61.33%. Thraustochytrids were found to contain Omega-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as EPA up to 8.89% in Aurantiochytrium sp. (VRTSK-01), DPA up to 9.65% in Aurantiochytrium sp. (AKTSK-03), and DHA up to 47.46% in Aurantiochytrium sp. (AKTSK-06). Thus, mangroves provide an ideal ecological niche for thraustochytrids with an abundant supply of omega-3 fatty acids for potential industrial applications.	0	contr
40064918	Interleukin-16 enhances anti-tumor immune responses by establishing a Th1 cell-macrophage crosstalk through reprogramming glutamine metabolism in mice.	Overcoming immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for developing novel cancer immunotherapies. Here, we report that IL-16 administration enhances the polarization of T helper 1 (Th1) cells by inhibiting glutamine catabolism through the downregulation of glutaminase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and increases the production of Th1 effector cytokine IFN-γ, thus improving anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, we find that establishing an IL-16-dependent, Th1-dominant TME relies on mast cell-produced histamine and results in the increased expression of the CXCR3 ligands in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), thereby improving the therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Cancer patients exhibit impaired production of IL-16, which correlates with poorer prognosis. Additionally, low IL-16 production is associated with unresponsiveness to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Collectively, our findings provided new insights into the biological function of IL-16, emphasizing its potential clinical significance as a therapeutic approach to augment anti-tumor immunity and sensitize ICB-based cancer immunotherapy.	0	contr
40066327	An Unexplored Diversity for Adaptation of Germination to High Temperatures in <i>Brassica</i> Species.	Elevated temperatures inhibit the germination of a concerning number of crop species. One strategy to mitigate the impact of warming temperatures is to identify and introgress adaptive genes into elite germplasm. Diversity must be sought in wild populations, coupled with an understanding of the complex pattern of adaptation across a broad range of landscapes. By investigating the landraces, wild, and feral populations of Algeria, Italy, France, Slovenia, Spain, and Tunisia, we assessed the response of germination to temperature increase in an unexplored diversity of 117 accessions of <i>Brassica rapa</i> and 66 of <i>Brassica oleracea</i>. Our results show that both species exhibit heat tolerance to the temperature range tested, especially <i>B. rapa</i>, with an increase in speed and uniformity of germination time, as well as an increase in germination rate as temperature increased. As for <i>B. oleracea</i> accessions, the ability to germinate under heat conditions depended on the geographical origin; in particular, southern populations showed a higher germination rate than northern populations, possibly in relation to their warmer climates of origin. These findings highlight the complex interplay between domestication, feralization, and current agronomic practices in shaping germination characteristics in <i>Brassica</i> species.	0	contr

40066622	Mpox virus poxin-schlafen fusion protein suppresses innate antiviral response by sequestering STAT2.	<b>ABSTRACT</b>Mpox virus (MPXV) has to establish efficient interferon (IFN) antagonism for effective replication. MPXV-encoded IFN antagonists have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the IFN antagonism of poxin-schlafen (PoxS) fusion gene of MPXV was characterized. MPXV PoxS was capable of decreasing cGAS-produced 2'3'-cGAMP, like its ortholog poxin of vaccinia virus, which is the first known cytosolic nuclease that hydrolyzes the 3'-5' bond of 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). However, MPXV PoxS did not suppress cGAS-STING-mediated type I IFN production. Instead, MPXV PoxS antagonized basal and type I IFN-induced expression of IFN-stimulated genes such as OAS1, SAMD9, SAMD9L, ISG15, ISG56 and IFIT3. Consistently, MPXV PoxS inhibited both basal and type I IFN-stimulated activity of interferon-stimulated response elements, but did not affect activation of IFN-γ-activated sites. Mechanistically, MPXV PoxS interacted with STAT2 and sequestered it in the cytoplasm. Both the viral schlafen fusion and the active site of 2'3'-cGAMP nuclease were required for STAT2 sequestration and consequent suppression of IFN-stimulated gene expression. MPXV PoxS conferred resistance to the suppression of MPXV replication by type I IFN. Taken together, our findings suggested that MPXV PoxS counteracts host antiviral response by sequestering STAT2 to circumvent basal and type I IFN-induced expression of antiviral genes.	0	contr

40064887	TET2 deficiency increases the competitive advantage of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells through upregulation of thrombopoietin receptor signaling.	Ten-Eleven Translocation-2 (TET2) mutations drive the expansion of mutant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). However, the precise mechanisms by which TET2 mutations confer a competitive advantage to HSCs remain unclear. Here, through an epigenetic drug screen, we discover that inhibition of disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L), a H3K79 methyltransferase, selectively reduces the fitness of Tet2 knockout (Tet2<sup>KO</sup>) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Mechanistically, we find that TET2 deficiency increases H3K79 dimethylation and expression of Mpl, which encodes the thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R). Correspondingly, TET2 deficiency is associated with a higher proportion of primitive Mpl-expressing (Mpl<sup>+</sup>) cells in the HSC compartment. Importantly, inhibition of Mpl expression or the signaling downstream of TPO-R is sufficient to reduce the competitive advantage of murine and human TET2-deficient HSPCs. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for aberrant TPO-R signaling in TET2 mutation-driven CH and uncover potential therapeutic strategies against this condition.	0	contr
40057549	A case study on thermal conductivity characteristics and prediction of rock and soil mass at a proposed ground source heat pump (GSHP) site.	Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) has a wide range of applications in the field of building cooling and heating. Ground source heat pump (GSHP) system is a technology to extract SGE. The design of borehole heat exchanger (BHE) has a great impact on heat transfer performance and investment cost, so it is important to accurately measure the thermal conductivity of rock and soil. Therefore, this study conducted field in-situ thermal response test (TRT) and laboratory sample test based on distributed optical fiber temperature sensor (DOFTS) in LY research area of Changchun, Northeast China. After comparing the differences and analyzing the reasons, an in-situ thermal conductivity prediction model was established based on artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm to predict in-situ thermal conductivity based on basic physical property parameters of laboratory tests. This model is used to supplement the layered thermal conductivity lacking in the CY study area. The results show that the distributed thermal conductivity can be obtained and the layered thermal conductivity can be calculated by improved combined thermal response test (ICTRT). The average layer thermal conductivity of laboratory test is about 12.2% lower than that of field test, but the thermal conductivity of the two test methods has the same variation trend along the depth. The thermal conductivity of rock mass is positively correlated with water content, negatively correlated with porosity and positively correlated with density. The result error of the in-situ thermal conductivity prediction model established by calculation is mainly within ± 5%, which is reliable and accurate. This model is used to supplement the layered thermal conductivity of the CY01 test hole. The research results can provide a new way to determine the thermal conductivity in SGE exploration.	0	contr
40064076	Effective microbial formulations using sustainable carriers for the remediation of plastic-affected soils.	The increasing use of mulching films in intensive agriculture, together with their inefficient end-of-life disposal, has led to a significant plastic accumulation in soils, which contributes to disrupting ecosystems. The aim of this work was to determine the ability of different sustainable carriers to harbor and introduce plastic-degrading microorganisms into contaminated soils to provide a biotechnological tool that potentially enhances plastic decontamination, ameliorating the harmful effect of this type of pollutant in soil. To this end, pure cultures and co-cultures of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas alloputida (specialized plastic-degrading strains) were added to three sustainable carriers (vermicompost, biochar, and calcium alginate beads) for the preparation of microbial formulations. After a storage period, the maintenance of cell viability and enzymatic activities related to the bioremediation potential of plastic materials of the inocula tested in the different microbial formulations (carrier + inoculant) were evaluated. The effectiveness of the formulations for plastic mineralization was tested by measuring CO2 emissions after two months. The results showed that biochar, followed by vermicompost, favored greater microbial survival (107 CFU g-1), while alginate formulations showed variable cell viability results, from 107 to 104 CFU g-1. Biochar also excelled in maintaining enzymatic activities related to plastic degradation, achieving the expression of 100% of the tested enzymes. Additionally, biochar-based formulations applied to soils contaminated with LLDPE plastic showed the highest mineralization rates, with statistically significant differences compared to the plastic-free control. These results lay the foundation for the development of new plastic decontamination technologies paving the way for the sustainable treatment of polluting and recalcitrant materials such as plastic.	0	contr

40054189	Methods to optimize the collection, pretreatment, extraction, separation, and examination of microplastics in soil, groundwater, and human samples.	Microplastics (MPs) in soil, groundwater, and human (SGH) present a significant global challenge due to their ecological and human health impacts. However, current protocols for detecting MPs in these environments and humans are limited, inconsistently applied, and vary significantly, particularly during the pretreatment stages of MP analysis. Moreover, no study has investigated the impact of methodological flaws on MP detection. This study conducted a thorough global assessment of the existing soil and groundwater (SG) pretreatment methods, using statistical tests to evaluate their effectiveness. It also reviewed filtration and analytical techniques for MPs in SGH samples. The analysis included research articles from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science published between 2015 and 2024. Findings show that pretreatment using more than 100 g of soil can impact MP quantification, likely due to soil heterogeneity, while groundwater volume did not significantly affect MP quantification, likely due to the homogeneity of groundwater. During SGH pretreatment, various salts (e.g., ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl) can be used for density flotation. Fenton's reagent was found to be a better choice than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for organic material removal because less heat was released. Post treatment MPs in SGH samples can be analyzed using various instruments and resolutions such as FTIR down to 1-5 µm, ATR-FTIR down to 2 µm, micro-Raman down to 500 nm, and LDIR down to 1 µm. This study lays the foundation for developing an effective MP analysis in SGH.	0	contr
40049114	Comprehensive ecological risk assessment method for multi-pesticide pollution in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, China.	Pesticide residues and their accumulation in marine environments pose potential threats to the ecosystem balance and human health. Assessment of pesticide residue levels and ecological risks in marine waters is insufficient. Therefore, we conducted a quantitative analysis of four different categories of pesticides in the surface waters of the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea in China. A comprehensive ecological risk assessment framework was constructed based on the importance of ecosystem services, utilizing the risk quotient (RQ) and entropy weighting methods to evaluate the multi-pesticide ecological risks in the study area. Thirteen pesticides were detected in the surface waters, with total concentration levels ranging from 8.18 to 80.60 ng/L, and the herbicide Atrazine and insecticide Imidacloprid were found at the highest levels. Concentration levels were higher in the Bohai Sea than in the Yellow Sea, and the highest area was mainly located on the coast of Shandong Province, China. The ecological risk of multi-pesticide pollution was the highest in the coastal regions of Shandong and was associated with Atrazine and Acetamiprid. Source analysis suggested that triazine herbicide and neonicotinoid insecticides are predominantly land-sourced, whereas sulfonylurea herbicides are primarily atmospheric. This study provides valuable support for formulating relevant environmental protection policies and measures.	1	pest

40051844	DROP app: A hydroclimate information service to deliver scientific rainfall, local rainfall, and soil moisture forecasts for agricultural decision-making.	Weather and Climate Information Services developed for agriculture often only provide scientific weather and climate forecasts on various timescales. Yet, local forecasts derived from indigenous knowledge and soil moisture information are still missing. In this study, we evaluate the implementation of the DROP app, a hydroclimate information service, offering both local (LF) and scientific rainfall forecasts (SF) and soil moisture forecasts, that was designed with and for smallholder farmers working on rainfed agriculture in northern Ghana. Results of the forecast assessment show that the LF generates a high probability of rain detection (POD), with a minimum value of 0.7. The hybrid forecast (HF) that integrates the SF and LF yields the highest POD value of 0.9 compared to others. However, the hybrid system also has a high number of false alarms which results in an overall lower forecast performance of HF compared to SF. Using forecasts obtained from the app, farmers adjusted their farming activities, such as time of sowing, planting and weeding dates, fertilizer and herbicide application, and harvesting. Although some limitations exist, the DROP app has potential to deliver actionable knowledge for climate-smart farm decision-making and thus, facilitate effective agriculture management.	1	pest
40036624	Monitoring insecticide resistance and target-site mutations in field populations of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in China.	The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a notorious invasive pest, has been widely monitored for insecticide resistance. Since its invasion of China in late 2018, early to mid-stage monitoring of resistance is particularly crucial to inform effective control strategies. Resistance ratios (RRs) derived from bioassays offer valuable insights into the overall resistance levels of field populations, while the detection of resistance allele frequencies helps uncover the potential causes of resistance variation. In this study, we established a baseline of susceptibility in third-instar larvae to 7 insecticides using a laboratory strain Xinzheng2019 and assessed the resistance levels of 9 populations collected from central and southern China between 2022 and 2023. Compared to the susceptible Xinzheng2019 strain, 2 field populations showed low-level resistance (RR = 5-10) to indoxacarb, and one exhibited low-level resistance to chlorantraniliprole. Minor resistance (RR = 3-5) was observed in 2 populations to lambda-cyhalothrin, 5 to indoxacarb, and 5 to chlorantraniliprole. All populations remained susceptible (RR < 3) to spinetoram, emamectin benzoate, chlorfenapyr, and lufenuron. Molecular analysis of 11 mutation sites across 3 key resistance-related genes (Ace-1, GluCl, and voltage-gated sodium channel [VGSC]) revealed that 52.1% of all tested samples carried either homozygous or heterozygous resistance alleles at the F290V locus of the Ace-1 gene, while no resistance mutations were detected at other sites. Our findings offer valuable insights into the insecticide resistance status of S. frugiperda field populations in China and provide guidance for effective chemical insecticide use.	1	pest

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biobased and biodegradable polymers that offer a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics, addressing the escalating concerns over plastic pollution. While their environmental advantages are well-documented, the efficient degradation of PHAs in natural and engineered environments remains a critical component of their lifecycle. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PHA-degrading bacteria isolated from diverse ecosystems and highlights the pivotal role of PHA depolymerases in achieving PHA circularity. Microbial adaptation to diverse environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, salinity, and pH, significantly influences enzymes properties, including the stability, activity, and substrate specificity of PHA-degrading enzymes. These adaptations often enhance enzyme, performance, enabling functionality under challenging conditions. Consequently, extremophilic microorganisms are invaluable resources for discovering and engineering robust PHA depolymerases for industrial and environmental applications.

40052218	MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 synergistically regulate arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and the transcription of MdPHT1;13, enhancing phosphorus uptake in apple rootstocks.	Phosphorus in the soil is easily chelated into forms that are unavailable to plants, leading to phosphorus deficiency, which severely affects the growth, development, and fruit quality of apple trees. To address phosphorus deficiency, we used four different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to investigate their effects on the growth and development of apple rootstocks and phosphorus uptake in the soil. We identified Glomus mosseae (Gm) fungi as the most effective AMF for promoting growth and found that under phosphorus-deficient conditions, inoculating with Gm fungi promoted the growth of the above-ground parts of the plants and phosphorus absorption, while it inhibited root growth. After inoculating with Gm fungi, we found phosphorus starvation response factors (PHRs) and auxin response factors (ARFs) were upregulated. Knockdown of MdPHR2 or MdARF6-4 resulted in decreased root arbuscular structures, total mycorrhizal colonization rate, and root phosphorus content, indicating that MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 positively regulate the symbiosis of Gm fungi and phosphorus absorption. In contrast, overexpressing MdARF6-4 led to reduced root development but increased root phosphorus content under Gm fungi inoculation, suggesting that MdARF6-4 is involved in Gm-mediated phosphorus absorption and root development. Moreover, both MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 directly bound to the promoter area of the downstream phosphorus transporter MdPHT1;13, and these two transcription factors interacted with each other in vivo and in vitro. In summary, our study demonstrates that the interaction between MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 synergistically regulates the Gm symbiosis and the transcription of MdPHT1;13, thereby promoting phosphorus absorption in apple rootstocks.	0	contr
40066175	Augmenting the human interactome for disease prediction through gene networks inferred from human cell atlas.	Gene co-expression network inference from bulk tissue samples often misses cell-type-specific interactions, which can be detected through single-cell gene expression data. However, the noise and sparsity of single-cell data challenge the inference of these networks. We developed scNET, a framework for integrative cell-type-specific co-expression network inference from single-cell transcriptome data, demonstrating its utility in augmenting the human interactome for more accurate disease gene prediction. We address the limitations of <i>de novo</i> network inference from single-cell expression data through dropout imputation, metacell formation, and data transformation. Employing this data preprocessing pipeline, we inferred cell-type-specific co-expression links from single-cell atlas data, covering various cell types and tissues, and integrated over 850K of these inferred links into a preexisting human interactome, HumanNet, resulting in HumanNet-plus. This integration notably enhanced the accuracy of network-based disease gene prediction. These findings suggest that with proper data preprocessing, network inference from single-cell gene expression data can be highly effective, potentially enriching the human interactome and advancing the field of network medicine.	0	contr

With the explosive growth of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), research on the recycling of spent batteries is widely conducted. However, conventional processes involve complex procedures, high costs, and environmental issues. This study introduces the electrochemical upcycling of spent LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LMO) cathode material, incorporating pre-filtration (PF) and pre-reduction (PR) processes to enable its direct application in redox flow batteries (RFBs). Moreover, a double membrane system is applied to address the low operating voltage and energy density by balancing the different pH levels of the zinc anode and manganese cathode. The aqueous zinc-manganese RFB, derived from spent LMO pouch full cells, achieves coulombic efficiency of 90% and energy efficiency (EE) exceeding 70% over 250 cycles. The LMO-containing electrolyte is further treated to precipitate the manganese ions by a simple pH adjustment, enabling 100% separation of lithium, thereby enhancing the sustainability of rare metal resources. This work presents a remarkable advancement in the upcycling method of LIB cathode materials and contributes to establishing a circular system for battery materials.	0	contr

40058208	Effects of microplastics on black soil health: A global meta-analysis.	Microplastics (MPs) have garnered widespread attention as an emerging global contaminant. However, the impacts of MPs on black soil health remain unclear. A meta-analysis of 337 cases from 33 studies was conducted to elucidate the effects of MPs on black soil health. The analysis incorporated 35 indicators, including soil properties, soil enzymes, plant growth, soil animal health, and soil microbial diversity. We investigated the effects of MPs properties, such as particle type, size, concentration, and exposure duration, on soil health. Results showed that MPs led to notable increases in SOM, DOC, available nitrogen by 31.84 %, 14.35 %, and 12.45 %, respectively, while decreasing nitrate nitrogen by 12.89 %. In addition, MPs exposure enhanced soil urease activity by 11.24 % but reduced phosphatase activity by 6.62 %. MPs also diminished microbial alpha-diversity, caused oxidative damage in earthworms, and suppressed plant germination rates. Notably, smaller MPs, higher concentrations, longer exposure periods, and conventional MPs have more detrimental effects on soil health. By applying the entropy weight method combined with the analytical hierarchy process, we quantified the overall impact of MPs on black soil health as a 12.09 % decrease. Our findings underscore the risks of persistent MPs pollution to black soil health.	0	contr

40066395	Anatomical Variations in Nasal Cavities and Paranasal Sinuses on Computed Tomography in Chronic Rhinosinusitis: Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment.	Chronic rhinosinusitis is a prevalent condition characterized by inflammation of the nasal and paranasal sinus cavities, significantly impacting quality of life and healthcare utilization. Computed tomography imaging is vital in assessing anatomical variations that may contribute to chronic rhinosinusitis pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify anatomical variations in the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses using CT imaging and explore their relationship with sinus mucosal abnormalities. 154 chronic rhinosinusitis patients were recruited. The study revealed a high prevalence of anatomical variations, with deviated nasal septum being the most common (71.4%), followed by Agger nasi cell (66.2%), spur formation (51.3%), ICA into the sphenoid sinus (44.8%) and Concha bullosa (34.4%). Most anatomical variations are commonly found on both sides. Significant correlations were found between some variations and sinusitis involvement on the same side. However, no significant correlations were observed between angles of septal deviation and CRS incidence. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing anatomical variations in CRS management to mitigate risks and improve treatment outcomes. Further research, including a comparison group of patients without CRS, would provide a comprehensive understanding of the anatomical variations observed in the study.	0	contr

40059763	The potential of silicon in crop protection against phloem feeding and chewing insect pests - a review.	As future crop production is threatened by the increasing incidence of insect pests caused by changing climate, it is crucial to focus on searching for alternative methods of insect pest management. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the effect of silicon (Si) on the incidence, growth, development, longevity, survival, feeding efficiency, and reproduction parameters of phloem sap feeding and chewing insects of plants. While Si may negatively impact the biological parameters of both insect guilds, the effect is generally more pronounced in chewing insects, and often varies under different cultivation conditions. In addition to the direct effect of Si on insect pest performance, the potential mechanisms of Si-mediated resistance of infested plants are discussed. These involve increasing plant mechanical properties (Si-based or other organic barriers), and boosting biochemical defence responses, such as increased antioxidant activity, stimulated activity of defence enzymes, attraction of parasitoids and predators of insect pests, and synthesis of toxic and taste repelling compounds. These changes create a complex Si-induced defence system that enables infested plants to better withstand insect pest attack, ultimately reducing pest damage and improving agricultural crop yields.	0	contr

40066385	Prevalence of Elevated IgG4 in Patients with Nasopharynx and Laryngopharynx Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Elevated Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels have been implicated in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including those affecting the nasopharynx and laryngopharynx. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated IgG4 and associated risk factors in patients with nasopharynx and laryngopharynx diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was performed from inception until July 2024. Keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms A random-effects model was used to pool prevalence estimates, and heterogeneity was assessed using the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test.From 922 records, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of elevated IgG4 levels was 33.9% (95% CI: 19.1%-52.6%), with significant heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 85.433%, P < 0.001). The highest frequency was reported in a Chinese study (96.9%), and the lowest in a Turkish study (0.2%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results, and no significant bias was detected. The findings illustrated a high level of elevated IgG4 levels among patients with nasopharynx and laryngopharynx diseases, with considerable variability across different populations and settings, highlighting the need for further research to understand the clinical implications and diagnostic utility of IgG4 in ENT diseases.	0	contr
40064933	Relating the molecular phenotype of ulcerative colitis to the clinical course.	The expanding portfolio of targeted therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC) suggests that a more precise approach to defining disease activity will aid clinical decision-making. This prospective study used genome-wide microarrays to characterize gene expression in biopsies from the most inflamed colon segments from patients with UC and analyzed associations between molecular changes and short-term outcomes while on standard-of-care treatment. We analyzed 141 biopsies-128 biopsies from 112 UC patients and 13 biopsies from eight inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) patients. Endoscopic disease was associated with expression of innate immunity transcripts, e.g. complement factor B (CFB); inflammasome genes (ZBP1 and PIM2); calprotectin (S100A8 and S100A9); and inflammation-, injury-, and innate immunity-associated pathway analysis terms. A cross-validated molecular machine learning classifier trained on the endoscopic Mayo subscore predicted the endoscopic Mayo subscore with area-under-the-curve of 0.85. A molecular calprotectin transcript score showed strong associations with fecal calprotectin and the endoscopic Mayo subscore. Logistic regression models showed that molecular features (e.g. molecular classifier and molecular calprotectin scores) improved the prediction of disease progression over conventional, clinical features alone (e.g. total Mayo score, fecal calprotectin, physician global assessment). The molecular features of UC showed strong correlations with disease activity and permitted development of machine-learning predictive disease classifiers that can be applied to expanded testing in diverse cohorts.	0	contr
40065499	The transcription factor RIP140 regulates interferon γ signaling in breast cancer.	RIP140 (receptor interacting protein of 140 kDa) is an important player in breast cancer (BC) by regulating key cellular pathways such as nuclear hormone receptor signaling. In order to identify additional genes specifically regulated by RIP140 in BC, we performed a transcriptomic analysis after silencing its expression in MCF-7 cells. We identified the interferon γ (IFNγ) signaling as being substantially repressed by RIP140 knockdown. Using the GBP1 (guanylate binding protein 1) gene as a reporter of IFNγ signaling, we demonstrated its robust induction by RIP140 through an ISRE motif, leading to a significant reduction of its induction upon IFNγ treatment. Furthermore, we showed that low levels of RIP140 amplified the IFNγ-dependent inhibition of BC cell proliferation. In line with these data, reanalysis of transcriptomic data obtained in human BC samples revealed that IFNγ levels were associated with good prognosis only for BC patients exhibiting tumors expressing low levels of RIP140, thus confirming its effect on the anti-tumor activity of IFNγ provided by our experimental data. Altogether, this study identifies RIP140 as a new regulator of IFNγ signaling in breast tumorigenesis.	0	contr
40065146	Mitochondrial genetics, signalling and stress responses.	Mitochondria are multifaceted organelles with crucial roles in energy generation, cellular signalling and a range of synthesis pathways. The study of mitochondrial biology is complicated by its own small genome, which is matrilineally inherited and not subject to recombination, and present in multiple, possibly different, copies. Recent methodological developments have enabled the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in large-scale cohorts and highlight the far-reaching impact of mitochondrial genetic variation. Genome-editing techniques have been adapted to target mtDNA, further propelling the functional analysis of mitochondrial genes. Mitochondria are finely tuned signalling hubs, a concept that has been expanded by advances in methodologies for studying the function of mitochondrial proteins and protein complexes. Mitochondrial respiratory complexes are of dual genetic origin, requiring close coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear gene-expression systems (transcription and translation) for proper assembly and function, and recent findings highlight the importance of the mitochondria in this bidirectional signalling.	0	contr

40065494	The DNA N6-adenine methylation target gene GhMAF1 promotes fiber initiation at the base of Gossypium ovules.	DNA methylation consists of 5-methylcytosine and N6-methyl deoxyadenosine (6mA) and is crucial in plant development. However, its specific role and potential mechanism to initiate cotton fibers remain unclear. This study employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to analyze DNA methylation alterations in ZM24 and ZM24 fuzzless-lintless (ZM24fl) during fiber initiation. Our results indicated that DNA 6mA methylation exhibited the most remarkable difference among ovule samples at -2, 0, and 5 d post anthesis of ZM24 and ZM24fl. Subsequently, genes with significant changes in DNA 6mA methylation and transcription during fiber initiation were screened. We found that GhMAF1 displayed significant transcriptional upregulation and 6mA enrichment in its promoter, which could serve as a potential target for DNA 6mA in fiber initiation. Further, we knocked out GhMAF1 using CRISPR-Cas technology and demonstrated that GhMAF1 specifically promotes the initiation of fiber cells at the base of the ovule by mediating the downstream JAZ2/CPC-MML3/MML4 pathway. These findings unveil a novel spatial module of fiber cell initiation on the ovule surface that involves GhMAF1. Ultimately, this work provides significant knowledge for the regulatory network of DNA 6mA modification in fiber initiation to improve fiber yield and quality.	0	contr
40066345	Pregnancy and pulmonary artery hypertension: Management challenges.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a term used to describe a complex heterogenous group of conditions defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of more than 20 mmHg at rest on right-heart catheterization. PH in pregnancy is associated with high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality and poor fetal outcomes. Currently, pregnancy in these women is classified as modified WHO class IV (pregnancy contraindicated). More recent data suggest that the prognosis varies with the underlying aetiology as well as with PH severity. Consequently, management during pregnancy must be individualised, with patients cared for in a tertiary unit as part of an experienced multidisciplinary team. In this article, we will discuss the importance of preconception counselling, the impact of the haemodynamic changes induced by pregnancy, the maternal and fetal risks of pregnancy in women with PH, and how these can be minimised by close antenatal, intrapartum and post-partum care and the development of individualised pregnancy plans.	0	contr

40054159	Effect of temperature on the physiology and phytoremediation capacity of Spirodela polyrhiza exposed to atrazine and S-metolachlor.	Environmental toxicity of pesticides to aquatic plants can vary with temperature, as temperature affects plant metabolic processes. We exposed the globally distributed duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza to environmentally relevant concentrations (40 µg/L) of atrazine and S-metolachlor at temperatures typical of surface freshwater in temperate zones (10, 15, and 21 °C). Our objective was to assess the effects of low temperatures and herbicide concentration, and their interactions, on growth, photosynthesis, pigments, antioxidant enzymes, and phytoremediation capacity. Lower temperatures (10 °C) intensified the adverse effects of both herbicides on the quantum yield of photosystem II in S. polyrhiza, with photosynthesis being a more sensitive endpoint than biomass growth rate. Both in the control and herbicide treatments, plants exposed to 10 °C exhibited lower concentrations of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) and reduced ascorbate peroxidase activity, which may have contributed to the intensified negative effects on photosynthesis at this temperature. The removal of S-metolachlor was lower at 10 and 15 °C (3-8 %) compared to 21 °C (17 %), while no difference was observed between the three tested temperatures for atrazine (2-8 %). Our findings suggest that conducting pesticide toxicity tests at around 25 °C may underestimate the contaminants' inhibitory effects on aquatic plants during colder seasons and in temperate regions. Additionally, lower temperatures pose a challenge to the effectiveness of atrazine and S-metolachlor phytoremediation in aquatic environments.	1	pest
40059629	Genetic diversity in the IIS6 domain of voltage gated sodium channel gene among Aedes aegypti populations from different geographical regions in India.	This study provides critical insights into the genetic diversity of the IIS6 domain of the Voltage Gated Sodium Channel (VGSC) gene in Aedes aegypti populations across various regions in India, focusing on two mutations: S989P and V1016G. Samples were collected from seven different cities across the country, including Dibrugarh, Kolkata, Berhampur, Bhopal, Bengaluru, Ghaziabad, and Aurangabad. The IIS6 domain was amplified and sequenced, revealing that the V1016G mutation was found at a higher frequency compared to the S989P mutation. The S989P mutation was most prevalent in Berhampur, followed by Bengaluru, while the V1016G mutation showed high frequencies in Dibrugarh, followed by Berhampur. Additionally, the study identified intron polymorphisms within the VGSC gene, with the type A intron being relatively rare. However, the type A intron was observed in samples harbouring both mutant and wild alleles for both mutations. The regional variation in the frequencies of these mutations indicates complex evolutionary dynamics potentially influenced by local environmental factors and insecticide application practices. Interestingly, the high frequency of these alleles also correlated with the genetic structure of the mosquito populations, suggesting that gene flow might be playing a role in spreading these mutations. Regular monitoring of these mutations could serve as important indicators in assessing the status of resistance to pyrethroids and guide nationwide mosquito control efforts. This research underscores the necessity for localised vector control strategies and continuous genetic surveillance to manage insecticide resistance effectively.	1	pest

40058434	Characterization of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) raw bast fibers of monoecious versus dioecious cultivars from flowering to senescence: FTIR of lignocelluloses and extract bioactivities.	Hemp is a multipurpose crop. Due to the revived interest in sustainable crops, hemp cultivation has increased in recent years. Both dioecious and monoecious hemp varieties are cultivated, yet few studies provide a comparative characterization. Monoecious cannabis plants are more uniform and economically efficient, being a whole-plant harvesting type. The aim of this research was to provide a comparative characterization of monoecious versus dioecious hemp bast fibers. There was conducted a microscopic analysis that showed their localization, the FTIR characterization of raw lignocellulosic fibers and extract bioactivity assays (antioxidant and microbiologic). Results indicated that FTIR absorbance ratios of peaks 1427/897 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1373-1375/667 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and1373/2905-2910 cm<sup>-1</sup> are relevant for hemp fibers parameters. A significant positive correlation was found between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity (r = 0.69*, r = 0.56*). Analysis of raw bast fibers extract indicated that the monoecious cultivar in the senescence phenophases had highest total phenolic content, and was more effective against all tested pathogenic bacterial strains. Both monoecious cultivar and male plants of the dioecious cultivar had higher total phenolic content than female plants of the dioecious cultivar, although at different phenophases. The male plants in the technological maturity phenophases presented the highest total phenolic content. Lower antioxidant activity was registered by female plants of the dioecious cultivar, which also showed lower total phenolic content, and the extract had no effect against Listeria monocytogenes, regardless of harvest time. The findings thus point to monoecious cultivars as having potential relevance in applications requiring enhanced bioactive properties, besides being advantageous for large-scale cultivation for fibers and seeds due to the economic efficiency.	0	contr

40066053	Chestnut (<i>Castanea crenata</i> S. et Z.) inner shell-A by-product promotes anti-obesity by regulating adipogenesis and lipogenesis-related genes and the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.	A by-product is a secondary substance unintentionally produced during manufacturing and can be repurposed through recycling. In particular, by-products generated from the processing of natural materials are valuable because of their bioactive compound content, such as polyphenols and anthocyanins. Obesity is a global health issue, and medicines for obesity have side effects, such as insomnia and headaches. The demand for safe anti-obesity treatments based on natural products has increased. In this study, the anti-obesity efficacy of chestnut inner skin powder (CIS), a by-product, was investigated in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model. CIS (100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) was administered orally for 7 weeks, and 200 mg/kg garcinia was used as the positive control. Body weight (BW) and food intake were monitored weekly. Our results showed that CIS intake reduced BW, liver weight, white adipose tissue (WAT) weight (epididymal, retroperitoneal, and perirenal tissues), leptin levels, LDL-c levels, and expression of adipogenesis- and lipogenesis-related genes, similar to the positive control group. Additionally, CIS activated the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway in the liver and reduced adipocyte size in the WAT H&E stain. In conclusion, these findings suggest that CIS may prevent and treat obesity by regulating adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipid metabolism.	0	contr
40064889	Discovery of the widespread site-specific single-stranded nuclease family Ssn.	Site-specific endonucleases that exclusively cut single-stranded DNA have hitherto never been described and constitute a barrier to the development of ssDNA-based technologies. We identify and characterize one such family, from the GIY-YIG superfamily, of widely distributed site-specific single-stranded nucleases (Ssn) exhibiting unique ssDNA cleavage properties. By first comprehensively studying the Ssn homolog from Neisseria meningitidis, we demonstrate that it interacts specifically with a sequence (called NTS) present in hundreds of copies and surrounding important genes in pathogenic Neisseria. In this species, NTS/Ssn interactions modulate natural transformation and thus constitute an additional mechanism shaping genome dynamics. We further identify thousands of Ssn homologs and demonstrate, in vitro, a range of Ssn nuclease specificities for their corresponding sequence. We demonstrate proofs of concept for applications including ssDNA detection and digestion of ssDNA from RCA. This discovery and its applications set the stage for the development of innovative ssDNA-based molecular tools and technologies.	0	contr

Fungicide contamination is a critical environmental issue, and the effective removal of fungicide residues from aquatic environments has attracted significant attention from researchers. In this study, the synthesized hyperbranched polysiloxane (TA-HBPSi) was grafted onto TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNF) to fabricate a novel aerogel material (TA-HBPSi@TOCNF) with the aim of enhancing the sorption efficiency of fungicide. The equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity of TA-HBPSi@TOCNF for imazalil (8.04 mg/g) was significantly higher compared to other fungicides, including prochloraz (6.43 mg/g), thiophanate-methyl (4.12 mg/g), carbendazim (0.16 mg/g), and thiabendazole (0.04 mg/g). In the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, the equilibrium adsorption capacity for imazalil increased from 8.04 mg/g to 9.61 mg/g, while the adsorption capacity for Cd<sup>2+</sup> increased from 0.26 mg/g to 0.88 mg/g. Quantum chemical calculations were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level. The energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ΔE(<sub>HOMO-LUMO</sub>)) for various adsorption mechanisms indicated that electrostatic interactions were the dominant driving force for adsorption, followed by π-π electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions and hydrophobic interactions. The developed aerogel demonstrated effective multi-component separation capabilities without inducing secondary environmental pollution, highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for practical water purification applications.	0	contr
40065246	Epigallocatechin -3- gallate mitigates diazinon neurotoxicity via suppression of pro-inflammatory genes and upregulation of antioxidant pathways.	Diazinon is a commonly used organophosphate (OP) insecticide especially in developing countries for the control of insect pests, however, exposure to its toxic impact especially in humans and other non-target species remains an important public health concern. The study aimed to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin -3- gallate (EGCG), abundant in green tea plants on neurobehavioural, biochemical, and pathological changes in the brain of male Wistar rats following exposure to diazinon toxicity. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were acclimatized for seven days and subsequently randomly assigned into six treatment groups as follows: Group I: Control group (0.2 mL distilled water); Group II: Diazinon at 3 mg/kg (1% LD50); Group III: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (50 mg/kg, ~ 2% of LD50); Group IV: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (100 mg/kg, ~ 5% of LD50); Group V: EGCG (50 mg/kg) and Group VI: EGCG (100 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally once daily for 14 days. Neurobehavioural studies, biomarkers of oxidative stress, histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) were performed. Diazinon alone impaired recognition memory, increased oxidative stress markers and altered antioxidant defense in the brain. It upregulated TNF-α and IL-6 genes and repressed GPx 4 gene expressions. It was also associated with increased GFAP, Tau, and α-SN immunoreactivity. Microscopic examination revealed loss of Purkinje and hippocampal cells in brain. Co-treatment with EGCG however improved cognition, lowered oxidative stress markers, improved antioxidant status and suppressed TNF-α and IL-6. In conclusion, findings from this study demonstrated that EGCG offered protection against diazinon-induced neurotoxicity. Hence, natural sources of epigallocatechin -3- gallate such as fruits and vegetables could offer immense benefits by protecting against oxidative stress and inflammation in neurodegenerative disease conditions.Clinical trial number Not applicable.	0	contr

Although microalgae efficiently utilize CO<sub>2</sub>, their metabolic engineering remains challenging. In contrast, while synthetic biology tools are advanced for many heterotrophic bacteria, these organisms cannot directly utilize CO<sub>2</sub>.

The GYD1 mutant secretes glycolic acid via photorespiration, which E. coli metabolizes via the glyoxylate cycle. E. coli growth was improved by implementing two-stage continuous systems to 2.0 mg L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> on CO<sub>2</sub>. The production of green fluorescent protein (0.52 ng L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) and lycopene (6.3 μg L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) was also demonstrated. This study represents a successful case of a synthetic modular co-culture with a microalga and a heterotrophic bacterium, potentially contributing to sustainable industrial processes and reducing environmental impact.	0	contr
40065760	<sup>64</sup>Cu-chelated InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs as PET/fluorescence dual-modal probe for tumor imaging.	Positron emission tomography (PET)/fluorescence dual-modal imaging combines deep penetration and high resolution, making it a promising approach for tumor diagnostics. Semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant attention for fluorescence imaging owing to their tunable emission wavelength, high quantum yield, and excellent photostability. Among these QDs, heavy metal-free InP-based QDs have emerged as a promising candidate, addressing concerns regarding heavy metal-related toxicity. However, to the best of our knowledge, PET/fluorescence dual-modal imaging of InP QDs has yet to be explored. Here, we developed a novel PET/fluorescence imaging probe based on radioisotope (RI) -chelated InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs for tumor imaging. The surface of the InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs was functionalized with polyethylene glycol terminated with either a methoxy group or a 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelator group. Subsequently, the RI <sup>64</sup>Cu was chelated with DOTA on the surface of the InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs, integrating their bright fluorescence with radioactivity. Using the obtained <sup>64</sup>Cu-chelated InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs, PET/fluorescence dual-modal imaging of tumor-bearing mice was conducted, demonstrating successful multi-scale imaging from the whole body to the subcellular level. This novel PET/fluorescence dual-modal probe is expected to contribute to more precise tumor diagnosis.	0	contr

40066068	A critical review of microbiome-derived metabolic functions and translational research in liver diseases.	Significant changes in gut microbial composition are associated with chronic liver disease. Using preclinical models, it has been demonstrated that ethanol/alcohol-induced liver disease is transmissible through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). So, the survival rate of people with severe alcoholic hepatitis got better, which suggests that changes in the makeup and function of gut microbiota play a role in metabolic liver disease. The leaky intestinal barrier plays a major role in influencing metabolic-related liver disease development through the gut microbiota. As a result, viable bacteria and microbial products can be transported to the liver, causing inflammation, contributing to hepatocyte death, and causing the fibrotic response. As metabolic-related liver disease starts and gets worse, gut dysbiosis is linked to changes in the immune system, the bile acid composition, and the metabolic function of the microbiota in the gut. Metabolic-related liver disease, as well as its self-perpetuation, will be demonstrated using data from preclinical and human studies. Further, we summarize how untargeted treatment approaches affect the gut microbiota in metabolic-related liver disease, including dietary changes, probiotics, antibiotics, and FMT. It discusses how targeted therapies can improve liver disease in various areas. These approaches may improve metabolic-related liver disease treatment options.	0	contr

40066448	BLIMP-1-dependent differentiation of T follicular helper cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory type 1 cells.	T-regulatory-type-1 (TR1) cells are a subset of interleukin-10-producing but Foxp3<sup>-</sup> Treg cells that arise in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. We have shown that systemic delivery of autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NP) triggers the formation of large pools of disease-suppressing Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells from cognate T-follicular helper (TFH) cell precursors. Here we show that, upon treatment withdrawal, these Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells spontaneously differentiate into a novel immunoregulatory Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subset that inherits epigenetic and transcriptional hallmarks of their precursors, including clonotypic T-cell receptors, and is distinct from other Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg subsets. Whereas the transcription factor BLIMP-1 is dispensable for development of conventional Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, it is necessary for development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 cells. In a model of central nervous system autoimmunity, abrogation of BLIMP-1 or IL-10 expression in the Foxp3<sup>-</sup> and/or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subsets inhibits their development or anti-encephalitogenic activity. Thus, the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway results in the generation of two distinct autoimmune disease-suppressing, IL-10-producing TR1 subsets that are distinguished by the expression of Foxp3 and Foxp3 target genes.	0	contr

Viruses are obligate parasites, that use the host's internal metabolic systems for their own reproduction. This complicates the search for molecular targets to prevent the spread of viral infection without disrupting the vital functions of human cells. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are natural competitors of viruses for important resources of viral reproduction. DIPs emerge during infection, originate from the normal viral replication process and inhibit its progression, making them an interesting candidate for antiviral therapy. Here we describe the biology of DIPs, advances in DIP-based antiviral technology, analyze their therapeutic potential and provide a systemic overview of existing preventive and therapeutic antiviral strategies.	0	contr
40060182	Convenient, high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in autotetraploid alfalfa using endogenous <i>U6</i> promoters and visual reporters.	CRISPR/Cas is a simple, robust, versatile tool for plant biology studies and precision plant breeding. However, establishing a high-efficiency gene editing system for multiplex editing of the autotetraploid crop alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.), the most important forage legume worldwide, remains a formidable challenge. Here, we systematically identified endogenous <i>U6</i> promoters in alfalfa through transient expression via <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated infiltration of alfalfa leaves. We further demonstrated the efficacy of the three most active promoters for genome editing using an optimized alfalfa hairy root system. Subsequently, we established an improved CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex system containing three or four tandemly arrayed <i>MsU6</i>-promoter-driven polycistronic tRNA-sgRNA (PTG) expression cassettes, each consisting of three tRNA-sgRNA units, to simultaneously edit three or four alfalfa genes, coupled with the visual reporter <i>RH1</i> or <i>RUBY</i>. This toolkit showed efficient multiplex editing in the hairy root system with visual selection. We successfully obtained regenerated, red-colored shoots resulting from the stable transformation of alfalfa. These results highlight the potential application of the visual reporter system for the stable transformation of alfalfa. Our improved CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex system enables convenient, high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in alfalfa, providing a versatile toolset to facilitate functional studies of multiple genes and gene families for basic research and the genetic improvement of alfalfa.	0	contr
40065719	Endogenous ERMAP Affects T-Cell Function in EAE Mice.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease (AID) mediated by myelin-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of human MS. Erythrocyte membrane-associated protein (ERMAP) is a novel erythrocyte-specific adhesion/receptor molecule associated with erythrocyte adhesion. We have previously characterised it as a novel inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule and demonstrated that recombinant ERMAP proteins ameliorate EAE; however, the specific mechanism of action of ERMAP and the effects of endogenous ERMAP on T-cell function are largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of endogenous ERMAP in T-cell and macrophage homeostasis and EAE development. We show here that erythrocyte membrane-associated protein (ERMAP) gene knockout (ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup>) mice have increased numbers of T cells and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and enhanced T-cell activation, as compared to wild-type (ERMAP<sup>+/+</sup>) mice. When induced to develop EAE, ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice have more severe EAE symptoms and pathology, which are related to increased numbers of T cells (especially Th1 and Th17 T cells) and M1 macrophages, enhanced activation of T cells, and increased generation of inflammatory cytokines, but decreased proportion of Th2 T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Global gene analysis by RNA-seq shows that signalling molecules in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway are decreased in ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results suggest that endogenous ERMAP plays an important role in T-cell and macrophage homeostasis and EAE development.	0	contr

40060627	Metagenomic selections reveal diverse antiphage defenses in human and environmental microbiomes.	To prevent phage infection, bacteria have developed an arsenal of antiphage defense systems. Using functional metagenomic selections, we identified new examples of these systems from human fecal, human oral, and grassland soil microbiomes. Our antiphage selections in <i>Escherichia coli</i> revealed over 200 putative defenses from 14 diverse bacterial phyla, highlighting the broad phylogenetic interoperability of these systems. Many defense systems were unrecognizable based on sequence or predicted structure, so could only be identified via functional assays. In mechanistic studies, we show that some defense systems encode nucleases that only degrade covalently modified phage DNA, but which accommodate diverse chemical modifications. We also identify outer membrane proteins that prevent phage adsorption and a set of previously unknown defense systems with diverse antiphage profiles and modalities. Most defenses acted against at least two phages, indicating that broadly acting systems are widely distributed among non-model bacteria.	0	contr
40066335	Gold complex QB1561 suppresses drug-resistant cancer cells by inhibiting TrxR and mitochondrial respiratory function.	Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is one of the leading reasons that cause the failures of cancer treatment. Novel agents that may reverse MDR and neutralize drug-resistant cancer cells are highly desirable for clinical practice. The targeting of cellular redox homeostasis and/or mitochondria-mediated energy metabolism are promising strategies for the suppression of drug-resistant cancer cells. Based on the structure of mono-gold(I) complex auranofin (AF), a drug candidate under clinical trials for cancer, we synthesized a new dual-gold(I) complex QB1561 and tested if it can inhibit drug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We also investigated if QB1561 could inhibit thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a well-known target of AF and other gold complexes, and assessed its impact on mitochondrial respiration.	0	contr
40066370	Vagal heart rate variability during rapid eye movement sleep reduces negative memory bias.	Emotional memories change over time, but the mechanisms supporting this change are not well understood. Sleep has been identified as one mechanism that supports memory consolidation, with sleep selectively benefitting negative emotional consolidation at the expense of neutral memories, with specific oscillatory events linked to this process. In contrast, the consolidation of neutral and positive memories, compared to negative memories, has been associated with increased vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) during wakefulness. However, how HRV during sleep contributes to emotional memory consolidation remains unexplored. We investigated how sleep oscillations (i.e., sleep spindles) and vagal activity during sleep contribute to the consolidation of neutral and negative memories. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject, cross-over design, we examined the impact of pharmacological vagal suppression using zolpidem on overnight emotional memory consolidation. Thirty-three participants encoded neutral and negative pictures in the morning, followed by picture recognition tests before and after a night of sleep. Zolpidem or placebo was administered in the evening before overnight sleep, and participants were monitored with electroencephalography and electrocardiography. In the placebo condition, greater overnight improvement for neutral pictures was associated with higher vagal HRV in both Non-Rapid Eye Movement Slow Wave Sleep (NREM SWS) and REM. Additionally, the emotional memory tradeoff (i.e., difference between consolidation of neutral versus negative memories) was associated with higher vagal HRV during REM, but in this case, neutral memories were remembered better than negative memories, indicating a potential role for REM vagal HRV in promoting a positive memory bias overnight. Zolpidem, on the other hand, reduced vagal HRV during SWS, increased NREM spindle activity, and eliminated the positive memory bias. Lastly, we used stepwise linear mixed effects regression to determine how NREM spindle activity and vagal HRV during REM independently explained the variance in the emotional memory tradeoff effect. We found that the addition of vagal HRV in combination with spindle activity significantly improved the model's fit. Overall, our results suggest that sleep brain oscillations and vagal signals synergistically interact in the overnight consolidation of emotional memories, with REM vagal HRV critically contributing to the positive memory bias.	0	contr

40066379	The Diagnosis and Management of a Ewing's Sarcoma of the Pterygopalatine fossa in a 5-year-old girl.	Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is a small round cell tumor that mainly involves the skeleton, with an incidence of 2.93 per million. It is responsible for 4-10% of all bone tumors, with long bones and pelvis being the most frequently observed locations, whereas it affects the skull in only about 1-4% of cases. After osteosarcoma, ES is the most frequently observed bony primary malignant tumour in children. It more frequently regards adolescents or young adults. It is rarely diagnosed below 5 years of age or after the age of 30. ES rarely occurs in the head and neck district and, when it occurs, the jaw and skull base are the two most frequently involved locations. Clinically, head and neck ES does not show any pathognomonic finding, with the most frequent signs and symptoms usually due to the mass effect of the neoplasm. The aim of this paradigmatic case report is to present and discuss the diagnosis and management of a rare case of ES of the right pterygo-palatine region in a 5-year-old girl, that had been previously misdiagnosed and managed as a dental abscess.	0	contr
40066207	Safety evaluation of pea fibre concentrate (FIPEA) as food additive.	The EFSA Panel on Food Additive and Flavourings (FAF Panel) provides a scientific opinion on the safety assessment of the proposed use of pea fibre concentrate (FIPEA) as a food additive. FIPEA is a powder consisting mainly of dietary fibres (i.e. pectin and hemicellulose), and low amounts of protein, derived from yellow pea (<i>P. sativum</i>). The manufacturing process includes extensive heat treatments, (e.g. > 100°C for more than 40 min), conditions which lead to inactivation of lectins, that in FIPEA do not pose a safety concern. A specific α-amylase is used in the manufacturing, and this should be included in the definition of the proposed specifications. The Panel considered that the additional contribution of FIPEA to the total fibre intake in adults and toddlers would be acceptable considering the levels that are considered adequate by the NDA Panel. The Panel recommended to lower the specification limits proposed for the toxic elements. The solubility test indicates that the material does not require specific assessment at the nanoscale. No toxicological data have been submitted on FIPEA. The Panel considered that, similarly to water-soluble soybean polysaccharides, FIPEA is not absorbed intact but undergoes extensive fermentation by the intestinal microbiota in humans and is not of genotoxic concern. Dry peas (raw material) are a staple food, with a very long history of safe use in the EU. FIPEA is extracted with hot water from the insoluble fibrous material of dehulled yellow peas, therefore the structure of the fibres is not chemically modified, and no new by-products or components of toxicological concern are expected from the manufacturing process. The Panel concluded that there was no need for a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) and that pea fibre concentrate (FIPEA) as a new food additive does not raise a safety concern at the proposed use and use levels.	0	contr
40064877	Activation of endogenous full-length utrophin by MyoAAV-UA as a therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.	Activation of endogenous full-length utrophin, a dystrophin homolog, presents an attractive therapeutic strategy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), regardless of mutation types and loci. However, current dCas9-based activators are too large for efficient adeno-associated virus delivery, and the feasibility and durability of such treatments remain unclear. Here, we develop a muscle-targeted utrophin activation system using the compact dCasMINI-VPR system, termed MyoAAV-UA. Systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA in male mdx mice leads to substantial upregulation of utrophin at the sarcolemma, resulting in significant improvements in skeletal muscle function and a slowing of heart function deterioration. These benefits remain observable at six months post-treatment. In male nonhuman primates, systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA increases utrophin expression by twofold in skeletal muscle, with no significant side effects observed. Furthermore, MyoAAV-UA upregulates utrophin and utrophin-glycoprotein complexes in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myotubes from DMD patients. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the potential of MyoAAV-UA as a therapeutic approach for DMD.	0	contr

40057515	Larval spongy moth transcriptomic response to ingestion of broad-versus narrow-spectrum insecticidal Chromobacterium species.	The PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> strain of Chromobacterium subtsugae was the first insecticidal bacterium to be registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use in crop protection applications since approval for Bacillus thuringiensis was granted in 1961. C. subtsugae, a Gram-negative betaproteobacterium, exhibits oral toxicity against a broad range of important insects, including dipteran, coleopteran, lepidopteran, and at least some hemipteran and tetranychidan pests. Chromobacterium sphagni is a closely related bacterium exhibiting a distinctly narrower activity spectrum than that of C. subtsugae: it is toxic to lepidopteran, but not dipteran or coleopteran pest insects. The molecular mode of activity for either species is not well characterized at present, and it remains unclear whether these bacterial species affect insects similarly, notwithstanding their close evolutionary relatedness. In this study, synchronized third-instar larvae of the destructive lepidopteran forest pest, Lymantria dispar dispar (European spongy moth), were separately fed with cultures of C. subtsugae strain PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> or C. sphagni strain 14B-1<sup>T</sup> and sampled after 24 h post infection. Gene expression levels in healthy reference versus treated insects were independently compared at the whole-insect and midgut-only tissue levels to characterize host-specific transcriptional responses to intoxication. Treatment induced up-regulation of such antimicrobial peptides as attacin and cecropin, of two cytochrome P450-encoding genes, and of gelsolin, a molecule involved in actin organization. Some differentially expressed genes were novel or uncharacterized, hence future work with lepidopteran species will be necessary to understand insect physiological responses to Chromobacterium infection.	0	contr
40062422	<i>Rhodotorula tropicalis</i> sp. nov., a novel red yeast of the order Sporidiobolales isolated from Thailand, Indonesia and Japan.	Six yeast strains, representing a novel anamorphic species of the genus <i>Rhodotorula</i>, were investigated in this study.

One strain (ISM36-1) was isolated from soil in Japan, and two strains were isolated from soil (14Y315) and leaf litter (Y15Kr055) collected in Indonesia. Analysis of the sequences of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions showed that the six strains were identical or differed by only one nt substitution in both the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene and the ITS regions. <i>Rhodotorula paludigena</i> CBS 6566<sup>T</sup> was the most closely related species but with 23-24 nt substitutions in the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene and 38-39 nt substitutions in the ITS regions. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated sequences of the ITS regions and D1/D2 domain showed that these strains represent a single species of the <i>Rhodotorula</i> clade that is distinct from other recognized species of the genus. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characteristics, these six strains were assigned to a novel species of the genus <i>Rhodotorula</i>, although sexual reproduction was not observed. The name, <i>Rhodotorula tropicalis</i> sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate the six strains. The holotype is TBRC 14874<sup>T</sup> and the ex-type culture is PYCC 8913 (=SU21).

40064932	Enzyme-activating B-cell receptors boost antigen presentation to pathogenic T cells in gluten-sensitive autoimmunity.	Autoantibodies against the enzyme transglutaminase 3 (TG3) are characteristic to the gluten-sensitive skin disorder dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), which is an extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease. We here demonstrate that TG3-specific B cells can activate gluten-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated internalization of TG3-gluten enzyme-substrate complexes. Stereotypic anti-TG3 antibodies using IGHV2-5/IGKV4-1 gene segments enhance the catalytic activity of TG3, and this effect translates into increased gluten presentation to T cells when such antibodies are expressed as BCRs. The crystal structure of TG3 bound to an IGHV2-5/IGKV4-1 Fab shows that antibody binding to a β-sheet in the catalytic core domain causes the enzyme to adopt the active conformation. This mechanism explains the production of stereotypic anti-TG3 autoantibodies in DH and highlights a role for TG3-specific B cells as antigen-presenting cells for gluten-specific T cells. Similar boosting effects of autoreactive BCRs could be relevant for other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.	0	contr

40065061	Activation of endogenous retroviruses characterizes the maternal-fetal interface in the BTBR mouse model of autism spectrum disorder.	Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic elements derived from a process of germline infection by exogenous retroviruses. Some ERVs have been co-opted for physiological functions, and their activation has been associated with complex diseases, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have already demonstrated an abnormal expression of ERVs in the BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD during intrauterine life till adulthood. Thus, starting from the assumptions that ERVs may contribute to the derailment of neurodevelopment and that ASD has fetal origins as a consequence of adverse intrauterine conditions, the present study aims to characterize the transcriptional activity of selected ERVs (MusD, IAP, Syn-A, Syn-B, ARC and GLN), LINE-1, inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-10, IL-11 CXCL-1) at the maternal-fetal interface and in dissected embryos from BTBR mice. Our results highlight the deregulation of ERVs and inflammatory mediators at the maternal-fetal interface, and in cephalic and non-cephalic embryonic tissues from BTBR compared to C57BL/6 J. Several correlations among ERV expression levels emerged in different tissues from C57BL/6 J mice while, in BTBR mice, no correlations were found, suggesting that in this model, the acquisition of autistic-like traits might be linked to the dysregulation of ERV activity occurring during intra-uterine life.	0	contr

This work investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of 99 pepper lines (Capsicum annuum L.), acclimated to Mediterranean climate conditions, using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq). The aims were to understand the genetic relationships among these lines, correlate genetic clusters with botanical classifications, and provide insights into pepper domestication in the region. Obtained were 318.76 million raw sequence reads overall, averaging 3.21 million reads per sample. A total of 8475 high-quality SNPs were identified and used to assess genetic diversity and population structure. Chromosome NC_061113.1 displayed the highest amount and Chromosome NC_061118.1 the fewest of these SNPs, which were not equally spaced around the genome. Heterozygosity measures and a negative inbreeding coefficient point to the great genetic diversity seen, therefore highlighting the genetic health of the population. Different genetic clusters found by phylogenetic study and STRUCTURE analysis can be used in breeding programs to mix desired features from many genetic backgrounds. This work showed how well ddRADSeq generates high-quality SNPs for genomic research on peppers, therefore offering useful molecular tools for genomic selection and marker-assisted selection. The analysis identified significant genetic diversity and distinct genetic clusters which are valuable for breeding programs focused on crop improvement. These findings enhance our understanding of pepper domestication and provide valuable genetic resources for breeding programs aimed at improving pepper varieties.	0	contr

Strain W18 exhibited the highest tolerance to Pb (EC<sub>50</sub> of 231.1 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>), Cu, and Cr (EC<sub>50</sub> of 24.9 and 26.7 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>), and displayed plant growth-promoting traits. The EPS extracted from W18 (107.3 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>) showed 58% emulsification against chloroform, remarkable 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (38%) and hydroxyl radical (83%) scavenging activities. Extracted EPS also exhibited a Pb-removal efficiency exceeding 79%, with an adsorption capacity for Pb of 499.2 ± 7.7 mg·g-EPS<sup>-1</sup>. In the contaminated soils with Pb (500 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>) and Cr (100 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>), W18 inoculation significantly enhanced pakchoi shoot length and biomass by 1.1 to 1.3 times after 20 days. The presence of pakchoi decreased bioavailable Pb and Cr concentrations in soil by 46%, which elevated to 76% for Pb and 72% for Cr post-inoculation with W18. Furthermore, W18 enhanced Pb uptake in pakchoi roots, increasing the bioconcentration factor by over 1.5 times and large macroaggregates (>2 mm) formation exceeded 75%. Overall, this study highlights Kosakonia sp. W18's multifunctional abilities to promote pakchoi growth and improve its effectiveness in phytoremediation of heavy metals in contaminated soils.	0	contr
40052297	Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics of Plant-Soil Feedbacks Explain the Spread Potential of a Plant Invader Under Climate Warming and Biocontrol Herbivory.	Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) can contribute to the success of invasive plants. Despite strong evidence that plant genetic traits influence soil microbial communities and vice versa, empirical evidence exploring these feedbacks over evolutionary timescales, especially under climate change, remains limited. We conducted a 5-year field study of the annual invasive plant, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., to examine how selection under climate warming and biocontrol insect herbivory shapes plant population genetics, soil properties, and microbial communities. After four generations under warming and herbivory, we collected seeds of the F<sub>4</sub> plant populations together with their conditioned soil for a common garden PSF experiment to explore how resulting PSFs patterns are influencing the performance and spread potential of Ambrosia under changing environmental conditions. This is especially relevant because our recent predictions point to a northward spread of Ambrosia in Europe and Asia under climate change, outpacing the spread of its insect biocontrol agent. We discovered that warming and herbivory significantly but differentially altered plant genetic composition and its soil microbial communities, with less pronounced effects on soil physicochemical properties. Our results indicate that both herbivory and warming generated negative PSFs. These negative PSFs favored plant growth of the seeds from the persistent soil seed bank growing in the conditioned soil under insect herbivory, and by this maintaining the Ambrosia population genetic diversity. They also enhanced the spread potential of warming-selected plant offspring, especially from warmer (southern) to colder (northern) climates. This can be explained by the observed decrease in soil pathogens occurrence under insect herbivory and by the especially strong genetic changes in plant populations under climate warming. Our findings provide insights into how climate warming and biocontrol management affect eco-evolutionary interactions between invasive plant populations and their soil environments, which are critical for predicting invasion dynamics in the context of global change.	0	contr
40065144	N,N-dimethylacetamide blocks inflammation-induced preterm birth and remediates maternal systemic immune responses.	The common excipient, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), prevents imminent endotoxin-induced preterm birth in mice. The present study hypothesized that DMA forestalls preterm birth to term (defined as day 18.5 or later) by attenuating bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal systemic inflammatory responses and cervix remodeling. Accordingly, LPS (i.p.) on day 15 postbreeding stimulated preterm delivery within 24 h while mice treated with DMA 2 h preceding and 9 h following LPS administration remained pregnant, comparable to saline and DMA controls, to deliver viable pups at term. Irrespective of LPS or DMA + LPS treatment, maternal plasma pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines on day 15.5 (12 h post-LPS) increased tenfold compared to baseline concentrations in controls. On day 16 of pregnancy, plasma concentrations of G-CSF and TNFα were statistically significantly reduced in the prepartum LPS + DMA group compared to those in postpartum mice given LPS. By day 18 of pregnancy, all cytokines returned to baseline-equivalent to low systemic levels throughout the study in saline and DMA controls that gave birth at term. In addition, maternal plasma progesterone declined within 12 h in prepartum LPS-treated mice to postpartum concentrations on day 16. Although a similar transient decrease occurred by 12 h in DMA + LPS mice, plasma progesterone returned to baseline concentrations in controls. Contemporaneously, the progression of prepartum cervix remodeling leading to preterm delivery was acutely forestalled by DMA without impeding birth at term. These findings support the hypothesis that DMA not only prevents inflammation-driven preterm birth, but rescues pregnancy for birth to occur at term. The results raise the possibility that maternal signals can forecast risk of preterm birth while selective suppression of systemic inflammation can mitigate adverse pregnancy outcomes.	0	contr
40064518	Binding Properties of Chemosensory Protein 1 to Plant Volatiles Guiding <i>Nicotiana rustica</i> Recognition in <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>.	<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> is one of the most serious pests attacking tobacco around the world. <i>Nicotiana rustica</i> is widely used as a trap crop in the fields of <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> in China. However, the chemical and molecular bases guiding <i>N. rustica</i> recognition in <i>H. armigera</i> are still unknown. In this study, we found 15 volatiles emitted from <i>N. rustica</i> induced EAG responses of <i>H. armigera</i>, while β-ocimene, α-pinene, and linalool were attractive to the moths in Y-tubes. Oviposition tests showed that <i>H. armigera</i> prefers to lay eggs on tobacco plants treated with β-ocimene and α-pinene. Further assays showed that an antenna-enriched chemosensory protein, HarmCSP1, binds robustly with β-ocimene, benzaldehyde, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. Structural analyses revealed that several key amino acid residues are involved in ligand binding. This study increases the understanding of the chemosensory mechanism of <i>H. armigera</i>'s recognition of <i>N. rustica</i> and provides the foundation for the design of attractants for <i>H. armigera</i> management.	0	contr
40065484	The pH influence on ectomycorrhizal nitrogen acquisition and decomposition.	In theory, ectomycorrhizal (EM) and saprotrophic fungi compete for nitrogen (N) found in soil organic matter. However, both positive and negative effects of EM fungi on decomposition have been observed across systems, with opposing implications for soil carbon (C) storage. The conditions driving the context dependency of fungal guild interactions remain poorly understood, which has limited our ability to predict the effects of EM fungi on biogeochemical cycling at regional and global spatial scales. To address this knowledge gap, we used a publicly available dataset of soil fungal communities to examine global patterns of relative EM and saprotrophic abundance and their influence on soil carbon and nutrient cycling. We demonstrate that EM fungal dominance and its effects on C and N cycling are predictable across the globe using only soil C : N stoichiometry, host tree functional group, and soil pH as predictors. We argue that because soil pH influences the availability and enzymatic catabolism of organic N, it determines the dominant N acquisition strategy of EM fungi, which in turn governs the directional effect of EM-saprotroph interactions on rates of organic matter decomposition in forests.	0	contr

Significant variability in the metabolism of midazolam (MDZ) exists among mechanically ventilated (MV) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to complex clinical conditions and genetic factors. The NR1I2 gene (PXR), which encodes a nuclear receptor that regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP3A4, plays a critical role in MDZ metabolism. Polymorphisms in NR1I2, along with variations in genes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, may influence enzyme activity and MDZ pharmacokinetics (PK).

40060593	Reference Library for Suspect Non-targeted Screening of Environmental Toxicants Using Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry.	As our health is affected by the xenobiotic chemicals we are exposed to, it is important to rapidly assess these molecules both in the environment and our bodies. Targeted analytical methods coupling either gas or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS or LC-MS) are commonly utilized in current exposure assessments. While these methods are accepted as the gold standard for exposure analyses, they often require multiple sample preparation steps and more than 30 minutes per sample. This throughput limitation is a critical gap for exposure assessments and has resulted in an evolving interest in using ion mobility spectrometry and MS (IMS-MS) for non-targeted studies. IMS-MS is a unique technique due to its rapid analytical capabilities (millisecond scanning) and detection of a wide range of chemicals based on unique collision cross section (CCS) and mass-to-charge ( <i>m/z</i> ) values. To increase the availability of IMS-MS information for exposure studies, here we utilized drift tube IMS-MS to evaluate 4,685 xenobiotic chemical standards from the Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) program including pesticides, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). In the analyses, 3,993 [M+H] <sup>+</sup> , [M+Na] <sup>+</sup> , [M-H] <sup>-</sup> and [M+] <sup>+</sup> ion types were observed with high confidence and reproducibility (≤1% error intra-laboratory and ≤2% inter-laboratory) from 2,140 unique chemicals. These values were then assembled into an openly available multidimensional database and uploaded to PubChem to enable rapid IMS-MS suspect screening for a wide range of environmental contaminants, faster response time in environmental exposure assessments, and assessments of xenobiotic-disease connections.	1	pest
40060716	The Ecological Restoration Strategies in Terrestrial Ecosystems Were Reviewed: A New Trend Based on Soil Microbiomics.	Soil microorganisms play a pivotal role in the biogeochemical cycle and serve as crucial indicators of ecological restoration in terrestrial ecosystems. The soil microbial community is regarded as a pivotal participant in environmental processes, offering both positive and negative feedback to diverse media within the ecosystem. This community can serve as a potential indicator in ecological monitoring and restoration processes. Consequently, an increasing number of scholars are directing their research towards the field of soil microbial ecology in diverse ecosystems and fragile areas, with the aim of elucidating the intricate interactions between microbes and vegetation. However, the implementation of soil microbiome in ecological restoration remains in the experimental stage due to the interference of extreme events and the complexity of governance measures. Consequently, a comprehensive evaluation of existing research is imperative. This review aims to address the ecological crises currently experienced by diverse terrestrial ecosystems and to provide a comprehensive overview of the specific practices of soil microorganisms in the context of ecological restoration. We also incorporate them into fragile habitats and identify urgent issues that need to be addressed in the ecological restoration process of fragile areas.	0	contr
40065324	Lysosomal acidification impairment in astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation.	Astrocytes are a major cell type in the central nervous system (CNS) that play a key role in regulating homeostatic functions, responding to injuries, and maintaining the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes also regulate neuronal functions and survival by modulating myelination and degradation of pathological toxic protein aggregates. Astrocytes have recently been proposed to possess both autophagic activity and active phagocytic capability which largely depend on sufficiently acidified lysosomes for complete degradation of cellular cargos. Defective lysosomal acidification in astrocytes impairs their autophagic and phagocytic functions, resulting in the accumulation of cellular debris, excessive myelin and lipids, and toxic protein aggregates, which ultimately contributes to the propagation of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative pathology. Restoration of lysosomal acidification in impaired astrocytes represent new neuroprotective strategy and therapeutic direction. In this review, we summarize pathogenic factors, including neuroinflammatory signaling, metabolic stressors, myelin and lipid mediated toxicity, and toxic protein aggregates, that contribute to lysosomal acidification impairment and associated autophagic and phagocytic dysfunction in astrocytes. We discuss the role of lysosomal acidification dysfunction in astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation primarily in the context of neurodegenerative diseases along with other brain injuries. We then highlight re-acidification of impaired lysosomes as a therapeutic strategy to restore autophagic and phagocytic functions as well as lysosomal degradative capacity in astrocytes. We conclude by providing future perspectives on the role of astrocytes as phagocytes and their crosstalk with other CNS cells to impart neurodegenerative or neuroprotective effects.	0	contr
40066691	Robust Sensory Traits Across Light Habitats: Visual Signals but Not Receptors Vary in Centrarchids Inhabiting Distinct Photic Environments.	Visual communication in fish is often shaped by their light environment, which influences both sensory (e.g., eye size, opsin gene expression) and signalling traits (e.g., body reflectance). This study explores the phenotypic variation in the visual communication traits of six species of centrarchids (Centrarchidae) inhabiting two contrasting light environments. We measured morphological, molecular and signalling traits to determine their variation across photic conditions. Our findings reveal significant interspecific variation in sensory traits but no consistent phenotypic variation between light environments. Centrarchids showed robust visual systems with green-sensitive rh2 and red-sensitive lws opsin genes representing the main chromatic channels, with their expression remaining largely unaffected between distinct light habitats. We also found significant molecular evolution in the visual opsin genes, although these changes were not associated with environmental conditions. However, body reflectance displayed species-specific responses to environmental conditions, suggesting that signalling traits may be more flexible than sensory traits. Overall, our results challenge the generality of the current paradigm in visual ecology, which portrays visual systems in fish as highly tunable owing to photic conditions. Our study highlights the potential evolutionary or developmental constraints on centrarchid visual systems and their implications for adaptability to various habitats and novel environmental threats.	0	contr

40064405	Molecular and Genomic Investigation Unveils Pseudomonas putida as an Emerging Multidrug-Resistant Pathogen Linked to Bovine Clinical Mastitis.	Pseudomonas putida is one of the emerging pathogens responsible causing mastitis in lactating animals. This study investigated the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), genetic diversity and virulence factor genes (VFGs) to highlight the pathogenic potentials of P. putida strains isolated from milk, feces and farm soil of bovine clinical mastitis (CM). A total of 110 samples were collected and analyzed, revealing an overall prevalence of P. putida in dairy farms at 40.90%, with specific prevalence rates of 42.22% in milk, 26.67% in feces, and 31.11% in farm soil. In vitro antimicrobial assays demonstrated that 76.0% P. putida isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR, resistance to ≥ 3 antibiotics), particularly showing high resistance to oxacillin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and aztreonam. Conversely, P. putida isolates showed the highest susceptibility against imipenem. The genome analysis of three MDR P. putida strains 11CM-M1 (milk), 11CM-F1 (feces) and 11CM-S1 (farm soil), showed a close evolutionary relationship with different strains of Pseudomonas spp. isolated from bovine mastitis milk and feces samples, human stool, and the hospital environment. The assembled genomes of three P. putida strains encoded nine antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), 36 VFGs, and 367 metabolic subsystems, highlighting a complex functional profile and potential for pathogenicity. The detailed analysis of these ARGs and VFGs demonstrated that P. putida strains employ distinct mechanisms of resistance (e.g., efflux pumps), biofilm formation, and virulence factors, including adhesins, secreted toxins, and lipopolysaccharides, which contribute to their pathogenic potential. Given the lack of reports linking P. putida strains to bovine mastitis in Bangladesh, the increasing trend of AMR, along with the presence of significant ARGs and VFGs in the studied strains, underscores the need for more intensive research, including animal model experiment, to better elucidate the pathogenesis and inform treatment decisions for mastitis in dairy animals.	0	contr

40066347	Constitutive overexpression of <i>Qui-Quine Starch</i> gene simultaneously improves starch and protein content in bioengineered cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz).	Cassava is a crucial source of daily calorie intake for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) but has an inferior protein content. Despite numerous attempts utilizing both traditional and biotechnological methods, efforts to address protein deficiency in cassava have yet to meet with much success. We aim to leverage modern biotechnologies to enhance cassava's nutritional value by creating bioengineered cassava cultivars with increased protein and starch content. In this study, we utilized <i>Qui-Quine Starch</i> (<i>QQS</i>), a novel orphan gene unique to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, to develop transgenic cassava plants with increased protein and starch accumulation in their tissues. A total of 10 independent transgenic cassava lines expressing <i>QQS</i> were successfully regenerated in this study, among which line R7 (F) demonstrated superior growth vigor. Quantitative RT-PCR verified the expression of the <i>QQS</i> gene in the transgenic lines. Data showed that <i>QQS</i> expression in cassava plants increased leaf protein content by 36% in line R''' (LA) L2 and root protein by 17% for the same line compared to their wild-type and empty vector (NPTII) control plants. Moreover, leaf-soluble total carbohydrates increased by 51.76% in line R (G) L2, and root-soluble total carbohydrates increased by 46.75% in line R7 (F). The novel function of <i>QQS</i> in increasing the starch content in the transgenic biomass is demonstrated. No significant change in the content of specific amino acids was observed among the lines and various plant parts. In addition, <i>QQS</i> expression revealed increased biomass, plant vigor, and early In vitro mini-tubers production for line R7 (F). Gene interaction study between AtQQS and 59 interacting partners generated 184 interactions or edges. These gene networks comprised several functional categories regulating the starch metabolic and auxin biosynthetic processes. The role of <i>QQS</i> in imparting starch and protein content of transgenic cassava plants is validated. The next logical step is the evaluation of biochemical profiles of cassava lines expressing <i>QQS</i> that reach maturity and the transferability of these findings to consumer-preferred cassava cultivars and local landraces grown in SSA. This study represents the first biotechnological report demonstrating a simultaneous increase of protein and starch content in bioengineered cassava.	0	contr
40060822	Pyrolysis Behavior, Kinetic Analysis, and Biochar Production from Waste Flowers.	Waste flowers constitute a significant portion of organic waste, offering the potential for sustainable waste management through pyrolysis. This study explores the pyrolysis behavior, kinetic parameters, and biochar production from waste flowers. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to examine thermal degradation characteristics under varying heating rates (10, 20, and 50 °C min<sup>-1</sup>). Kinetic analysis was performed using model-free methods such as the Friedman method (FM), Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Starink method (STM), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and Criado model to determine the pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Further, the biochar was produced in a semibatch reactor at 450 °C with a 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup> heating rate and 100 mL min<sup>-1</sup> nitrogen flow rate. The characterization of the biochar included proximate and elemental analysis, calorific value, bulk density, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pH, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and water-holding capacity. The decomposition results were confirmed in three stages: moisture removal, active pyrolysis, and residue formation. Kinetic results revealed a multistep reaction mechanism, with average activation energies of 236.35, 232.29, 234.74, and 221.50 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> derived from KAS, OFW, STM, and FM, respectively. Pyrolysis of marigold flowers (MG) yielded 36.64 wt % biochar at 450 and 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup> heating rate. Further, the biochar exhibited a 57.10% carbon content, 33.57 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup> higher heating value (HHV), 9.96 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> BET surface area, and 29.14 mV zeta potential, demonstrating its potential for soil amendment, carbon sequestration, and pollutant adsorption. This study emphasizes the value of MG as a feedstock for biochar production, contributing to circular economy initiatives.	0	contr
40059455	TRTBee: A standalone calculator for Time-Reinforced Toxicity according to EFSA honeybee guidelines.

40053474	Degradation of Glyphosate to Benign N-Formyl Glycine Using MOF-808 Nanocrystals.	Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine, GPh) is an industrial herbicide used worldwide in modern agricultural practices. With the growing concerns about cumulative environmental and health effects, pathways for catalytic GPh degradation to benign products are becoming a pressing societal need. This report demonstrates that Zr-based metal-organic framework (MOF-808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites can be employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of GPh at room temperature. Importantly, the degradation mechanism produces N-formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl-phosphonate, which are largely innocuous chemicals, especially when compared to more common decomposition products that typically result in GPh degradation. Nanocrystalline MOF-808 (nMOF-808) exhibits enhanced reactivity than larger MOF-808 crystals, attributed to the higher coordination of hydroxyl and water molecules to the secondary building units (SBU) as determined using a range of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques. These studies indicate that the crystal size-dependency in GPh degradation is related to structural modifications on coordinative unsaturated Zr site that promote the fast exchange of weakly bonded ligands. Taken together, this study demonstrates that GPh degradation can be optimized through ligand field tuning in MOFs, which can help improve overall reactivity while also pushing the reaction toward desirable, non-toxic products.	1	pest

Early-onset Marfan syndrome (eoMFS) is a severe and rare form of Marfan syndrome characterized by severe atrioventricular valve insufficiency developing before or shortly after birth. It is unclear which factors (interventions and/or genotype) influence survival. Forty-one individuals with eoMFS with a fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) variant in exon 24-32 (CRCh37) were included. At the last follow-up, 14/41 (34%) were alive (8 months-18 years) and 27/41 (66%) were deceased. Median age of death was 1 month and 88% of the deaths occurred before 5 months of age. More individuals alive past the age of 16 months versus those who were deceased before that age had undergone cardiovascular surgery at an older age (13 months, range 3-72, vs. 2 months, range 2-2, p = 0.03). Survival was better in those with single amino acid substitutions/small in-frame deletions than in those with large in-frame deletions (p = 0.007), but variants involving a cysteine substitution in an EGF-like domain versus those involving other amino acids did not significantly influence survival. EoMFS ranges from a (pre-)neonatal life-threatening disorder to a disorder with enhanced survival, creating a window for cardiovascular surgery. Individuals with single amino acid substitutions/small in-frame deletions had better survival compared to those with variants significantly impacting exon 24-32 length.	0	contr

40064938	Time series analysis of Sentinel 1 A SAR data to retrieve annual rice area maps and long-term dynamics of start of season.	Rice is a vital staple crop globally, and accurate estimation of rice area was crucial for effective agricultural management and food security. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has emerged as a valuable remote sensing tool for rice area estimation due to its ability to penetrate cloud cover and capture backscattered signals from rice fields. The backscatter signature of rice showed a minimum dB value at agronomic flooding indicating the Start of Season (SoS). The parameters viz., the minimum values of -22.03 to -17.69 dB at the start of season, maximum value of -16.10 to -14.20 dB at the peak of season coinciding with heading and corresponding mean increase of 5.07 dB during growing stages were utilized for developing rule-based classification system. Rice area was estimated over the Cauvery Delta Zone of Tamil Nadu, India for the past six years during samba (August-January) season from 2017 to 2023 using Sentinel 1 A Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data. Rice area maps were generated for the region utilizing parameterization with a classification accuracy of 88.5 to 94.5 per cent with a kappa score of 0.77 to 0.87 during the study period. The total classified rice area during samba season in the Cauvery Delta Zone was 508,581 ha, 456,601 ha, 506,844 ha, 511,714 ha, 524,723 ha and 476,586 ha for the years 2017-18 to 2022-23, respectively. The Start of Season (SoS) maps for samba season revealed that the major planting periods for rice were between the second fortnight of September to first fortnight of November in all the years except 2018 when early planting happened during the first fortnight of September due to favorable weather conditions and assured water supply. Near real-time information on rice area, start of season, and progress of planting derived using SAR satellite data will facilitate the development of decision support systems for sustaining the productivity of rice-based ecosystems.	0	contr

40065552	Implications for soluble iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and glial glutamate release in motor neuron death associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Oxidative stress in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been evidenced by accumulation of oxidatively modified products of nucleic acids, lipids, sugars, and proteins in the motor neuron system of brains and spinal cords obtained at autopsy from the patients. We recently demonstrated soluble iron accumulation in activated microglia of sporadic ALS spinal cords. This finding could indicate that iron-mediated Fenton reaction is most likely to be responsible for oxidative stress associated with this disease. The excitatory amino acid neurotoxicity hypothesis for sporadic ALS has been proposed based on increased glutamate and aspartate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from the patients. Initially, the increase in extracellular excitatory amino acid levels was considered to reflect excessive release from the axon terminal of upper motor neurons. However, it is a question of whether the damaged upper motor neurons continue releasing glutamate even in advanced stage of this disease. To address this issue, we hypothesized that glial cells might be a glutamate release source. Our immunohistochemical analysis on autopsied human spinal cords revealed that ferritin, hepcidin, ferroportin, aconitase 1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE), and glutaminase-C (GAC) were expressed mainly in microglia and that cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) was expressed mainly in astrocytes. We next performed cell culture experiments. Cultured microglia treated with soluble iron over-released glutamate and TNF-α via aconitase 1 and TACE, respectively. Cultured microglia treated with TNF-α over-released glutamate via GAC. Cultured microglia treated with hepcidin, of which expression is known to be upregulated by TNF-α, showed downregulated expression of ferroportin. Cultured astrocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide over-released glutamate via xCT. These observations provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that microglia and astrocytes are glutamate suppliers in response to soluble iron overload and oxidative stress, respectively, in sporadic ALS.	0	contr

This is the case with the in vitro unified bioaccessibility method (UBM), which is widely used in Europe to assess the bioaccessibility of metal(loid)s in the event of soil ingestion. This study proposes a comprehensive operational approach that incorporates bioaccessibility to refine human exposure and risk assessments. A pilot study of 45 Pb-contaminated soil samples collected in and around Paris highlighted the importance of carefully following soil preparation protocols. Specifically, sieving the soil to 250 µm without mechanical milling is recommended for determining both bioaccessible and total concentrations. A simplified test using dilute hydrochloric acid can predict the bioaccessibility of metal(loid)s in first-tier screening. This affordable, single-extraction method is easy to use in analytical laboratories and is both fast and reproducible. For second-tier validation studies, the UBM protocol should be applied to a limited number of samples. With the new approach, the relative bioavailability can be directly calculated using an in vivo/in vitro equation in the stomach compartment, thus, enabling UBM validation. The results of the pilot study demonstrated that to refine exposure assessments, adjusting chronic daily intake using relative bioavailability data was more effective than were classical approaches based on total concentrations. This method offers a promising perspective for stakeholders in managing polluted sites and soils.	0	contr
40066363	Metabolic pathways to sustainability: review of purple non-sulfur bacteria potential in agri-food waste valorization.	"Agri-food waste (AFW) represents a significant fraction of the material generated by the agri-food industry, which itself accounts for almost one-third of the annual global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Considering the growing global population and the consequent rise in food demand, the management and valorization of this waste are essential to ensure the sustainability of the entire food chain for future generations. Recycling agri-food waste offers a promising strategy to mitigate the sector's environmental impact, particularly when the waste consists of food-grade materials that enhance its intrinsic value. Retaining such products within the agri-food chain by converting them into feed or food, a process referred to as ""waste upcycling,"" is therefore of critical importance. Purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) are emerging as promising candidates for AFW upcycling due to their remarkable metabolic versatility, which allows them to metabolize a wide range of organic substrates, including carbohydrates, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and alcohols, into valuable microbial biomass. This biomass is notably rich in superior quality proteins, vitamins, pigments, and other high-value compounds. The phototrophic metabolism of PNSB is particularly advantageous for organic matter valorization, as the carbon conversion yield approaches unity by utilizing light as an energy source. This review explores the potential of PNSB in upcycling AFW streams derived from various sources, such as fruit and vegetable residues, as well as effluents from the dairy, brewery, and sugar industries. The pre-treatment methods required to optimize substrate availability are also discussed. Furthermore, we examine the metabolic pathways utilized by PNSB under phototrophic conditions to assimilate the most common carbon substrates found in AFW, highlighting critical gaps in our understanding of their metabolism. Additionally, challenges and opportunities in AFW valorization, with a focus on PNSB applications, are identified. This review underscores recent advancements and ongoing challenges, emphasizing the potential role of PNSB in driving sustainable circular bioeconomy applications for AFW."	0	contr
40065071	MicroRNA 320a-3p up-regulation reduces PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer cells: an experimental and bioinformatic study.	Growing evidence suggests that dysregulated microRNAs were critical in the development of tumors and the progression number of malignancies. This research aimed to check the effect of microRNA 320a-3p transfection on gastric cancer (GC) cell lines. Following transfection, the efficacy was determined by the RT-PCR method. After that, MTT, scratch assay, DAPI staining, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry were used respectively. The results demonstrated that the viability of GC cells considerably decreased following transfection. Moreover, microRNA 320a-3p transfection significantly suppressed cell migration and induced apoptosis in these cells. We found that transfection of microRNA 320a-3p remarkably decreased PD-L1 gene expression and influenced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related and apoptotic gene expressions. The findings propose that microRNA 320a-3p could decrease cell proliferation and migration and induce apoptosis by increasing TP53 and CASP3 expression levels in GC cells. Notably, microRNA 320a-3p might be a potential target in GC immunotherapy by suppressing the PD-L1 gene expression.	0	contr
40055955	Unlocking the potential of genome editing in agriculture with tissue culture-free techniques.	Genome editing holds great promise for enhancing crop traits; however, progress has been slow due to inefficient delivery methods and reliance on tissue culture for regenerating edited plants, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address these limitations, innovative tissue culture-free techniques have been developed, including meristem editing through biolistic-mediated delivery and RNA virus-mediated delivery. New methods for de novo gene-edited meristem induction and root suckering-based cut-dip-budding have also been established. While these approaches show promise, each faces challenges that must be addressed for practical application in crop improvement. We discuss the transformative potential of these techniques for crop improvement and emphasize the need for ongoing research to refine them and maximize their agricultural impact.	0	contr

40064082	Transformational fixation of Cr(VI) during microwave-enhanced reduction of soil iron minerals by tea polyphenols.	Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] presents substantial environmental and health hazards due to its pronounced toxicity and mobility in soils. Traditional chemical reduction methods for Cr(VI) are often inadequate for treating chromium-contaminated soils, as they may fail to fully reduce Cr(VI), leading to incomplete remediation. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop more efficient and environmentally sustainable methods for the treatment of hexavalent chromium. This study explores an innovative approach using microwave-enhanced reduction of soil iron minerals facilitated by tea polyphenols to achieve transformational fixation of Cr(VI). The microwave-assisted treatment (0.5 wt% TP combined with MW at 700 W for 10 min) significantly reduced Cr(VI) concentrations in iron-rich soil from 363.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 0.3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, achieving a removal rate of 99.9%, compared to TP treatment alone (0.5 wt%). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the enhanced removal efficiency of Cr(VI) by microwave-assisted tea polyphenols is attributable to the accelerated reduction of soil iron minerals by the polyphenols. Furthermore, microwave enhancement facilitated the transformation of Cr into more stable forms, such as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Additionally, the Cr(VI) content in the treated soil remained below 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> after 360 days of atmospheric exposure, indicating sustained immobilization. This study demonstrates that the integration of tea polyphenols with microwave irradiation constitutes a promising strategy for the remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated soils.	0	contr
40066692	Factors influencing vaccine hesitancy among United Kingdom adolescents in a senior high school environment and actions to address it.	"We explored adolescent viewpoints on vaccines and hesitancy using an anonymized, validated, self-completed electronic questionnaire amongst state-school Year 12-13 adolescents in London, UK. As the response rate was low (Cohort 1; <i>n</i> = 112/486, 23.0%), we repeated the survey with incoming students (cohort 2, <i>n</i> = 256/275; 93%). A focus group (<i>n</i> = 31) evaluated international HPV campaign posters. Cohort 1 participants were 82.1% female, 13.4% male, and ethnically diverse (32.1% Asian/Asian British, 29.5% Black/Black British, 25.9% White, 7.1% Mixed); Cohort 2 were 80% female, 18% male, with participants identifying as 38% Black/Black British, 34% Asian/Asian British, 15% White, 12% Mixed/Others. Across both cohorts, participants believed childhood vaccinations were safe (Cohort 1 = 95.8%, Cohort 2 = 91%). COVID-19 vaccination uptake was higher in Cohort 1 than 2 (76.8% vs 67%), with fewer participants believing it was adequately tested (56.3% vs 47%). Support for mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for healthcare workers (HCW) was high (Cohort 1:77.8-79% ""all"" vs ""patient-facing HCWs;"" Cohort 2 = 62-64%). Similar patterns were observed for mandatory influenza vaccination (Cohort 1: 62.5-66.7%; Cohort 2: 62-63%). Vaccination decisions in Cohort 2 were primarily influenced by parents (96%), healthcare providers (48%), and school friends (36%) (Cohort 1 = 30.2%, 19.6%, and 12%, respectively). Recommendations by doctors, experts and parents (but not politicians) and school-based vaccine availability boosted vaccine confidence. Social media had minimal impact. Most participants received HPV vaccine (Cohort 1 = 83.1%, Cohort 2 = 77.2%). International HPV posters received strong but mixed support; direct design input from the target group is needed to ensure the success of visual vaccine promotions."	0	contr
40064975	Investigating ferroptosis-related genes NFE2L2 in neutrophils for ankylosing spondylitis: therapeutic potential of cassia twigs.	We determined the relationship between ferroptosis and immune cells in ankylosing spondylitis and the role of the Chinese herbal medicine Cassia twigs in treating ankylosing spondylitis. We analyzed clinical data on ankylosing spondylitis, transcriptome data, single-cell sequencing data, and genes related to ferroptosis and Cassia twigs. Clinical variables related to AS were selected through logistic regression analysis of the clinical data combined with machine learning. GSEA and enrichment analysis were performed on genes related to ferroptosis, combined with transcriptome data and drug-related genes, to identify the key genes and drug targets related to AS, as well as, the key immune cells. Then, the single-cell data and cell subtypes were analyzed. Finally, the interconnections between immune cells were analyzed through intercellular communication. Five variables, including neutrophils, were screened for clinical data analysis. The AUC of the experimental group was 0.859 and that of the validation group was 0.807. Ferroptosis gene NFE2L2 was identified as the final drug target of AS; it was upregulated in AS and downregulated in the control group by immunohistochemical verification, both of which were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Neutrophils were divided into two subgroups: high expression of NFE2L2 and low expression of NFE2L2. Through molecular docking, Cassia twigs were found to effectively act on the ferroptosis gene NFE2L2. Neutrophils act as important immune cells in AS. The twigs of the Chinese herb Cassia can treat AS by acting on the protein structure of the ferroptosis gene NFE2L2.	0	contr
40064053	Microplastics in agricultural soils following sewage sludge applications: Evidence from a 25-year study.	Sewage sludges applied to agricultural soils are sources of microplastic pollution, however, little is known about the accumulation, persistence, or degradation of these microplastics over time. This is the first study to provide long-term, high temporal resolution quantitative evidence of microplastics in agricultural soils following sewage sludge application. The abundance and degradation of microplastics was assessed in soils sampled biennially from an experimental field over a 25-year period managed under an improved grassland regime following the application of five different sewage sludges. The sludges contained different microplastic compositions reflecting the different sources of the sludges. Microplastic abundance increased by 723-1445% following sewage sludge applications (p < 0.05) and remained constant over time (22 years and possibly beyond) (p > 0.05). All sludges predominantly added white/transparent microfibres to soil. Microfilms, microfibres, and fragments were most susceptible to degradation, potentially creating micro(nano)plastics. Of note was the discoloration of coloured microfibres, which may be environmentally hazardous due to the toxicity of textile dyes in soil ecosystems. We also found that plastic composition could be used to trace its source. This evidence is useful in informing regulation on sewage sludge use and management, and in assessing the fate and impact of microplastics in soil.	0	contr

40065259	Manganese-Driven Plasmid Nanofibers Formed <i>In Situ</i> for Cancer Gene Delivery and Metalloimmunotherapy.	While nucleic-acid-based cancer vaccines hold therapeutic potential, their limited immunogenicity remains a challenge due in part to the low efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery caused by lysosomal entrapment. In this work, we found that plasmids encoding both an antigen and a STING agonist protein adjuvant can self-assemble into coordination nanofibers, triggered by manganese ions. We developed a strategy to construct a DNA vaccine, termed MnO<sub>2</sub>-OVA-CDA-mem, formed by the coencapsulation of manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>), an antigen-expressing plasmid (encoding ovalbumin, OVA), and an adjuvant enzyme-expressing plasmid (encoding STING agonist, CDA) within dendritic cell (DC) membranes. Upon uptake into acidic lysosomes, Mn<sup>2+</sup> released from MnO<sub>2</sub> triggered the nucleic acids to undergo a morphological change from nanospheres (∼180 nm diameter) to nanofibers (∼1 μm length), resulting in an increase in mechanical strength by about 9-fold and consequently lysosomal membrane disruption. The antigen OVA and adjuvants Mn<sup>2+</sup> and CDA in the cytoplasm triggered strong DC activation and antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell metalloimmune responses, significantly inhibiting the growth of B16-OVA tumors and inducing long-term immune memory. Altogether, MnO<sub>2</sub>-OVA-CDA-mem holds potential as a platform for nucleic acid antigen and adjuvant delivery using an <i>in situ</i> self-assembly strategy in a metal-driven, stimulus-responsive, and programmable manner for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.	0	contr

40064342	The primary role of phosphate-metal- natural organic matter (humic) ternary complexes as drivers of long-term phosphorus plant nutrition in acidic soils.	Several studies have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) can form stable complexes in soil and soil solution, with some fractions of natural organic matter (NOM), mainly humic substances, through metal bridges. However, the role of these types of complexes in plant phosphorus (P) nutrition remains unclear. On the other hand, Pi in acidic soils is rapidly absorbed and fixed, becoming unavailable for plants. In this framework, this study aims to unveil the role of Pi-metal-NOM (humic) complexes in plant P nutrition in acidic soils. To this end, we have selected nine acidic soils from Spain with different soil properties and nutrient availability. On these soils, we cultivated wheat (Triticum aestirum L., cv Fiel) for successive harvests until no new sprouts appeared. Pi fractions were characterized using two complementary Pi sequencing analyses adapted to acidic soils. The results showed that Pi-metal-NOM (humic) complexes are mainly extracted by oxalate-pH3 after extracting the more labile forms of Pi. Likewise, correlation and principal component analysis studies showed that the Pi extracted with water plus resin is linked to short-term wheat P-nutrition. On the contrary, the Pi extracted with oxalate (pH 3) (after extracting the more labile fraction of Pi) that contains the main fraction of Pi-metal-NOM (humic) complexes is mainly linked to long-term wheat P-nutrition. This fact indicates that the addition of humified organic matter to acidic soils can significantly improve the fraction of potentially available P for crops.	0	contr
40066262	Integrated Single-Step Terahertz Metasensing for Simultaneous Detection Based on Exosomal Membrane Proteins Enables Pathological Typing of Gastric Cancer.	Exosomes (Exos) are emerging as noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and progression monitoring of gastric cancer (GC). However, the heterogeneity discrimination and ultrasensitive quantification of Exos presents a considerable analytical challenge, thereby impeding severely their clinical application. Herein, we propose an integrated terahertz metasensing platform for the discrimination of Exos in distinct subtypes of GC in a single step-through the simultaneous evaluation of the category and richness level of Exos membrane proteins. Characterized by dual-sided independent sensing capabilities with enhanced sensitivity (169 and 325 GHz per refractive index unit, respectively), the metasensor functionalized with antibodies simultaneously reflects the content of 2 membrane proteins in the terahertz spectral response. Our approach concurrently completes accurate differentiation and precise quantification of GC-subtype Exos by integrating dual-sided sensing information in merely a single assay. The dual-sided sensing design enhances the reliability of detection results. Moreover, combined with the signal amplification of gold nanoparticles, the platform experimentally demonstrates a superior dynamic response to Exos concentrations spanning from 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> particles/ml, with the limit of detection being 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> particles/ml. This work provides new insights into multisensing metasurface design and paves the way for precise and personalized cancer treatment through the specific sensing of Exos.	0	contr
40064678	Inherited endurance: deciphering genetic associations of transgenerational and intergenerational heat stress memory in barley.	"Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a cornerstone of global cereal crops, is increasingly vulnerable to concurrent heat stress, a critical abiotic factor that is intensified by climate change. This study employed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate ""stress memory,"" a phenomenon where prior stress exposure enhances a plant's response to subsequent stress events. In this study, we analyzed essential agronomic traits, including plant height, spike length, grain number, and thousand-kernel weight, in conjunction with biochemical markers such as chlorophyll content, proline, and soluble proteins. These assessments spanned three successive generations under heat stress, capturing transgenerational and intergenerational effects and uncovering the cumulative impacts of prolonged stress in the third generation. Markedly, our findings highlight the critical influence of heat stress on plant physiology across generational scales, showcasing significant reductions in chlorophyll content, which reflect stress-induced limitations on photosynthetic capacity. In contrast, the observed consistent and substantial increases in proline and soluble protein content across transgenerational, intergenerational, and third-generation stress memory stages underscore their vital roles in stress mitigation and cellular homeostasis. These results provide compelling evidence of generational stress memory, suggesting potential adaptive strategies that plants employ to cope with harsh environmental conditions. Interestingly, identifying significant SNP markers within key genomic regions using GWAS analysis further highlights the potential for harnessing these loci in breeding programs. These results shed light on the intricate mechanisms of barley's stress tolerance and underscore the potential of integrating genomic, epigenomic, and advanced phenotyping tools into breeding programs to develop heat-resilient cultivars."	0	contr

Individuals with congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD) may transmit cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene to their offspring through assisted reproductive technology (ART). We aimed to delineate the spectrum and estimate the prevalence of CF-causing variants in Chinese individuals with CAVD through a cohort analysis and meta-analysis. CFTR was sequenced in 145 Chinese individuals with CAVD. CFTR variants were classified as CF-causing or non-CF-causing variants regarding clinical significance. A comprehensive genotype analysis was performed in Chinese individuals with CAVD, incorporating previous studies and our study cohort. The prevalence of CF-causing variants was estimated through meta-analysis. In our cohort, 56 different CFTR variants were identified in 108 (74.5%) patients. Twenty variants were categorized as CF-causing and were detected in 28 (19.3%) patients. A comprehensive genotype analysis of 867 patients identified 174 different CFTR variants. Sixty-four were classified as CF-causing variants, 56.3% of which had not been previously reported in Chinese patients with CF. Meta-analysis showed that 14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.0%-18.9%) CAVD cases harbored one CF-causing variant, and 68.6% (95% CI: 65.1%-72.0%) CAVD cases carried at least one CFTR variant. Our study underscores the urgent need for extensive CFTR screening, including sequencing of whole exons and flanking regions and detection of large rearrangements and deep intronic CF-causing variants, in Chinese individuals with CAVD before undergoing ART. The established CF-causing variants spectrum may aid in the development of genetic counseling strategies and preimplantation diagnosis to prevent the birth of a child with CF.	0	contr
40064348	Carbon Quantum Dots from Fallen Leaves of Lonicera caerulea L.: An Innovative Plant Growth Promoter and Fruit Quality Enhancer.	With increasing environmental pollution and resource wastage, utilizing waste for high-value applications has become crucial. This study explores the preparation of carbon dots (CDs) from blue honeysuckle leaves and their potential in enhancing plant photosynthesis. CDs derived from these leaves have a particle size of ∼2.6 nm and emit blue fluorescence under 365 nm UV light, making them suitable for foliar spraying. When applied, CDs enter leaf cells and impact chloroplasts, significantly improving photosystem II (PSII) performance and Rubisco enzyme activity. At an optimal concentration of 1000 mg/L, PSII electron transfer efficiency and Rubisco activity increased by 29.84% and 208.12%, respectively, boosting net photosynthetic rate by 60.4%. This treatment also enhanced blue honeysuckle yield and fruit quality, with higher levels of soluble solids, ascorbic acid, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and total phenolics. These improvements were linked to increased sucrose synthesis (up 25.99%) and leaf assimilative capacity (up 25%). Additionally, CDs enhanced post-harvest soil enzyme activity and microbial abundance, promoting nutrient cycling and soil utilization. This study demonstrates that preparing CDs from waste blue honeysuckle leaves not only mitigates environmental pollution but also offers a sustainable, high value use for plant resources.

40065576	Size Matters: Influence of Available Soil Volume on the Root Architecture and Plant Response at Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Levels in Barley.	Pot size is a critical factor in plant growth experiments, influencing root architecture, nutrient uptake, and overall plant development as well as sensing of stress. In controlled environments, variation in pot size can impact phenotypic and molecular outcomes and may bias experimental results. Here, we investigated how pot size affects the root system architecture and molecular responses of two barley genotypes, the landrace BERE and the modern elite CONCERTO, through assessment of shoot and root traits and by using X-ray computed tomography complemented by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. The two genotypes showed distinctly different adaptations to changes in pot size. The landrace showed greater stability and adaptability with consistent root traits and enhanced accumulation of osmoprotectant metabolites across different pot sizes with respect to CONCERTO. Conversely, the elite line was more sensitive to pot size variations, particularly showing altered root architecture and transcriptomic responses. Overall, this study highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate pot size for plant growth experiments, particularly when focused on root traits, and highlights the importance of considering the physiological and molecular changes due to growth environment choice in experimental design in barley.	0	contr

40064917	The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice.	Fear can be induced either directly through self-experience of aversive events or vicariously by observing conspecifics experiencing such events. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NA) system is crucial in fear responses and cognitive processes. We investigated whether the LC-NA system differentially processes these two types of fear, direct and vicarious in male mice. The results highlighted that the right hemisphere LC→anterior cingulate cortex pathway is uniquely crucial for vicarious fear, while the two inputs to the LC-from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA)-differentially contribute to fear processing. The BNST plays a more targeted role in vicarious fear, and the CeA has a broader influence on fear in general. This underscores the complexity and specialization within the LC-NA system for fear-processing.	0	contr
40064671	Effects of Low Concentrations of Hypochloric Acid on the Agricultural Soil Properties.	The oxidant (e.g., hypochlorous acid, HClO) has been widely used to remediate contaminated sites. However, the effects of HClO on soil health in agricultural fields have been rarely explored. Based on the laboratory and field experiments, we found that low concentrations of HClO changed soil bioavailable elements, enzyme activities, and the structure of microbial communities. Specifically, the application of 5‰ HClO increased DOC content by 13.9-19.9% compared with CK. The bioavailable Fe and Mn contents also increased by 15.0% and 48.7%-61.8%, respectively. Correspondingly, in field experiments, 5‰ HClO enhanced the DOC contents by 12.0%. Besides, the application of HClO also elevated enzyme activities and improved the structure of the microbial community of soil. These findings might provide new strategies for improving the fertility and quality of agricultural soil.	0	contr

40058046	Enhanced sulfamethoxazole degradation by electrode material modification in microbial electrochemical system.	Electrode modification was recognized as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of microbial electrochemical systems. In this study, the cathode material was modified by introducing conductive polymer (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene, PEDOT)-modified carbon fiber (CF) and MnO<sub>2</sub>-modified granular activated carbon (GAC) electrodes to improve the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from water and to explore the mechanisms underlying microbial electrochemical action that facilitated SMX degradation. The results showed that, compared to the control group, the specific capacitance of the PEDOT/CF group and the MnO<sub>2</sub>/GAC group was increased by 100.2 F·g-1 and 197.4 F·g-1, respectively. Additionally, internal resistance was reduced by 335 Ω and 684 Ω, while the average current was increased by 56.8% and 57.4%, respectively. As a result, SMX removal efficiencies were enhanced by 11.8% and 12.9%, respectively. Microbial community analysis revealed that the cathode surfaces were enriched with electroactive and degradation-dominant microorganisms. Combined with an analysis of SMX degradation products, these findings demonstrated that the modified electrodes exhibited enhanced electron transfer capabilities, promoting redox reactions and ultimately facilitating the degradation of SMX.	0	contr
40065571	Plant-soil feedbacks contribute to coexistence when considering multispecies assemblages over a soil depth gradient.	"Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) may determine plant-species coexistence. They may stabilize coexistence, but frequently destabilize it by increasing fitness differences between species. Most studies focus on pairwise models in greenhouses. Thus, whether PSFs favor or deter coexistence is still unclear, especially in multispecies field contexts. We analyzed pairwise and multispecies coexistence over a hydric gradient in a semiarid grassland. Using PSF strength estimates between 17 species, we measured stability and fitness differences between all species pairs, and built all possible multispecies communities to test computationally whether they were stabilized by PSFs. We analyzed whether coexistence probability diminishes with species richness, as previously hypothesized. Because PSFs change with environmental conditions, we investigated their contribution to overall diversity maintenance over the hydric gradient. Strong PSF increased fitness differences, hindering pairwise coexistence. As expected, the probability that an assemblage was stable diminished with its richness, with the largest stable community containing 12 of the 17 species. However, all species coexisted with others in at least one assemblage, highlighting the importance of multispecies analyses. Positive PSFs promoted coexistence in pairwise analyses, but were associated with species-poor communities. Contrastingly, negative PSFs predominated in species-rich associations, perhaps due to indirect positive interactions (an ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" scenario) that are known to maintain diversity in this grassland. Changes in the density of different species over the hydric gradient predicted from PSF-stabilized communities matched observations in nature. This seems to promote species turnover and thus coexistence along the gradient. As such, the interplay between environmental conditions and PSFs may be an important driver of diversity. Our results emphasize the need to move beyond pairwise coexistence models. In multispecies systems, crucial indirect interactions may arise. The interplay between environment and PSF under field conditions may provide important insights into coexistence in nature."	0	contr
40055973	Plant nitrogen uptake preference and drivers in natural ecosystems at the global scale.	Elucidating plant nitrogen (N) acquisition is crucial for understanding plant N strategies and ecosystem productivity. However, the variation in plant N uptake preference and its controlling factors on a global scale remain unclear. We conducted a global synthesis to explore plant N preference patterns and driving factors. Globally, the average contributions of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>), and glycine N to the total plant N uptake were 41.6 ± 1.1%, 32.8 ± 1.2%, and 25.6 ± 0.9%, respectively. However, plant N uptake preferences differed significantly among climatic regions and vegetation types. Soil NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> was the most preferred N form by plants in (sub)tropical regions, whereas NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference was significantly higher in high-latitude than low-latitude regions. Plant functional type was one of the most important factors driving NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference, with significantly higher NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference of nonwoody species than broadleaf-evergreen, conifer, and shrub species. Organic N preference was lowest in (sub)tropics and significantly lower than that in temperate and alpine regions. This study shows clear climatic patterns and different influencing factors of plant NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference, which can contribute to the accurate prediction of N constraints on ecosystem productivity and soil carbon dynamics.	0	contr
40065827	A Posteriori Error Analysis for a Coupled Stokes-Poroelastic System with Multiple Compartments.	The computational effort entailed in the discretization of fluid-poromechanics systems is typically highly demanding. This is particularly true for models of multiphysics flows in the brain, due to the geometrical complexity of the cerebral anatomy-requiring a very fine computational mesh for finite element discretization-and to the high number of variables involved. Indeed, this kind of problems can be modeled by a coupled system encompassing the Stokes equations for the cerebrospinal fluid in the brain ventricles and Multiple-network Poro-Elasticity (MPE) equations describing the brain tissue, the interstitial fluid, and the blood vascular networks at different space scales. The present work aims to rigorously derive a posteriori error estimates for the coupled Stokes-MPE problem, as a first step towards the design of adaptive refinement strategies or reduced order models to decrease the computational demand of the problem. Through numerical experiments, we verify the reliability and optimal efficiency of the proposed a posteriori estimator and identify the role of the different solution variables in its composition.	0	contr
40066341	Thromboprophylaxis and adult congenital heart disease: The latest on indications, risk scoring and therapy.	Advances in medical care have significantly extended the lifespan of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), allowing most to survive into adulthood. However, they continue to face significant cardiovascular morbidity, particularly atrial arrhythmias (AA), heart failure, and thromboembolic (TE) events. TE events in adult CHD patients arise from various factors, including AA, intracardiac repairs, cyanotic CHD, Fontan palliation, pregnancy, and mechanical heart valves (MHV). As randomized clinical trials are lacking, most current guidelines rely on observational data and expert opinions, leading to inherent variability. While vitamin K antagonists are the only option for patients with MHV and significant mitral stenosis, direct oral anticoagulants appear to be a reasonable choice for other indications. In the presence of AA, complex conditions alone may justify anticoagulation, whereas thromboembolic and haemorrhagic risks should be evaluated individually for simpler lesions. This review summarizes the available evidence and makes relevant recommendations regarding thromboprophylaxis in ACHD patients, focusing on indications, risk scores, and therapies.	0	contr
40070273	Investigating the genomic and biochemical effects of dalapon on antioxidant systems in zebrafish, <i>Danio rerio</i>.

Kidney and liver tissues were analyzed to assess oxidative stress levels. Results indicated that both the concentration of dalapon (25 and 50 ppm) and the duration of exposure had a significant effect on AE activities and gene expression. RT-PCR analysis suggested that changes in gene expression among dalapon-exposed zebrafish might indicate a rapid response to pesticide-induced stress. Moreover, the activities of CAT, G6PD, and GST increased in response to dalapon exposure at the specified concentrations. In contrast, prolonged exposure exceeding 72 h led to significantly higher malondialdehyde levels in liver and kidney tissues compared to the control group. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of antioxidant enzymes in oxidative stress and provide important insights for developing aquaculture breeding programs focused on improving fish stress tolerance. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis and conserved gene synteny analysis confirmed that the antioxidant enzyme genes in zebrafish are orthologous to those found in other model organisms, such as medaka and stickleback. Consequently, these results could be beneficial for other vertebrate species.	1	pest

40054134	Pseudomonas syringae exacerbates apple replant disease caused by Fusarium.	Apple replant disease (ARD) causes significant economic losses globally, including in China. Analyzing the causes of this replant disease from the perspective of rhizosphere microecology is therefore essential. In this study, we examined rhizosphere soils from apple trees subjected to continuous cropping. The mechanisms underlying ARD were elucidated through high-throughput sequencing of the soil microbiome, co-occurrence network analysis using NetShift, and correlation analyses. Core bacterial microbes were isolated, and their roles in altering the microecological environment were verified through reinoculation experiments. The results indicated that the disease indices for apple seedlings cultivated increased in continuously cropped soils. Bacterial diversity decreased in continuously cropped apple orchards for 10 years (R10) and 15 years (R15), but the relative abundance of Pseudomonas increased. In contrast, fungal diversity increased, with the relative abundance of Fusarium also increasing. As a dominant genus, Pseudomonas exhibited significant network variation after 10 years of consecutive cultivation, suggesting that this microorganism may play a key role in the occurrence of ARD. Moreover, the correlation analysis revealed, for the first time, that Pseudomonas is negatively correlated with bacterial diversity but positively correlated with the relative abundance of Fusarium, indicating a close relationship between Pseudomonas and Fusarium in continuously cropped soil. Four key Pseudomonas amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) strains were isolated from the continuously cropped rhizosphere soil of apple trees, and reinoculation experiments verified that introducing Pseudomonas exacerbated the occurrence of replant diseases in both strawberry and apple, with significantly higher disease indices compared to single Fusarium inoculation. The findings of this study provide new and timely insights into the mechanism underlying the occurrence of ARD.	0	contr
40065010	EMD missense variant causes X-linked isolated dilated cardiomyopathy with myocardial emerin deficiency.	Pathogenic variants in the EMD gene cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy type 1 (EDMD1), typically presenting with joint contractures and skeletal muscle atrophy, followed by atrial arrhythmias, cardiac conduction defects, and atrial dilatation. Although an association with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been suggested, evidence is currently insufficient to verify the gene-disease association. We investigated the causality of a missense variant, c.23C>G, p.Ser8Trp, in EMD in a large family with a history of DCM and suspected sudden cardiac death (SCD) in males. DCM was diagnosed in six hemizygous males aged 36-50 and detailed phenotyping identified end-stage heart failure, cardiac conduction defects, and ventricular arrhythmias as prominent features. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed late gadolinium enhancement with mixed ischemic and non-ischemic patterns. Muscular dystrophy was absent in all six males, of whom five underwent neuromuscular examination including serum-creatine kinase measurement. Immunohistochemical analysis showed greatly reduced levels of emerin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle samples. The EMD variant c.23C>G co-segregated with DCM, with an estimated LOD score of 3.9 and full-likelihood Bayes factor of >2500:1 in favor of causality. Among the 17 heterozygous females, ages 20-87, one developed DCM at age 72. We concluded that the EMD c.23C>G missense variant is associated with DCM in the absence of muscular dystrophy, thereby providing new evidence of isolated DCM as a distinct cardiac EMD-phenotype, separate from EDMD1. The phenotypic similarities with LMNA-DCM, with a high risk of cardiac conduction defects and ventricular arrhythmias, might warrant early interventions to prevent SCD.	0	contr
40065196	Development of a tetraplex reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay for three carlaviruses and an ilarvirus infecting hop and viral titer quantification in different tissue types.	The hop plant (Humulus lupulus) is an economically important perennial species of plant due to its role in beer production. While the majority of hop production occurs in central Washington State, local production in regions around the United States is gaining popularity due to local micro-breweries wanting to use locally grown hops in their production. In Florida, production has recently increased, and while most hop plants are grown from tissue culture, the development of a cost-effective diagnostic assay for hop viruses is critical to ensure planting material is clean. In this study, a tetraplex RT-dPCR assay was developed for the detection of four common hop viruses; Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), Hop mosaic virus (HMV), Hop latent virus (HLV) and American hop latent virus (AHLV). A synthetic control was generated with corresponding viral sequences inserted in tandem for optimization. Stem, petiole, and leaf tissue sampled from each of three different cultivars with different viral profiles were screened with the tetraplex RT-dPCR assay. Across all tissue types and cultivars, HLV had the highest titer level, followed by HMV and ApMV having the lowest levels. Additionally, there were significant levels of variation among tissue types across cultivars. These data highlight the utility of this assay for detecting viruses in hop tissue and provide a useful diagnostic tool for screening hop plants to confirm they are healthy. This assay will be utilized in vector studies but also integrated into diagnostic services.	0	contr
40059228	Transcriptional reprogramming and microbiome dynamics in garden pea exposed to high pH stress during vegetative stage.	High soil pH induces the upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress and nutrient transport, while the enrichment of beneficial microbes (Variovorax, Chaetomium, and Pseudomonas) highlights their potential role in promoting stress adaptation. High soil pH severely impacts plant growth and productivity, yet the transcriptomic changes and microbial dynamics underlying stress adaptation in garden pea (Pisum sativum ssp. hortense) remain unclear. This study demonstrates that high soil pH leads to stunted growth, reduced biomass, impaired photosynthesis, and nutrient status in garden pea. Further, disruption in key nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium indicum, R. leguminosarum, and R. redzepovicii), along with the downregulation of NifA and NifD genes and upregulation of NifH in nodules highlights the critical role of micronutrient balance in legume-microbe symbiosis and a compensatory response to maintain nitrogen status. RNA seq analysis revealed extensive transcriptional reprogramming in roots, characterized by the upregulation of oxidative stress response genes (e.g., oxidoreductase and glutathione transferase activities, metal ion transporters) and the downregulation of genes related to ammonia-lyase activity and ion binding, reflecting broader disruptions in nutrient homeostasis. KEGG pathway analysis identified enrichment of MAPK signaling pathway, likely interacting with other pathways associated with stress tolerance, metabolic adjustment, and structural reorganization as part of adaptive responses to high pH. Root microbiome analysis showed significant enrichment of Variovorax, Shinella, and Chaetomium, suggesting host-driven recruitment under high pH stress. Stable genera, such as Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, Mycobacterium, Herbaspirillum, and Paecilomyces, displayed resilience to stress conditions, potentially forming core microbiome components for adaptation to high pH. In a targeted study, inoculation of plants with an enriched microbiome, particularly C. globosum, under high pH conditions improved growth parameters and increased the abundance of Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas in the roots. It suggests that these bacterial genera may act as helper microbes to C. globosum, collectively promoting stress resilience in pea plants suffering from high pH. These findings provide a foundation for microbiome-aided breeding programs and the development of microbial consortia to enhance the adaptation of pea plants to high pH conditions.	0	contr
40064349	Distribution and Accumulation Dynamics of Fungicide Azoxystrobin in the Soil-Plant System.	Azoxystrobin is a widely used fungicide belonging to the strobilurin group, primarily employed to control a range of fungal diseases in crops, including pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). As a systemic pesticide, it effectively inhibits mitochondrial respiration in fungi, thereby preventing their growth and spread. However, concerns have emerged regarding its environmental persistence and potential bioaccumulation in soil-plant systems. This study conducted a field study and utilized HPLC-MS/MS for sample analysis, investigating the distribution and accumulation dynamics of azoxystrobin in the soil-plant system, with a focus on its behavior in different soil depths and plant tissues. The results show that pesticide concentration in the shoots remained consistently low throughout the observation period. In contrast, the concentration in roots gradually increased over time, with a peak observed in the top soil around the 10th day (16.56 mg/kg), followed by a rapid decrease to 1.44 mg/kg by the 14th day after application. The pesticide concentration in the subsurface soil remained relatively stable, reaching 0.91 mg/kg by the 35th day. The percentage distribution of pesticides in different parts of the system was as follows: top soil > subsurface soil > roots > shoots. The biological concentration factor (BCF) was greater than 1 during the early and middle-late growth stages, and both the biological accumulation coefficient (BAC) and translocation factor (TF) remained consistently below 1. This study highlights the role of the top soil as a primary pesticide reservoir and suggests limited translocation efficiency from roots to shoots. This pattern of accumulation could have significant implications for environmental health by indicating potential risks of pesticide persistence in the soil, emphasizing the need for further research on optimizing agricultural practices to mitigate pesticide accumulation in the environment.	0	contr
40054662	Planktonic versus colony growth of Bacillus thuringiensis affects gene expression in vitro and infectivity against an insect host, Galleria mellonella.	The entomopathogenic bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, can complete its life cycle in environments of varying densities like insects, cadavers and soil. The stationary growth phase of the bacterial lifecycle includes virulent, necrotrophic and sporulation stages, which are under the control of pleotropic regulators of quorum sensing. In addition to insecticidal Cry-toxins, B. thuringiensis can generate quorum-dependent virulence factors. Herein, we investigated the development of B. thuringiensis under conditions of planktonic and colony growth. Using an insect host, namely Galleria mellonella larvae, we observed distinct virulence profiles and differential expression of quorum regulatory genes between B. thuringiensis from liquid planktonic growth and those colonies on a solid surface/medium.	0	contr
40065514	NAPQI is absent in the mouse brain after Sub-hepatotoxic and hepatotoxic doses of acetaminophen.	Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most-used over-the-counter analgesic among pregnant women. However, concerns have arisen over the safety of APAP exposure during gestation. In particular, it's been speculated that the hepatotoxic metabolite of APAP, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), forms in the brain after maternal use of therapeutic APAP doses and leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, APAP metabolism in the brain is understudied. Here, we tested the hypothesis that NAPQI can be generated in the brain by overdosing BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (common model of the NDD autism) and C57Bl/6J mice with APAP and measuring glutathione loss and APAP-protein adducts as two of the best markers of NAPQI available. Despite glutathione depletion and adducts in the liver, we saw none in the brain. We conclude NAPQI is unlikely to contribute to the pathophysiology of NDDs. IMPACT STATEMENT: It has been hypothesized that NAPQI formation in the brain provides biological plausibility for the purported link between APAP and NDDs. Our results cast doubt on that hypothesis.	0	contr
40066599	Insights from traditional fermented legumes towards the innovation of modern plant-based meat analogues.	There has been a major growth in the development of plant-based meat alternatives (PBMA) in recent years. However, current PBMA often contain ultra processed ingredients and numerous additives to be able to mimic animal-based meat (ABM) including the meaty (umami) flavour, characteristic firm/chewy structure and juicy mouthfeel. In this review, the potential of ancient fermentation techniques as a minimally processed alternative to ABM and current PBMA are explored. Fermented foods including tempeh, natto, dawadawa and ugba are naturally high in protein and umami flavours. The nutritional, aroma, flavour and techno-functional properties are provided and discussed in the context of ABM and PBMA. The fermented foods have potential to be used as whole foods ingredients, or their constituents can be used as ingredients in plant-based foods. Particularly the umami flavours and high protein content combined with the naturally occurring high water holding capacity (WHC), solubility and other material properties make fermented legume foods suitable candidates for use in high-protein plant-based foods. Understanding the sensory characteristics and material properties generated during legume fermentation and their similarities to ABM can aid in stimulating innovations in food technology to obtain a new generation of less-processed PBMA with limited additives.	0	contr

CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are strategically located in peripheral tissues, enabling a rapid response to local infections, which is different from circulating memory CD8+ T cells. Their unique positioning makes them promising targets for vaccines designed to enhance protection at barrier sites and other organs. Recent studies have shown a correlation between CD8+ TRM cells and favorable clinical outcomes in various types of cancer, indicating their potential role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the dual nature of CD8+ TRM cells presents challenges, as their inappropriate activation may lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review highlights significant advancements in the field, focusing on the differentiation pathways and phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ TRM cells across different tissues and disease states. We also review their protective roles in various contexts and the implications for vaccine development against infections and treatment strategies for tumors.

40064739	Metagenomic insights of microbial functions under conventional and conservation agriculture.	Agricultural practices such as conventional (CN) and conservation agriculture (CA) influence the composition and structure of soil microorganisms. We used short reads and genome-resolved metagenomic-based dual sequencing approaches to create a profile of bacterial and archaeal communities in hyperthermic Typic Haplustepts soil after seven years of CA and CN. The most differences in the physico-chemical and biological properties of soil were higher pH, organics carbon, available nitrogen and microbial biomass contents, activities of dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, and arylsulfatase, found in CA soil. The dominant bacterial taxa under both management types were Pseudomonadota (46-48%), Acidobacteriota (12-13%), Planctomycetota (8-10%), Bacteroidota (7-8%), and Actinomycetota (6-7%). Nitrososphaerota (1.1-1.5%) was the predominant archaeal phyla in CA and CN soils. The alpha diversity was 1.5 times higher in CA compared to CN soils. Fourteen high-quality (HQ) metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from both groups. Four HQ metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Pseudomonadota phylum were exclusively recovered from the CA soil. The dominance of this phylum in the CA soil might be correlated with its nutrient richness, as certain classes of Pseudomonadota, such as Alpha, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltaproteobacteria, are known to be copiotrophic. Copiotrophic organisms thrive in nutrient-rich environments, which could explain their prevalence in the CA soil. CAZyme gene analysis showed that Glycoside Hydrolases (GH) and GlycosylTransferases (GT) classes are dominant in the CA group, possibly due to higher substrate availability from the application of crop residues, which provide a rich source of complex carbohydrates. Several biogeochemical gene families related to C1 compounds, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur metabolism were enriched in CA soils, suggesting these practices may contribute to a soil environment with increased organic matter content, microbial diversity, and nutrient availability. Overall, CA practices seemed to improve soil health by supporting soil microbial communities abundance.	0	contr
40065622	[Research progress on the mechanisms of Tau phosphorylation and its kinases in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage].	Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is one of the main causes of disability in middle-aged and elderly people, as well as high mortality rates and long-term physical impairments in newborns. The pathological manifestations of HIBD include neuronal damage and loss of myelin sheaths. Tau protein is an important microtubule-associated protein in brain, exists in neurons and oligodendrocytes, and regulates various cellular activities such as cell differentiation and maturation, axonal transport, and maintenance of cellular cytoskeleton structure. Phosphorylation is a common chemical modification of Tau. In physiological condition, it maintains normal cell cytoskeleton and biological functions by regulating Tau structure and function. In pathological conditions, it leads to abnormal Tau phosphorylation and influences its structure and functions, resulting in Tauopathies. Studies have shown that brain hypoxia-ischemia could cause abnormal alteration in Tau phosphorylation, then participating in the pathological process of HIBD. Meanwhile, brain hypoxia-ischemia can induce oxidative stress and inflammation, and multiple Tau protein kinases are activated and involved in Tau abnormal phosphorylation. Therefore, exploring specific molecular mechanisms by which HIBD activates Tau protein kinases, and elucidating their relationship with abnormal Tau phosphorylation are crucial for future researches on HIBD related treatments. This review aims to focus on the mechanisms of the role of Tau phosphorylation in HIBD, and the potential relationships between Tau protein kinases and Tau phosphorylation, providing a basis for intervention and treatment of HIBD.	0	contr

40063805	Sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to multiple <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> traits in transgenic maize.	Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.	1	pest
40065140	Establishment and validation of a simple and accurate qPCR detection method for Haemophilus parasuis.	As an infectious disease that poses a significant threat to the rapidly growing pig breeding industry, the detection of Haemophilus parasuis (HPS) is often compromised by various interfering substances present in the test sample during quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The rapid detection of HPS is important for the isolation of infectious pigs and their treatment. We designed and optimized a rapid qPCR test to detect the INFB gene of HPS in clinical and environmental samples on pig farms. The method was evaluated for its specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, anti-interference capability, and its ability to detect HPS in clinical samples. The results indicated that the method was specific for the detection of HPS when evaluated against pathogens and intestinal probiotics found in pig farms. By using a seven-fold dilution series of the recombinant plasmid DNA in triplicate, it was determined that the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for this method was less than 10 copies/µL. The results of inter-batch and intra-batch repeatability tests showed that the coefficient of variation (CV) was consistently below 1%. Furthermore, the impact of 14 endogenous and exogenous interfering substances on the Ct values detected by the HPS qPCR was found to be less than 5% when compared to the Ct values obtained in the absence of interfering substances. A total of 248 clinical samples were analyzed using the HPS qPCR, commercial kits, and corresponding national standards, yielding positive rates of 9.27%, 6.05%, and 9.27%, respectively. Notably, the positive and negative percent agreement between the detection method developed in this research and the national standard was 100%. These findings demonstrate that the established detection method is suitable for epidemiological research on HPS and for diagnosing clinical samples containing interfering substances, thereby providing essential technical support for the prevention and control of HPS.	0	contr
40066469	3D anatomical digital twins: New generation virtual models to navigate robotic partial nephrectomy.	"Objective 3D virtual models have gained interest in urology, particularly in the context of robotic partial nephrectomy. From these, newly developed ""anatomical digital twin models"" reproduce both the morphological and anatomical characteristics of the organs, including the texture of the tissues they comprise. The aim of the study was to develop and test the new digital twins in the setting of intraoperative guidance during robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). Patient and Methods The production path of the 3D model-digital twin of an organ begins with a phantom of virtual elements, including the kidney's parenchyma, vessels, tumour and collecting system. Textures are created from intraoperative robotic surgery images using machine learning algorithms. The result is a 3D model - digital twin that replicates the organ's shape and appearance. Two surgeons, one experienced and one young, used both the standard 3D model and the digital twin in four surgical phases: identifying the organ and its boundaries, dissecting the vascular pedicle, isolating the neoplastic lesion and identifying the renal pelvis and ureter. Results 4 patients, 2 per each surgeon harbouring a low and intermediate complexity (PADUA 6 and 8) renal masses respectively, underwent RAPN. From the assessment made by the surgeons at the end of each procedure, the 3D digital twin models were found to be superior to their standard counterparts both in terms of concordance with real anatomy and in usefulness to guide the identification of the tumour, vascular pedicle and ureter, while they did not demonstrate significant advantages in identifying the kidney and its margins. Conclusions The new 3D digital twin models represent a step forward towards the personalization of virtual reconstructions. Approaching real anatomy more closely, they offer the surgeons a perceived higher degree of concordance with the intraoperative environment, making it easier to identify the structures of interest during the surgical procedure."	0	contr
40066032	Proteome-wide identification of druggable targets and inhibitors for multidrug-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> using an integrative subtractive proteomics and virtual screening approach.	<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a versatile and antibiotic-resistant gram-negative pathogen, poses a critical threat to both immunocompromised and immunocompetent populations, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic targets. This study applies an extensive subtractive proteomics approach to identify viable drug targets within the core proteome of <i>P. aeruginosa PAO1</i>, analyzing a total of 5563 proteins. Through a rigorous, multi-stage process, we excluded human homologs, identified essential proteins, mapped functional pathways, determined subcellular localization, and assessed virulence and resistance factors. This comprehensive analysis led to the identification of three novel, druggable targets integral to <i>P. aeruginosa's</i> pathogenicity and multidrug resistance: preprotein translocase subunit SecD, chemotaxis-specific methyl esterase, and imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisF2. Following this, inverse virtual screening of 464,867 compounds from the VITAS-M library, performed using Schrödinger's Glide module, initially pinpointed 15 potent hits with favorable binding affinities and pharmacokinetic profiles as confirmed by QikProp analysis. Subsequent molecular dynamics, MMPBSA and DFT calculations refined these to three promising candidates: STK417467 for imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisF2, STL321396 for chemotaxis-specific methylesterase, and STL243336 for preprotein translocase subunit SecD. These compounds show strong potential as inhibitors and could be developed further as therapeutic agents against multidrug-resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections. This study provides a robust computational framework for the discovery of drug targets and candidate inhibitors, marking a significant step toward effective treatments for resistant <i>Pseudomonas</i> infections.	0	contr
40065658	Advantages of Mutant Generation by Genome Rearrangements of Non-Conventional Yeast via Direct Nuclease Transfection.	We previously developed a genome engineering method (TAQing2.0) based on the direct delivery of DNA endonucleases into living cells, which induces genome rearrangements even in non-sporulating nonconventional yeasts without introducing foreign DNA. Using TAQing2.0 and conventional mutagenesis (by nitrosoguanidine), we obtained mutant asexual Candida utilis strains capable of growing under highly acidic conditions (pH 1.8). Whole genome resequencing revealed that the genomic sequences of mutants generated by both methods contain a negligible small population of unmappable sequences, suggesting that both types of mutants can be regarded as equivalent to naturally occurring mutants. TAQing2.0 mutants exhibit multiple genome rearrangements with few point mutations, whereas conventional mutagenesis produces numerous point mutations. This feature enabled us to easily identify candidate genes (e.g., LYP1 homolog) responsible for acid resistance. TAQing2.0 is a powerful and versatile tool for mutant production and gene hunting without invasion of foreign DNA.	0	contr

40059719	Improved Modeling of Vegetation Phenology Using Soil Enthalpy.	Many vegetation phenological models predominantly rely on temperature, overlooking the critical roles of water availability and soil characteristics. This limitation significantly impacts the accuracy of phenological projections, particularly in water-limited ecosystems. We proposed a new approach incorporating soil enthalpy-a comprehensive metric integrating soil moisture, temperature, and texture-to improve phenological modeling. Using an extensive dataset combining FLUXNET observations, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), and meteorological data across the Northern Hemisphere (NH), we analyzed the relationship between soil enthalpy and vegetation phenology from 2001 to 2020. Our analysis revealed significant temporal trends in soil enthalpy that corresponded with changes in leaf onset date (LOD) and leaf senescence date (LSD). We developed and validated a new soil enthalpy-based model with optimized parameters. The soil enthalpy-based model showed particularly strong performance in autumn phenology, improving LSD simulation accuracy by at least 15% across all vegetation types. For shrub and grassland ecosystems, LOD projections improved by more than 12% compared to the temperature-based model. Future scenario analysis using CMIP6 data (2020-2054) revealed that the temperature-based model consistently projects earlier LOD and later LSD compared to the soil enthalpy-based model, suggesting potential overestimation of growing season length in previous studies. This study establishes soil enthalpy as a valuable metric for phenological modeling and highlights the importance of incorporating both water availability and soil characteristics for more accurate predictions of vegetation phenology under changing climatic conditions.	0	contr

40057539	Competition and interdependence define interactions of Nostoc sp. and Agrobacterium sp. under inorganic carbon limitation.	Cyanobacteria of the Nostoc genus are capable of forming symbiotic relationships with plants but also serve as a hub for heterotrophic bacteria. By comparing the axenic strain Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 and the xenic strains Nostoc sp. KVJ2 and KVJ3, we were able to demonstrate an almost obligate dependence of the cyanobacteria on the heterotrophic partners under carbon-limiting conditions. A detailed analysis of the intimate relationship between N. punctiforme and the isolate Agrobacterium tumefaciens Het4 using shotgun proteomics and microscopy uncovered a complex partnership characterized by competition for iron and facilitation for carbon. The prevalent extracarboxysomal localization of the carbon-fixing enzyme RubisCO suggests that a weak carbon-concentrating mechanism in N. punctiforme enforces a dependence on heterotrophic bacteria. Our study indicates a limited autonomy of symbiotic Nostoc strains, which may also explain its preference for symbiotic interactions.	0	contr
40065768	Development of a novel anti-erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor B6 monoclonal antibody Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 for flow cytometry.	Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor B6 (EphB6) is a member of the largest Eph subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. EphB6 is widely expressed in various tissues and regulates cellular homeostasis by interacting with its membrane-bound ephrin ligands and other receptors. EphB6 is involved in cancer pathology despite lacking kinase activity. Developing sensitive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for EphB6 has been desired for treatment, diagnosis, and further analysis of EphB6. This study established a novel specific and sensitive anti-human EphB6 mAb clone Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 (mouse IgG<sub>1</sub>, kappa) by the Cell-Based Immunization and Screening (CBIS) method. In flow cytometry, Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 demonstrated reactivity with EphB6-overexpressed Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (CHO/EphB6) and endogenously EphB6-expressing DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells. Cross-reactivity of Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 was not observed. Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 demonstrated a moderate binding affinity (dissociation constant; <i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>) for CHO/EphB6 (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>: 2.6 ± 1.0 × 10<sup>-8</sup> M) and a high binding affinity for DLD-1 (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>: 3.4 ± 1.3 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M). Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 can detect EphB6 protein in CHO/EphB6 lysate in Western blot. Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3, established by the CBIS method, could be valuable for analyzing the EphB6-associated cellular functions and has potential applications in diagnosis and treatment with specificity and high affinity for cancer cells.	0	contr
40065333	Alleviating the emotional burden on families during organ donation requests in neurologic patients declared with brain death: the role of timing and circumstances of death.	Organ donation requests to families often occur during moments of profound grief and create an emotional burden that is compounded by the varying emotional responses to circumstances surrounding death. These responses, in turn, interact with the timing of the request to influence authorization decisions. Understanding the interplay between timing and circumstances of death is crucial for improving authorization rates and addressing the organ donor shortage. The Organ Retrieval and Collection of Health Information for Donation database was used to identify 3,289 potential donors with neurologic mechanisms of brain death. Multivariate logistic regression with interaction between timing and circumstance was used to estimate authorization rates. Results show no significant differences in authorization for requests made within 12 h of death, regardless of circumstance. However, significant differences in authorization were observed between requests made at the time of brain death and those made 12 or more hours later for natural causes, as well as those at 24 or more hours for homicide, motor vehicle accidents, and non-motor vehicle accidents. These findings indicate that the optimal timing for organ donation requests may depend on the emotional intensity of the situation. While quicker requests may be more effective in less emotionally charged cases, extending the time for families to grieve in highly distressing circumstances does not appear to negatively impact authorization rates. Tailoring the timing of donation requests to the circumstances of death, balancing sensitivity with the need for prompt decision-making, could reduce families' emotional burden, ease pressure in decision-making, and help address the shortage of organ donors.	0	contr

Curcumin possesses a variety of pharmacological properties, particularly anticancer activity. However, its clinical utility is limited by its poor water solubility and low bioavailability. To alleviate the problems, our previous research demonstrated that mono-carbonyl curcumin easters can be employed for the development of novel anticancer agents. In this study, further structural optimization was performed and a series of novel amino acid conjugates of mono-carbonyl curcumin H1-H6 were designed, synthesized, and evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies. Compound H1 was found as the most potent derivative (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.66 µM) compared to curcumin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 36.19 µM) by anti-proliferation assay. Subsequently, wound healing, transwell, JC-1 staining, the HepG2 cell xenograft model and H&E staining experiments were performed, and it was found that compound H1 was more effective than curcumin in inhibiting tumor growth. The results of transcriptome sequence, bioinformatics analysis, molecular docking, and western blotting suggested that compound H1 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through the AKT/FOXO1 pathway. Hence, H1 is a promising lead compound with the potential to be developed as a chemotherapy agent for hepatocellular carcinoma.	0	contr

40056894	From soil sorption to bioaccumulation: Tracing the endectocide ivermectin in soil and earthworms.	Ivermectin (IVM), a widely used antiparasitic drug in veterinary medicine, has emerged as an environmental contaminant due to its semi-persistence and potentially harmful ecotoxicological impacts on non-target terrestrial fauna. This study investigates the innovative combination of sorption, desorption, and bioaccumulation dynamics of IVM in soil-earthworm systems, focusing on the species Eisenia fetida, Aporrectodea caliginosa, and Lumbricus terrestris. Sorption experiments in artificial soil (AS) and its components (sand, clay, peat) revealed a strong affinity of IVM for organic-rich substrates, reducing bioavailability and bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation studies showed that the kinetic bioaccumulation factor BAF<sub>k</sub> for IVM in E. fetida ranged from 0.505 to 0.727 g soil dw/g earthworm dw, with elimination kinetics best described by a biphasic model, and suggesting minimal net accumulation. A. caliginosa and L. terrestris showed slightly higher accumulation potential, with accumulation factors exceeding 1 during the uptake phase, although equilibrium was not reached within 21 days. The prolonged accumulation process, combined with a calculated DT<sub>50</sub> of 142 days in AS, underscores IVM's potential environmental persistence and risk, particularly its ecotoxicological relevance. The results also suggest that strong sorption to organic matter in soils can mitigate bioaccumulation.	0	contr
40063217	Methodological optimization for ecotoxicological community tests with Enchytraeids-extraction procedures and sampling effort.	Enchytraeids play important roles in ecosystems, contributing to the decomposition of organic matter, given the feeding activity in the litter and the interaction with soil microorganisms, affecting the regulation, flow, and cycling of carbon and nutrients in ecosystems. Despite their ecological relevance, enchytraeids are commonly neglected in soil biodiversity assessments. To develop a methodology to assess the effects of pollutants on natural communities of enchytraeids, some methodologies require optimization. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the two extraction methods of the enchytraeid community to access their structural diversity, determine the sampling effort for each extraction method, and evaluate the survival of the specimens subjected in a post-extraction survival test. The samplings were collected in two municipalities in the South region of Brazil. In each area, two transects were established (one for the wet-hot extraction method and one for the wet-cold extraction method); each transect contained nine sampling points, and nine cores were collected. The nine cores were collected in a grid of 3 × 3 subpoints, spaced 0.3 m. The enchytraeids were identified until genus and morphospecies level. The extraction method did not influence the diversity accessed in the field. The sampling effort was positively related to the genus and morphospecies richness, with the cold extraction method requiring more samples to achieve a given fraction of species richness. Additionally, both extraction methods had similar effects on the survival of enchytraeids after extraction. These results contribute to the development of a methodology to assess the effects of pollutants on enchytraeids communities and help to fulfill the gap of knowledge about this important biological indicator.	0	contr
40066427	Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte Ratio: A Shunned Entity as a Novelty in Diagnosing Peripheral Vestibular Disorders.	Vestibular vertigo is a condition characterized by dizziness or imbalance, often resulting from changes in head position. With an incidence of 1.4% in adults, vertigo is a common symptom in the general population (Oxford Textbook of Vertigo and Imbalance, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2013). To study the potential association of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in patients with peripheral vestibular disorders. A one year cross-sectional observational study with a total of 51 confirmed cases of peripheral vestibular disorders was conducted in the department ENT and HNS. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio(NLR) and DHI scoring was analysed. Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis. 41.18% of patients in the study were male, while 58.82% of the patients were female. In terms of numbers, it was discovered that the mean age of females (50.97) exceeded the mean age of males (48.43). The DHI score indicated a severe handicap in 58.82% of the study subjects with a mean NLR 6.93, while 39.22% participants showed moderate handicap with a mean NLR 7.20. Majority of the study subjects ellicited mild to moderate stress levels with respect to their NLR. Based on our results, we have concluded that neutrophil to lymphocyte plays a major role as a marker of peripheral vestibular diseases. With the majority of patients exhibiting moderate to severe handicap on dizziness handicap inventory scoring and mild to moderate stress levels; neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio should be touted as a marker for peripheral vertigo.	0	contr

Stenotrophomonas geniculata, a bacterium, has been recognized as an eco-friendly substitute for chemical fungicides in managing peanut foliar diseases, web blotch, and early leaf spot. Core genome and pan-genome analysis identified that strain MK-1 belongs to Stenotrophomonas geniculata, and nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis confirmed that strain belongs to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The research revealed that S. geniculata MK-1 had a notable antagonistic impact on Peyronellaea arachidicola and Cercospora arachidicola and demonstrated a biocontrol efficacy of over 95% against peanut early leaf spot and web blotch disease. The nonredundant protein sequences (NR) database identified 4324 annotations related to S. geniculata, with 2682 genes similar to strain MK-1. The COG database categorized 3041 annotations into 22 functional groups, and 33 distinct metabolic pathways associated with 1851 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations. Most genes linked with metabolism are found in S. geniculata, with 380 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 44 genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

40064231	Community structure and metabolic potentials of keystone taxa and their associated bacteriophages within rice root endophytic microbiome in response to metal(loid)s contamination.	Heavy metal (HM) contamination of agricultural products is of global environmental concern as it directly threatened the food safety. Plant-associated microbiome, particularly endophytic microbiome, hold the potential for mitigating HM stress as well as promoting plant growth. The metabolic potentials of the endophytes, especially those under the HM stresses, have not been well addressed. Rice, a major staple food worldwide, is more vulnerable to HM contamination compared to other crops and therefore requires special attentions. Therefore, this study selected rice as the target plants. Geochemical analysis and amplicon sequencing were combined to characterize the rice root endophytic bacterial communities and identify keystone taxa in two HM-contaminated rice fields. Metagenomic analysis was employed to investigate the metabolic potentials of these keystone taxa. Burkholderiales and Rhizobiales were identified as predominant keystone taxa. The metagenome-assembled genome (MAG)s associated with these keystone populations suggested that they possessed diverse genetic potentials related to metal resistance and transformation (e.g., As resistance and cycling, V reduction, Cr efflux and reduction), and plant growth promotion (nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, oxidative stress resistance, indole-3-acetic acid, and siderophore production). Moreover, bacteriophages encoding auxiliary metabolism genes (AMGs) associated with the HM resistance as well as nitrogen and phosphate acquisition were identified, suggesting that these phages may contribute to these crucial biogeochemical processes within rice roots. The current findings revealed the beneficial roles of rice endophytic keystone taxa and their associated bacteriophages within HM-contaminated rice root endophytic microbiome, which may provide valuable insights on future applications of employing root microbiome for safety management of agriculture productions.	0	contr

Extracellular proteins are supposed to play crucial roles in the formation and structure of biofilms and aggregates. However, often little is known about these proteins, in particular for microbial communities. Here, we use two advanced metaproteomic approaches to study the extracellular proteome in a granular Candidatus Accumulibacter enrichment as a proxy for microbial communities that form solid microbial granules, such as those used in biological wastewater treatment. Limited proteolysis of whole granules and metaproteome isolation from the culture's supernatant successfully classified over 50% of the identified protein biomass to be secreted. Moreover, structural and sequence-based classification identified 387 proteins, corresponding to over 50% of the secreted protein biomass, with characteristics that could aid the formation of aggregates, including filamentous, beta-barrel containing, and cell surface proteins. While various of these aggregate-forming proteins originated from Ca. Accumulibacter, some proteins associated with other taxa. This suggests that not only a range of different proteins but also multiple organisms contribute to granular biofilm formation. Therefore, the obtained extracellular metaproteome data from the granular Ca. Accumulibacter enrichment provides a resource for exploring proteins that potentially support the formation and stability of granular biofilms, whereas the demonstrated approaches can be applied to explore biofilms of microbial communities in general.	0	contr

40058874	Role of Arabidopsis monomeric E3 ubiquitin ligases in the ABA signaling pathway.	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key phytohormone that regulates multiple biological processes in plants, including seed germination, seedling growth, and abiotic stress response. ABA enhances drought tolerance by promoting stomatal closure, thereby improving crop productivity under unfavorable stress conditions. Extensive research efforts have focused on understanding ABA signaling more clearly for its potential application in agriculture. The accumulation and stability of signaling components involved in the efficient transduction of downstream ABA signaling are affected by both transcriptional regulation and post-translational modifications. Ubiquitination is a representative post-translational modification that regulates protein stability, and E3 ubiquitin ligase is a key enzyme that determines target substrates for ubiquitination. To date, many E3 ligases functioning as a monomeric form such as RING-, HECT- and Ubox-types have been known to participate in the ABA signaling process. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of ABA-related monomeric E3 ligases, their regulation, and mode of action in Arabidopsis, which will help develop a detailed and integrated understanding of the ABA signaling process in Arabidopsis.	0	contr

Embryonic exposure to valproic acid and imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) impairs filial imprinting in hatchlings, and the deteriorating effects of valproic acid are mitigated by post-hatch injection of bumetanide, a blocker of the chloride intruder Na-K-2Cl cotransporter 1. Here, we report that these exposures depolarized the reversal potential of local GABAergic transmission in the neurons of the intermediate medial mesopallium, the pallial region critical for imprinting. Furthermore, exposure increased field excitatory post-synaptic potentials in pre-tetanus recordings and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) by low-frequency tetanic stimulation. Bath-applied bumetanide rescued the impaired LTP in the valproic acid slices, whereas VU0463271, a blocker of the chloride extruder KCC2, suppressed LTP in the control slices, suggesting that hyperpolarizing GABA action is necessary for the potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission. Whereas a steep increase in the gene expression of KCC2 appeared compared to NKCC1 during the peri-hatch development, significant differences were not found between valproic acid and control post-hatch chicks in these genes. Instead, both valproic acid and imidacloprid downregulated several transcriptional regulators (FOS, NR4A1, and NR4A2) and upregulated the RNA component of signal recognition particles (RN7SL1). Despite different chemical actions, valproic acid and imidacloprid could cause common neuronal effects that lead to impaired imprinting.	1	pest
40065171	Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy with laromestrocel in mild Alzheimer's disease: a randomized controlled phase 2a trial.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, severe brain atrophy and neuroinflammation. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline of brain volume and potentially cognitive function. Larger-scale clinical trials of laromestrocel in AD are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05233774 .	0	contr
40054558	Assessing heavy metal pollution levels and associated ecological risks in peatland areas in the Mekong Delta region.	"Heavy metal (HM) pollution in soils and sediment is a significant concern, yet its levels and ecological risks in peatland areas remain unexplored. This study evaluates these aspects in three peatland regions of the Long An province in Vietnam. Comparisons of HM concentrations in peatland sediments from Tan Thanh, Thanh Hoa, and Duc Hue provinces in the study locations revealed highest values in the Tan Thanh region. Specifically, Cu and Ni were found in sediments at levels two to three times higher than the threshold effects level (TEL) and the effects range median (ERL) guidelines. The main sources of HM pollution in the study area are predicted to include the production and use of fertilizers and pesticides, metal surface processing, mechanical engineering and electronics manufacturing, and chemical plants. Further, positive correlations between HM concentrations and factors such as pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and clay-silt ratio in the sediments were identified through Spearman correlation analysis. The results obtained from the correlation analysis were further corroborated by Bayesian network analysis, which was also applied in this study. In addition, the contamination factor (CF) index indicated that Ni has a pollution level of ""moderate degree"" in Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and ""considerable degree"" in Tan Thanh (CF = 3.2), whereas, Cu has a pollution level of ""moderate degree"" in both Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and Tan Thanh (CF = 2.4). The modified degree of contamination (mCd) ranked the areas as Tan Thanh > Thanh Hoa > Duc Hue, with mCd indexes of 1.3, 0.7, and 0.4, respectively. The potential ecological risk index (RI) indicated a ""low risk"" level, with an average RI of 35.6 across all sites. These findings address knowledge gaps in HM pollution in peatlands but also contribute to the development of strategies for the protection of peatlands."	0	contr
40063772	First record of watermelon crinkle leaf-associated virus 2 infecting watermelon in open field in Italy.	Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) is an important horticultural crop in Italy, with a production of around 600,000 tons per year (third producer in the Europe). Viruses are considered a limiting factor in watermelon production, especially those transmitted by efficient vectors such as whiteflies and aphids. In July 2023, foliar symptoms on 100% of watermelon plants (cv. Samba), including curling and wrinkling, yellow mottling and chlorosis, were observed in a commercial field of about 4000 m2 at Eboli (Salerno province, South Italy; coordinates: 40°29'83''N 14°57'99''E) (Figure S1). Some fruits were also symptomatic showing circular lesions and deformations. Overall, symptoms resembled those described for watermelon crinkle leaf-associated viruses (WCLaV-1, Coguvirus citrulli and WCLaV-2, Coguvirus henanense; genus Coguvirus, family Phenuiviridae) (Hernandez et al., 2021; Hendricks et al., 2022; Mulholland et al., 2023). Total RNAs were isolated from pooled leaf tissues of 10 symptomatic plants using the Viral Gene-spinTM Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc., South Korea) and used for construction of RNA-seq libraries, which were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform with paired-end reads length of 101 bp. The HTS yielded 31,125,612 raw reads, while after trimming 28,868,089 reads were recovered. Viral genome assembly was performed with the two algorithms implemented in the SPAdes program (v. 3.15.3; Bankevich et al., 2012). Two sets of filtered contigs were obtained: 3,184 contigs with the algorithms implemented in Metaspades, and 3,369 contigs with algorithms implemented in RNAviral. BLASTn/BLASTx analysis of the contigs were carried out against online databases (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Two contigs, obtained from the assembly of 7520 reads for RNA1 and 4585 reads for RNA2 respectively, showed the greatest nucleotide identities with the WCLaV-2 genome. These contigs represented full-length genomic sequences of the corresponding virus. No other viral contigs belonging to other viruses were generated by HTS library. The HTS results were confirmed by RT-PCR on each of the 10 watermelon samples using the WCLaV-2-specific primers WCLaV-2vRP (5'-GTCTCACATTCCTGCACTAACT)/WCLaV-2cRP (5'-ATCGGTCCTGGGTTATTTGTATC) targeting 968 bp of the RdRP and WCLaV-2vMP (5'-GACTTCAGAACCTCAACATCCA)/WCLaV-2cMP (5'-CAAGGGAGAGTGCTGACAAA) targeting 562 bp of the MP (Hernandez et al., 2021). Amplicons of the expected size were sequenced and sequences were 100% identical to the corresponding regions obtained by HTS sequencing, confirming presence of WCLaV-2 in the watermelon plants. After verifying the sequences at the 5' and 3' ends, the sequences of the two genomic ssRNA segments consisted of 6679 nucleotides (nt) for RNA1 and 2729 nt for RNA2. These sequences were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers PQ869160 (RNA1) and PQ869161 (RNA2). According to the BLASTn analysis, the RNA1 was highly similar (99.94% sequence identity; 100% query coverage) to the Ju-01-WCLaV2 isolate (LC636073) from Brazil, while the RNA2 was highly similar (96.23% sequence identity; 99% query coverage) to the KF-15 isolate (NC_079049) from China. WCLaV-2 was first reported in watermelon in China (Xin et al., 2017) and then in USA (Hernandez et al. 2021), Brazil (Maeda et al., 2022) and Australia (Mulholland et al., 2023). Although it was recently detected in some watermelon commercial seeds in Italy (Minutolo et al., 2024), this report confirms for the first time the spread of the virus in open field watermelon crops in southern Italy. Studies to assess the incidence and impact of disease on watermelon production, the identification of potential vectors and the role of the seeds in virus transmission should be conducted to aid the development of the best management practices with the aim to contain the damages caused by the virus.	0	contr
40057106	Exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons among adults and children: Contributions from multiple pathways and sources.	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exist ubiquitously in the natural environment; however, studies seldom evaluate health risks from aggregate exposures to PAHs from multiple environmental media. This study aimed to estimate the doses and risks of 16 priority PAHs in soil and air for both children and adults and quantify their contributors. Soil and ambient air samples were collected at 50 and 8 sites, respectively, in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. Grab soil samples were taken from the upper 2 inches of the soil and air samples were collected every 12 days for over one year. The sum concentration of 16 PAHs (ΣPAH) averaged 7.6±15.0 mg/kg (range 1.5-98.8 mg/kg) in soil and 73.6±25.3 ng/m<sup>3</sup> (range 47.0-121.2 ng/m<sup>3</sup>) in air. Source apportionment identified five broad sources of health risks: vehicle emissions, petrogenic sources, coal combustion, emissions from coal tar, and natural gas combustion. For children aged 3-6 years, the average daily dose (ADD) of ΣPAH was 58.3 ng/kg-day, with 66%, 27%, and 7% from inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact, respectively. The lifetime cancer risk from all PAHs was 0.42×10<sup>-6</sup>, with ingestion being the primary contributor (75%). For adults aged 21-30 years, the ADD of ΣPAH was 46.2 ng/kg-day, with contributions of 67%, 31%, and 2% from dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion, respectively. The lifetime cancer risk from all PAHs was 0.55×10<sup>-6</sup>, mainly due to dermal contact (96%). Vehicle emissions, petrogenic sources, and coal combustion together contributed over 85% of the cancer risk. The findings provided bases for designing effective exposure controls, including source control and personal behavioral changes.	0	contr

40066155	Gut microbiome differences in individuals with PTSD compared to trauma-exposed controls: a systematic review.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental health disorder that can occur following exposure to a traumatic event, and is characterized by symptoms including intrusive memories, dissociation, and nightmares. PTSD poses significant suffering on the individual and can reduce quality of life substantially, however, its mechanisms are not fully understood. It has also been associated with gut abnormalities, such as with irritable bowel syndrome, indicating possible involvement of the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis. Whereas previous research has implicated the gut microbiome and microbiome gut-brain axis in various mental health disorders, the relationship between gut microbiome function and PTSD is unclear. Specifically, little is known about whether specific gut microbiome compositions can increase the risk of developing PTSD, or, vice versa, act as a protective factor for the individual. This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature looking at gut microbiome differences between individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed controls (TEC) while exploring potential risk and resilience factors for development of the disorder. Three studies met the inclusion criteria, and results showed that all studies found differences in gut microbial taxa between PTSD and TEC groups yet varied in their taxonomic level and type. One study found a significant difference in diversity between groups, reporting lower diversity in PTSD, and two studies found certain taxa to be correlated with PTSD symptom severity: <i>Mitsuokella</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i>, <i>Catenibacterium</i> and <i>Olsenella</i> genera, and <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Lentisphaerae</i> and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> phyla. This review has important implications for potential novel treatments for PTSD which target the gut microbiome, for example psychobiotic dietary interventions such as prebiotics and probiotics. It also informs our understanding of potential risk and resilience factors for the disorder, such as certain gut microbiome compositions being potentially protective or increasing susceptibility. More research is needed, as currently sample sizes are small and confounding variables (e.g., diet) are not always controlled for. <b>Systematic review registration:</b> The protocol was registered on PROSPERO, registration number: CRD42024530033.	0	contr
40066446	Exercise boost after surgery improves survival in model of metastatic breast cancer.	Despite advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment of the primary tumor, metastatic breast cancer tumors remain largely incurable, and their growth is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. There is therefore a critical need to identify ways to reduce metastatic tumor burden and increase breast cancer patient survival. While surgery and pharmacological treatments are the cornerstones of breast cancer intervention, epidemiological data suggests that physical activity can lower the risk of breast cancer development, improve adjuvant treatment tolerance, reduce the risk of disease recurrence and lower breast cancer-related death.	0	contr
40066356	Adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation in post-PCI patients: a latent class analysis.	Coronary heart disease seriously jeopardizes human health and has become a principal public health problem of global concern. While percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) repairs narrowed arteries and extends patients' lives, cardiac rehabilitation offers additional benefits post-PCI. Numerous previous studies have shown that cardiac rehabilitation can inhibit the progression of atherosclerotic plaques in patients after coronary intervention, effectively controlling patients' clinical symptoms and improving their quality of life. However, the current status of adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation is poor, and the variation in adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation among post-PCI patients in China are not well understood. This study aimed to identify the heterogeneity of adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation and its influencing factors in post-PCI patients through latent class analysis (LCA) to support individualized interventions.	0	contr
40058049	Study on the effect of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 coupled with the low molecular weight organic acid on the dissimilation reduction of Cd-containing goethite.	Microbial dissimilated iron reduction is one of the important driving forces of the biological and geochemical cycles of iron in nature. Plant root exudates dominated by organic acids are important electron donors of the rhizosphere dissimilar iron reduction microorganisms under flooded conditions. In this paper, we investigated the effects of different kinds and concentrations of organic acids on the dissimilation reduction process of goethite by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and explored the effect of phase transformation of iron minerals on its adsorption of Cd. The results showed that the low molecular weight organic acid promoted the dissolution of Fe(Ⅲ) in goethite, and ternary carboxylic acids had more obvious effect than binary carboxylic acids. The concentration of the solution of Fe(Ⅱ) increased by 63.95%-342.3%, the Fe(Ⅲ) concentration increased by 2.95%-260.6%. In addition, in the process of dissimilated iron reduction, the concentration of Cd released during the dissolution of iron ore is low due to the complexation of the low molecular organic acid, which will reduce the negative impact of high concentration Cd on Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and further reduce the inhibitory effect of Cd on dissimilated iron reduction. It is noteworthy that we found that Cd released by soil iron minerals will be adsorbed and fixed again, that is, heavy metals loaded on trivalent iron minerals will be released and redistributed in the process of dissimilated iron reduction, which is one of the migration and transformation ways of heavy metals in the environments.	0	contr
40065639	Genetic origins of the Kiritimati population from central-eastern Micronesia.	The migration of Austronesian-speaking populations through Oceania has intrigued researchers for decades. The Kiribati islands, situated along the boundaries of Micronesia and Polynesia, provide a crucial link in this migration. We analyzed the genome-wide data of the Kiritimati population of Kiribati to uncover their genetic origins and connections with other Oceanian groups. Our study reveals that the Kiritimati population primarily exhibits Remote Oceanian-related ancestry associated with ancient Lapita and present-day Polynesian populations. In addition, our identity-by-descent analysis identifies populations from Philippines as their closest relatives in Island Southeast Asia. The genetic links between Kiritimati, ancient Lapita, and modern Polynesians underscore the shared ancestry and continuous gene flow across these regions. This genetic continuity and ongoing links are supported by linguistic and cultural evidence, illustrating a complex history of migration and admixture in Oceania.	0	contr
40056745	Resilience mechanisms of rhizosphere microorganisms in lead-zinc tailings: Metagenomic insights into heavy metal resistance.	This study investigates the impact of heavy metal contamination in lead-zinc tailings on plant and soil microbial communities, focusing on the resilience mechanisms of rhizosphere microorganisms in these extreme environments. Utilizing metagenomic techniques, we identified a significant association between Coriaria nepalensis Wall. rhizosphere microbial communities and metal(loid) resistance genes. Our results reveal a notable diversity and abundance of bacteria within the rhizosphere of tailings, primarily consisting of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. The presence of metal-resistant bacterial taxa, including Afipia, Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonas, and Miltoncostaea, indicates specific evolutionary adaptations to metal-rich, nutrient-deficient environments. Elevated expression of resistance genes such as znuD, zntA, pbrB, and pbrT underscores the microorganisms' ability to endure these harsh conditions. These resistance genes are crucial for maintaining biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and adaptability. Our findings enhance the understanding of interactions between heavy metal contamination, microbial community structure, and resistance gene dynamics in lead-zinc tailings. Additionally, this research provides a theoretical and practical foundation for employing plant-microbial synergies in the in-situ remediation of contaminated sites.	0	contr
40065057	CIRP contributes to multiple organ damage in acute pancreatitis by increasing endothelial permeability.	Acute pancreatitis can lead to systemic inflammation and multiple organ damage. Increased endothelial permeability is a hallmark of systemic inflammation. Several studies have demonstrated that cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) functions as a proinflammatory factor in various diseases. However, its role in endothelial barrier dysfunction during acute pancreatitis remains unknown. To study this, acute pancreatitis was induced by two hourly intraperitoneal injections of 4.0 g/kg L-arginine in wild-type (WT) or CIRP knockout mice. Our results showed that CIRP levels in the pancreas, small intestine, lung, and liver were upregulated at 72 h after the induction of acute pancreatitis in WT mice. CIRP deficiency significantly attenuated tissue injury, edema, and extravasation of Evans blue in the pancreas, small intestine, lung, and liver at 72 h after L-arginine injection. Administration of C23, a specific antagonist of CIRP, at 2 h after the last injection of L-arginine also produced similar protective effects as CIRP knockout in mice. In vitro studies showed that recombinant CIRP caused a significant reduction in transcellular electric resistance in HUVEC monolayers. Immunocytochemical analysis of endothelial cells exposed to CIRP revealed an increased formation of actin stress fibers. VE-cadherin and β-catenin staining showed intercellular gaps were formed in CIRP-stimulated cells. Western blot analysis showed that CIRP induced SRC phosphorylation at TYR416. Exposure to the SRC inhibitor PP2 reduced CIRP-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in HUVEC monolayers. In conclusion, blocking CIRP mitigates acute pancreatitis-induced multiple organ damage by alleviating endothelial hyperpermeability. Targeting CIRP may be a potential therapeutic option for acute pancreatitis.	0	contr
40056554	Bioaccumulation of PCBs and OCPs in Antarctic phytoplankton and zooplankton: Insights into bioconcentration and biomagnification in Fildes Bay.	This study was conducted at Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, from November 30th, 2019, to January 30th, 2020. We determined the concentrations of Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in phytoplankton, and zooplankton. The most abundant compounds found were hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in phytoplankton and γ-HCH in zooplankton. We estimated the bioconcentration factors (BCF<sub>PHYTO</sub>) for phytoplankton and zooplankton (BCF<sub>ZOO</sub>), as well as biomagnification factors (BMF) across trophic levels. Our findings indicate that BCF values were generally higher for compounds with a higher degree of chlorination, and noticeable biomagnification of these contaminants was observed, emphasizing the enhancement of contaminant concentrations from phytoplankton to zooplankton. This biomagnification varied depending on the specific compound and environmental conditions. Throughout the study period, the factors influencing bioconcentration and biomagnification were closely correlated with the seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton biomass, which were affected by local conditions such as slower S and SE winds. These events enhanced the concentration of chlorophyll-a and POPs, influencing their transfer across trophic levels. Our study underscores the complex interplay between biotic and abiotic factors in determining the fate of these persistent pollutants in a rapidly changing polar environment. These findings highlight the need for continuing ongoing monitoring to understand the long-term impacts of environmental changes on the distribution and behavior of hazardous substances in remote regions like Antarctica.	1	pest
40057111	Impact of Repeated Organic Amendments on Trace Element Exposure and Health Risks via the Soil-Vegetable-Human Pathway.	Applying organic fertilizers enriches soil with essential nutrients and organic matter. However, the trace elements (TE) often present in organic fertilizers-such as chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As)-can pose food safety risks. Continuous use of organic amendments can lead to the accumulation of TE in the soil, increasing their uptake by plants and potential risks to human health. To investigate this, we conducted a study across two production cycles to examine the presence of TE along the soil-plant-human contamination pathway. Our focus was on assessing the effects of repeated fertilizer applications on vegetable production and TE contamination, particularly in leafy (lettuce) and root (radish) vegetables. The results showed that using sewage sludge (SS), swine manure (SM), and chemical fertilizer (CF) led to higher vegetable yields compared to compost derived from municipal solid waste (CP). Soil amendments had limit impact on the overall TE concentrations in the soil. However, TE were more concentrated in vegetables grown with organic fertilizers than in those grown with chemical fertilizers. TE levels in the edible parts of vegetables increased significantly following repeated applications. In the first productive cycle of both vegetables, Zn and Cd exhibited moderate bioaccumulation, with BCF values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. In the second cycle, bioaccumulation generally increased, with Zn reaching high bioaccumulation levels in lettuce under SS and SM treatments (BCF > 1.0). Cr in both vegetables and Cu in lettuce maintained moderate bioaccumulation levels. Conversely, both vegetables demonstrated strong defense mechanisms against Pb and As accumulation, as indicated by consistently low BCF values. According to the hazard quotient (HQ), repeated fertilization of lettuce with CF, CP, SS, and SM resulted in a 1.4-1.8-fold increase in the total hazard quotient (THQ) for adults and a 1.3-1.9-fold increase in radish bulbs, with a maximum THQ of 0.23 in the twice-CP fertilization treatment. Overall, the consumption of lettuce and radish grown in amended soils poses no significant health risk, as the THQ values remained consistently below 1.	0	contr

40060183	A high-throughput protocol for testing heat-stress tolerance in pollen.	Viable pollen is crucial for fertilization, but pollen is generally highly susceptible to heat stress. A quick, reliable method for testing the heat-stress tolerance of pollen is needed to improve the heat-stress tolerance in plants, but current methods require considerable space and labor. In addition, many such methods only test tolerance to a single constant temperature, making it time-consuming to screen heat tolerance over a wide temperature range and to examine the dynamics of pollen viability at different temperatures. To address this issue, we aimed to: (1) develop an easy, reliable method for measuring pollen viability at different temperatures; and (2) identify the best temperature range for screening pollen with high heat-stress tolerance. We harvested mature pollen from wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plants and transferred it to a 96-well plate filled with liquid medium containing sucrose. We placed the plate in a PCR machine operating under a gradient PCR program to simultaneously test a range of temperatures. After incubating the pollen for 4 h, at temperatures ranging from 21.9 to 47 °C, we examined the pollen grains under a light microscope and employed a specific image analysis pipeline to assess the effects of temperature on pollen morphology, germination, and tube growth. This method facilitated the high-throughput screening of many pollen samples, enabling rapid, reliable, and precise analysis of pollen viability in response to temperature. Our approach should be applicable to other plant species and could be used to identify quantitative trait loci or genes influencing heat stress tolerance in pollen for breeding programs.	0	contr

40060881	Removal of Antibiotics from Swine Wastewater Using an Environmentally Friendly Biochar: Performance and Mechanisms.	Antibiotics used in the swine industry to treat diseases and improve animal growth are poorly absorbed by swine and have been classified as micropollutants due to their occurrence in surface water, wastewater, and soil. This study investigated the capacity of biochar produced from eastern red cedar to remove target antibiotics that have been extensively used in the swine industry. Biochar was produced by pyrolysis from eastern red cedar at 450 °C. The sorption tests were performed by mixing biochar and a solution (1:10 ratio) containing each antibiotic in 100, 300, 600, and 900 μg L<sup>-1</sup> concentrations. The results indicate that red cedar biochar was able to effectively remove up to 99.93% tetracycline, 96.23% oxytetracycline, 98.28% chlortetracycline, 76.4% sulfadiazine, and 78.6% sulfamethazine at the lowest concentrations. The removal efficiencies at higher concentrations declined up to 83.52, 47.23, 64.16, 69.8, and 58.4% for tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethazine, respectively. The biochar exhibited stronger adsorption capacity for chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine compared to the other antibiotics. The likely adsorption mechanisms driving the removal of tetracyclines and sulfonamides are hydrogen-bonding and π-π electron-donor-acceptor, supported by FTIR analyses of the biochar itself. Overall, the results highlighted the potential utilization of eastern red cedar biochar for practical applications, mitigating antibiotic residues from swine wastewater in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner due to its relatively low pyrolysis temperature (450 °C) and sustainable repurposing of an invasive tree species.	0	contr

To address this issue, therapeutic nanoparticles composed of a dendritic polyglutamic acid (DPGlu) and chelerythrine (CHE) complex (DPGlu@CHE) were developed <i>via</i> hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. DPGlu@CHE could be adsorbed onto the tooth surface, releasing CHE rapidly under acidic conditions to remove cariogenic bacteria, subsequently inducing tooth surface remineralization <i>in situ</i>. Our results demonstrated that more than 99% of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> on the tooth surface were killed, and 84% of the mechanical properties of tooth were restored within 2 weeks. Thus, DPGlu@CHE was proven to be a safe and effective enamel restoration material <i>in vitro</i>, and its safety was verified <i>in vivo</i>, making it a promising mouthwash ingredient to maintain dental health.	0	contr
40065383	Autism spectrum disorder and 3p24.3p23 triplication: a case report.	The role of copy number variants as genomic mutations causative of neurodevelopmental disorders has been recently established. They can act as risk factors of conditions with multifactorial etiopathogenesis and incomplete penetrance, such as nonsyndromic autism, and, in this case, are often inherited from an unaffected parent. Conversely, dominant syndromes, with high penetrance, can be caused by de novo occurring variants.	0	contr

40065551	Kisspeptin fiber and receptor distribution analysis suggests its potential role in central sensorial processing and behavioral state control.	Kisspeptin (KP) signaling in the brain is defined by the anatomical distribution of KP-producing neurons, their fibers, receptors, and connectivity. Technological advances have prompted a re-evaluation of these chemoanatomical aspects, originally studied in the early years after the discovery of KP and its receptor Kiss1r. Previously, we characterized (Hernández et al. bioRxiv 2024) seven KP neuronal populations in the mouse brain at the mRNA level, including two novel populations, and examined their response to gonadectomy. In this study, we mapped KP fiber distribution in rats and mice using immunohistochemistry under intact as well as short- and long-term post-gonadectomy conditions. Kiss1r mRNA expression was examined via RNAscope, in relation to vesicular GABA transporter (Slc32a1) in whole mouse brain, and to KP and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Slc17a6), Kiss1, and Slc32a1 in hypothalamic RP3V and arcuate regions. We identified KP fibers in 118 brain regions, primarily in extra-hypothalamic areas associated with sensorial processing and behavioral state control. KP-immunoreactive fiber density and distribution were largely unchanged by gonadectomy. Kiss1r was expressed prominently in sensorial and state control regions such as the septal nuclei, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, locus coeruleus, hippocampal layers, thalamic nuclei, and cerebellar structures. Co-expression of Kiss1r and Kiss1 was observed in hypothalamic neurons, suggesting both autocrine and paracrine KP signaling mechanisms. These findings enhance our understanding of KP signaling beyond reproductive functions, particularly in sensorial processing and behavioral state regulation. This study opens new avenues for investigating KP's role in controlling complex physiological processes, including those unrelated to reproduction.	0	contr

40056774	Detection of microplastic hotspots in beach sand for national surveys using fluorescence microscopy and infrared spectroscopy: Case study on the Catalan coast.	The aim of this study is the characterization of microplastics (60 μm -5 mm) on Catalan beaches. It takes into consideration factors as sand size distribution, geomorphology, meteorological parameters and anthropogenic pressures. MPs were measured in seventy (n = 70) intertidal sand samples covering 580 km coastline. After dry sieving the fraction over 0.5 mm was analysed by visual sorting and FTIR techniques. The fraction below 0.5 mm was separated by wet density separation processes, oxidation of organic matter and then analysed by Nile Red staining and fluorescence microscopy. A subset of samples (n = 23) was also subjected to μ-FTIR techniques for compositional analysis in order to compare and confirm the results given by the staining method. The concentration of MP > 0.5 mm ranged from <0.55 to 56.8 MPs/kg (60 % fragments). For sizes 60 μm-0.5 mm it varied from 0 to 2013 MPs/kg (70 % fibres). Polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene composed most fragments. Polyester, polyamide, polypropylene and acrylic constituted fibres. Although spectroscopy (μFTIR) is needed to confirm the results, the staining method can be a screening strategy to detect hotspots and provided good approximations for MPs quantification. Only sand particle size is correlated with MPs concentration. Sewage treatment plant discharges, runoff, and local ocean currents might all be significant in the accumulation of MPs along the coast.	0	contr

40065421	Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and inhibitory control training for excess weight treatment: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (InhibE).	The prevalence of excess weight has increased globally. Despite interventions include targeted goals on essential aspects such as physical activity and diet, their long-term effectiveness remains limited. Research highlights that eating behaviour is influenced by impulsive processes, especially in the context of a food-rich environment. Inhibitory control has been identified as a key factor in regulating eating behaviour. Neuroscience approaches, including inhibitory control training and non-invasive neuromodulation of brain regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, show promise in improving eating behaviour when used in addition to conventional intervention for weight management. This parallel group, randomized, controlled trial aims to study the efficacy of neuromodulation with iTBS as an add-on to the weight loss treatment as usual (TAU: diet and exercise), alone and in combination with inhibitory control training, for excess weight treatment.	0	contr

40065264	Molecular breeding of pigs in the genome editing era.	To address the increasing demand for high-quality pork protein, it is essential to implement strategies that enhance diets and produce pigs with excellent production traits. Selective breeding and crossbreeding are the primary methods used for genetic improvement in modern agriculture. However, these methods face challenges due to long breeding cycles and the necessity for beneficial genetic variation associated with high-quality traits within the population. This limitation restricts the transfer of desirable alleles across different genera and species. This article systematically reviews past and current research advancements in porcine molecular breeding. It discusses the screening of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) to identify resistance loci in swine and the challenges and future applications of genetically modified pigs.	0	contr
40066033	T and NK cell functionality in a patient harboring heterozygous novel BCL11B p.Asp632fsAla∗91 and STX11 p.R129P mutations.	BCL11B is a transcription factor essential for central nervous system development and T-cell differentiation that regulates numerous genes across various pathways. Heterozygous BCL11B defects can lead to a broad spectrum of phenotypes, including neurological disorders with or without immunological features. STX11 encodes a t-SNARE protein crucial for the final fusion of lytic granules with the plasma membrane of NK-cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Biallelic mutations in STX11 are linked to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 4. We analyzed the functional impact of heterozygous BCL11B (p.Asp632fsAla∗91) and STX11 (p.R129P) variants present in a pediatric patient with Evans syndrome and neurodevelopmental delay, without hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis presentation. The BCL11B p.Asp632fsAla∗91 variant, positioned to escape nonsense-mediated decay, likely produces a truncated protein losing three zinc finger domains. Given that BCL11B is involved in the activation of IL-2 gene expression, we evaluated this function and found a reduced IL-2 production by the patient's CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. On the other hand, structural analysis of STX11 indicated that the proline substitution at position 129 could disrupt key interactions with Munc18-2. The patient's cells exhibited decreased NK-cell degranulation and cytotoxicity, and diminished CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell degranulation compared to healthy donors. <i>In vitro</i> IL-2 treatment restored these functions to healthy donor levels. We also observed a reduced STX11 protein expression in patient PBMCs. We hypothesize that impaired IL-2 secretion caused by the BCL11B mutation may reduce the patient's ability to compensate for STX11 dysfunction, suggesting that the combined effect of BCL11B and STX11 mutations contributes to the observed immune dysfunction and the patient's complex phenotype. Additionally, our findings suggest that abnormal NK- and T-cells function could play a role in the onset of autoimmune disorders.	0	contr
40066229	Pulmonary Hypertension: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Studies.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) stands as a tumor paradigm cardiovascular disease marked by hyperproliferation of cells and vascular remodeling, culminating in heart failure. Complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms collectively contribute to the disruption of pulmonary vascular homeostasis. In recent years, advancements in research technology have identified numerous gene deletions and mutations, in addition to <i>bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2</i>, that are closely associated with the vascular remodeling process in PH. Additionally, epigenetic modifications such as RNA methylation, DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs have been shown to precisely regulate PH molecular networks in a cell-type-specific manner, emerging as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review summarizes and analyzes the roles and molecular mechanisms of currently identified genes and epigenetic factors in PH, emphasizing the pivotal role of long ncRNAs in its regulation. Additionally, it examines current clinical and preclinical therapies for PH targeting these genes and epigenetic factors and explores potential new treatment strategies.	0	contr
40065582	Buprenorphine's Effect on the Human Immune System and Inflammation.	Opioid use disorder is a persistent epidemic despite several FDA-approved medications for its treatment. While the pathogenesis of opioid use disorder has been classically attributed to dopamine pathways in the brain, there is emerging evidence and interest surrounding the role of inflammation and inflammatory signaling in its development and treatment. Buprenorphine has become the most prescribed medication for opioid use disorder, largely due to its ease of access and tolerability. This review aimed to better characterize contemporary knowledge of how buprenorphine modulates the human immune system and inflammatory functions in this population. A comprehensive review was conducted using 11 key databases, including Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. This review captured 8177 records, and 14 studies were ultimately selected for inclusion and discussion in this review. Notably, all 14 clinical studies evaluated buprenorphine's effect on the peripheral immune system, and the majority of the studies supported the notion that initiation and maintenance of buprenorphine restore immune suppression caused by opioid use disorder. In addition, we discuss how recent and ongoing work utilizing advanced imaging and cellular technologies is advancing the understanding of how buprenorphine affects the immune and inflammatory signaling in the brain.	0	contr
40064960	Impact of drainage on peatland soil environments and greenhouse gas emissions in Northeast China.	Peatlands are vital for global carbon storage, but drainage significantly disrupts their natural carbon cycling. Drainage alters peatland soil environments in complex ways, affecting factors such as water table, soil temperature, organic carbon (SOC), pH, and microbial communities. However, how these factors interact to influence GHG emissions remains unclear. In this study, we compared water table, soil temperature, soil properties, microbial community structure, and GHG emissions across three zones of a peatland in Northeast China undergoing drainage: drained, transition, and natural areas. The average water table in the drained area was significantly lower than in the natural area (from 11.45 cm to -13.47 cm), shifting from waterlogged to unsaturated conditions. Deep soil temperatures in the drained area decreased by 1 ~ 3 °C. The pH of the upper soil layer was higher in the drained area (5.05 ~ 5.29 vs. 4.64 ~ 4.71), while SOC was lower (197.31 ~ 374.75 g/kg vs. 437.05 ~ 512.71 g/kg). Aerobic bacteria (mainly Solibacter) were more abundant in the drained area, while methanogens (mainly hydrogenotrophic) declined significantly. Fungal diversity increased from the natural to drained area with increased negative interactions and enhanced network modularity. Drainage reduced CH<sub>4</sub> emissions but increased CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, resulting in a significant rise in net GHG emissions (8.86 ~ 10.65 vs. 22.27 ~ 24.26 t CO<sub>2</sub>-eq·ha⁻¹·season⁻¹), primarily driven by increased CO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were positively correlated with soil temperature, aerobic bacteria, facultatively anaerobic bacteria and pH, but negatively correlated with water table, anaerobic bacteria, soil moisture and C/N ratio. CH<sub>4</sub> flux was positively correlated with methanogens and water table, but negatively correlated with pH. The effects of drainage were more pronounced near drainage ditches, particularly for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, highlighting the localized impacts of drainage on peatland GHG fluxes.	0	contr
40066532	Clinical, Immunologic, and Genetic Characteristics of T-lymphoblastic Leukemia with STIL-TAL1 Fusion.	T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with a less favorable prognosis. The genetic background of T-ALL is widely heterogeneous, with the co-occurrence of multiple genetic abnormalities. The STIL-TAL1 rearrangement results from a submicroscopic deletion on chromosome 1p33 and is present in 15 - 25% of T-ALL cases. Submicroscopic deletions are not detected by conventional cytogenetic ana-lyses but can be identified through array comparative genomic hybridization and/or high-throughput RNA sequencing. Patients with the STIL-TAL1 fusion exhibit distinct characteristics, such as a young age, high white blood cell count, typical immunophenotype, and specific genetic abnormalities. However, the clinical, laboratory, and prognostic significance of this rearrangement remains unclear. This study was performed to identify STIL-TAL1 rearrangement resulting from submicroscopic 1p33 deletion in T-ALL and to investigate the clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics of T-ALL patients with STIL-TAL1 fusion.	0	contr

40065506	DNA methylation signatures of cervical pre-invasive and invasive disease: An epigenome-wide association study.	Epigenetic alterations are essential in the development of cancers, while epigenome-wide exploration in cervical cancer has been limited. In this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) we explore differential DNA methylation signatures associated with CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) grade 3 and cervical cancer to better understand potential drivers and biomarkers of cervical carcinogenesis. 247 women were recruited between 2014 and 2020 (N = 119 benign, N = 74 CIN3/CGIN [cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia] and N = 54 cancer). Methylation signatures were obtained from exfoliated cervical cells and sequenced using the Illumina 850 k array. Logistic regression and conditional analyses were used to test for independent associations between Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites and case-control status, with adjustment for batch, chip, age, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status. 409 CpG sites were strongly associated with CIN3/cancer (p-value <5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Following conditional analysis, two CpG sites located in PAX1 (cg16767801) and NREP-AS1 genes (cg23642047) were independently associated with case status, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (AUC = 0.97 for invasive disease). In a validation dataset (CIN3 only) PAX1/NREP-AS1 yielded a combined AUC of 0.77. Methylation markers offer promise for use in cervical screening, particularly as triage tests and self-sampling. We have identified a novel combined methylation marker that offers a high accuracy for the detection of CIN3 or worse.	0	contr
40063805	Sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to multiple <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> traits in transgenic maize.	Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.	0	contr

40050071	Simultaneous Determination of Hormones in Botanical Dietary Supplements With Supramolecular Solvent-Based Extraction by HPLC-MS/MS.	Dietary supplements typically contain either natural products or synthetic chemicals. While botanical dietary supplements are often thought to be more natural and safer, they could still contain potentially harmful ingredients. Despite the detection of sex hormones in plants and soil, it is still worth examining if products made from plants contain them. In this study, simultaneous determination of 14 kinds of sex hormones in botanical dietary supplements was conducted by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). A suitable sample pretreatment method is expected to extract and purify the sample in a single step when detected by HPLC-MS/MS, enabling it to be directly injected into the instrument. Herein, supramolecular solvent (SUPRAS), composed of n-hexanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and water, was employed to extract hormones from botanical dietary supplements. The effect of various parameters, including the composition of the supramolecular solvents, their dosage, and vortex time, on extraction efficiency was investigated. The results demonstrated that the 14 compounds exhibited excellent linearity over the concentration range of 0.5-100 µg·L<sup>-1</sup>, with determination coefficients exceeding 0.99. Recoveries were assessed at three levels using spiked samples, ranging from 75.6% to 115.8%, with relative standard deviations between 0.8% and 9.7%. This method was successfully applied to determine 14 sex hormones in botanical dietary supplements. Progesterone was detected in one sample at a concentration of 64 µg·kg<sup>-1</sup>. The SUPRAS method coupled with HPLC-MS/MS, was proved to be efficient, easy-to-operate, and sensitive for determining sex hormones in botanical dietary supplements.	1	pest

The preferential dissipation of <i>R-</i>mefentrifluconazole was verified in soybean plants, soybeans, peanut plants, tomatoes, and grapes. The preferential dissipation of <i>S-</i>mefentrifluconazole was verified in the peanut shells and soil. The stereoisomeric excess variations of mefentrifluconazole in soybean plants, soybean, peanut plants, and peanut shells exceeded 10%, and the enantiomer toxicity and behavior differences should be considered in risk assessments. The dietary risks of acute (0.020-1.250%) and chronic (0.054-18.328%) of mefentrifluconazole in these crops were acceptable. <i>R-</i>Mefentrifluconazole might be recommended for use as a monocase product.	1	pest

With the expansion of the culture scale of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), the high incidence of diseases has seriously threatened the development of its industry. In this study, PcToll3 and PcToll4 were respectively cloned and explored SNPs among the germplasm populations, which had been identified relating to disease resistance in crayfish based on our previous study. A total of 3036 bp and 2820 bp of the open reading frame of PcToll3 and PcToll4 encoded 1011 and 939 amino acids, respectively. They were specially expressed in haemolymph, and significantly up-regulated expression after stimulation by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila and white spot syndrome virus. It was found that the expression of downstream genes PcALF, PcCru, PcIMD, PcMyD88, and PcNF-κB were repressed after interference of PcToll3 and/or PcToll4. Totally, 16 and 19 SNPs in the coding region of PcToll3 and PcToll4 were mined, and the favoured haplotypes and the combinations of them were classified according to the associated SNPs with the disease resistance in crayfish. The haplotypes of Toll3-Hap1, Toll4-Hap1 and the combination of Toll3+Toll4-Hap1 were further validated that they had the stronger disease resistance comparing to others haplotypes, and the related KASP markers were developed for further breeding application. This study will advance our understanding of the function of the two Toll genes in crayfish, and provide the markers for the molecular breeding.	0	contr

40066438	Update on tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative review.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, affecting approximately 1% of the adult population. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor, has emerged as an effective treatment for RA. This narrative review provides an update on TCZ's efficacy and safety based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world evidence (RWE). TCZ, available in subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) formulations, has shown significant benefits in RA management. Key clinical trials, including SAMURAI, OPTION, RADIATE, and TOWARD, have demonstrated TCZ's efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), particularly in patients with inadequate responses to methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. Long-term studies, such as STREAM, have highlighted TCZ's sustained efficacy and favorable safety profile over 5 years. The impact of TCZ on cardiovascular health, lipid profiles, and the risk of infections has been a focal point, with findings suggesting no significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk compared to other RA therapies. RWE further highlights the effectiveness of TCZ, identifying predictors of response, such as age, and emphasizes its suitability for biologic-naïve and overweight patients. Special considerations include TCZ use in RA-associated interstitial lung disease and amyloidosis. Overall, TCZ remains a pivotal option in RA treatment, with a well-established safety and efficacy profile supported by extensive clinical and real-world data.	0	contr

Individuals with comorbid rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and neurotrauma (NT; defined by traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder) have an earlier age of RBD symptom onset, increased RBD-related symptom severity and more neurological features indicative of prodromal synucleinopathy compared to RBD only. An early sign of neurodegenerative condition is autonomic dysfunction, which we sought to evaluate by examining heart rate variability during sleep. Participants with overnight polysomnography were recruited from the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System. Veterans without NT or RBD (controls, n = 19), with RBD only (RBD, n = 14), and with RBD and NT (RBD+NT, n = 19) were evaluated. Eligible 5-min non-REM (NREM) and REM epochs without apneas/hypopneas, microarousals, and ectopic beats were analysed for frequency and time domain (e.g., low-frequency [LF] power; high-frequency [HF] power; root mean square of successive R-R intervals [RMSSD]; percentage of R-R intervals that vary ≥50 ms [pNN50]) heart rate variability outcomes. Heart rate did not significantly differ between groups in any sleep stage. Time domain and frequency domain variables (e.g., LF power, HF power, RMSSD, and pNN50) were significantly reduced in the RBD+NT group compared to the controls and RBD-only group during NREM sleep. There were no group differences detected during REM sleep. These data suggest significant reductions in heart rate variability during NREM sleep in RBD+NT participants, suggesting greater autonomic dysfunction compared to controls or RBD alone. Heart rate variability during sleep may be an early, promising biomarker, yielding mechanistic insight for diagnosis and prognosis of early neurodegeneration in this vulnerable population.	0	contr

40066267	<i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> regulates gut microbiota and increases the effective metabolite luteolin to inhibit MAPK/STAT3 signaling pathway to alleviate allergic rhinitis.	The global prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) remains high, posing challenges due to its chronic nature and propensity for recurrence. Gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to immune dysregulation, impacting AR pathogenesis. <i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> (<i>L. reuteri</i>) has great potential in regulating immune function to alleviate AR symptoms. However, the specific active components and mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects in AR remain incompletely clarified. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms of <i>L. reuteri</i> and its metabolites in alleviating AR. The AR mouse model was constructed using ovalbumin (OVA). The analysis of hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE staining) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) suggested that <i>L. reuteri</i> alleviated nasal inflammation, suppressed aberrant Th2 immune responses, and modulated the balance of Treg and Th17 cytokines. The 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolic analysis revealed that <i>L. reuteri</i> restored gut microbiota composition and significantly increased the abundance of <i>Ligilactobacillus</i> and the metabolite luteolin (LO). Through ELISA and Western blotting analysis, LO treatment restored the Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 cytokine balance and suppressed the MAPK/STAT3 signaling pathway in AR mice. The study highlights LO as a key metabolite contributing to the anti-inflammatory effects of <i>L. reuteri</i>, suggesting potential avenues for future therapeutic strategies in AR management.	0	contr
40060804	A Comparative Analysis of Cockroach and Mosquito, Octopamine Receptor Homologues Produced Using Chimera, Swiss-Model, and AlphaFold Molecular Modeling Tools.	Homology modeling can help bridge the gap between missing 3D structures and available primary sequences of protein. More environmentally friendlier insecticides against domestic nuisance can target the octopamine receptor proteins, only expressed in invertebrates. Herein, octopamine receptor homologues from <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, which do not have tertiary structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), were built using homology modeling and evaluated with various molecular modeling tools. AlphaFold models (AFM), which use artificial intelligence from DeepMind, showed structural validity when superimposed on Swiss-Model models (SMM) for both insect octopamine receptor species. The UCSF Chimera and Modeler models (CMM) did not match those by AlphaFold and Swiss-Model irrespective of the insect species receptor model compared. The greatest discrepancy between any two structures resulted between AFM and CMM with only 21.46% similarity and 14.92% similarity between backbone αCs of their superimposed 3D structures, respectively, for cockroach and mosquito, yet their primary sequences are highly identical. The highest sequence identity for superimposed 3D structures occurred between AFM and SMM of cockroach at 75%, and their corresponding mosquito sequence at 35.12% just surpassed the threshold of pairwise structural validity set above 30%. The local model quality obtained from ProSA web server ranks AFM above SMM and CMM in that order, even though all models had good <i>z</i>-scores. Ramachandran plot paints a different picture where the CMM have a higher percentage of residues in the accepted zone and AFM have a few residues in the wrong places. However, the data from VADAR statistics show that AFM models are more thermodynamically stable with lower fraction of buried amino acids or charges. Docking studies conducted on UCSF Chimera software showed similarity in active site residues for AFM and SMM involved in a number of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. These include residues GLU202, LEU102, ASP95, and ASP105 for cockroach models and residues VAL24 and LEU174 for mosquito models. The active site of all protein models contains some identical residues found in bound complexes including GLU, LEU, APS, and SER, which happen to be in different positions. ANOVA analysis revealed no significant difference in docking energies, an indication that even when active site residues are different, they still conserve the essential qualities needed for binding. Thus, despite the differences in structures, based on validation evaluation, such differences are unlikely to affect binding with octopamine. However, for studies where the quaternary structure of a protein is crucial, the AFM that preserves the full quaternary structure is recommendable.	1	pest

We present the description of the new species, <i>Rhodococcus parequi</i>, found during phylogenomic investigations of a global collection of strains identified as <i>Rhodococcus</i> (<i>Prescottella</i>) <i>equi</i>. Strain PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> was isolated from horse-breeding farm soil in Normandy, France, and was indistinguishable from <i>R. equi</i> based on the usual identification tests. Whole-genome phylogenetic analyses located PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> in the same <i>Rhodococcus</i> sublineage as <i>R. equi</i>, together with <i>Rhodococcus agglutinans</i>, <i>Rhodococcus defluvii</i>, <i>Rhodococcus soli</i>, <i>Rhodococcus subtropicus</i>, <i>Rhodococcus spongiicola</i> and <i>Rhodococcus xishaensis</i>. PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> is most closely related to, but sufficiently distinct from, <i>R. equi</i> DSM 20307 <sup>T</sup> to be considered a separate species. The average nt identity (ANI) and average aa identity (AAI) values are 88.60% and 92.35, respectively, well below the species cutoff. The PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> draft genome is ~5.3 Mb in size with 68.98% G+C mol content. PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> is strictly aerobic and non-motile and produces smooth, creamy to buff-coloured colonies very similar to those of <i>R. equi</i>. It phenotypically differs from the latter by the ability to grow at 5 °C, a strongly positive urease test at 24 h and specificities in the carbon and nitrogen source utilization profile as determined by phenotype microarray screens. Our data indicate that PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> belongs to a novel species, for which the name <i>Rhodococcus parequi</i> sp. nov. is proposed. <i>R. parequi</i> was avirulent in macrophage infection assays and is assumed to be non-pathogenic.

40060473	Deletion of core septin gene <i>aspB</i> in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> results in fungicidal activity of caspofungin.	Septins are a family of GTP-binding proteins found in many eukaryotic lineages. Although highly conserved throughout many eukaryotes, their functions vary across species. In <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> , the etiological agent of invasive aspergillosis, septins participate in a variety of processes such as cell wall organization of conidia, septation, and response to cell wall stress. Previous studies determined that the Δ <i>aspB</i> strain had a greater sensitivity to anti-cell wall drugs, especially the echinocandin caspofungin, yet mechanisms behind this augmented sensitivity are unknown. We performed cell viability staining of the deletion strains post-caspofungin exposure and found that the Δ <i>aspA</i> , Δ <i>aspB</i> , and Δ <i>aspC</i> strains have significantly lower cell viability. Concomitant with the reduced viability, deletion strains are more susceptible to caspofungin on solid media. These results indicate that the septin cytoskeleton is important for <i>A. fumigatus</i> survival in the presence of caspofungin. Due to the potential of improved therapeutic outcome, we followed up using a neutropenic murine model of invasive aspergillosis. Animals infected with the Δ <i>aspB</i> strain and treated with caspofungin showed improved survival compared to the animals infected with <i>akuB</i> <sup>KU80</sup> wild-type or complemented strains. Additionally, histological analysis showed reduced fungal burden and inflammation in the Δ <i>aspB</i> infected, caspofungin-treated group. Affinity purification coupled with quantitative proteomics identified proteins involved in the septin-dependent response to caspofungin, includng four candidate interactors involved in cell wall stress response. Deletion of these candidate genes resulted in increased susceptibility to caspofungin and moderately reduced viability post-drug exposure. Taken together, these data suggest that septin AspB contributes to the fungistatic response to caspofungin.	1	pest
40066422	The Impact of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Treatment Planning of Attico Antral Disease.	"Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a useful method for investigating cholesteatomas since it may be performed without the need for a contrast agent and can prevent unnecessary ""second look"" operations. This study aims to evaluate the role of DWI-MRI in monitoring residual or recurrent disease and preventing second look procedures when physical examination is difficult or CT is ambiguous. This single centric, cross-sectional study was conducted on 33 patients with suspected cases of attico-antral disease at a tertiary sector, subjected to DWI sequence of MRI for a study period of 1.6 years. The average age of patients was 36 ± 14.40 years with male predominance (66.66%). A right-sided laterality with hearing loss and ear discharge was commonest symptom. MRI findings and surgical presence of cholesteatoma was present in 81.81% cases. Sensitivity, Specificity of MRI in the diagnosis of AAD was 100%.

40063678	Environmental and Biological Drivers of Root Exudation.	Root exudation is the process by which plants release organic and inorganic metabolites from their roots into the surrounding soil. Root exudation is a dynamic process and shapes plant-environment interactions at the root-soil interface. Little is known about the biological and environmental factors that shape the exuded metabolome, hereafter referred to as the exudome, despite its importance in structuring soil processes. Here, we emphasize plant physiological and morphological traits that modulate the exudome in a species- and developmental stage-specific manner. We further discuss how environmental factors drive exudation processes. We highlight evidence of a potential circadian exudation rhythm and further illustrate how the physical (temperature, structure), chemical (moisture, pH, nutrients, pollutants), and biological (micro- and macrofauna) properties of soil alter the root exudome composition and release patterns. Exploring the factors that directly or indirectly modulate exudation will enhance our understanding of how this dynamic process mediates plant-environment interactions.	0	contr
40066200	Health risk assessment of potentially toxic elements in public pipe-borne water from selected households in Abeokuta, Southwestern, Nigeria.	Public pipe-borne water serves as a significant source of potable water in some communities in Abeokuta. However, the presence of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) at certain concentrations in drinking water can render it unsuitable for consumption due to associated health risks. This study assessed the health risks posed by PTEs in public pipe-borne water collected from ten households in six communities in Abeokuta, Southwestern Nigeria. Pipe-borne water samples were subjected to PTE (lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) analysis using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, following standard digestion procedures for the water samples. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The health risk assessment was conducted for the Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Cancer Risk (CR) using the USEPA IRIS models. The water quality index (WQI) was also evaluated. Results indicated varying levels of PTEs, with certain areas exceeding the permissible limits for Cd (0.01-0.02 mg/L), Cr (0.05-0.11 mg/L), and Pb (0.50-0.97 mg/L), posing significant health risks to humans. The health risk assessment revealed that the HQ for Cd, Cr, and Pb exceeded the permissible limit of 1.0 in pipe-borne water consumed by children and infants, indicating potential adverse effects. Additionally, the CR values for Cd, Cr, and Pb in water samples consumed by all age groups also surpassed the permissible limit of 1.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, suggesting a probable risk of cancer development. The WQIs exceeding the threshold limit of 300 were observed in pipe-borne water samples, indicating that the water is unfit for consumption. Therefore, this study recommends the removal of potential toxic elements at the point of collection by using taps fitted with activated carbon filters.	0	contr

40063245	Genome-wide association mapping for the identification of stripe rust resistance loci in US hard winter wheat.	The GWAS and testing with Yr gene linked markers identified 109 loci including 40 novel loci for all-stage and adult plant stage resistance to stripe rust in 459 US contemporary hard winter wheat genotypes. Stripe rust is a destructive wheat disease, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). To identify sources of stripe rust resistance in US contemporary hard winter wheat, a panel of 459 Great Plains wheat genotypes was evaluated at the seedling stage against five US Pst races and at the adult plant stage in field environments in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Washington. The results showed that 7-14% of the genotypes were resistant to Pst races at the seedling stage, whereas 32-78% of genotypes were resistant at the adult plant stage across field environments, indicating the presence of adult plant resistance. Sixteen genotypes displayed a broad spectrum of resistance to all five Pst races and across all field environments. The panel was further genotyped using 9858 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated from multiplex restriction amplicon sequencing (MRASeq) and the functional DNA markers linked to the known stripe rust resistance (Yr) genes Yr5, Yr15, Yr17, Yr18, Yr29, Yr36, Yr40, Yr46, and QYr.tamu-2B. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using genotypic and phenotypic data, which identified 110 SNPs and the functional markers linked to Yr15 and Yr17 to be significantly associated with stripe rust response. In addition, Yr5, Yr15, Yr17, Yr18, Yr29, and QYr.tamu-2B were detected by their functional DNA markers in the panel. This study identified 40 novel loci associated with stripe rust resistance in genomic regions not previously characterized by known Yr genes. These findings offer significant opportunities to diversify and enhance stripe rust resistance in hard winter wheat.	0	contr
40055835	The universal accumulation of p-aminophenol during the microbial degradation of analgesic and antipyretic acetaminophen in WWTPs: a novel metagenomic perspective.	Acetaminophen, a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug, has become a significant aquatic micro-pollutant due to its extensive global production and increased consumption, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its high-water solubility leads to its pervasive presence in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), posing substantial risks to the environment and human health. Biological treatment is one of the promising approaches to remove such pollutants. Although previous studies have isolated acetaminophen-degrading pure cultures and proposed catabolic pathways, the interactions between microbiotas and acetaminophen, the distribution feature of acetaminophen degradation genes, and the gene-driven fate of acetaminophen in the real-world environment remain largely unexplored.	0	contr

40066409	Expression of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in Nasal Polyp: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	Nasal polyp (NP) is a pathological benign mass that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. This lesion is occasionally associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which is named chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) indicates abnormal cell proliferation which may help assess the nasopharyngeal lesions and upper airway cancers. This study aimed to examine the PCNA expression in NP tissue. This study was conducted under the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A thorough search using relevant keywords was performed on the electronic database to identify studies examining the PCNA expression in NP. Meta-analysis on pooled single group proportion and means of PCNA expression was conducted by the metamean and metaprop functions in R software (version 4.4.0). Quality assessment was done according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Ten articles were included in this study. The PCNA expression in NP was higher than in normal nasal mucosa (NNM), while its expression in NP was lower than in inverted papilloma (IP). The mean percentage of PCNA expression in NP was 15.73% (95%-CI[2.87-28.58]) with considerable heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 97%[96-98%],<i>p</i>-value < 0.01). Based on a cutoff staining (> 5%), 64% of NP samples were PCNA-positive (95%-CI[42-81%]) with high heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 76%[47-89%], <i>p</i>-value < 0.01). NP tissue has a relatively high expression of the PCNA oncoprotein based on the immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Although more than half of NP samples were positive for PCNA, still the mean expression of this marker in NP was lower than in IP tissue.	0	contr

40065113	Bacterial lysates in modifying sIgA levels in the upper respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients.	A great deal of evidence has accumulated suggesting an important role of mucosal immunity not only in preventing COVID-19 but also in the pathogenesis of this infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in different compartments of the upper respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients in relation to the severity of the disease and treatment with a bacteria-based immunomodulating agent (Immunovac VP4). The titers of sIgA were determined by ELISA in nasal epithelial swabs, pharyngeal swabs, and salivary gland secretions at baseline and on days 14 and 30 of treatment. The levels of nasal, pharyngeal and salivary sIgA were significantly lower in more severe patients (subgroup A) than in less severe patients (subgroup B), p < 0.01. In subgroup A, the patients who received Immunovac VP4 had higher pharyngeal sIgA levels in convalescent period than those who did not receive the therapy p < 0.05. In subgroup B patients, an increase in immunoglobulin levels was observed from baseline to day 14 of treatment whether they received the add-on therapy or not, p < 0.01. On day 30 of treatment, the sIgA levels in the standard treatment group, however, decreased, while the patients receiving the immunomodulating agent maintained high sIgA levels, p < 0.05. Oxygen saturation significantly increased by day 14 in both groups, p < 0.001. However, it was higher in the Immunovac VP4 group than in the standard treatment group, p < 0.01. Thus, addition of a bacterial lysate-based immunomodulating agent to the treatment regimen for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 induces the production of pharyngeal and salivary sIgA. SIgA production is inversely correlated to CRP levels and percentage of lung involvement on CT scan and is directly correlated to SpO<sub>2</sub> levels.	0	contr
40066159	Development of an efficient and heritable virus-induced genome editing system in <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>.	The CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to introduce site-specific mutations into the genome of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. However, the direct application of this revolutionary technology to desirable tomato cultivars has been hindered by the challenges of generating transgenic plants. To address this issue, we developed an efficient and heritable genome editing system using tobacco rattle virus (TRV) for an elite tomato cultivar (the paternal line of Saladette). Notably, this virus-induced genome editing (VIGE) system enables the rapid production of various mutant seeds without the need for additional plant transformation and tissue culture, once a Cas9-expressing tomato line is established. This VIGE system consists of transgenic tomato plants that express Cas9 under the control of the tomato ubiquitin 10 (<i>SlUbi1</i>0) gene promoter and a mobile guide RNA scaffold (gRNA:SlmFT) generated using the sequence of the tomato <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>SlFT</i>) gene. We determined its editing efficiency by targeting the tomato phytoene desaturase (<i>SlPDS</i>) gene, which causes photobleaching symptoms when disrupted. Most transgenic seedlings infected with the TRV vectors carrying the <i>SlPDS-</i>targeting sgRNA developed chimeric albino leaves associated with a high frequency of indel mutations in the <i>SlPDS</i> gene. Remarkably, fruits from these plants yielded homozygous <i>SlPDS</i> knockout seeds at rates ranging from 15% to 100%. These results demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of our VIGE system in rapidly generating heritable genome edits in tomato.	0	contr

Post-infectious bronchiolitis/bronchitis obliterans (PIBO) is a chronic irreversible obstructive lung disease that results in obstruction and/or obliteration of small airways. Previous reports have indicated that PCD-related gene mutations contribute to PIBO incidence. However, the relationship between DNAH9 variants and PIBO remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between DNAH9 mutations and the incidence of PIBO. In our cohort, 126 PIBO patients conducted Whole Exome Sequence (WES) test and twelve variants of DNAH9 gene were identified. Detailed clinical information, high-resolution computerized tomography and/or electronic bronchoscopy findings of the six pediatric children carried DNAH9 variants were systematically collected, meticulously reviewed, and rigorously analyzed. Clinical evaluation revealed three patients with bronchiolitis obliterans, two patients with bronchitis obliterans and one with both conditions. All patients had at least one previous bout of pneumonia, which in three cases was linked to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, in two cases to adenovirus infection, and in one case to co-infection with both pathogens. Genetic analysis of all cases identified six compound heterozygous DNAH9 mutations encompassing twelve variants: c.12,925 C > T (p.Arg4309*), c.5152-10G > T (-), c.4604 A > G (p.Gln1535Arg), c.12844-14T > C (-), c.4816T > C (p.Phe1606Leu), c.8831G > A (p.Arg2944Gln), c.9479 C > T (p.Ala3160Val), c.7415G > A (p.Arg2472Gln), c.5692G > T (p.Glu1898*), c.11,572 C > T (p.Arg3858Trp), c.11,176 C > T (p.Arg3726Trp), c.1010 C > T (p.Pro337Leu). These variants included two nonsense mutations, two mutations near splice sites, and eight missense mutations. All variants exhibited negligible or low minor allele frequencies based on the gnomAD database and were predicted to be variants of uncertain significance (VUS) or deleterious based on comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Our findings suggest that DNAH9 compound complex variants may contribute to development of PIBO following severe M. pneumoniae and/or adenoviral infectious pneumonia in pediatric patients.	0	contr
40066273	Mobile genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>: important pathways for the acquisition of virulence and resistance.	<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> is an opportunistic pathogen primarily associated with nosocomial infections, characterized by a propensity for multi-drug resistance and the potential evolution into hypervirulent strains. Based on its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, <i>K. pneumoniae</i> can be classified into two types: classical <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (cKP) and hypervirulent <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (hvKP). The spread of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> has led to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (CRKP) and carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (CR-hvKP). The emergence of CR-hvKP is particularly concerning due to its multidrug resistance, high pathogenicity, and increased transmissibility. This review summarizes the types of MGEs present in <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, the mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by these mobile elements, their roles in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence genes, and the relationships among MGEs that resemble Russian dolls or exhibit hybrid characteristics. Additionally, the clinical treatment and epidemiological characteristics of CR-hvKP are discussed. Given the high variability and transmissibility of MGEs, continuous monitoring and control of the variation and transmission of such genetic material in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> should be prioritized.	0	contr

40065153	Integrating model systems and genomic insights to decipher mechanisms of cancer metastasis.	Deciphering metastatic processes is crucial for understanding cancer progression and potential treatment options. Genetic studies of model systems engineered to mimic metastatic disease, including organoids, genetically engineered mice and human cell lines, have had an important role in shaping our understanding of the metastatic cascade and how it can be manipulated. More recently, advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled human metastases to be studied at single-cell and single-nucleotide resolution, providing insights into metastatic evolution and phenotypes of both cancer cells and immune cells. However, human tissue studies are often correlative and descriptive, whereas experimental models are reductionistic by nature, meaning that individual results should be interpreted with caution. Crucially, these seemingly disparate branches of metastasis research can and should complement each other to strengthen and validate findings. Here we explore the synergies between model systems and sequencing studies and outline key areas that must be explored to improve our understanding of the metastatic process.	0	contr

A study was conducted to quantify the heavy metals and bacterial loads in Solanum scabrum Mill., Amaranthus cruentus L., and Talinum fruticosum (L.) Juss., three major vegetables grown in the area. Soil and water samples were collected and analysed for the concentrations of 24 elements, including heavy metals, using the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) approach. The bacteria in the samples were isolated and cultured in lactose broth, and the total coliform count was estimated using the maximum probable number (MPN) technique. The heavy metals in both soil and plant samples occurred in the order Mn > Zn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Co > Pb > Fe > Al. The contamination indices of Mn > 5807.3 and Cr > 4698.3 indicated varied sources of these metal contaminants. The bioaccumulation coefficient (BAC) was > 1 for most of the metals, with T. fruticosum having the highest BAC value (3.60) for the leaves. The mean bacteria count indicated high contamination with Enterobacteria (600 coliform forming units (CFU)) and E. coli (500 CFU) in vegetables across all sampling sites. The high concentration of bacterial contaminants in the soil, water, and plants across the study sites indicates a high health risk, making the ecosystem not pristine and thus impossible for these wetlands to improve food security. Consequently, this study provides crucial information for policymakers and stakeholders to develop effective strategies for the conservation and sustainable management of these wetlands.	0	contr

40065181	Microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease: mechanisms of disease and therapeutic opportunities.	Perturbations in the intestinal microbiome are strongly linked to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Bacteria, fungi and viruses all make up part of a complex multi-kingdom community colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, often referred to as the gut microbiome. They can exert various effects on the host that can contribute to an inflammatory state. Advances in screening, multiomics and experimental approaches have revealed insights into host-microbiota interactions in IBD and have identified numerous mechanisms through which the microbiota and its metabolites can exert a major influence on the gastrointestinal tract. Looking into the future, the microbiome and microbiota-associated processes will be likely to provide unparalleled opportunities for novel diagnostic, therapeutic and diet-inspired solutions for the management of IBD through harnessing rationally designed microbial communities, powerful bacterial and fungal metabolites, individually or in combination, to foster intestinal health. In this Review, we examine the current understanding of the cross-kingdom gut microbiome in IBD, focusing on bacterial and fungal components and metabolites. We examine therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities, the microbial metabolism, immunity, neuroimmunology and microbiome-inspired interventions to link mechanisms of disease and identify novel research and therapeutic opportunities for IBD.	0	contr
40066162	Genome-wide association study of salicylic acid provides genetic insights for tea plant selective breeding.	Salicylic acid (SA) is a phenolic phytohormone widely believed to regulate plant growth and stress response. Despite its significance, the genetic basis of SA-mediated resistance to biotic stressors in tea plants is little understood. Our study investigated the genetic diversity, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns of 299 tea accessions using 79 560 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. Our genome-wide association study identified <i>CSS0033791.1</i>, an essential gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (CsNCED1), which catalyzes a vital step in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. Exogenous ABA treatment and transgenic overexpression of the <i>CsNCED1</i> gene lowered SA content in the respective tea plants by inhibiting the expression of the <i>ICS</i> gene. Further analysis revealed that ABA could reduce the expression levels of the SA receptor gene (<i>NPR1</i>) and NPR1 target genes (<i>PR1</i> and <i>WRKY18</i>), increasing the plant's susceptibility to biotic stressors. Furthermore, the feeding behavior of <i>Spodoptera litura</i> revealed that the insect bite area on transgenic leaves was substantially more extensive than that in wild type (WT), implying that the <i>CsNCED1</i> gene had a negative regulatory role in SA-mediated immune response. This study thus provides the foundation for future insect resistance breeding, sustainable tea plant resource usage, and molecular marker-assisted (MAS) tea plant breeding.	0	contr

40061033	Soil properties and rhizosphere interactions affecting nitrous oxide emissions with mitigation by nitrification inhibitors in rice growth stages.	Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions from paddy soils, particularly from the rice rhizosphere, significantly contribute to agricultural greenhouse gas outputs. This study explores N<sub>2</sub>O emission dynamics in rhizosphere (R) and non-rhizosphere (NR) soils from two distinct paddy types (JR and YC) during the primary rice growth stages (tillering, jointing, heading, and grain-filling). Cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were measured at 688.56, 762.90, 831.20, and 1072.32 µg N kg<sup>-1</sup> for JR-NR, JR-R, YC-NR, and YC-R, respectively. Notably, JR-R and YC-R exhibited increases in cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by up to 20.04% and 28.23%, respectively, compared to their NR counterparts at different growth stages. These enhanced emissions were primarily associated with microbial genera <i>Nitrosospira</i> and <i>Nitrosospirae</i>, and influenced by factors such as electrical conductivity (EC) and available potassium (AK). The soil organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C/N) was a key determinant influencing <i>Nitrosospira</i> abundance. Additionally, nitrification inhibitors (NIs) demonstrated a substantial reduction in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, with a decrease of 92.37% in JR-R and 91.93% in YC-R at selected growth stages, showing more pronounced effects compared to NR soils. These findings highlight the efficacy of NIs in significantly mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, particularly in rhizosphere soils. Variations in the efficiency of NIs across different soil types and growth stages suggest that optimizing application timing and developing tailored soil-specific strategies could further enhance the effectiveness of NIs in mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from paddy fields. This research provides essential insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies to reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in rice cultivation and contributes to sustainable agricultural practices.	0	contr

40058417	Isolation, identification and bioprospecting potential of Bacillus subtilis, endophytic bacterium from Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. ex Savigny.	Mangroves are crucial for supporting coastal communities, benefiting both humans and animals. Their intricate root systems grasp the soil, mitigating erosion and dampening wave impact. As a result, they shield and fortify shorelines that would otherwise erode. This study focuses on the isolation of endophytic bacteria from the stem of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. Molecular analysis using 16S rDNA gene sequencing identified the isolate as Bacillus subtilis (BG1). Its hydrolytic enzyme production capabilities were assessed, revealing its ability to produce cellulase, amylase, protease and L-asparaginase. The isolate also demonstrated various plant growth promoting traits including ammonia production, indole 3- acetic (IAA) production, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production, phosphate solubilization, and ACC deaminase activity. IAA and organic acid production were quantified using Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with B. subtilis producing 86.32 ± 0.64 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> of IAA, peaking at a retention time of 6.8 minutes. The endophyte also produced two different organic acids during phosphate solubilization with malic acid been the most abundant (398.79 ± 2.58 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, B. subtilis was able to form biofilm and exhibited drug resistance towards Cefixime (5 μg). Biofilm was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Invitro antagonist studies demonstrated the significant effectiveness of B. subtilis against two pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. This is the first study to successfully isolate and identify endophytic bacteria from B. gymnorrhiza, highlighting its plant growth promoting traits, biofilm forming potential, and antibacterial capabilities.	0	contr
40064955	Integrative single cell transcriptomic analysis reveals 3p deletion associated tumor microenvironment and chemoresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a prevalent and lethal malignancy, with a five-year survival rate of just 50% for cases of locally advanced disease. Chromosomal aberrations, particularly the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p), have been strongly associated with poor prognosis and more aggressive tumor phenotypes. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy. This study aims to elucidate the impact of 3p deletion on the TME, immune cell infiltration, and treatment response in HNSCC, to identify novel therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and bulk transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Pseudo-time trajectory and cell-cell communication analyses were performed with the Monocle and CellChat packages. The Wilcoxon test was used to evaluate the differential gene expression between wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut) groups. Prognostic models were developed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm and Cox regression analyses to find the genes related to survival, with survival analysis conducted via Kaplan-Meier curves. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was employed to investigate pathway dysregulation, and immune cell infiltration was assessed using various immune scoring methodologies to explore the differences immune environment. The Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) database was utilized to predict the potential efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. mRNA and protein expression levels of SPP1 were examined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, while cell proliferation was assessed using the CCK8 assay. The mut group demonstrated significant alterations in cellular composition, characterized by increased endothelial cells and macrophages and decreased fibroblasts and CD8 + T cells, indicative of an immunosuppressive TME. Differential expression analysis revealed downregulation of immune pathways, including antigen processing and presentation, T cell receptor signaling, and B cell receptor signaling pathways in the mut group, along with enhanced metabolic activity in glycolysis and lipid metabolism. The prognostic model identified nine key genes associated with poor survival in HNSCC. The mut group exhibited poorer overall survival and a more immunosuppressive microenvironment compared to the wt group, which correlated with the outcomes observed in high-risk versus low-risk groups. High-risk patients also showed a diminished response to immunotherapy compared to low-risk patients. Additionally, SPP1 emerged as a critical gene associated with chemotherapy resistance and macrophage M2 polarization. This study demonstrates that 3p deletion significantly reshapes the TME, contributing to poor prognosis in HNSCC by fostering an immunosuppressive environment and enhancing chemoresistance. These findings highlight the potential for developing targeted therapies that address the genetic and immunological landscape of HNSCC.	0	contr
40064919	Competitive antagonism of KAT7 crotonylation against acetylation affects procentriole formation and colorectal tumorigenesis.	Accurate procentriole formation is critical for centriole duplication. However, the holistic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we show that KAT7 crotonylation, facilitated by the crotonyltransferase hMOF, competes against its acetylation regulated by the deacetylase HDAC2 at the K432 residue upon DNA damage stimulation. This competition diminishes its histone acetyltransferase activity, leading to the inhibition of procentriole formation in colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, the reduction of KAT7 histone acetyltransferase activity by the antagonistic effect of KAT7 crotonylation against its acetylation decreases the gene expression associated with procentriole formation by modulating the enrichment of H3K14ac at their promoters and plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Furthermore, KAT7 crotonylation and acetylation are associated with the prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unidentified role of KAT7 in the regulation of procentriole formation and colorectal tumorigenesis via competitive antagonism of its crotonylation against acetylation.	0	contr
40066428	Applicability of Paediatric Kerrison's Punch in Endoscopic Transcanal Mastoidectomy-Harnessing a Fresh Perspective.	The science of endoscopic ear surgery is gaining popularity and increasing momentum with reported outcomes comparable to conventional microscopic ear surgery. Endoscopic ear surgery has numerous advantages including access to visualization of occult areas of middle ear like sinus tympani. The endoscopic transcanal mastoidectomy via conventional drilling technique(Inside-out) has also established itself as a successful procedure with excellent post-operative outcomes. However, transcanal drilling is a challenging procedure as it requires extreme coordination, repeated irrigation and suction, injury to vital structures, tympanomeatal flap tear. We here propose a novel technique of doing Endoscopic transcanal mastoidectomy using upcutting and downcutting, straight and angled Paediatric Kerrison's punch to remove the attic and posterosuperior bony canal wall with substantial benefits of significant reduction in chances of injury to vital structures, no repeated suction-irrigation required, less operative time and good visualization. Paediatric Kerrison's punch is an instrument which is essentially available in the armamentarium of all ENT surgeons as it has been used since a long time in dacryocystorhinostomy surgery. In our quest for simplifying transcanal mastoidectomy, we have devised a novel utility of this same punch in the otology surgery. And in our experience, it has proven a pragmatic instrument in the otology surgeries as much as it is in the nasal surgeries.	0	contr
40064869	In-depth and high-throughput spatial proteomics for whole-tissue slice profiling by deep learning-facilitated sparse sampling strategy.	Mammalian organs and tissues are composed of heterogeneously distributed cells, which interact with each other and the extracellular matrix surrounding them in a spatially defined way. Therefore, spatially resolved gene expression profiling is crucial for determining the function and phenotypes of these cells. While genome mutations and transcriptome alterations act as drivers of diseases, the proteins that they encode regulate essentially all biological functions and constitute the majority of biomarkers and drug targets for disease diagnostics and treatment. However, unlike transcriptomics, which has a recent explosion in high-throughput spatial technologies with deep coverage, spatial proteomics capable of reaching bulk tissue-level coverage is still rare in the field, due to the non-amplifiable nature of proteins and sensitivity limitation of mass spectrometry (MS). More importantly, due to the limited multiplexing capability of the current proteomics methods, whole-tissue slice mapping with high spatial resolution requires a formidable amount of MS matching time. To achieve spatially resolved, deeply covered proteome mapping for centimeter-sized samples, we developed a sparse sampling strategy for spatial proteomics (S4P) using computationally assisted image reconstruction methods, which is potentially capable of reducing the number of samples by tens to thousands of times depending on the spatial resolution. In this way, we generated the largest spatial proteome to date, mapping more than 9000 proteins in the mouse brain, and discovered potential new regional or cell type markers. Considering its advantage in sensitivity and throughput, we expect that the S4P strategy will be applicable to a wide range of tissues in future studies.	0	contr
40054352	Combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD facilitates phytoremediation of heavy metals and carbon sequestration: A field experiment.	A field study examined the impact of γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA), both alone and in combination with dicyandiamide (DCD), on the phytoremediation of soil contaminated with Cd, Pb, and Zn. This study focused on the heavy metal (HM) accumulation, and soil CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in Cosmos sulphureus and Pennisetum americanum × P. purpureum, and soil microbial communities. The findings indicated that the application of γ-PGA, either alone or in combination with DCD, increased plant yield and HM bioavailability in the soil, leading to improved HM uptake by plants. For P. americanum × P. purpureum, compared to CK treatment, the combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD increased the Cd, Pb, and Zn extraction by 131.4%, 80.6%, and 99.7%, respectively. Compared to γ-PGA alone, the combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD reduced the soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission and global warming potential by 26.4% and 39.1%, respectively. P. americanum × P. purpureum treated with γ-PGA and DCD achieved C sequestration of 829 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the application of γ-PGA, alone or in combination with DCD, increased the abundance of soil microbes. Bacteria (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Firmicutes) as well as fungi (Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota) contributed to HM accumulation and resistance to stress by altering soil enzyme activities, C and N fractions. Additionally, Acidobacteriota and Patescibacteria are beneficial to reducing soil GHG emissions and GWP in P. americanum × P. purpureum soil treated with γ-PGA and DCD. In conclusion, P. americanum × P. purpureum with the combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD increased HM extraction and total C sequestration in the plant-soil system. This approach offers a scientific basis and promising approach for integrating phytoremediation with C sequestration.	0	contr
40053052	Characterization of a G. max × G. soja nested association mapping population and identification of loci controlling seed composition traits from wild soybean.	Wild soybean (Glycine soja Siebold & Zucc.) has valuable genetic diversity for improved disease resistance, stress tolerance, seed protein content and seed sulfur-containing amino acid concentrations. Many studies have reported loci controlling seed composition traits based on cultivated soybean populations, but wild soybean has been largely overlooked. In this study, a nested association mapping (NAM) population consisting of 10 families and 1107 recombinant inbred lines was developed by crossing 10 wild accessions with the common cultivar NC-Raleigh. Seed composition of the F<sub>6</sub> generation grown at two locations was phenotyped, and genetic markers were identified for each line. The average number of recombination events in the wild soybean-derived population was significantly higher than that in the cultivated soybean-derived population, which resulted in a higher resolution for QTL mapping. Segregation bias in almost all NAM families was significantly biased toward the alleles of the wild soybean parent. Through single-family linkage mapping and association analysis of the entire NAM population, new QTLs with positive allele effects were identified from wild parents, including 5, 6, 18, 9, 16, 17 and 20 for protein content, oil content, total protein and oil content, methionine content, cysteine content, lysine content and threonine content, respectively. Candidate genes associated with these traits were identified based on gene annotations and gene expression levels in different tissues. This is the first study to reveal the genetic characteristics of wild soybean-derived populations, landscapes and the extent of effects of QTLs and candidate genes controlling traits from different wild soybean parents.	0	contr
40065631	Genome Mining and Antagonism of Stenotrophomonas geniculata MK-1, Against Peanut Foliage Fungus Diseases.	Stenotrophomonas geniculata, a bacterium, has been recognized as an eco-friendly substitute for chemical fungicides in managing peanut foliar diseases, web blotch, and early leaf spot. Core genome and pan-genome analysis identified that strain MK-1 belongs to Stenotrophomonas geniculata, and nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis confirmed that strain belongs to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The research revealed that S. geniculata MK-1 had a notable antagonistic impact on Peyronellaea arachidicola and Cercospora arachidicola and demonstrated a biocontrol efficacy of over 95% against peanut early leaf spot and web blotch disease. The nonredundant protein sequences (NR) database identified 4324 annotations related to S. geniculata, with 2682 genes similar to strain MK-1. The COG database categorized 3041 annotations into 22 functional groups, and 33 distinct metabolic pathways associated with 1851 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations. Most genes linked with metabolism are found in S. geniculata, with 380 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 44 genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database identified 194 annotations are linked to non-ribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites. The Pathogen-Host Interactions (PHI) database showed reduced virulence in strain MK-1, while unaffected pathogenicity protein counts were 52. The MK-1 strain can produce antifungal siderophores secondary metabolites, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and siderophores.	1	pest

40065611	[The role of microglia activated by the deletion of immune checkpoint receptor CD200R1 gene in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease].	The study aimed to investigate the effect of the CD200R1 gene deletion on microglia activation and nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss in the Parkinson's disease (PD) process. The CRISPR-Cas9 technology was applied to construct the CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The primary microglia cells of wild-type and CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were cultured and treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia phagocytosis level was assessed by a fluorescent microsphere phagocytosis assay. PD mouse model was prepared by nigral stereotaxic injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector carrying human α-synuclein (α-syn). The changes in the motor behavior of the mice with both genotypes were evaluated by cylinder test, open field test, and rotarod test. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess the loss of dopamine neurons in substantia nigra. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression level of CD68 (a key molecule involved in phagocytosis) in microglia. The results showed that CD200R1 deletion markedly enhanced LPS-induced phagocytosis <i>in vitro</i> by the microglial cells. In the mouse model of PD, CD200R1 deletion exacerbated motor behavior impairment and dopamine neuron loss in substantia nigra. Fluorescence intensity analysis results revealed a significant increase in CD68 expression in microglia located in the substantia nigra of CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The above results suggest that CD200R1 deletion may further activates microglia by promoting microglial phagocytosis, leading to increased loss of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in the PD model mice. Therefore, targeting CD200R1 could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of early-stage PD.	0	contr

The next-generation gene editing tool, prime editing (PE), is adept at correcting point mutations precisely with high editing efficiency and rare off-target events and shows promising therapeutic value in treating hereditary diseases. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common type of inherited retinal dystrophy and is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptors and, consequently, visual decline. To date, effective treatments for RP are lacking. Herein, a PE system is designed to target the PDE6B Y347X mutation in the rd1 mouse strain, a preclinical RP model. We screen and develop the PE system with epegRNA and RT<sup>ΔRnH</sup>, which is delivered via dual-AAV in vivo with an editing efficiency of 26.47 ± 13.35%, with negligible off-target effects confirmed by AID-Seq and PE-tag. Treatment with the PE system in vivo greatly restores PDE6B protein expression and protects rod cells from degeneration. Mouse behavioural experiments also show that compared with no treatment, prime editing inhibits vision deterioration in littermate rd1 mice. This study provides a therapeutic opportunity for the use of PE to correct mutated RPs at the genomic level.	0	contr

40066158	The long non-coding RNA MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module regulates phosphate accumulation and disease resistance to <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> in pear.	Pear ring rot disease (<i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i>) is a significant threat to the healthy development of the pear industry. Recent research has identified the functional role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in various biological processes of plants. The role of lncRNAs in the pear defense response remains unknown. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze lncRNAs in pear stem infected with <i>B. dothidea</i>. It identified 3555 lncRNAs, of which 286 were significantly differentially expressed. GO and KEGG analyses showed that <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-regulated target genes were enriched in multiple disease resistance-related pathways. More specifically, MSTRG.32189, predicted as an endogenous target mimic (eTM), was significantly down-regulated in response to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection, and was confirmed to inhibit the cleavage effect of PcmiR399b on <i>PcUBC24.</i> OE-MSTRG.32189 transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> exhibited lower Pi content and weaker disease resistance to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> compared with wild type. In pear callus, overexpression of MSTRG.32189 negatively regulated PcmiR399b, which decreased Pi content and reduced disease resistance. Overexpressing PcmiR399b in pear callus exhibited the opposite effects compared with OE-MSTRG.32189. Overexpression and knockout of <i>PcUBC24</i> further clarified that <i>PcUBC24</i> negatively regulates Pi content and disease resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection. Furthermore, the ROS levels and expressions of disease resistance pathway-related genes were regulated by the MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module in transgenic pear callus, which contributed to disease resistance. Overall, our results demonstrated the role of lncRNAs in the pear defense response, revealing that the MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module regulates phosphate accumulation and disease resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection in pear.	0	contr
40059837	Understanding zoonotic pathogens and risk factors from wildlife in Southeast Asia: a systematic literature review.	The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the significance of the human-animal interface in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, with wildlife serving as an important source of infection. A better understanding of the specific pathogens and mechanisms involved is vital to prepare against future outbreaks, especially in Southeast Asia, a hotspot for zoonotic diseases. This paper reviews the published literature on wildlife zoonoses in this region from 2012 to 2022. The results show a diverse range of potential zoonotic pathogens and the widespread occurrence of zoonotic diseases from wildlife. Drivers of zoonotic pathogen spillover include (i) environmental factors (e.g. animal habitat disruption, environmental conditions, exposure to contaminated water/food/soil), (ii) animal factors (e.g. movement patterns, age-related susceptibility), (iii) human factors (e.g. lack of awareness, poor hygiene practices, age, gender and income) and (iv) human-animal-environmental interface factors (e.g. close contact between humans and animals, exposure through visiting animals and presence of vectors). The diverse drivers of zoonoses in Southeast Asia put its communities at risk for infection. To mitigate these risks, global health efforts should consider adopting a One Health approach to foster collaboration across human, animal, and wildlife health sectors. This could involve educating communities on safe animal interactions and improving disease surveillance.	0	contr
40065518	New-Onset, But Not Chronic Atrial Fibrillation, Is a Significant Factor Contributing to Mortality Among Patients with Severe COVID-19.	BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia in the general population and the most frequently presented arrhythmia in the intensive care unit. We investigated the effects of AF on the outcomes of critical COVID-19 patients, especially focusing on differences between chronic (CAF) and new-onset AF (NOAF) during critical disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this case-control study, we investigated the association of CAF and NOAF as an exposure, with in-hospital mortality as an outcome. We identified 2 patient groups, NOAF and CAF, which were compared with controls (all other hospitalized patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia). No specific selection or matching was performed. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables; t test and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for continuous variables, depending on distribution. P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the NOAF group, while in the CAF group, it was similar to that of the control group. The NOAF group had significantly higher markers of inflammation and more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), measured with computed tomography. NOAF was strongly associated with in-hospital death, with OR 6.392 (95% CI, 2.758-14.815), P<0.000. In comparison, the CAF group was older and had more cardiovascular comorbidities, with similar markers of inflammation and severity of ARDS as the control group. CONCLUSIONS NOAF in COVID-19 was linked with significant risk of death, being a sign of extreme cardiac, pulmonary, and metabolic instability. NOAF should be considered as an important marker of instability and predictor of poor outcomes among patients with COVID-19.	0	contr

40054359	Prioritizing microbial functions over soil quality for enhanced multifunctionality in saline-sodic soil remediation.	Paddy cultivation has become a widely adopted approach for saline-sodic wasteland reclamation, aiming to mitigate the food crisis and enhance soil quality. Nevertheless, the impact of long-term paddy cultivation on the interplay between soil quality, microbial metabolic functions, and soil ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) remains unclear. Here, we evaluated soil physicochemical properties, the abundance of 132 biomarker functional genes, and soil EMF across a 78-year period of saline-sodic paddy cultivation. After 78 years of paddy cultivation, soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) decreased by 43.38% and 93.02% compared to saline-sodic wasteland (WL), respectively. Moreover, principal component analysis was used to select a minimal dataset of soil indicators and to establish a soil quality index (SQI). Significant positive correlations were observed between SQI and rice yield, implying that soil quality was the main factor driving increases in saline-sodic farmland. The Mantel test indicates that soil microbial biomass, SQI, and the availability of nutrients exhibit a significant positive relationship with the abundance and expression of genes related to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling, encompassing crucial biogeochemical processes like hemicellulose degradation, C fixation, N degradation, and organic P mineralization. This indicates that changes in soil physicochemical properties significantly affect biogeochemical cycling in saline-sodic soils. Differences in the abundance of microbial P core functional genes explained 41.9% of variation in soil EMF, followed by key soil physicochemical indicators (EC, available potassium, microbial biomass nitrogen, etc.) selected through random forest analysis. Further, we identified a key threshold for changes in soil EMF during long-term saline-sodic paddy cultivation, with EMF increasing for the first 20 years of restoration before decreasing thereafter. Finally, partial least squares path modeling revealed the roles of microbial functional genes and SQI in driving soil EMF before and after the threshold. Soil EMF is primarily influenced by the significant negative effects of P functional genes prior to the threshold value, whereas beyond the threshold, it is mainly affected by the positive effects of C functional genes. These findings provide insights into the functional restoration and sustainable development of saline-sodic agricultural ecosystems.	0	contr
40066049	Comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial resistance, biofilm formation and virulence factors of staphylococci isolated from bovine mastitis.	Bovine mastitis, a prevalent disease, is often attributed to staphylococci species. These microorganisms can express a diverse array of virulence genes and have the capability to form biofilms, establishing a robust defense against antimicrobials and host immune responses. In this study, we analyzed 191 <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp.<i>,</i> of which 81 % were identified as <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and 19 % as non-aureus staphylococci (NAS), including species such as <i>S. borealis, S. chromogenes, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, S. capitis, S. ratti,</i> and <i>S. pasteuri</i>. Our analysis involved determining antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, assessing biofilm-forming capacities, and identifying genes associated with virulence, biofilm formation, adhesion, and antimicrobial resistance. Notably, 17.2 % of the strains exhibited resistance to penicillin, with 97 % carrying the <i>blaZ</i> gene, while 9.4 % demonstrated resistance to erythromycin. All strains were sensitive to gentamicin and cefoxitin. Additionally, resistance was observed for clindamycin (8.4 %) and tetracycline (1.0 %). Concerning biofilm development, 2.6 % displayed no formation, 24.6 % were categorized as weak producers, 47.1 % as moderate, and 25.7 % as strong formers. Our investigation also unveiled the presence of virulence genes, such as superantigens like <i>sea</i> (4.7 %), <i>seb</i> (3.7 %), sec (8.4 %), <i>sed</i> (0.5 %), and <i>tst</i> (6.8 %); Panton-Valentine leukocidin (<i>pvl</i>) (59.7 %); haemolysins <i>hla</i> (88.5 %) and <i>hlb</i> (91.1 %); genes responsible for biofilm production <i>icaA</i> (87.9 %), <i>icaD</i> (78.5 %), and <i>bap</i> (4.2 %); and adhesion genes <i>fnbpA</i> (89.5 %), <i>fnbpB</i> (20.4 %), and <i>clfA</i> (89.0 %). Additionally, the strains were categorized into four groups based on their virulence attributes, revealing differences between <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> and NAS, with the latter showing a lower presence of the studied genes compared to <i>S. aureus</i> strains. This research sheds light on the resistance and virulence profiles of staphylococci strains associated with bovine mastitis, providing valuable insights for potential treatment approaches.	0	contr
40062396	Interaction Between Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus-GAV Movement Protein and VOZ Proteins Delays Flowering of Plant.	Dwarfing and yellowing are characteristic symptoms caused by viral infections and are considered significant contributors for reduced crop yield. In this study, we identified that infection by barley yellow dwarf virus-GAV (BYDV-GAV) leads to a delay in the flowering process, potentially diminishing grain yield in wheat. The BYDV-GAV movement protein (MP) interacts with vascular plant one-zinc finger proteins (VOZs), which play a crucial role in promoting wheat flowering. Expression of MP inhibits floral transition in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Furthermore, BYDV-GAV MP facilitates the degradation of VOZ transcription factors via the 26S proteasome pathway, independently of phytochrome B (PhyB). Domain B in VOZ is essential for the interaction between VOZ and MP. Our results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-induced symptoms.	0	contr
40066547	Immune-Related Adverse Event of Immunotherapy: Diabetes.	The development of immunotherapy has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of malignant tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) function by blocking the receptors and ligands of T cells from binding one another, empowering them to target and attack cancer cells. ICIs along with other immunotherapy treatments, have seen a significant increase in usage in recent years. However, this increased utilization has been accompanied by a significant rise in immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While the majority of irAEs reported are linked to endocrine dysfunction, less common irAES affecting the gastrointestinal, skin, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac systems have also been reported.	0	contr

40057505	Differential roles of deterministic and stochastic processes in structuring soil bacterial ecotypes across terrestrial ecosystems.	Soil bacteria are vital to ecosystem resilience and resistance, yet ecological attributes and the drivers governing their composition and distribution, especially for taxa varying in ecological traits and inhabiting different ecosystems, are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed a large-scale bacterial community and environmental dataset of 622 soil samples systematically collected by us from six major terrestrial ecosystems across the United States. We show that soil bacterial diversity and composition significantly differ among ecotypes and ecosystems, partially determined by a few universal abiotic factors (e.g., soil pH, calcium, and aluminum) and several ecotype- or ecosystem-specific ecological drivers. Co-occurrence network analysis suggests that rare taxa have stronger ecological relevance to the community than abundant taxa. Ecological models revealed that deterministic processes shape assembly of abundant taxa and generalists, while stochastic processes played a greater role in rare taxa and specialists. Also, bacterial communities in the shrubland ecosystem appear to be more sensitive to environmental changes than other ecosystems, evidenced by the lowest diversity, least connected community network, and strongest local environmental selection driven by surrounding land use. Overall, this study reveals ecological mechanisms underlying the bacterial biogeography in terrestrial ecosystems nationwide and highlights the need to preserve rare biosphere and shrubland ecosystems amid environmental disturbance.	0	contr
40063283	Drought's physiological footprint: implications for crop improvement in rice.	Rice, a staple food for significant percent of the world's population, is increasingly vulnerable to drought stress, threatening global food security. This review synthesizes current knowledge on drought's physiological impact on rice, highlighting key mechanisms, responses, and adaptations. Drought stress alters rice physiology at various stages, from seed germination to grain filling, affecting yield, quality, and nutrient content. Drought tolerance in rice is influenced by physiological traits such as root architecture and depth, stomatal regulation and water use efficiency, Osmo-protectants and antioxidant defences, hormone signalling and stress response pathways. Genetic diversity and molecular breeding have enhanced drought resilience in rice, with key genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling drought tolerance identified, enabling marker-assisted selection and genetic engineering. Despite progress, challenges persist, including limited understanding of drought's impact on rice physiology under field conditions, inefficient screening methods for drought tolerance, and insufficient attention to drought's effects on rice quality and nutritional content. To address these gaps, integrating physiology, genetics, and agronomy for holistic drought mitigation strategies is crucial. Developing high-throughput phenotyping tools for drought tolerance screening and investigating drought's impact on rice grain quality and nutritional content are essential. This review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding drought's physiological footprint in rice and guiding future research toward improving drought tolerance and resilience.	0	contr
40064086	Enriched anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation for mitigating methane emissions in rainfed systems and climate-neutral rice production.	This study demonstrated the effectiveness of enriched anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation in reducing methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from rice cultivation while improving soil fertility and rice productivity. The enriched consortium from cattle farm effluent, dominated by Acinetobacter (65.5%) and containing both types I (Methylosarcina, Methylomagnum, and Methyloversatilis) and II (Methylocystis) methanotrophs, exhibited high methane oxidation rates (V<sub>max</sub> 45.70 ± 13.71 μmol-CH<sub>4</sub>⋅g<sup>-1</sup>⋅h<sup>-1</sup> and K<sub>m</sub> 16.50 ± 4.95 μM). The optimal inoculum size for soil application was 0.2 L⋅m<sup>-2</sup> (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5), resulting in a CH<sub>4</sub> reduction efficiency of 74.30 ± 3.56%. In rice pot experiments, the anoxic methanotrophic consortium with an inoculum size of 0.2 L⋅m<sup>-2</sup> reduced methane emissions by 79.32 ± 3.96% without fertilizer and 29.22 ± 1.45% and 46.81 ± 1.87% when combined with organic and chemical fertilizers, respectively. The field-scale evaluation revealed that combined soil and irrigation water application with anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation was the most effective, reducing seasonal methane emissions from 32.8 ± 4.2 to 9.3 ± 1.5 g-CH<sub>4</sub>·m<sup>-2</sup> and methane flux from 15.2 ± 2.1 to 4.3 ± 0.8 mg-CH<sub>4</sub>·m<sup>-2</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>, representing a 71.7 ± 0.4% reduction. This method also increased plant height (6.5%) and tiller number (26.4%). The combined application method also resulted in the highest soil nutrient levels (96.1 mg-N·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil, 21.8 mg-P·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil, and 133.4 mg-K·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil) and increased rice yield by 14.7% (975 g⋅m<sup>-2</sup>). These findings demonstrate that anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation is a sustainable approach to mitigate methane emissions and improve rice productivity, emphasizing the importance of integrating this strategy into rice cultivation practices in rainfed lowland areas.	0	contr

40058890	Visualizing the spatial distribution of metabolites in tomato fruit at different maturity stages by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging.	Tomato is one of the highest-value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide, serving as an important source of micro-nutrients in the human diet. Understanding the spatial distribution changes of critical metabolites during fruit maturation is essential for investigating the physiological roles, nutritional value, and potential functional values of phytochemicals in tomato fruit. However, information on their spatial distribution remains limited. This study aimed to visualize the distribution differences of endogenous metabolites in tomatoes across four maturity stages (from green to red) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Relative quantification results showed that as the fruit ripened, levels of soluble sugars, amino acids and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increased significantly at the red ripening stage, while L-hydroxysuccinic acid exhibited an opposite trend, and citric acid initially decreased, then increased. Mass spectrometry imaging revealed that soluble sugars, organic acids, and amino acids were evenly distributed throughout the fruit across all maturity stages. During maturation, nine VOCs transitioned from a widespread distribution in the flesh tissue to concentrating near the peel, suggesting that aromatic compounds predominantly localize in the fruit's outer regions at full maturity. Additionally, a colocalization phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the spatial distribution imaging of each metabolite. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the changes and distribution of phytochemicals during tomato fruit development, offering a scientific basis for breeding, utilization, and production strategies.	0	contr

40063884	Enhancing green bean crop maturity and yield prediction by harnessing the power of statistical analysis, crop records and weather data.	Climate change impacts require us to reexamine crop growth and yield under increasing temperatures and continuing yearly climate variability. Agronomic and agro-meteorological variables were concorded for a large number of plantings of green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in three growing seasons over several years from semi-tropical Queensland. Using the Queensland government's SILO meteorological database matched to sowing dates and crop phenology, we derived planting specific agro-meteorological variables. Linear and nonlinear statistical models were used to predict duration of vegetative and pod filling periods and fresh yield using agro-meteorological variables including thermal time, radiation and days of high temperature stress. High temperatures over 27.5∘C and 30∘C in the pod fill period were associated with a lower fresh bean yield. Differences between specific bean growing sites were examined using our bespoke open source software to derive agro-meteorological variables. Agronomically informed statistical models using production data were useful in predicting time of harvest. These methods can be applied to other commercial crops when crop phenology dates are collected.	0	contr
40058038	The interactive application and impacts of iron/nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in distributed ponds for non-point source pollution control in a watershed.	The linkages of distributed ponds are utilized in conjunction with one another to remediate non-point source (NPS) pollution in a water-scarce basin. This study provides an overview of a state-of-the-art thorough evaluation of ponds, which offers insight into the majority of topics covered by the ongoing scientific studies, including their various functions and factors affecting their functioning on the hydrological, physicochemical, and biological processes, such as environmental climate factors and basin-specific landscape configuration parameters, as well as process parameters for design, operation and management aspects. The linkages of ponds provide a variety of sustainable services (6R functions), such as resources, restoration, reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery. The significance of regional environmental geochemical substrates in the ponds, such as red soil, as a hotspot for microbial reaction is emphasized to demonstrate the significant contribution of the migration and transformation of Fe/N cycles to the pollution removal process. In this review, 178 original research publications were thoroughly analyzed to improve our knowledge of the iron-nitrogen cycle in wetlands. From a molecular biology standpoint, the identification of functional microbe species and genes linked to microbially driven iron-nitrogen cycle activities is delved. Reliable data and homogeneous datasets from 42 studies were collected. The correlation analysis results demonstrated Feammox rates contributed to the N loss amount (r = 0.871; p < 0.01), and they had a positive correlation with Fe(III) concentration (r = 0.965; p < 0.01). The proposal for the treatment of NPS pollution by large-scale linkages of ponds in a basin involves optimizing Fe/N microbial processes to promote iron crystallization and efficient circulation of Fe(II) and Fe(III). The co-benefits of geochemistry, biotechnology, and environmental science should be considered when managing contamination in engineering applications. The linkages framework for integrated ponds, which incorporates macro (watershed management) and micro (biogeochemical cycle mechanism) investigations, provides a systematic approach to the application of integrated ponds and sustainable water management for NPS pollution control.	0	contr
40065567	Recent advances in targeted degradation in the RAS pathway.	"<i>RAS</i> (rat sarcoma) is one of the most frequently mutated gene families in cancer, encoding proteins classified as small GTPases. Mutations in RAS proteins result in abnormal activation of the RAS signaling pathway, a key driver in the initiation and progression of various malignancies. Consequently, targeting RAS proteins and the RAS signaling pathway has become a critical strategy in anticancer therapy. While RAS was historically considered an ""undruggable"" target, recent breakthroughs have yielded inhibitors specifically targeting KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutations, which have shown clinical efficacy in patients. However, these inhibitors face limitations due to rapid acquired resistance and the toxic effects of combination therapies in clinical settings. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies, such as PROTACs and molecular glues, provide a novel approach by selectively degrading RAS proteins, or their upstream and downstream regulatory factors, to block aberrant signaling pathways. These degraders offer a promising alternative to traditional inhibitors by potentially circumventing resistance and enhancing therapeutic precision. This review discusses recent advancements in RAS pathway degraders, with an emphasis on targeting RAS mutations as well as their upstream regulators and downstream effectors for potential cancer treatments."	0	contr

40065930	Morphometric Analysis of Pterygomaxillary Fissure in Dry Skulls and its Clinical Significance During Head and Neck Injury.	The divergence of the maxilla from the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone forms the pterygomaxillary fissure, which lies in the medial part of the infratemporal fossa. It transmits the posterior superior alveolar nerve and the terminal segment of the internal maxillary artery and connects the infratemporal fossa with the pterygopalatine fossa. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the height, width and distance of the pterygomaxillary fissure from the zygomatic bone, articular tubercle, and zygomatico-temporal suture. Forty dry human skulls were examined by the Department of Anatomy. Using a digital caliper, the right and left sides of the skulls of both sexes were measured for height, width, and distance from the upper end of the pterygomaxillary fissure to the articular tubercle of the zygomatic arch (AB), zygomaticotemporal suture (AC), and zygomatic body (AD). The average height of the pterygomaxillary fissure was 22.68 mm in males & 22.34 mm in females, the width was 7.33 mm in males & 7.22 mm in females, distance from the articular tubercle (AB) was 33.37 mm in males & 31.79 mm in female, zygomatic temporal suture (AC) was 36.91 mm in male & 34.89 mm in female, zygomatic bone (AD) was 29.88 mm in male &28.44 mm in female. There is no statistically significant difference between the right and left sides of the skulls of both genders. Because fissures smaller than 2 mm may prevent neurostimulator implants from being inserted into the pterygopalatine fossa, this study attempted to determine the location of the pterygomaxillary fissure using the three anatomical markers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when performing maxillofacial procedures on female patients.	0	contr
40066645	Synergistic Inactivation of Airborne Viruses by Low-Concentration Ozone With High Humidity and Temperature.	Ambient humidity, temperature, and ozone influence the viability of airborne viruses, but their synergistic effects are poorly understood, particularly regarding ozone with humidity/temperature changes. Therefore, we examined the inactivation of airborne influenza viruses and coronaviruses under combinations of low ambient ozone concentrations, relative humidity (RH) levels, and temperatures typical of daily life. Viral fluid was atomized in a closed chamber conditioned with different combinations of these factors. The atomized aerosol particles containing the virus were exposed to ambient air and then sampled for titration. Active virus levels in ambient air at 50%-85% RH with 15, 35, and 55 ppb ozone significantly decreased compared with those in ambient air with 0 ppb ozone, whereas those in ambient air at < 40% RH decreased only slightly, even with 100 ppb ozone. Viral gene copy numbers, assayed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, remained similar across all conditions. Inactivation increased with higher temperatures, although not at 15°C. These findings suggest that low concentrations of ambient ozone, when combined with high humidity and temperature, effectively inactivate airborne viruses, potentially influencing viral transmission in real-world environments.	0	contr
40062896	Evaluating the survival and removal of <i>Escherichia coli</i> from surfaces made with traditional and sustainable cement-based materials in field-relevant conditions.	Soil household floors are common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and can serve as reservoirs of enteric pathogens. Cement-based floors may interrupt pathogen transmission, but little is known about pathogen survival or removal from cement-based surfaces. This study investigated the survival of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, an indicator of fecal contamination, on cement-based surfaces and evaluated its reduction through common household activities (mopping, sweeping, and walking). We compared <i>E. coli</i> fate on three mixes: (i) ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete (used in the United States), (ii) OPC mortar (used in Bangladesh), and (iii) OPC mortar with fly ash (a sustainable alternative to the Bangladesh mix). Additionally, we compared outcomes on cement-based surfaces with and without soil and at two temperatures representing the dry and wet seasons in Bangladesh. After 4 hours on the cement-based surfaces, <i>E. coli</i> decayed more than 1.1 log<sub>10</sub>(<i>C</i>/<i>C<sub>o</sub></i>) under all conditions tested, which is significantly faster than in bulk soils. The higher temperature increased the decay rate constant (<i>P</i> = 5.56 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) while soil presence decreased it (<i>P</i> = 2.80 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Sweeping and mopping resulted in high levels of removal for all mixes, with a mean removal of 71% and 78%, respectively, versus 22% for walking. The concrete and mortar mix designs did not impact <i>E. coli</i> survival or removal (<i>P</i> > 0.20). Cement-based floors made with a fly ash mix performed similarly to traditional cement-based floors, supporting their potential use as a more sustainable intervention to reduce fecal contamination in rural LMIC household settings.	0	contr
40058202	Anthropogenic impacts on regional leaching risks posed by trace metal(loid)s in the soil of an industrial city.	The leaching risks associated with trace metal(loid)s (s) in regional soil are complex due to the intricate interplay between pollution levels and soil properties. A K<sub>d</sub>-based regional leaching risk assessment method was developed to assess the leaching risks posed by soil TMs. The random forest model was used to identify the effects of the soil environment on the soil K<sub>d</sub> and the leaching risks. The reliability of the established method was successfully validated by field monitoring data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84). The mean total soil groundwater risk was 1.59, the high mobility of Cd contributed the most to total risks. High-risk areas were mainly located in the farmland and forestland around a smelter and areas with severe soil acidification. The high mobility and moderate contamination of TMs resulted in the highest leaching risks. Furthermore, soil acidification and the conversion of farmland to forestland would increase the leaching risk by 33.5 % and 46.4 %, respectively, while urban expansion would reduce the leaching risk by 60.3 %. The K<sub>d</sub>-based leaching risk assessment method provided a critical framework for decision-makers to efficiently identify high-risk areas on a regional scale, facilitating a deeper understanding of how anthropogenic activities influenced the leaching risks of TMs in soil.	0	contr
40065031	Responses of rice plant to multiple abiotic stresses revealed by transcriptome meta-analysis and identification of novel genetic factors.	Plant responses to abiotic stresses have a complex polygenic nature including main and epistatic genetic factors. Several tolerant rice varieties were subjected to drought, salt and cold stresses and their transcriptomic responses were evaluated using affymetrix probe set. Meta-analysis of standardized microarray data was conducted to identify specific and common genes responding to multiple abiotic stresses. 375 and 298 genes were up- and downregulated under drought stress, 281 and 313 genes were up- and downregulated under salt stress, and 1,273 and 2,996 genes were up- and downregulated under cold stress. In addition to many specific genes for each stress condition, common genes were identified for response to drought and salt (n=91), drought and cold (n=121), and salt and cold (n=108), while 14 genes were common for response to all 3 stresses. 12 out of 14 genes were downregulated under the 3 stresses; however, only 2 upregulated genes (including an auxin-responsive protein and a LRR protein) were common among the 3 stresses. One of the common downregulated genes is a non-ABC transporter belonging to proton-dependent oligopeptide transport (POT) family protein which is novel and has a vital role in uptake of nutrients, particularly nitrate, and in recognizing plant defense compounds and hormones. In addition, two other non-ABC transporters (OsAAP7C and OsGT1) were identified which were downregulated under drought, salinity and cold stresses. This finding can explain why and how the uptake of necessary nutrients for growth and development of plants decreases under these oxidative stresses. Another novel downregulated gene under the 3 stresses is a TraB-related protein with vital role for normal mitochondrial function. These results open new insights into genetic engineering and molecular breeding of plants for tolerance to abiotic stresses.	0	contr
40064915	Comprehensive immunophenotyping reveals distinct tumor microenvironment alterations in anti-PD-1 sensitive and resistant syngeneic mouse model.	The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has revolutionized cancer treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. However, resistance remains a critical challenge. This study aimed to comparatively elucidate immunophenotypic changes in syngeneic mouse models sensitive (MC-38) or resistant (LLC1) to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. In the sensitive MC-38 model, anti-PD-1 therapy increased dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, while decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I/II) and costimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86) was observed on tumor-associated DCs and macrophages. Tumor-infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup>T, CD8<sup>+</sup>T, regulatory T, NK, and NKT cells also significantly increased. Importantly, treatment boosted lymphocyte cytotoxic potential, with perforin identified as a key marker of efficacy. Notably, perforin expression in CD4<sup>+</sup>T and NKT cells strongly negatively correlated with tumor volume. In contrast, the resistant LLC1 model exhibited minimal immunophenotypic changes upon treatment. These findings highlight critical immune modifications induced by anti-PD-1 therapy, particularly the role of perforin, and the DC/MDSC ratio in predicting therapeutic outcomes. This research offers valuable insights into potential predictive biomarkers and informs strategies to overcome resistance, emphasizing the complex interplay between anti-PD-1 treatment and the tumor microenvironment, ultimately aiming to improve immunotherapy response rates.	0	contr

40065721	HDAC11 in ovarian granulosa cells coordinates LH in the maturation of oocytes in Tan sheep.	Oocyte maturation plays an important role in supporting mammalian reproduction. Histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11), the only member of the class IV histone deacetylase family and the smallest histone deacetylases (HDACs), has been shown to regulate oocyte maturation in mice and pigs. However, the epigenetic effects of HDACs in follicular granulosa cells in response to LH induction remain elusive in sheep. In this study, the effects of follicular somatic cell-derived HDAC11 on oocyte maturation in Tan sheep are evaluated. The expression changes of HDAC11 and related proteins are detected by means of immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results indicate that the level of HDAC11 in follicular granulosa cells as well as oocytes in Tan sheep increases with the growth and maturation of the follicles. Specific inhibition of HDAC11 by SIS17 remarkably reduces the oocyte maturation rate under LH supplementation <i>in vitro</i>. Accordingly, the acetylation level of H3K9 in granulosa cells is increased, while the EGF-like growth factor AREG is remarkably decreased. Furthermore, inhibition of HDAC11 markedly decreases the level of YAP1, which is a negative regulator of AREG in granulosa cells. Conclusively, HDAC11 in the granulosa cells of Tan sheep contributes to the LH induced production of AREG during oocyte <i>in vitro</i> maturation by decreasing the level of H3K9 acetylation and increasing the level of YAP1.	0	contr

40066372	Application of Ultrasound Localization Microscopy in Evaluating the Type 2 Diabetes Progression.	Type 2 diabetes is considered as a chronic inflammatory disease in which the dense microvasculature reorganizes with disease progression and is highly correlated with β cell mass and islet function. In this study, we constructed rat models of type 2 diabetes and used ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) imaging to noninvasively map the pancreatic microvasculature at microscopy resolution in vivo to reflect β cell loss and islet function deterioration, and evaluate the efficacy after anti-cytokine immunotherapy. It was unveiled that ULM morphological and hemodynamic parameters have a strong link with β cell loss and deterioration of pancreatic islet function. This correlation aligns with the observed pathological alterations in the microvessels of islet and demonstrated that ULM can effectively mirror the functionality of β cells during rapid fluctuations in blood glucose levels by observing changes in mean velocity. Furthermore, it was revealed that treatment with anti-cytokine immunotherapy enhances the function and health of β cells by restoring the microvascular environment. Remarkable improvements in vessel morphology (measured by fractal dimension) and hemodynamics (indicated by mean velocity and vessel density) were noted following the anti-cytokine immunotherapy, signifying a significant enhancement at the treatment's conclusion (<i>P</i> < 0.05). These observations suggested that ULM technology holds promise as a visible and efficient tool for monitoring the effectiveness of anti-cytokine immunotherapy in managing type 2 diabetes. Pancreatic microvessel-based ULM may serve as a novel noninvasive method to assess β cells, providing a valuable clinical tool for tracking the progression of type 2 diabetes.	0	contr

There are three main subtypes of SWI/SNF CRCs: canonical (cBAF), polybromo (pBAF), and noncanonical (ncBAF) in humans and their functional Arabidopsis counterparts SYD-associated SWI/SNF (SAS), MINU-associated SWI/SNF (MAS), and BRAHMA (BRM)-associated SWI/SNF (BAS). Here, we highlight the importance of interplay between SWI/SNF CRCs and TFs in human and Arabidopsis and summarize recent advances demonstrating their role in controlling important regulatory processes. We discuss possible mechanisms involved in TFs and SWI/SNF CRCs-dependent transcriptional control of gene expression. We indicate that Arabidopsis may serve as a valuable model for the identification of evolutionarily conserved SWI/SNF-TF interactions and postulate that further exploration of the TFs and SWI/SNF CRCs-interplay, especially in the context of the role of particular SWI/SNF CRC subtypes, TF type, as well as cell/tissue and conditions, among others, will help address important questions related to the specificity of SWI/SNF-TF interactions and the sequence of events occurring on their target genes.	0	contr
40065879	Successful BRCA2 Mutation Detection via Tissue-Based Gene Panel Testing in Post-bone Marrow Transplant Breast Cancer: Implications for Precision Medicine.	<i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> (<i>BRCA1/2</i>) mutation screening is recommended for patients with advanced breast cancer or early breast cancer suspected to have hereditary origins based on family history or tumor characteristics. Blood-based testing is the standard approach, but it is not feasible in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation due to the replacement of blood cells with donor-derived cells. We report a case of a patient who, following bone marrow transplantation, required an alternative to blood-based germline <i>BRCA1/2</i> screening. A germline <i>BRCA2</i> mutation was inferred through tissue-based gene panel testing on a tumor sample, using variant allele frequency analysis. This approach allowed the initiation of targeted therapy with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, resulting in sustained progression-free intervals. This case demonstrates the potential of tissue-based gene panel testing to identify actionable germline mutations in breast cancer patients when blood-based testing is not feasible, thereby expanding therapeutic options in complex clinical scenarios.	0	contr
40053875	Reduced Honeybee Pollen Foraging under Neonicotinoid Exposure: Exploring Reproducible Individual and Colony Level Effects in the Field Using AI and Simulation.	Honeybees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) are important pollinators. Their foraging behaviors are essential to colony sustainability. Sublethal exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids can significantly disrupt these behaviors, in particular pollen foraging. We investigated the effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on honeybee foraging, at both individual and colony levels, by integrating field experiments with artificial intelligence (AI)-based monitoring technology and mechanistic simulations using the BEEHAVE model. Our results replicated previous findings, which showed that imidacloprid selectively reduces pollen foraging at the colony level, with minimal impact on nectar foraging. Individually marked exposed honeybees exhibited prolonged pollen foraging trips, reduced pollen foraging frequency, and instances of drifting pollen foraging trips, likely due to impaired cognitive functions and altered metabolism. These behavioral changes at the individual level corroborated the previous model predictions derived from BEEHAVE, which highlights the value of combining experimental and simulation approaches to disentangle underlying mechanisms through which sublethal effects on individual foragers scale up to impact colony dynamics. Our findings have implications for future pesticide risk assessment, as we provide a robust feeding study design for evaluating pesticide effects on honeybee colonies and foraging in real landscapes, which could improve the realism of higher-tier ecological risk assessment.	1	pest

40058661	Integrated modelling of anaerobic digestion process chain for scenario assessment.	Anaerobic digestion (AD) expansion as a renewable energy source offers environmental benefits, such as reducing mineral fertilizer use and preserving soil organic matter. However, poor AD performance can cause greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient loss, impacting efficiency. To address this, an innovative AD process chain (ADPC) model was developed to dynamically simulate biogas production, organic matter bioaccessibility, digestate phase separation, storage, and soil application, focusing on carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Evaluated against 5 lab-scale experiments and C/N soil dynamics without specific calibration, the model accurately reproduced trends (bias: 11% for biogas, r<sup>2</sup>: 0.78 for soil N dynamics), despite discrepancies in digestate carbon speciation and soil C dynamics, emphasizing the importance of calibrating feedstock biodegradability and hydrolysis parameters to enhance accuracy. Additionally, feedstock seasonality scenarios demonstrated the importance of dynamic modeling in predicting agronomic digestate fate positioning ADPC as a valuable tool for scenario testing considering both energy and agronomic valorization.	0	contr

40064954	Precision soil sampling strategy for the delineation of management zones in olive cultivation using unsupervised machine learning methods.	Climate change and environmental degradation pose a significant threat to the global community. Soil management is one of the critical factors for achieving climate neutrality, as plants and soils together currently absorb approximately 30% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by human activities each year. This study focused on delineating soil management zones in olive groves to maintain soil health in complex environmental conditions and minimize adverse effects on the biological systems supported. The results of this study are crucial because they showed the potential of unsupervised machine learning techniques in this setting and important soil characteristics for defining management zones. They might significantly affect applying precision farming techniques and methods in olive groves, providing a possible remedy for the problems caused by climate change. A total of 222 soil samples at a depth of 0-30 cm were collected from three areas in the Region of Western Greece, at a density of 21 × 21 m in each area, and analyzed for physicochemical properties. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to identify the critical soil properties for delineating the management zones. The soil samples were clustered using unsupervised machine learning methods, K-means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. PCA is a method that can help in the selection of critical parameters for the delineation of management zones. Sand (S), Clay (C), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), and total carbonates (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) can delineate management zones in olive cultivation. The management zones and how each field is separated vary depending on the clustering method.	0	contr
40052246	Stomata-Photosynthesis Synergy Mediates Combined Heat and Salt Stress Tolerance in Sugarcane Mutant M4209.	"Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is an economically important long-duration crop which is currently facing concurrent heat waves and soil salinity. The present study evaluates an inducible salt-tolerant sugarcane mutant M4209, developed via radiation-induced mutagenesis of elite check variety Co 86032, under heat (42/30°C; day/night), NaCl (200 mM) or heat + NaCl (HS)-stress conditions. Though heat application significantly improved plant growth and biomass in both genotypes, this beneficial impact was partially diminished in Co 86032 under HS-stress conditions, coinciding with higher Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation and lower triacylglycerol levels. Besides, heat broadly equalised the negative impact on NaCl stress in terms of various physiological and biochemical attributes in both the genotypes, indicating its spaciotemporal advantage. The simultaneous up- and downregulation of antagonistic regulators, epidermal patterning factor (EPF) 9 (SoEPF9) and SoEPF2, respectively attributed to the OSD (Open Small Dense) stomatal phenotype in M4209, which resulted into enhanced conductance, transpirational cooling and gaseous influx. This led to improved photoassimilation, which was supported by higher plastidic:nonplastidic lipid ratio, upregulation of SoRCA (Rubisco activase) and better source strength, resulting in overall plant growth enhancement across all the tested stress scenarios. Taken together, the present study emphasised the knowledge-driven harnessing of stomatal-photosynthetic synergy for ensuring global sugarcane productivity, especially under ""salt-heat"" coupled stress scenarios."	0	contr
40053538	Hygroscopic effect of high clay-content shale under temperature and humidity conditions and its impact on mechanical properties.	High clay-content shale, containing hydrophilic clay minerals, is highly sensitive to environmental temperature and humidity. It readily absorbs moisture from the air, leading to increased water content and reduced mechanical strength, which poses challenges for underground structures, such as mining roadways, tunnels, and storage chambers. This study investigates the influence of temperature and humidity on the water content of high clay-content shale during its hygroscopic process and examines the evolution of its mechanical properties under variations in water content, aiming to reveal the effects of environmental temperature and humidity on the mechanical behavior of high clay-content shale. Hygroscopic experiments were conducted using a temperature and humidity chamber, with quartz sand as non-clay mineral control groups, and strength experiments were performed on reconstituted shale samples with varying water content. Results from the hygroscopic experiments showed that the equilibrium water content (EWC) of high clay-content shale decreases with lower humidity and higher temperature. When the humidity decreased from 100% RH to 80% RH, the average EWC dropped from 15.88% to 7.53%. Under high-humidity conditions (100% RH), the EWC decreased to 11.92% only after the temperature increased to 30°C. Within the experimental conditions, reducing humidity was found to be more effective than increasing temperature in reducing EWC. Based on the mechanical test results, reducing humidity can decrease the loss of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) caused by moisture absorption from approximately 50% to 15.48%. The results indicate that humidity is the primary factor influencing the EWC and mechanical properties of high clay-content shale. Reducing humidity can significantly mitigate strength loss caused by moisture absorption, while increasing temperature plays a supplementary role. These findings provide a scientific basis for controlling temperature and humidity in underground engineering to enhance structural stability.	0	contr

40058441	TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber incorporating hydrophobic TA-HBPSi nanoparticles aerogels for efficient adsorption of fungicides in water.	Fungicide contamination is a critical environmental issue, and the effective removal of fungicide residues from aquatic environments has attracted significant attention from researchers. In this study, the synthesized hyperbranched polysiloxane (TA-HBPSi) was grafted onto TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNF) to fabricate a novel aerogel material (TA-HBPSi@TOCNF) with the aim of enhancing the sorption efficiency of fungicide. The equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity of TA-HBPSi@TOCNF for imazalil (8.04 mg/g) was significantly higher compared to other fungicides, including prochloraz (6.43 mg/g), thiophanate-methyl (4.12 mg/g), carbendazim (0.16 mg/g), and thiabendazole (0.04 mg/g). In the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, the equilibrium adsorption capacity for imazalil increased from 8.04 mg/g to 9.61 mg/g, while the adsorption capacity for Cd<sup>2+</sup> increased from 0.26 mg/g to 0.88 mg/g. Quantum chemical calculations were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level. The energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ΔE(<sub>HOMO-LUMO</sub>)) for various adsorption mechanisms indicated that electrostatic interactions were the dominant driving force for adsorption, followed by π-π electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions and hydrophobic interactions. The developed aerogel demonstrated effective multi-component separation capabilities without inducing secondary environmental pollution, highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for practical water purification applications.	1	pest
40073482	"Filament-woven SF/PA gel for removing ultrafine nanoparticles and unmanageable hazardous pollutants by ""all-in-one net""."	"The current state of the world's water resources is facing serious challenges, and the current water purification processes are designed for a single, more specific contaminant, with more stringent constraints, which are not suitable for emergency water treatment in stochastic environment and may cause secondary pollution. It is necessary to provide a water purification method that is convenient, easy-to-operate, one-step treatment of multiple pollutants. Herein, silk fibroin (SF) that extracted from discarded silkworm cocoons and recycled silk and phytic acid (PA) are ""woven"" into a network structure through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction to form a unique gel, which could be used to remove different pollutants by ""sweeping and catching"" and physical adsorption. SF/PA gels have been demonstrated to adsorb more than 99.9% of ultrafine nanoparticles in water, and many unmanageable hazardous pollutants can also be removed by ""All-in-one Net"", including bacteria, polystyrene microsphere, insoluble antibiotics and pesticides. In addition, SF/PA gel from waste resources can not only achieve the purpose of treating waste with waste, but also the products after removal of pollutants can be reused as biochar-based fertilizer to improve the soil environment. This process established a sustainable closed-loop system without secondary pollution, providing an excellent scheme for the sustainable use of resources."	1	pest

40056517	Microbial degradation of polypropylene microplastics and concomitant polyhydroxybutyrate production: An integrated bioremediation approach with metagenomic insights.	The persistence of plastics, particularly polypropylene (PP), and their conversion into microplastics (MPs), specifically PP-MPs, have emerged as serious ecological threats to soil and aquatic environments. In the present study, we aimed to isolate a microbial consortium capable of degrading PP-MPs. The results revealed that three microbial consortia (CPP-KKU1, CPP-KKU2, and CPP-KKU3) exhibited the ability to degrade PP-MPs, achieving weight losses ranging from 11.6 ± 0.2 % to 17.8 ± 0.5 % after 30 days. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis confirmed the degradation through oxidation, as evidenced by the presence of new functional groups (-OH and -C=O). In particular, CPP-KKU3 showed the highest degradation efficiency, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealing surface cracking after treatment. Additionally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified various intermediate compounds, including heterocyclic aromatic compounds, phenyl groups, methylthio derivatives, and ethoxycarbonyl derivatives, indicating complex biochemical processes that were likely mediated by microbial enzymes. Furthermore, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production by these consortia was also investigated. The result showed that both CPP-KKU2 and CPP-KKU3 successfully produced PHB, with CPP-KKU3 demonstrating superior performance in terms of PP-MP degradation and PHB production. Metagenomic analysis of CPP-KKU3 revealed abundant carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), particularly glycosyl transferases and glycoside hydrolases, which are associated with MP digestion. This study presents a promising bioremediation approach that addresses plastic waste degradation and sustainable bioplastic production, offering a potential solution for environmental plastic pollution.	0	contr

40066161	High-resolution genome assembly and population genetic study of the endangered maple <i>Acer pentaphyllum</i> (Sapindaceae): implications for conservation strategies.	<i>Acer pentaphyllum</i> Diels (Sapindaceae), a highly threatened maple endemic to the dry-hot valleys of the Yalong River in western Sichuan, China, represents a valuable resource for horticulture and conservation. This study presents the first chromosomal-scale genome assembly of <i>A. pentaphyllum</i> (~626 Mb, 2<i>n</i> = 26), constructed using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C sequencing technologies. Comparative genomic analyses revealed significant recent genomic changes through rapid amplification of transposable elements, particularly long terminal repeat retrotransposons, coinciding with the dramatic climate change during recent uplift of the Hengduan Mountains. Genes involved in photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and plant-pathogen interaction showed expansion and/or positive selection, potentially reflecting adaptation to the species' unique dry-hot valley habitat. Population genomic analysis of 227 individuals from 28 populations revealed low genetic diversity (1.04 ± 0.97 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) compared to other woody species. Phylogeographic patterns suggest an unexpected upstream colonization along the Yalong River, while Quaternary climate fluctuations drove its continuous lineage diversification and population contraction. Assessment of genetic diversity, inbreeding, and genetic load across populations revealed concerning levels of inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious mutations in small, isolated populations, particularly those at range edges (TKX, CDG, TES). Based on these results, we propose conservation strategies, including the identification of management units and recommendations for genetic rescue. These findings not only facilitate the conservation of <i>A. pentaphyllum</i> but also serve as a valuable resource for future horticultural development and as a model for similar studies on other endangered plant species adapted to extreme environments.	0	contr

40066322	Biomimetic Self-Oxygenated Immunoliposome for Cancer-Targeted Photodynamic Immunotherapy.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy with significant clinical application potential for tumor treatment. However, the tumor hypoxia and limited efficacy against tumor metastasis present significant limitations in the clinical application of PDT. To alleviate tumor hypoxia for PDT against tumor growth and metastasis, we developed a self-oxygenated immunoliposome by encapsulating the catalase (CAT) within the liposome cavity and loading the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and immunoadjuvant MPLA in the lipid bilayer of the immunoliposome (CAT@LP-Ce6-A). Subsequently, we fused it with the cancer cell membrane (CCM) to create the hybrid immunoliposome (CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A). The in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A-based photodynamic immunotherapy (PDIT) was evaluated.	0	contr
40066471	Tracking In Vivo Lipolysis of Lipid Nanocarriers Using NIR-II Polarity-Sensitive Fluorescent Probes.	Elucidating in vivo lipolysis is crucial for clarifying the underlying mechanisms and in vivo fates of lipid-based nanocarriers, which are essential oral drug delivery carriers. Current mainstream methodologies use various in vitro digestion models to predict the in vivo performance of lipid formulations; however, their accuracy is often impeded by the complicated environment of the gastrointestinal tract. Although fluorescence labeling with conventional probes partly reveals the in vivo translocation of lipid nanocarriers, it fails to elucidate the lipolysis process because of poor signal discrimination among nanocarriers, free probes, and mixed micelles (lipolysis end-products). Here, a polarity-sensitive probe (PN-C18) with aggregation-caused quenching properties for labeling lipid nanocarriers is developed and optimized. PN-C18 successfully eliminates interference from both free probes and mixed micelles during lipolysis. In a representative in vitro lipolysis model, PN-C18 labeling shows stronger correlation between fluorescence intensity and lipolysis progression than those of previous methods. In vivo, the translocation and lipolysis of lipid nanoparticles are clearly visualized and effectively monitored, owing to the high tissue-penetrating capability of PN-C18 NIR-II photons. This study provides practical means for elucidating the in vivo fate of lipid-based drug delivery systems and offers valuable insights and reference for further studies in this domain.	0	contr
40065617	[Research progress of nucleus tractus solitarius involved in central regulation of hypertension].	The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) is the primary brain region for receiving and integrating cardiovascular afferent signals. It plays a crucial role in maintaining balance of autonomic nervous system and regulating blood pressure through cardiovascular reflexes. Neurons within the NTS form complex synaptic connections and interact reciprocally with other brain regions. The NTS regulates autonomic nervous system activity and arterial blood pressure through modulating baroreflex, sympathetic nerve activity, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and oxidative stress. Dysfunctions in NTS activity may contribute to hypertension. Understanding the NTS' role in centrally regulating blood pressure and alterations of neurotransmission or signaling pathways in the NTS may provide rationale for new therapeutic strategies of prevention and treatment. This review summarizes the research findings on autonomic nervous system regulation and arterial blood pressure control by NTS, as well as unresolved questions, in order to provide reference for future investigation.	0	contr
40066513	Stacking Pressure Modulated Deposition and Dissolution of Zinc Anode.	Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are emerging as a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage, offering enhanced safety and low costs. Nevertheless, the disordered growth of zinc dendrites has resulted in low coulombic efficiency and the dangers of short circuits, limiting the commercialization of ZIBs. In this study, a planar growth of zinc along the (002) direction is achieved by regulating the moderate initial stacking pressure during cell cycling and facilitating a larger zinc deposition particle size. The pivotal role of stacking pressure on the zinc nucleation, growth, and dissolution processes is elucidated with in situ pressure X-ray diffraction (XRD), time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMs), and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). By adjusting the staking pressure from 20 to 300 kPa, the battery cycle time increased 5 times. This work highlights the opportunity to precisely manipulate metal deposition/dissolution with stacking pressure for long-cycle life batteries.	0	contr
