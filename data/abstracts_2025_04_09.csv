40205627	Efficacy and Safety of Direct Oral Anti-Coagulants in Painful Venous Malformations in Children.	Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), including dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban, are increasingly used in adults for painful venous malformations (VMs) instead of subcutaneous drugs such as low molecular weight heparins or fondaparinux. However, these medications are poorly studied in children. In seven children with painful VMs and chronic intravascular consumptive coagulopathy, DOACs allowed for successful pain control and improvement in coagulopathy, with no adverse effects. DOACs appear to be an effective alternative in childhood VM associated with intravascular coagulopathy.

40205621	Exercise and dietary interventions in the management of diabetic cardiomyopathy: mechanisms and implications.	The global prevalence of diabetes is rapidly increasing, significantly raising the risk of various cardiovascular diseases. Among these, diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a distinct and critical complication characterized by ventricular hypertrophy and impaired myocardial contractility, ultimately progressing to heart failure and making it a leading cause of mortality among diabetic patients. Despite advances in pharmacological therapies, the effectiveness of managing cardiac dysfunction in DCM remains challenging. Consequently, exploring additional therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of DCM is urgently needed. Beyond pharmacological approaches, lifestyle modifications, particularly exercise and dietary interventions, play a fundamental role in managing DCM due to their significant cardiovascular benefits in diabetic patients. This review synthesizes recent advancements in the field, elucidating the underlying mechanisms through which exercise and dietary interventions influence DCM pathophysiology. By integrating these strategies, we aim to facilitate the development of personalized exercise and dietary regimens that effectively mitigate or prevent DCM progression.
40205620	Core outcome sets in cancer clinical trials: current status and future opportunities-an EORTC perspective.	Inconsistent, varied and selective outcome reporting is problematic in clinical trials. Core outcome sets (COS) standardise the outcomes that should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific area of health or health care. We reviewed available cancer COS and assessed their uptake in cancer clinical trials through surveying members of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).

Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) causes lumpy skin disease, which is one of the most devastating ruminant diseases. The pathogenesis of the disease remains largely unknown; however, the disease seriously threatens the global cattle-farming industry. In our previous study, we found that LSDV 142 gene deletion affected LSDV proliferation in cells and was an early gene involved in LSDV infection. Additionally, the study found that ORF142 inhibits the production of interferon beta.
40205611	Skin microbiome influences the progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma through the immune system.	Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a type of skin tumor that develops in the epithelial cells. This disease has the second highest incidence of human skin cancers, with a high metastatic rate. While ultraviolet radiation significantly contributes to the genomic changes that support cSCC development, the dysbiosis of the skin microbiome and influence of the immune system also play important roles in this process. In this review, we discuss the effects of skin microbes and their metabolites on the immune system, including innate immune cells, T cells, and cytokines. We also discuss how Staphylococcus aureus and human papillomavirus can affect cSCC by impacting the immune system. Furthermore, we explore the antagonism of symbiotic microorganisms with cSCC-associated pathogens and their potential as novel therapeutic modalities.

Studies evaluating the impact of kangaroo mother care (KMC) on neonatal mortality and morbidity often rely on healthcare worker records or caregiver reports to measure intervention duration. However, the accuracy of these methods remains uncertain. We examined the validity of different methods of KMC duration measurement amongst neonates ≤ 2000 g in Uganda.
40205607	Environmental costs in healthcare system: the case studies of Greece health care.	Climate change is considered one of the greatest threats to environmental sustainability, human health and social well-being worldwide. The healthcare sector is one of the main actors with a strong negative environmental footprint, being responsible for about 4% of global emissions, and is also considered one of the costliest sectors, with healthcare spending absorbing about 10% of global economic output. This article examines the environmental costs of the healthcare system in Greece, with a focus on public hospitals. The data analysis methodology was based on linear ordinary regression (OLS) models to calculate environmental costs related to energy consumption, waste management and water consumption. Data was collected through the Ministry of Health's platform (BI Health) and analyzed using Stata software. The main findings suggest that environmental costs are a significant part of total operating costs, particularly in university and specialist hospitals. Factors such as the number of beds, the existence of special units (e.g. ICU) and the use of natural gas have a significant impact on environmental costs. The study offers a mathematical model for predicting environmental costs, which can help hospital administrators to make decisions about sustainable practices. This model could provide an important opportunity for practical application to make targeted decisions such as investing in sustainable technologies, improving energy efficiency and enhancing waste management, leading to cost-effective and environmentally sustainable practices.

However, the specific mechanisms through which parental educational expectations impact adolescents' subjective well-being via self-efficacy and learning engagement are not well understood.
40205605	Perceived injustice in patients with chronic pain.	Chronic pain, particularly pain secondary to trauma, is often accompanied by a feeling of perceived injustice. A prevalent feeling of injustice often goes along with a prolonged rehabilitation and problematic development of chronic pain. This feeling also correlates to catastrophizing. To date, too little is known about how the perception of injustice in chronic pain patients is interwoven with a variety of psychological, social and somatic factors. The present study sought to examine whether perceived injustice is correlated with pain level, pain diagnosis, depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life, pain related disability, occupation status and ongoing workers compensation litigation.
40205604	Hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma after cytoreductive surgical procedures: a systematic review.	Surgery-based multimodality therapies for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma have been clinically explored in the past decades. In this regard, hyperthermic intrathoracic or intrapleural chemotherapy has been used as one of the multimodality therapies. The question addressed was In patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who undergo macroscopic complete resection (MCR) does performing a Hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy (HITOCH) lead to improvement in survival? The trial was registered in PROSPERO https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ under registration number: CRD42024588823.Three hundred five papers were found using the reported search, 21 were relevant to our topic and only 7 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Six studies demonstrated a survival benefit for patients receiving HITOCH with a median survival ranging from 13-35 months in comparison to 11 -22.8 months for the non HITOCH group. Three out of the five studies compared extra-pleural pneumonectomy (EPP) to extended pleurectomy decortication (EPD) as the surgical preference for MCR. Only one study by Van Sandick et al. found a negative outcome with HITOCH in patients performing EPP (11 months vs 29 months). There was no reported mortality in relation to complications associated with HITOCH. The most common complication was atrial fibrillation followed by renal impairment. Despite the heterogeneity, small number of cases and lack of prospective randomised controlled trials, the body of evidence identified in this work demonstrates that HITHOC added to MCR in patients with pleural mesothelioma is safe and feasible. Possible improvement in recurrence free survival and overall survival warrant investigation in a randomised controlled trial.
40205603	Application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of malignant digestive tract tumors: focusing on opportunities and challenges in endoscopy and pathology.	Malignant digestive tract tumors are highly prevalent and fatal tumor types globally, often diagnosed at advanced stages due to atypical early symptoms, causing patients to miss optimal treatment opportunities. Traditional endoscopic and pathological diagnostic processes are highly dependent on expert experience, facing problems such as high misdiagnosis rates and significant inter-observer variations. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as deep learning, real-time lesion detection with endoscopic assistance and automated pathological image analysis have shown potential in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. However, relevant applications still face challenges including insufficient data standardization, inadequate interpretability, and weak clinical validation.
40205601	Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis on a global scale.	Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be at higher risk of developing MetS due to chronic inflammation, altered adipokine profiles, and the effects of corticosteroid treatment. However, the prevalence of MetS in IBD patients remains inconsistent across studies. This meta-analysis aims to estimate the prevalence of MetS in IBD patients and compare its occurrence between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
40205600	The impact of socioeconomic characteristics on Sudanese women's use of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine for self-management of infertility.

Therefore, this study aimed to fill this gap by examining the associations of the socioeconomic characteristics of Sudanese women with, as well as their predictability of, the use of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine for self-management of infertility.
40205599	Off-label use of sodium cantharidinate and vitamin B6 injection in cancer: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.	In China, sodium cantharidinate/vitamin B6 (SC/VB6) injection has been approved since 2002 for the treatment of lung cancer and primary liver cancer. In addition to these authorized indications, clinical application of SC/VB6 is also common in various other types of cancer. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding on this topic. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to consolidate evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of off-label use of SC/VB6 in oncology.
40205597	Genomic and functional analysis of rmp locus variants in Klebsiella pneumoniae.	Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen and a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections in hospitals, which are frequently antimicrobial resistant (AMR). Exacerbating the public health threat posed by K. pneumoniae, some strains also harbour additional hypervirulence determinants typically acquired via mobile genetic elements such as the well-characterised large virulence plasmid KpVP-1. The rmpADC locus is considered a key virulence feature of K. pneumoniae and is associated with upregulated capsule expression and the hypermucoid phenotype, which can enhance virulence by contributing to serum resistance. Typically such strains have been susceptible to all antimicrobials besides ampicillin; however, the recent emergence of AMR hypermucoid strains is concerning.
40205596	Treating the individual: moving towards personalised eating disorder care.	Eating disorders (EDs) are complex and heterogeneous conditions, which are often not resolved with conventional, manualised treatments. Arguments for the development of holistic, person-centred treatments accounting for individual variability have been mounting amongst researchers, clinicians and people with lived experience alike. This review explores the transformative potential of personalised medicine in ED care, emphasising the integration of precision diagnostics and tailored interventions based on individual genetic, biological, psychological and environmental profiles. Building on advancements in genomics, neurobiology, and computational technologies, it advocates for a shift from categorical diagnostic frameworks to symptom-based and dimensional approaches. The paper summarises emerging evidence supporting precision psychiatry, including the development of biomarkers, patient-reported outcomes, predictive modelling, and staging models, and discusses their application in ED research and clinical care. It highlights the utility of machine learning and idiographic statistical methods in optimising therapeutic outcomes and identifies key challenges, such as ethical considerations, scalability and implementation.
40205595	A pilot metabolomics study on clear cell renal cell carcinoma.	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is fundamentally a metabolic disease. To investigate the underlying metabolite changes in the occurrence of ccRCC, we analyzed untargeted metabolomics of 15 ccRCC samples and paired adjacent non-malignant renal tissues by UHPLC-MS/MS analyses. In this study, 511 differential metabolites were screened, of which the top ten up-regulated metabolites in ccRCC were histamine, 1-methylnicotinamide, L-kynurenine, cortisol, tetrahydrocorticosterone, calcitriol, D-erythrose 4-phosphate, citric acid, sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate, and UDP-alpha-D-galactose, and the top down-regulated metabolites were D-cysteine, acetylcholine, pantothenic acid, cytosine, UMP, biocytin, dUMP, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, cytidine-5'-monophosphate, and 16α-hydroxyestrone. KEGG pathways enrichment analysis further demonstrated several highlighted pathways: steroid hormone biosynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism, and vitamin digestion and absorption. Our study reveals metabolic patterns of ccRCC and provides insight into the potential biomarker panel to diagnose ccRCC.

40205591	Trusted health system implementation strategies to increase vaccination (TRUE SYNERGI): a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to reduce HPV-related cancers.	Despite the availability of highly effective HPV vaccines that can reduce HPV-associated cancer mortality, HPV vaccination rates in Texas rank 48th nationwide. Although evidence shows Latino parents are more accepting of HPV vaccination than non-Hispanic parents, this disparity in vaccination rates underscores the importance of understanding Latino parental HPV vaccine hesitancy. Latinos/as typically receive healthcare at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which often need support implementing and improving access to evidence based preventive services. However, the current literature around implementation comes from large integrated healthcare systems and there is limited research around what works in the FQHC settings with Latino/a patients. Preliminary data from our previous work suggest practice facilitation is a feasible approach for building the capacity in FQHCs to select and implement provider- and practice-level strategies for increasing vaccination rates.
40205590	Cardiac symptoms in patients 3-6 months after contracting COVID-19- data from the polish STOP-COVID registry.	Common complaints of long COVID patients are cardiac symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and a feeling of palpitations. The study aimed to investigate the clinical features of patients with persistent cardiological symptoms occurring within 3 to 6 months after COVID-19. Differences in ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), Holter ECG (electrocardiogram) and Echocardiography between people with and without persistent cardiological symptoms were evaluated. We also assessed whether the symptoms of anxiety and depression may be implicated in the clinical outcomes.

An aggregated data collection system was initiated using District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) software in 2013 and a case-based electronic data registry system was developed utilising its "tracker" component since January 2018. The purpose of this study is to review the cervical cancer surveillance situation based on the data of the national cervical cancer screening, treatment and follow-up through the DHIS2-based electronic registry.
40205588	Metagenomic analysis reveals microbial drivers of heat resistance in dairy cattle.	Heat stress poses a significant challenge to dairy cattle, leading to adverse physiological effects, reduced milk yield, impaired reproduction performance and economic losses. This study investigates the role of the rumen microbiome in mediating heat resistance in dairy cows. Using the entropy-weighted TOPSIS method, we classified 120 dairy cows into heat-resistant (HR) and heat-sensitive (HS) groups based on physiological and biochemical markers, including rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), salivation index (SI) and serum levels of potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and cortisol. Metagenomic sequencing of rumen fluid samples revealed distinct microbial compositions and functional profiles between the two groups. HR cows exhibited a more cohesive and functionally stable microbiome, dominated by taxa such as Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Succiniclasticum, which are key players in fiber degradation and short-chain fatty acid production. Functional analysis highlighted the enrichment of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in HR cows, suggesting a metabolic adaptation that enhances oxidative stress management. In contrast, HS cows showed increased activity in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pyruvate metabolism and other energy-intensive pathways, indicating a higher metabolic burden under heat stress. These findings underscore the critical role of the rumen microbiome in modulating heat resistance and suggest potential microbiome-based strategies for improving dairy cattle resilience to climate change.

There is emerging evidence for the benefits of Exercise can reduce depressive symptoms among people with diagnosed depression, but there is limited evidence for subthreshold depression in primary care setting. This study aims to examine the efficacy of a 12-week online instructor-led exercise intervention in reducing depressive symptoms among people with subthreshold depression in primary care, when compared to usual care control.
40205585	Comprehensive assessment of aortic flow before and after aortic valve replacement in an ex-vivo porcine model with four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging.	Aortic valve replacement (AVR) has shown to induce secondary flow patterns deviating from main flow. It is impossible to analyze the impact of surgical access and different AVR techniques under standardized conditions in patients or silicone models. Therefore, we developed an ex-vivo swine model to analyze the impact of surgical access and to compare flow patterns after different AVR-techniques within the ascending aorta.
40205584	Interaction of low-density neutrophils with other immune cells in the mechanism of inflammation.	Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) are a unique subpopulation of neutrophils, play a significant role in regulating innate and adaptive immunity in various inflammation-related diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that LDNs play a significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. In this review, we address the origin, development, and heterogeneity of LDNs, and the roles of LDNs in system homeostasis and diseases. We will focus on the findings of the interaction between LDNs and other immune cells. We will then discuss potential novel therapeutic strategies of intervention in diseases by targeting LDNs.
40205583	Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses revealing tumor microenvironment remodeling after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the most common pathological type of lung cancer, and the combination of neoadjuvant immunotherapy with chemotherapy has emerged as the first-line treatment for NSCLC. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this therapeutic approach remains variable. The present study aims to examine the impact of chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC patients, with a view to identifying key molecules, critical cell subpopulations, communication patterns and spatial distributions that potentially correlate with therapeutic sensitivity. A total of 16 lung cancer tissue samples were collected from a cohort of 12 NSCLC patients and subjected to single-cell RNA and spatial transcriptome sequencing. Our data demonstrated that the distribution of CD4 + Treg T cells and mCAFs indicated an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, while the accumulation of CD4 + Th17 T cells and iCAFs could act as a positive marker for the sensitivity to chemoimmunotherapy. Furthermore, a significant high level of SELENOP-macrophages was observed in tissues from positive responders, and a strong co-localization between SELENOP-macrophages and antigen-presenting cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor boundaries was identified, indicating the cooperative roles of these two cell types in response to combined therapy. Moreover, SELENOP-macrophages were observed to be accumulated in tertiary lymphoid structures, which further suggested its critical role in recruiting lymphocytes. Furthermore, analysis of cell-cell communication, based on spatial transcriptomics, suggests that the interactions between SELENOP-macrophages, apCAFs, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were significantly enhanced in responders. In addition, SELENOP-macrophages recruited CD4 + Naïve, Helper and CD8 + Naïve T cells through pathways such as the cholesterol, interleukin, chemokine and HLA when responding to combined therapy. The present study further unveils the dynamic spatial and transcriptional changes in the tumor microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer in response to combination therapy.
40205582	Looking into opportunities for maternity continuum of care improvement within the primary health care system in Northwest Ethiopia: primary health care-oriented research.	The maternity continuum of care (MCC) is an integral component of universal health coverage and a crucial strategy for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. Despite its importance, MCC coverage remains low in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Ethiopia, which bear the highest burden of maternal and neonatal mortality. This underscores the need for proactive interventions. In this perspective, the primary health care (PHC) approach holds significant potential for enhancing MCC. Exploring demand- and/or supply-side opportunities for improving MCC within the PHC system could help inform policy, practice, and further research. However, there is limited evidence on these aspects in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aims to explore demand- and/or supply-side opportunities for MCC enhancement within the PHC system in northwest Ethiopia.

40205577	IGF2BP2: an m<sup>6</sup>A reader that affects cellular function and disease progression.	Insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) is a widely studied N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification reader, primarily functioning to recognize and bind to m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites on the mRNA of downstream target genes, thereby enhancing their stability. Previous studies have suggested that the IGF2BP2-m<sup>6</sup>A modification plays an essential role in cellular functions and the progression of various diseases. In this review, we focus on summarizing the molecular mechanisms by which IGF2BP2 enhances the mRNA stability of downstream target genes through m<sup>6</sup>A modification, thereby regulating cell ferroptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness, angiogenesis, inflammatory responses, and lipid metabolism, ultimately affecting disease progression. Additionally, we update the related research progress on IGF2BP2. This article aims to elucidate the effects of IGF2BP2 on cell ferroptosis, EMT, stemness, angiogenesis, inflammatory responses, and lipid metabolism, providing a new perspective for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between IGF2BP2 and cell functions such as ferroptosis and EMT, as well as the potential for targeted IGF2BP2 therapy for tumors and other diseases.

Severe sarcoidosis has been associated with peripheral blood (PB) total lymphopenia and high tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels, and the lymphopenia phenotype seems to respond poorly to conventional treatment. However, the mechanisms behind PB lymphopenia and its correlation with TNF-α levels remain unclear. Understanding the connections among PB lymphocyte subsets, TNF-α and clinical phenotype including treatment status could offer insights into how to individualize therapy.
40205573	The impact of insulin requirement on mortality and morbidity in non-diabetic covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit: A retrospective, observational study.	COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic cases to severe disease with high mortality. Corticosteroids are crucial in treatment, reducing mortality and morbidity. However, the use of corticosteroids poses additional challenges in maintaining glycemic control in COVID-19 patients This study aims to eva-luate the impact of insulin requirement on mortality and morbidity in non-diabetic ICU patients and investigate its correlation with disease severity.
40205572	Intimate partner violence and post-migration stressors reported by refugee women accessing settlement services.	Intimate partner violence (IPV) is highly prevalent globally, with increased risk for women in situations of conflict, post conflict and resettlement. The Safety and Health after Arrival (SAHAR) study tested IPV screening with women accessing settlement services in New South Wales, Australia, using the validated ACTS tool, along with brief response involving risk assessment, safety planning and referral. A three month follow-up telephone survey was administered to women who had attended four participating sites which delivered the intervention. The survey explored the nature of any IPV experienced, factors associated with disclosure, and responses provided to those who identified IPV. Data is reported on 316 women of whom 48 (15%) identified current IPV. For 45 women who responded to Composite Abuse Scale items, the most common forms of abuse were forced isolation from family/friends (56% 25/45), blame for abusive behaviour (53% 24/45), "put downs" (44% 20/45) and physical violence 38% (17/45). Psychological distress and post-migration stressors were significantly higher for women who disclosed IPV compared to those who did not. Length of residency in Australia and whether the screening occurred during the first or subsequent service visits, were not associated with the likelihood of disclosing IPV. The majority of women who disclosed reported the caseworker's response to be helpful and involved risk assessment, safety planning and referral. Screening and response to disclosure in settlement services provide opportunities to address abuse experienced by this group of women who are less likely to report experiences of abuse or use mainstream services.

40205569	Vector-borne pathogens in dogs from the Republic of Kosovo.	Canine vector-borne pathogens (CVBP) are transmitted by arthropod vectors such as ticks, fleas, mosquitoes, and phlebotomine sand flies and are of global veterinary and medical importance. Dogs are important reservoir hosts, which may develop potentially life-threatening clinical signs. The Balkan area harbors diverse vector fauna and associated CVBPs, and data, particularly from the Republic of Kosovo, are scarce. Considering the high number of stray and privately owned dogs primarily kept outside, living in close contact with dogs might promote spillover of zoonotic pathogens to human populations. To combat these diseases, a One Health approach is required. Therefore, our study molecularly analyzed samples of dogs for CVBP.

40205566	Targeting DKK3 to remodel tumor immune microenvironment and enhance cancer immunotherapy.	Cancer immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has made important breakthroughs in cancer treatment, however, currently only parts of cancer patients benefit from ICB therapy. The suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) impedes the treatment response of immunotherapy, indicating the necessity to explore new treatment targets. Here, we reported a new potential immunotherapeutic target, Dickkopf-3 (DKK3), for cancer treatment. DKK3 expression is up-regulated in the tumors from multiple cancer types, and high DKK3 expression is associated with worse survival outcome across different cancers. We observed that DKK3 directly inhibits the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and the Th1 differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells ex vivo. Also, by establishing four different mouse cancer models, we found that DKK3 blockade triggers effective anti-tumor effects and improve the survival of tumor-bearing mice in vivo. DKK3 blockade also remodels the suppressive TIME of different cancer types, including the increased infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Th1 cells, and decreased infiltration of M2 macrophages and MDSCs in the TIME. Moreover, we found that combined blockade of DKK3 and PD-1 induces synergistic tumor-control effect in our mouse cancer model. Therefore, our study reveals the impact of DKK3 in the TIME and cancer progression, which suggests that DKK3 is a novel and promising immunotherapeutic target for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.
40205565	Outcomes of early post-discharge cardio-geriatric care in frail patients after acute heart failure: a before-and-after study.	Despite significant advancements in heart failure (HF) management, older adults continue to face poor clinical outcomes. While an integrated, multidisciplinary approach that combines cardiology and geriatric expertise has shown considerable promise, its adoption in practice remains limited. This study aimed to assess whether an early post-discharge Cardio-Geriatric (CG) outpatient service could reduce 1-year mortality compared to usual care (UC), as well as evaluate its impact on 1-year rehospitalization rates and days alive and out of hospital (DAOH).

40205561	Study protocol for assessing the effectiveness, implementation fidelity and uptake of attachment & child health (ATTACH™) Online: helping children vulnerable to early adversity.	Exposure to early childhood adversities, such as family violence, parental depression, or low-income, undermine parent-child relationship quality and attachment leading to developmental and mental health problems in children. Addressing impacts of early childhood adversity can promote children's development, giving them the best start in life. Parental reflective function (RF), or parents' ability to understand their own and children's mental states, can strengthen parent-child relationships and attachment and buffer the negative effects of early adversity. We developed and tested ATTACH™ (Attachment and Child Health), an effective RF intervention program for parents and their preschool-aged children at-risk from early adversity. Pilot studies revealed significantly positive impacts of ATTACH™ from in-person (n = 91 observations of 64 dyads) and online (n = 10 dyads) implementation. The two objectives of this study are to evaluate: (1) effectiveness, and (2) implementation fidelity and uptake of ATTACH™ Online in community agencies serving at-risk families in Alberta, Canada. Our primary hypothesis is ATTACH™ Online improves children's development. Secondary hypotheses examine whether ATTACH™ Online improves children's mental health, parent-child relationships, and parental RF.
40205560	Erector spinae plane block versus transversus abdominis plane block with rectus sheath block for postoperative analgesia in laparoscopic hepatectomy: a randomized clinical trial.	Postoperative pain after laparoscopic hepatectomy is common and can lead to increased opioid use, delayed recovery, and complications. Although transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) with rectus sheath block (RSB) and erector spinae plane block (ESPB) have shown promise in abdominal surgeries, few comparative studies exist between the two techniques for laparoscopic hepatectomy. This study aims to compare the efficacy of bilateral ultrasound-guided ESPB versus subcostal TAPB with RSB for postoperative analgesia, addressing the gap in current research and optimizing pain management strategies for this procedure.
40205559	Significance of vertical transmission of arboviruses in mosquito-borne disease epidemiology.	Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) are increasingly prevalent due to the resultant impact of global change with significant health and economic impacts worldwide. Dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and West Nile virus (WNV) transmitted by Aedes and Culex species have been identified as arboviruses of public health interest. The vertical transmission (VT) refers to the process where infected mosquitoes transmit viruses to their offspring; this has been often overlooked in MBD epidemiology. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the role of VT in the occurrence, prevalence, and spread of MBDs, focusing on study types, mosquito species, and virus genera. In total, 73 studies from 2005 to 2024 relating to VT in the mosquito population were reviewed. Findings revealed the occurrence of VT across multiple mosquito species in natural and experimental settings, with significant variation in VT rates depending on vector species, virus genus, and study location. Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Aedes vexans, Culex pipiens, Culex tarsalis, and Culex quinquefasciatus were identified as mosquito species that support VT, while pathogens identified to be transmitted vertically were DENV, ZIKV, WNV, CHIKV, YFV, Sindbis virus (SINV), Ross River virus (RRV), and Mayaro virus (MAYV). VT rates were reported as minimum, and infection rate (MIR) varied across species, study type and location. Also, a high VT rate may precede a mosquito-borne disease outbreak. These findings indicate that VT, though often overlooked, contributes to the dynamics of MBD transmission and could influence disease outbreaks and endemism, especially under changing climatic conditions, highlighting the need for incorporating VT in mathematical models, experimental studies, and control strategies to understand dynamics of MBDs, given its potential role in sustaining arbovirus transmission and influencing outbreak dynamics.

Likewise, the predicted human dose regimen for efficacy and safety provides critical insight into clinical development planning. As such, human dose predictions are commonly generated in early stages of research and continually revisited as new data are generated through development.
40205555	Nanodiamond: a multifaceted exploration of electrospun nanofibers for antibacterial and wound healing applications.	In this review, we explore the exciting potential of nanodiamonds (NDs) as innovative materials for future wound dressings. These materials aim to tackle important issues in wound care and offer fresh solutions. While NDs show promising mechanical and structural properties, their full potential in wound healing applications is still not fully explored. We emphasize their unique features-like high surface area, the dispersion of functional groups, and excellent purity-which contribute to their mechanical stability, adhesion, growth, and movement-all critical for effective wound healing and tissue repair. We also focused on modifying the surface of these particles using various functionalization, which can enhance their biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, heat conductivity, and wettability. This positions NDs as a powerful tool for improving chronic wound care in the future. However, there are notable challenges when it comes to scaling up ND-based nanofiber matrices, which currently limits the electrospinning process for mass production. Also, issues with the physical and chemical stability of ND-based nanofibers when interacting with cells need to be resolved to guarantee long-lasting effectiveness. In this study, we tackle these challenges by suggesting solutions like surface functionalization, optimizing the electrospinning process, and creating hybrid scaffolds. Our findings show that these innovations can effectively address scalability and stability issues, paving the way for broader clinical applications. This review not only emphasizes the advantages of NDs in wound healing but also introduces new insights for enhancing the biocompatibility and functionality of ND-based nanofibers, finally pushing the technology of wound dressings forward.
40205554	Early secretory antigen target of 6-kDa of Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibits macrophage apoptosis and host defense via TLR2.	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is an intracellular pathogen adept at evading the human immune system through a variety of mechanisms. During infection, M. tb secretes numerous virulence factors, including the 6 kDa early secretory antigen target (ESAT-6), which is produced by the ESX-1 secretion system. ESAT-6 plays a crucial role in host-pathogen interactions, either independently or in association with culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10). While some research has investigated the role of ESAT-6 in M. tb pathogenicity and vaccine development, its precise contribution to immune evasion and the cellular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. To address this, we used cultured THP-1(A) macrophages to characterize the effects of secreted ESAT-6 on cellular host defenses and apoptosis. We found that ESAT-6 (5 μg/ml) inhibited M. tb-induced apoptosis in THP-1(A) macrophages by suppressing Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) through the Caspase-9/Caspase-3 pathway. Additionally, ESAT-6 reduced phagocytosis of M. tb by THP-1(A) macrophages by downregulating the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-12 (IL-12). Furthermore, ESAT-6 diminished the bactericidal activity of macrophages by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In parallel, our in silico analysis of differentially expressed genes in dendritic cells (DCs) infected with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) strains, with or without the region of difference-1 (RD1) gene, strongly suggests that ESAT-6, located within the RD1 region, modulates host defense functions and apoptosis in DCs during BCG infection. Collectively, these findings indicate that ESAT-6 plays a pivotal role in modulating the innate immune response of macrophages against M. tb by regulating macrophage recognition, phagocytosis, bactericidal activity, and apoptosis. Our study provides valuable insights into potential molecular targets for the development of innovative vaccines and therapeutic strategies against M. tb.
40205553	Cannabis smoking is associated with persistent epigenome-wide disruptions despite smoking cessation.	The use of cannabis has been associated with both therapeutic and harmful effects. As with cigarette smoking, cannabis smoking may affect the epigenetic regulation (e.g., DNA methylation) of gene expression which could result in long term health effects. The study of DNA methylation in cannabis smoking has to date been restricted to young adults and there remains yet no evaluation of whether cannabis smoking cessation can reverse epigenetic disturbances. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship between genome-wide DNA methylation and cannabis smoking.

40205544	Maize associated bacterial and fungal microbiomes show contrasting conformation patterns dependent on plant compartment and water availability.	Plant-associated microorganisms can help crops to alleviate stress and increase the resilience of agricultural ecosystems to climate change. However, we still lack knowledge on the dynamics of soil and plant microbiomes and their response to changing conditions. This information is essential for the development of microbiome-based solutions to improve crop resilience to stressors associated with climate change. In this work, we explored: (i) the conformation of the bacterial and fungal assemblages of different soil and plant compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere, roots, leaves and grains) along the crop cycle of maize in an open field trial; and (ii) the effect of water restriction on the maize microbiome, comparing optimal irrigation with a 30% reduction of water supply. Our results show a dynamic compartment-driven recruitment of microorganisms with contrasting patterns for bacteria and fungi that were intensified towards the end of the plant cycle. Roots showed the most differentiated bacterial assemblage while fungi conformed a very distinct community in the leaves, suggesting a relevant contribution of aerial fungal propagules to the microbiome of this plant organ. Regarding the grain, bacterial communities looked closer to those in the leaves, while fungal communities were more like those in the root. Despite the reductions in plant growth and yield, the microbiome of limited-watered plants did not show severe alterations. Still, significant impacts were observed within compartments, being fungi more responsive to limited watering than bacteria, with hallmark fungal ASVs for each compartment and irrigation regime. Network analysis suggests that bacteria and fungi may play different roles in the shifts observed under water limitation. Our study highlights the importance of conducting multikingdom analyses for a holistic understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the microbial assemblages in the whole plant and their roles in plant response to environmental stressors.
40205543	Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the treatment of critical Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in a child with Langerhans cell histiocytosis: a case report and literature review.	Children with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) are particularly susceptible to infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) due to the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. The use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) to manage hypoxemia secondary to PJP in LCH presents unique challenges, including the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections associated with arterial and venous access. This study explores a case wherein ECMO was crucial in treating severe PJP-induced respiratory failure in a pediatric patient with LCH.

40205530	Root system morphoanatomy of sunflower genotypes under water deficit.	Sunflower is classified as a moderately drought tolerant crop. Genotypic variations and water availability are factors that influence the root development of the crop, which is important for water absorption in deep regions of the soil. Therefore, tests in controlled water deficit environments allow evaluating a set of morphoanatomical characteristics of the root system that attribute tolerance to water deficit, contributing to sunflower genetic improvement programs. The objective of this study was to identify a set of root morphoanatomical characteristics of four sunflower genotypes subjected to controlled water deficit. We tested four commercial sunflower genotypes (OLISUN03, AGUARÁ06, HELIO250 and BRS323) under well-irrigated (field capacity) and water restriction (40% of field capacity) conditions, completely randomized design with six replicates was applied, grown in rhizotron pot, allowing to evaluate root development through imaging and anatomical characteristics related to water absorption in different regions of the sunflower root system. Plants under water deficit showed changes that contributed to water absorption in different positions of root development. Under water deficit, the tissue differentiation occurred first near the root apex, while at field capacity differentiation occurred close to the root base. In the condition of water deficit, it was verified narrow root system architecture (RSA) for the genotype OLISUN03, deep RSA for BRS323, reduced endoderm thickness in OLISUN03 and vascular cylinder area in AGUARÁ06. In general, water deficit promoted changes in the morphological and anatomical characteristics of the root system. Morphological and anatomical modifications of the root system contribute to the anchoring and absorption of water and nutrients in places with little water availability in the soil.
40205529	Inhibition of quorum sensing related virulence factor production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 by Naringenin.	The P. aeruginosa, widely spread and highly detrimental nosocomial pathogen, exhibits extensive intrinsic and acquired antibiotics resistance. Naringenin, a flavonoid compound, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities, especially in inhibiting the growth of many pathogenic bacteria. Our study revealed that naringenin showed significant inhibition on the virulence factors of P. aeruginosa at non bactericidal concentrations. At the concentration of 200 μg·mL-1, naringenin inhibited the swarming and swimming motility of P. aeruginosa, reduced pyocyanin secretion, and flagella assembly. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiment was conducted, and the results showed that naringenin could reduce the expression of bacterial virulence factors related to P. aeruginosa. Naringenin inhibited bacterial adherence capability to cells in vitro. The larvae of Galleria mellonella showed a higher survival rate in treatment with naringenin in vivo. These findings suggested a promising role of naringenin in suppressing the virulence of P. aeruginosa, which encompasses the growth inhibition of various pathogenic bacteria. This indicates substantial potential for future therapeutic interventions targeting bacterial virulence.
40205528	Particle-size dependent of bacterial diversity associated with Suspended particulate matter continuum in Lake Taihu.	Suspended particulate matter (SPM) of varying particle sizes is widespread in aquatic ecosystems, providing crucial habitats for bacteria and serving as hotspots for mineralization and nutrient cycling. However, prior studies have typically treated bacteria associated with these particulates as a homogeneous group, overlooking size-related differences in diversity and composition. In this study, we separated the SPM continuum into five size-fractions (0.2 μm, 2 μm, 20 μm, 200 μm, and 500 μm) and investigated bacterial diversity, community assembly, and environmental drivers across four representative regions of Lake Taihu, China, over one-year period. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we observed particle-size-dependent variations in bacterial diversity. Alpha diversity decreased significantly with increasing particle size, while beta diversity showed a similar trend. Environmental factors influencing species richness varied by particle size, while bacteria associated with smaller particles (0.2 μm, 2 μm, and 20 μm) were more sensitive to environmental factors compared to those associated with larger ones (200 μm, 500 μm). The role of deterministic processes in community assembly increased with particle size, indicating stronger selection on larger particles. This study enhances our understanding of bacterial diversity in aquatic ecosystems and highlights the importance of particle size in bacterial community dynamics.

While existing studies conducted in South Asian countries have provided valuable insights into the nutritional status of the marginalized third-gender population and highlighted suboptimal nutritional conditions, regrettably such data is lacking in Bangladesh. Addressing this data gap is crucial to understanding and improving the nutritional condition of the third-gender community. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate their nutritional status, dietary protein intake, lifestyle, social behavior, nutritional knowledge, and prevalence of diseases.
40205526	The incidence of cerebral edema in pediatric patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a retrospective study.	Cerebral edema is a severe and potentially fatal complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), particularly in pediatric patients. Despite its clinical significance, limited data exist on its incidence and associated risk factors in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to determine the incidence of cerebral edema in pediatric patients with DKA and investigate potential contributing factors. This retrospective study analyzed data from 270 pediatric DKA patients admitted to the Children's Medical Center Hospital, Tehran, between March 2018 and March 2020. Patients aged 1 day to 18 years were included based on standard DKA diagnostic criteria (blood glucose > 250 mg/dL, pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 18 mEq/L, and ketonemia/ketonuria). Patients with incomplete records or pre-existing neurological conditions were excluded. The statistical analyses included independent t-tests and Fisher's exact tests.

Inhalation therapy is recommended by the World Health Organization as the first-line treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its rapid onset of action, good safety profile, ease of use, and portability. High medication adherence in COPD patients is crucial for enhancing disease management. The aim of this study was to assess the level of disease control, adherence to inhaled medication therapy, and potential factors influencing treatment adherence among COPD patients.
40205524	Improving Risk Assessment of Land-Applied Biosolids with Probabilistic Approaches.	Land application of municipal and industrial wastewater biosolids for use as a fertilizer or soil conditioner is a common practice in the United States. Regulations are in place to reduce pathogens, minimize disease vectors, and limit concentrations of nutrients and some metals, but extensive assessment of the risk of biosolids-associated chemicals to human health and environmental systems is uncommon. Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency developed the Biosolids Tool (BST) to facilitate more comprehensive chemical risk assessment of land-applied biosolids based on a deterministic approach that utilizes conservative model inputs without regard for the variability and uncertainty inherent in environmental exposures. Management decisions based on probabilistic risk assessment (PRA), in which variability and uncertainty are quantified and risk is linked to specific population segments, may provide a more accurate understanding of risk. We examined the sediment risk assessment literature and explored the application of probabilistic model inputs within the BST to better understand how deterministic (DRA) and probabilistic (PRA) risk assessment methods compare for characterizing risk. The BST model results for noncancer and cancer risk outcomes associated with total ingestion of aluminum and benzo(a)pyrene in biosolids applied to pastureland for an adult and child indicated that PRA provides a more nuanced understanding of risk than the traditionally used deterministic approach. Receptor-specific risk patterns, model sensitivity, and risk drivers are discussed. Findings underscore the need for incorporating probabilistic methods into regulatory frameworks to improve the accuracy and reliability of risk assessments for biosolids land application.

40205522	A Critical View of Antimicrobial Peptides: Exploring their Potential and the Barriers to Realisation.	The global rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections highlights the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies beyond traditional antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), naturally occurring in all forms of life and synthetically producible, have garnered significant attention for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and diverse mechanisms of action, including membrane disruption, immune modulation, and biofilm formation inhibition and disruption. Despite great potential, the clinical deployment of AMPs faces significant challenges, including cytotoxicity, low chemical stability, high production costs, and stringent regulatory demands. Innovative strategies, such as AMP-antibiotic conjugation, offer potential solutions to some of these challenges by enhancing efficacy, reducing toxicity, and broadening antimicrobial activity. This review critically evaluates the promise and limitations of AMPs as therapeutic antibacterial agents. We also explore the potential of AMP-antibiotic conjugates, highlighting their potential synergistic effects and the obstacles to their clinical application. Antimicrobial self-assembling peptides are also discussed, with their ability to form nanostructures that may disrupt biofilms and inhibit bacterial communication, representing a promising but complex avenue. A critical perspective on the challenges and practical applicability of these strategies is essential to advance their development in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.

40205519	Multimodal sequencing of neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma reveals cellular and molecular immune landscape for drug response.	A striking characteristic of liver cancer is its extensive heterogeneity, particularly with regard to its varied response to immunotherapy. In this study, we employed multimodal sequencing approaches to explore the various aspects of neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment in liver cancer patients. We used spatially-resolved transcriptomics, single- and bulk-cell transcriptomics, and TCR clonotype analyses to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the effects of nivolumab. We observed a significantly higher clonal expansion of T cells in the tumors of patients who responded to the treatment, while lipid accumulation was detected in those of non-responders, likely due to inherent differences in lipid metabolic processes. Furthermore, we found a preferential enrichment of T cells, which was associated with a better drug response. Our results also indicate a functional antagonism between tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and CD8 cells and their spatial separation. Notably, we identified a UBASH3B/NR1I2/CEACAM1/HAVCR2 signaling axis, highlighting the intense communication among TAMs, tumor cells, and T-cells that leads to pro-tumorigenic outcomes resulting in poorer nivolumab response. In summary, using integrative multimodal sequencing investigations, combined with the multi-faceted exploration of pre- and post-treatment samples of neoadjuvant nivolumab-treated HCC patients, we identified useful mechanistic determinants of therapeutic response. We also reconstructed the spatiotemporal model that recapitulates the physiological restoration of T cell cytotoxicity by anti-PD1 blockade. Our findings could provide important biomarkers and explain the mechanistic basis differentiating the responders and non-responders.
40205518	Semantic-consistent diffusion model for unsupervised traumatic brain injury detection and segmentation from computed tomography images.	Unsupervised traumatic brain injury (TBI) lesion detection aims to identify and segment abnormal regions, such as cerebral edema and hemorrhages, using only healthy training data. Recent advancements in generative models have achieved success in unsupervised anomaly detection by transforming abnormal patterns into normal counterparts. However, current mask-free image generators often fail to maintain semantic consistency of anatomical structures during the restoration process. This limitation negatively impacts residual-based anomaly detection, particularly in cases where structural deformations occur due to the mass effect of TBI lesions.

40205512	Exploring the role of virtual reality in preparing emergency responders for mass casualty incidents.	The increasing complexity of mass casualty incidents (MCIs) necessitates highly effective training for emergency responders. Traditional training methods, while effective in teaching core skills, often fail to replicate the dynamic, high-pressure environments responders face in real-world crises. Virtual reality (VR) offers a novel approach to emergency training, providing an immersive, controlled setting that can simulate real-life scenarios. This study explores the effectiveness of VR in training paramedic students for MCIs and compares the outcomes to those from conventional training methods.

40205510	Intracellular electron donor stripping to identify electron donors of indigo reduction.	The identification of the electron donor of a reduction reaction is one of most important points for revealing the reaction mechanism and the enzyme involved. In some cases, it is difficult to identify the electron donor because microbial cells have sufficient quantities of electron donors in the cells. In this study, we found that potassium hexacyanoferrate (Ⅲ) is a good stripping chemical compound of intracellular electron donors. Ethanol and glucose clearly enhanced the indigo-reducing activity of the microbial cells after stripping. This supports our previous proposal that acetaldehyde is an electron donor for the reduction of methyl viologen as representative of indigo. We constructed the stripping of intracellular electron donors for the first time as a useful technique for identifying the electron donor of a reduction reaction when microorganisms have sufficient electron donors in their cells.

40205508	Involving young people in research investigating comorbidity associated with childhood-onset rheumatic disease: perspectives of a series of focus groups.	Childhood-onset rheumatic diseases, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, juvenile-onset lupus and juvenile dermatomyositis, appear to be associated with an increased risk of comorbidities in adulthood compared to the general population. For the first stage of a research project evaluating this topic, we wanted to capture views from young people with juvenile-onset rheumatic disease to ensure that further work was relevant to their lived experience and priorities. This study aimed to determine (i) which comorbidities young people identify as important, (ii) how they access information about their disease, including comorbidity risk, whether (iii) they would like to hear about the risk of comorbidities whilst they are under paediatric care, and (iv) would be motivated to make lifestyle choices to decrease the risk of potential comorbidities.

The objective of this research was to investigate the persistence of this relationship among diabetic patients.
40205506	Granulosa cell-specific FOXJ2 overexpression induces premature ovarian insufficiency by triggering apoptosis via mitochondrial calcium overload.	Follicle development is a complicated biological process that produces mature oocytes, and requires nutrients, growth factors, and steroids produced by ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). High fork head box J2 (FOXJ2) expression might negatively regulate ovarian function; however, the mechanism is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of FOXJ2 overexpression in GCs on regulating follicle development and fertility.
40205505	T2-weighted MRI high signal in cervical spondylotic myelopathy is associated with dynamic change.	The cervical spine's mobility affects the compression level of the cervical cord which varies with dynamic positioning. High signal on MRI T2-weight imaging (MRI-T2WI) of the cervical cord indicates a poorer prognosis. This study investigates the relationship between high-signal intensity on MRI-T2WI and cervical dynamic change using kinematic MRI. The objective of this study was to explore changes in the degree of cervical spinal cord compression during flexion-extension motions and identify risk factors linked to the occurrence of high signals.
40205504	USP21 is involved in the development of chronic hepatitis B by modulating the immune microenvironment.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health challenge that alters the immune microenvironment of the liver and drives disease progression by triggering chronic inflammation that leads to hepatic cell death through multiple programmed cell death (PCD) modalities. Due to the persistence of covalently closed circular DNA in hepatocytes, there is a lack of curative drugs that can completely eradicate HBV. Therefore, revealing how HBV infection leads to changes in the hepatic immune microenvironment, as well as searching for specific molecular targets, is crucial for controlling the onset and progression of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this study, we used the single sample gene set enrichment analysis and CIBERSORT algorithms to assess immune cell infiltration in the livers of CHB patients. With three advanced machine learning algorithms, random forest, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and selected support vector machine recursive feature elimination, we identified the PCD signature genes associated with CHB from the candidate genes. We further validated that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 21 could differentiate CHB patients with different natural courses by receiver operating characteristic analysis. These findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of HBV infection.
40205502	Mechanisms of change in a gender-sensitized health intervention: the mediating role of health self-efficacy.	Men's lower life expectancy has been in part attributed to adherence to masculine stereotypes restricting health promoting behaviors. Health-specific self-efficacy beliefs are theorised to contribute to these outcomes and recent research suggests addressing the link between masculinity and these beliefs is a key pathway to men's health promotion. Gender-sensitised health interventions show promise for helping men overcome health barriers as the "safe space" provides opportunity to broaden perspectives of masculinity, contributing to increases in health self-efficacy, which then mediates improved health outcomes. This study aimed to address gaps in previous research by examining this mechanism of gender-sensitised health promotion longitudinally in an intervention context.
40205501	Maximizing horizontal transmission through mating: increased mating frequency and mating competitiveness associated with Microsporidia MB-infected Anopheles arabiensis males.	Microsporidia MB is a naturally occurring symbiont in Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes that inhibits the development of Plasmodium. It is transmitted both vertically and horizontally, enabling its spread within mosquito populations. Currently, mating is the only known mechanism for horizontal transmission. Understanding the factors that influence Microsporidia MB transmission during mating is crucial for developing a malaria transmission-blocking strategy based on this symbiont.
40205500	The effect of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug on the locomotor activity of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) on their natural pastures after clamp castration-a pilot study.	During seasonal round-ups, free-grazing reindeer are gathered from natural pastures. Reindeer bulls removed from breeding are clamp castrated, traditionally without analgesia, and then returned to the grazing grounds. The new Finnish Animal Welfare Act requires the use of analgesia in painful procedures. Our earlier studies have shown that a single dose of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) meloxicam may maintain therapeutic plasma concentrations for 2-3 days in reindeer. No studies have been conducted on the effect of meloxicam on the locomotor activity of free-ranging castrated reindeer after castration. We installed GPS collars on 16 male reindeer (at least 5 years old, 130-160 kg), chosen to be castrated as a standard procedure during the round-up held on 5 Oct 2020. Of these, eight were randomly selected to receive approximately 0.5 mg/kg of meloxicam subcutaneously (NSAID group) and eight received no analgesia (TRAD group). The trackers were set to provide location twice per hour with 10 m accuracy. From the GPS data, we calculated the daily distances travelled by the reindeer during the 3 days after castration and analysed the differences between the treatments using a GEE model. Fixed factors were treatment (NSAID or TRAD), days (1-3) and hours, and the interactions between these variables. Our key presumption was that a meloxicam injection can reduce the pain related restless locomotion of newly clamp castrated reindeer.
40205499	Electroacupuncture modulates the gut-brain axis via the PI3K/Akt pathway to improve feeding behavior, body weight, glucolipid metabolism, and reduce insulin resistance in T2DM rats.

The research aims to reveal the mechanisms underlying EA's therapeutic effects and to investigate a novel strategy for managing T2DM.
40205498	Fluorescent probes in autoimmune disease research: current status and future prospects.	Autoimmune diseases (AD) present substantial challenges for early diagnosis and precise treatment due to their intricate pathogenesis and varied clinical manifestations. While existing diagnostic methods and treatment strategies have advanced, their sensitivity, specificity, and real-time applicability in clinical settings continue to exhibit significant limitations. In recent years, fluorescent probes have emerged as highly sensitive and specific biological imaging tools, demonstrating substantial potential in AD research.This review examines the response mechanisms and historical evolution of various types of fluorescent probes, systematically summarizing the latest research advancements in their application to autoimmune diseases.

40205494	Antioxidant capacities and in vitro anti-microbial activities of rice (Oryza sativa var Bajong) from Borneo.	Rice contains antioxidants and phenolic components that exert anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. Different geographical areas produce rice with various chemical constituents and phytochemicals, in turn these confer differential protective effects including antimicrobial and anticancer properties. Sarawak rice, Oryza sativa var Bajong (Bajong), a fragrant dark purple rice grain harvested from two locations in Sarawak, namely interior Lubok Nibong (LN) and coastal Sri Aman (SA), was assessed for their antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activities. The rice was extracted using methanol solvent and evaluated for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid contents (TFC), as well as their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities based on the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, the aluminium calorimetric method, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity and disk diffusion assay, respectively. Using dual-wavelength measurement, Bajong LN showed 2.16% higher amylose content than Bajong SA. Furthermore, 24-h extract of Bajong LN and 48-h extract of Bajong SA exhibited high antioxidant properties (34-70 µg/mL) and were rich in phenolic (46.54 ± 2.62 mg GAE/g; 25.28 ± 3.91 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid contents (5.53 ± 0.36 mg QCE/g; 7.7 ± 2.19 mg QCE/g) respectively. It is interesting to note that 72-h Bajong extract exhibited the largest zone of inhibition (9-9.3 mm) against Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ps. aeruginosa), which correlated to the high TPC and TFC despite a reduction of antioxidant activity due to prolonged extraction hours. These significant results conferred added value to a staple, health-promoting Bajong had warranted it to be further investigated as a nutraceutical and pharmaceutical crop.
40205493	Monitoring patients with acute respiratory failure during non-invasive respiratory support to minimize harm and identify treatment failure.	Non-invasive respiratory support (NRS), including high flow nasal oxygen therapy, continuous positive airway pressure and non-invasive ventilation, is a cornerstone in the management of critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory failure (ARF). Overall, NRS reduces the work of breathing and relieves dyspnea in many patients with ARF, sometimes avoiding the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation with variable efficacy across diverse clinical scenarios. Nonetheless, prolonged exposure to NRS in the presence of sustained high respiratory drive and effort can result in respiratory muscle fatigue, cardiovascular collapse, and impaired oxygen delivery to vital organs, leading to poor outcomes in patients who ultimately fail NRS and require intubation. Assessment of patients' baseline characteristics before starting NRS, close physiological monitoring to evaluate patients' response to respiratory support, adjustment of device settings and interface, and, most importantly, early identification of failure or of paramount importance to avoid the negative consequences of delayed intubation. This review highlights the role of respiratory monitoring across various modalities of NRS in patients with ARF including dyspnea, general respiratory parameters, measures of drive and effort, and lung imaging. It includes technical specificities related to the target population and emphasizes the importance of clinicians' physiological understanding and tailoring clinical decisions to individual patients' needs.
40205492	The use of statins are associated with an increased risk of new-onset diabetes in patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea, a longitudinal study.	Statins, a kind of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, are first-line cholesterol-lowering drugs that are widely used in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD). However, the safety of statins has been in the spotlight as recent studies have shown that statins may increase the incidence of diabetes. Therefore, we conducted a study of statins use and new-onset diabetes(NODM) in people with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to better understand the relationship and to provide guidance for future clinical management.
40205491	Addressing the associative stigma of psychiatry and psychiatrists: a survey on the attitudes of medical and nursing students and doctors in Verona, Italy.	Negative societal attitudes toward mental health often contribute to misconceptions and stereotypes about psychiatry, a phenomenon known as "associative stigma". This stigma can hinder collaboration between psychiatrists and other specialists and deter students from pursuing psychiatry as a career. This study focused on one of the three main components of stigma by examining attitudes toward psychiatry and psychiatrists among medical and nursing students, as well as doctors, and identifying factors that influence these attitudes.
40205489	Hydrogeological and geological partitioning of iron and sulfur cycling bacterial consortia in subsurface coal-based mine waters.	Pyrite oxidation drives iron and sulfur availability across Earth's subsurface and is partly microbially mediated. Subsurface microbial communities accelerate this process at circumneutral pH directly by weathering pyritic surfaces and indirectly by causing changes to the surrounding microenvironment thereby further accelerating pyrite weathering. However, our understanding of community structure dynamics and associated biogeochemistry in Fe- and S-rich lithologies, e.g. pyritic coal, is limited. Here we present the first comprehensive regional and seasonal genus-level survey of bacterial groundwater communities in a pyritic coal-based aquifer in the South Wales Coalfield (SWC), using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Seasonal changes in community structure were limited, suggesting limited influence of surface processes on subsurface communities. Instead, hydrogeologically distinct mine water blocks (MWB) and coal rank largely explained bacterial community structure variation across sites. Fe(II)-oxidising Betaproteobacteriales genera Gallionella and Sideroxydans dominated the bacterial communities across nine sites and seven MWBs, while three sites within a single MWB, were dominated by S-oxidising Epsilonbacteraeota genera Sulfuricurvum and Sulfurovum. The co-occurrence of pairs of Fe(II)- and S-oxidising bacterial genera suggests functional redundancy, which coupled with genus-specific morphologies and life strategies, indicates the importance of distinct environmental and ecological niches within the SWC groundwater at seasonal and regional scales.
40205488	Modified diatom-based ocular suspension for sustained diclofenac sodium delivery: a novel drug carrier approach.	Ophthalmic drugs typically last only around 15 minutes due to rapid elimination from tear flow, with only about 2% absorption, while the rest may enter the nasal mucosa, potentially causing systemic side effects. Diatoms, with properties like unique structure, abundance, low cost, heat resistance, non-toxicity, and easy access, present a promising solution for sustained drug delivery. This study aimed to prepare and evaluate an ocular suspension of diclofenac sodium loaded onto modified diatoms.
40205487	Polyphenols and post-exercise muscle damage: a comprehensive review of literature.	Recent research highlights the significant role of polyphenols in alleviating post-exercise muscle damage, thus positioning them as a valuable nutritional strategy for athletes and fitness enthusiasts. Polyphenols, naturally occurring bioactive compounds abundant in fruits, vegetables, tea, wine, and other plant-based foods, are recognized for their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This dual mechanism is critical for combating oxidative stress and inflammation-two factors that intensify during vigorous physical activity and contribute to muscle soreness and damage. Among various polyphenols, compounds like quercetin have particularly emerged as effective agents for promoting muscle recovery and enhancing exercise performance. These protective effects are facilitated through several mechanisms, including the modulation of inflammatory pathways, acceleration of muscle repair processes, and enhancement of mitochondrial function, all of which bolster overall muscle health. As ongoing studies yield deeper insights, the potential of polyphenols to enhance athletic performance and overall health will become increasingly substantiated, leading towards their strategic incorporation into exercise nutrition protocols. Therefore, we reviewed relevant studies in order to show how efficient polyphenols can be in reducing muscle fatigue and damage and what are the exact mechanisms.
40205486	Innovative diagnostic framework for shoulder instability: a narrative review on machine learning-enhanced scapular dyskinesis assessment in sports injuries.	A common shoulder problem that significantly detracts from patients' quality of life is shoulder instability (SI). Abnormal scapular positioning and movement are closely associated with rotator cuff injuries and SI, as shown by several studies. The aetiology of scapular dyskinesia (SD) adversely affects shoulder stability and function, including postural abnormalities, musculoskeletal problems, and neurological conditions. Presently, there is a paucity of studies on scapular kinetic alterations in SI rehabilitation. This paper rigorously examines the correlation between SI and scapular kinetic irregularities, as well as the functional alterations of periscapular muscle groups, offering a thorough theoretical foundation and practical guidance for clinicians to enhance their understanding of the disease mechanism and develop a more holistic and effective treatment for patients with SI. We examined the particular manifestations of scapular kinetic disorders in SI patients, evaluated current clinical assessment tools, and explored novel strategies (machine learning, kinetic chain, and scapular biomechanics) for prospective clinical applications. Our objective is to furnish a thorough theoretical foundation and practical guidance for rehabilitating patients with SI, thereby enhancing clinicians' comprehension of the disease mechanism and enabling the development of more effective rehabilitation programs.
40205485	ELK4 induced upregulation of HOMER3 promotes the proliferation and metastasis in glioma via Wnt/β-catenin/EMT signaling pathway.	Glioma is an aggressive brain tumor characterized by its high invasiveness, which complicates prognosis and contributes to patient resistance against various treatment options. The HOMER family, consisting of HOMER1, HOMER2, and HOMER3, has been implicated in various cancers, yet their specific roles in glioma remain inadequately understood. This study conducted a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis to evaluate the expression profiles of HOMER family members across different tumor types, utilizing data from public databases such as TCGA and GTEx. Our findings indicate significant dysregulation of HOMER1, HOMER2, and HOMER3 in multiple cancers, with HOMER3 emerging as a potential prognostic biomarker, particularly for lower-grade glioma. Elevated expression levels of HOMER3 were associated with shorter overall survival and disease-specific survival in LGG patients, supported by Cox regression analysis that confirmed HOMER3 as an independent prognostic factor. Furthermore, HOMER3 expression correlated positively with advanced clinical stages and key tumor markers. To elucidate the mechanisms behind HOMER3 dysregulation, we identified ELK4 as a transcription factor that binds to the HOMER3 promoter, promoting its expression in glioma cells. Functional assays demonstrated that silencing HOMER3 significantly reduced glioma cell proliferation and metastatic potential in vitro and in vivo, highlighting its oncogenic role. Additionally, HOMER3 was found to influence the Wnt/β-catenin/EMT signaling pathway, with knockdown resulting in altered expression of critical EMT markers. Collectively, our results indicated that HOMER3 plays a crucial role in glioma progression and metastasis, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in glioma management.

40205474	The impact of obstructive sleep apnea on early surgical site infections in elderly PLIF patients: a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis.	Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep disorder associated with intermittent hypoxia, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation, posing risks for adverse postoperative outcomes, including surgical site infections (SSIs). Elderly patients undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) are particularly susceptible to SSIs due to advanced age, comorbidities, and prolonged surgical times. However, the role of OSA in increasing SSI risk among this population remains unclear.
40205473	Running against the clock: Exploring microbial diversity in an extremely endangered microbial oasis in the Chihuahuan Desert.	The Cuatro Ciénegas Basin is a biodiversity hotspot known for its unique biodiversity. However, this ecosystem is facing severe anthropogenic threats that are drying its aquatic systems. We investigated microbial communities at three sites with different physicochemical and environmental characteristics (Pozas Rojas, Archean Domes, and the Churince system) within the basin to explore potential connections to deep aquifers and determine if the sites shared microorganisms. Utilizing 16S rRNA gene data, we identified a core microbiota between Pozas Rojas and Archean Domes. Sulfur reduction appears to shape the microbial connectivity among sites, since sulfur-reducing bacteria has the highest prevalence between samples from Pozas Rojas and Archean Domes: Halanaerobium sp. (88.46%) and Desulfovermiculus halophilus (65%); and between the Churince system and Archean Domes: Halanaerobium sp. (63%) and Desulfovermiculus halophilus (60%). Furthermore, metagenome assembled genomes from Ectothiorhodospira genus were found in both Archean Domes and Churince, suggesting microbial dispersal. An important finding is that microbial diversity in the Archean Domes system declined, from 2016 to 2023 the ecosystem lost 29 microbial phyla. If this trend continues, the basin will lose most of its water, resulting in the loss of various prokaryotic lineages and potential biotechnological solutions, such as enzymes or novel antibiotics. Our findings highlighting the need for water extraction regulations to preserve the basin's biodiversity.
40205472	Systematic review of AI/ML applications in multi-domain robotic rehabilitation: trends, gaps, and future directions.	Robotic technology is expected to transform rehabilitation settings, by providing precise, repetitive, and task-specific interventions, thereby potentially improving patients' clinical outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been widely applied in different areas to support robotic rehabilitation, from controlling robot movements to real-time patient assessment. To provide an overview of the current landscape and the impact of AI/ML use in robotics rehabilitation, we performed a systematic review focusing on the use of AI and robotics in rehabilitation from a broad perspective, encompassing different pathologies and body districts, and considering both motor and neurocognitive rehabilitation. We searched the Scopus and IEEE Xplore databases, focusing on the studies involving human participants. After article retrieval, a tagging phase was carried out to devise a comprehensive and easily-interpretable taxonomy: its categories include the aim of the AI/ML within the rehabilitation system, the type of algorithms used, and the location of robots and sensors. The 201 selected articles span multiple domains and diverse aims, such as movement classification, trajectory prediction, and patient evaluation, demonstrating the potential of ML to revolutionize personalized therapy and improve patient engagement. ML is reported as highly effective in predicting movement intentions, assessing clinical outcomes, and detecting compensatory movements, providing insights into the future of personalized rehabilitation interventions. Our analysis also reveals pitfalls in the current use of AI/ML in this area, such as potential explainability issues and poor generalization ability when these systems are applied in real-world settings.

40205465	Influence of race, ethnicity, and sex on the performance of epigenetic predictors of phenotypic traits.	DNA methylation-based predictors of phenotypic traits including leukocyte proportions, smoking activity, biological aging, and circulating levels of plasma proteins are widely used as biomarkers in public health research. However, limited racial and ethnic diversity of research participants is an ongoing issue for epigenetics research, and the potential downstream impacts of limited diversity in training samples on the performance of epigenetic predictors remains poorly understood. We examined the performance of epigenetic predictors of chronological age (also known as epigenetic clocks), telomere length, cell proportions, and plasma proteins within a diverse sample of adult NHANES participants during the 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 survey cycles, both overall and stratified by self-reported race/ethnicity and sex. We utilized correlation coefficients and median absolute errors (MAE) to judge predictor performance, and bootstrapping and multivariate regression to assess the significance of differences between groups.

40205463	Cabazitaxel-induced ureteritis in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: a single center case series 2014-2024.	One of the main and effective therapy choices for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is cabazitaxel (CBZ). Cystitis and hematuria are among the most significant non-hematological adverse events associated with CBZ treatment. But because the prevalence of CBZ-induced ureteritis has not been thoroughly studied, this case series investigation was carried out to emphasize the condition's clinical relevance and potential treatment alternatives.
40205462	Efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma combined with core decompression and enhanced bone grafting versus core decompression with enhanced bone grafting alone in treating femoral head necrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	The efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) combined with core decompression (CD)-enhanced bone grafting for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head remains controversial. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of PRP combined with CD-enhanced bone grafting for treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head and to compare this method with CD-combined bone grafting as a way to provide theoretical bases for future clinical treatments and research.
40205461	Synthesis and in silico studies of quinoline appended acridine via conventional and green methods: photophysical analysis of novel fluorophore for picric acid detection using a 'turn-off' fluorescence approach.	A series of novel 4-(9-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridin-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-ones and their dimers were synthesized using an efficient one-pot method with Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), alongside microwave-assisted and conventional techniques. Using less toxic and inexpensive DESs enhance sustainability in producing desired products. Green metrics calculations indicate a high level of greenness in the synthesis process. FT-IR, NMR, and HRMS characterized the compounds. In-silico tests involving Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) assessed the binding affinity of the compounds toward various drugs. Furthermore, DFT studies explored theoretical spectral calculations, energy differences, and electron cloud density. Notably, among the derivatives, the fluorophore 4-(7-amino-9-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridin-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one (3e) can specifically detect 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (Picric acid, PA), a fatal nitro explosive. Photophysical studies confirmed 3e's ability as a "turn-off" fluorescence chemosensor for PA with a detection limit of 1.766 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M and a binding stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 between the probe and analyte. Structural confirmation of the probe was achieved through single-crystal XRD.
40205460	Importance of future motivation for skill acquisition among medical students undergoing endoscopic forceps training.	In recent years, surgical procedures have shifted from open thoracotomy and laparotomy to minimally invasive endoscopic surgery, making endoscopic forceps training essential. In our department, we teach endoscopic forceps training to medical students in dry laboratories. We examined differences in the skill acquisition of medical students undergoing endoscopic forceps training.
40205459	Biopolymer-based bone scaffold for controlled Pt (IV) prodrug release and synergistic photothermal-chemotherapy and immunotherapy in osteosarcoma.	Achieving bone defect repair while preventing tumor recurrence after osteosarcoma surgery has consistently posed a clinical challenge. Local treatment with 3D-printed scaffolds loaded with chemotherapeutic drugs can exert certain effects in tumor inhibition and bone regeneration. However, the non-specific activation of chemotherapeutic drugs leads to high local toxic side effects and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby limiting their clinical application and therapeutic efficacy. To address this, we designed a Pt (IV) prodrug with low toxicity and minimal side effects, which releases Pt (II) in response to glutathione. This prodrug was grafted onto polydopamine (PDA) through an amidation reaction, resulting in a composite nanomaterial (PDA@Pt) that possesses both photothermal synergistic chemotherapy and immuno-oncological properties. Subsequently, we innovatively employed selective laser sintering technology to incorporate PDA@Pt into a poly (L-lactic acid)/bioactive glass matrix, successfully constructing a composite scaffold with dual anti-tumor and bone repair capabilities. The study revealed that the composite scaffold significantly inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma cells and activated the cGAS-STING pathway by inducing DNA damage, ultimately converting the 'cold tumor' into a 'hot tumor.' Additionally, the composite scaffold could induce osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and exhibited excellent bone repair capabilities in vivo.
40205458	Geographic equity in essential newborn care practices in Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.	Essential newborn care is a set of measures every newborn baby needs, regardless of its birthplace. Geographic equity in essential newborn care refers to the fairness of access to newborn care across different regions. These practices vary across different social groups, but evidence on the geographic equity of newborn care in Ethiopia is scarce. We aimed to assess the geographic distribution and equity of selected essential newborn care practices (initial skin-to-skin care, delayed bathing, proper cord care, timely breastfeeding initiation, and immunizations of BCG and first-dose polio vaccines) recommended by the World Health Organization among neonates born at health facilities and homes in Ethiopia.

40205455	The Design and Rationale of the Biomarkers for Evaluating Spine Treatments (BEST) Trial: A Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial.	Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a common condition that impacts quality of life and function. There are many evidence-based treatments to address cLBP; however, treatment effects are modest, perhaps in part due to individual variation in treatment response. The Biomarkers for Evaluating Spine Treatments (BEST) Trial was designed as the collaborative centerpiece of the Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) research program. This consortium was sponsored by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) as part of the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative.
40205454	High matrix stiffness promotes senescence of type II alveolar epithelial cells by lysosomal degradation of lamin A/C in pulmonary fibrosis.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular senescence in pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear.
40205452	Combined effect of skeletal muscle mass loss and elevated insulin resistance on heart failure risk in older adults: a community-based longitudinal cohort study.	Skeletal muscle mass loss and insulin resistance (IR) are associated with cardiovascular diseases risk. However, it remains unclear whether the combination of skeletal muscle mass loss and elevated IR affects heart failure (HF) risk. Here, we investigate the association between a combination of appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) with estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) and HF risk in older adults.
40205451	Cross-sectional examination of characteristics of higher-dose buprenorphine prescriptions during the era of illicit fentanyl.	In response to greater illicit fentanyl use, buprenorphine daily doses exceeding the FDA's recommended target daily dose (16 mg) and maximum suggested daily dose (24 mg) may provide better outcomes, but little is known about higher dosage prescribing patterns. To better understand buprenorphine prescribing patterns, this manuscript examines the frequency and characteristics of dispensed buprenorphine of ≤ 16mg, > 16-24 mg, and > 24 mg daily dose.
40205450	Preoperative assessment in lymph node metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a transformer model based on dual-energy CT.

40205447	TF Profiler: a transcription factor inference method that broadly measures transcription factor activity and identifies mechanistically distinct networks.	TF Profiler is a method of inferring transcription factor (TF) regulatory activity, i.e., when a TF is present and actively participating in the regulation of transcription, directly from nascent sequencing assays such as PRO-seq and GRO-seq. While ChIP assays have measured DNA localization, they fall short of identifying when and where the effector domain of a transcription factor is active. Our method uses RNA polymerase activity to infer TF effector domain activity across hundreds of data sets and transcription factors. TF Profiler is broadly applicable, providing regulatory insights on any PRO-seq sample for any transcription factor with a known binding motif.
40205446	Risk expression using likelihood ratios and natural frequencies in Bayesian inference tasks-a preregistered randomized-controlled crossover trial.	To make reasonable future medical decisions, medical students need to be sufficiently educated to interpret diagnostic tests. Natural frequencies are considered the gold standard for understanding single diagnostic test results. However, they may be less suitable in situations involving sequential diagnostic testing. We test whether odds and likelihood ratios (odds/LR) may serve as a viable alternative in these situations.
40205445	Developing a core outcome set for acetabular fractures: a systematic review (part I).	There are indications that clinical studies investigating the surgical treatment of acetabular fractures assess different outcomes. This heterogeneity reduces the comparability of study results and, thus, limits the knowledge generated from research. Core outcome sets (COS) contain a minimum set of outcomes that should be measured in studies investigating a specific disease or injury. A COS for surgically treated acetabular fractures does not yet exist. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the reported outcomes in studies investigating the surgical treatment of acetabular fractures.
40205444	Psychotropic medication non-adherence and its determinants among people living with mental illnesses in Ethiopia: systematic review and meta-analysis study.	Over half of patients take medications incorrectly, with non-adherence being a significant challenge in managing mental illnesses and to healthcare systems globally. In mental health, non-adherence to psychotropic medications exacerbates symptoms, increases relapse rates, and contributes to treatment resistance, higher hospitalization rates, and mortality. It also places a financial burden on healthcare systems through preventable hospitalizations and prolonged treatments. Understanding the prevalence and determinants of non-adherence is particularly critical in low-resource settings like Ethiopia, where mental health services are underfunded and sociocultural factors influence treatment behaviors. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and determinants of psychotropic medication non-adherence in Ethiopia.
40205443	Clustered Cases of Candida Auris Colonization: Roles of the Infection Prevention and Control Department and the Mycology Laboratory in Controlling Transmission.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of ambient temperature on linguistic development at the age of 2 years-old.
40205440	Consensus-based recommendations for the rehabilitation of children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita: an integrated knowledge translation approach.	Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a group of rare disorders characterized by multiple joint contractures present at birth. Early rehabilitation is essential to minimize joint contractures and maximize autonomy and participation among individuals with AMC. However, there is little robust scientific evidence to inform best practice. This project aimed to develop consensus-based recommendations for the rehabilitation management of children with AMC in the following priority areas: early intervention and motor development, muscle and joint function, orthotics, mobility, participation in areas of life, pain, psychosocial wellbeing, and perioperative rehabilitation.
40205439	Filtering cells with high mitochondrial content depletes viable metabolically altered malignant cell populations in cancer single-cell studies.	Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our understanding of cellular diversity, yet noise from technical artifacts and low-quality cells can obscure key biological signals. A common practice is filtering out cells with a high percentage of mitochondrial RNA counts (pctMT), typically indicative of cell death. However, commonly used filtering thresholds, primarily derived from studies on healthy tissues, may be overly stringent for malignant cells, which often naturally exhibit higher baseline mitochondrial gene expression.
40205438	Enhancing Akkermansia growth via phytohormones: a strategy to modulate the gut-bone axis in postmenopausal osteoporosis therapy.	Phytohormones have garnered considerable interest as potential modulators of the gut-bone axis. Denosumab (Deno), a widely utilized therapeutic agent for postmenopausal osteoporosis, has not been previously investigated for its effects on gut health. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of isoflavones (SI), naringin (Nar), and Deno in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis by targeting the gut-bone axis.
40205437	Financing of non-communicable diseases in Afghanistan.	Afghanistan is suffering from a triple burden of diseases. One of every two Afghan is dying due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The national health account report shows that people are paying 77% of health expenditure from their pocket especially for diagnostic and treatment purposes. Considering the huge number of mortality and health expenditure related to NCDs, this paper aimed to analyze the financing system of NCDs and provide recommendations to the policy makers and program managers in national and international health institutions.
40205436	Zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 13-mediated S-palmitoylation of GNA13 from Sertoli cell-derived extracellular vesicles inhibits autophagy in spermatogonial stem cells.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) originating from testicular somatic cells act as pivotal intermediaries in cell signaling crosstalk between spermatogenic cells and the testicular microenvironment. The intricate balance between palmitoylation and depalmitoylation governs the positioning of protein cargos on the membrane, thereby influencing cellular activities by concentrating these proteins in EVs for delivery to recipient cells. Here, we reveal that GNA13 undergoes specific S-palmitoylation at Cys14 and Cys18 residues in Sertoli cells (SCs), a modification essential for its localization to the plasma membrane. We identify DHHC13, a member of the zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase family that catalyzes protein S-palmitoylation, as the enzyme responsible for this critical post-translational modification. Additionally, GNA13 palmitoylation is indispensable for its selective enrichment in EVs emanating from SCs. Intriguingly, we discovered the presence of palmitoylated GNA13 in SC-derived EVs significantly downregulates autophagy levels in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), and the inhibition of GNA13 palmitoylation attenuates its interaction with ARHGEF12 which leads to diminished RhoA activity and consequent elevation of autophagy in SSCs. Our results illuminate the crucial role of DHHC13-mediated GNA13 S-palmitoylation in modulating autophagy levels in SSCs through SCs-derived EVs, suggesting that PM-GNA13-EV may serve as a potential candidate for further exploration in addressing fertility-related challenges during spermatogenesis.
40205435	Barriers to effective antimicrobial resistance management in Nigerian livestock: the role of veterinary practices and client expectations.	Resistance to antimicrobials is growing faster than the discovery of new drugs. This problem has raised the global concern of a possible pandemic, as the treatment of infections in both humans and animals is becoming more difficult. This study aimed to understand the opinions of practising veterinarians on the factors responsible for increasing antibiotic resistance among animals in Nigeria. A cross-sectional study of veterinarians from 36 states (including the Federal capital territory) was conducted using a paper-based structured questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was made available to the 1,117 veterinarians who attended 2023 Nigerian Veterinary Medical Association (NVMA). A simple random selection was used to select 295 veterinarians as respondents. The data collected were coded and stored electronically in a Microsoft Excel database and anonymised for further analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using Excel and SPSS Statistics v24.0. Most veterinarians (89.8%) agreed that the antibiogram test (AST) is important before prescription; however, only a few (4.4%) request for an antibiogram before prescriptions to clients due to the unaffordability of the test by clients (x̄=3.21), the desire for rapid results (x̄=3.06), and the lack of diagnostic laboratories nearby (x̄=2.96). As a result, 61.5% reported that clients had complained that antibiotics prescribed did not work (curative). In addition, veterinarians opined that irrational antibiotic use among animal owners (x̄=4.34), an increased number of quackery (x̄=4.10) and ease of access of the public to antibiotics at veterinary pharmacies/shops (x̄=3.86) were the leading causes of increasing antimicrobial resistance in Nigeria. The significant factors responsible for veterinarians' opinions were education (β = 0.929) and the value of conducting an antibiogram before prescription (β = 1.618) at the p ≤ 0.05 level of significance. This study revealed that irrational antibiotic use among animal owners, an increasing number of quackery and ease of access of the public to antibiotics at veterinary pharmacies/shops were the leading causes of increasing animal antimicrobial resistance in Nigeria. Therefore, this study suggests the development and implementation of policies and frameworks that promote antimicrobial stewardship and the establishment of veterinary laboratories in various communities in the country. Continuous education for veterinarians and livestock workers, especially on AMR, is also critical.
40205434	Health expenditure, governance and SDG3 nexus: a longitudinal analysis in BRICS economies.	Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3): good health and well-being, requires significant health investments and effective governance. While many studies explored the influence of health expenditure and governance, little is known about how different levels of governance affect the relationship between health expenditure and SDG3 in a globalised world. Thus, this study aims to fill that gap by examining the marginal effects of health expenditure on SDG3 under varying levels of governance in BRICS economies.

This study informs gaps in clinical guidance for patient-centered decision-making about medical and surgical interventions for PWD and advancecare planning.
40205430	Lysosomes: guardians and healers within cells- multifaceted perspective and outlook from injury repair to disease treatment.	Lysosomes, as crucial organelles within cells, carry out diverse biological functions such as waste degradation, regulation of the cellular environment, and precise control of cell signaling. This paper reviews the core functions and structural characteristics of lysosomes, and delves into the current research status of lysosomes damage repair mechanisms. Subsequently, we explore in depth the close association between lysosomes and various diseases, including but not limited to age-related chronic diseases, neuro-degenerative diseases, tumors, inflammation, and immune imbalance. Additionally, we also provide a detailed discussion of the application of lysosome-targeted substances in the field of regenerative medicine, especially the enormous potential demonstrated in key areas such as stem cell regulation and therapy, and myocardial cell repair. Though the integration of multidisciplinary research efforts, we believe that lysosomes damage repair mechanisms will demonstrate even greater application value in disease treatment and regenerative medicine.

40205426	Exploring the longitudinal relationships between non-suicidal self-injury and depressive symptoms in adolescents: a cross-lagged panel network analysis.	Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and depressive symptoms are two major public health issues among adolescents. Moreover, they can often co-occur, which can lead to additional negative outcomes, such as suicidal behaviors. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the comorbidity patterns of NSSI and depressive symptoms and provide valuable insights for future interventions.
40205425	Optical coherence tomography in patients with major depressive disorder.	Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has emerged as a significant non-invasive imaging technique in psychiatric research, allowing for detailed structural assessment of the retinal layers. While OCT has been promising for monitoring neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, results in major depressive disorder (MDD) remain inconsistent. Building on findings of attenuated electroretinogram (ERG) responses in MDD, indicating functional retinal alterations, this study investigated whether structural retinal changes, such as thinning of retinal layers, also occur in patients with MDD and whether these changes are associated with the severity of depressive symptoms.
40205424	Self-concept promote subjective well-being through gratitude and prosocial behavior during early adolescence? a longitudinal study.	Whether and how self-concept link subjective well-being (SWB) among early adolescents is an important issue. This study employs longitudinal method to explore the relationship between self-concept and SWB, as well as the mediating effects of gratitude and prosocial behavior on this relationship in early adolescents. A total of 554 early adolescents completed scales at two waves, with a 10-month interval between two measurements. Results showed that, from the perspective of cross-section, self-concept T1 had an indirect effect on SWB T1 through gratitude T1 and prosocial behavior T1. From the longitudinal perspective, self-concept T1 had an indirect predictive effect on SWB T2 through gratitude at T1 and T2, as well as prosocial behavior at T1 and T2. In a word, self-concept positively predicted SWB indirectly in that they positively predicted gratitude and prosocial behavior. These findings help to enrich existing literature and provide a new scientific insight for effectively enhancing early adolescents' SWB. Implications and limitations were also discussed.

40205422	Unraveling the role of hypoxia-inducible factors in cutaneous melanoma: from mechanisms to therapeutic opportunities.	Hypoxia is a common feature of solid malignancies, including cutaneous melanoma (CM). Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α orchestrate cellular responses to hypoxia and coordinate a transcriptional program that promote several aggressive features in CM, such as angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastasis formation, metabolic rewiring, and immune escape. BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, which is the most frequent mutation observed in CM patients, usually increases HIF-α signaling not only in hypoxia, but also in normoxic CM cells, enabling HIF-1α and HIF-2α to continuously activate downstream molecular pathways. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the intricate role and regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in CM, with a brief focus on the complex interactions between HIF-α subunits and non-coding RNAs. We also discuss HIF-α-mediated cellular responses in normoxia along with the mechanisms that allow HIF-α subunits to maintain their stability under normal oxygen conditions. Finally, we resume available evidence on potential therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting HIF-1α and/or HIF-2α.

40205409	Spectrum of genetic alterations in patients with peroxisome biogenesis defects in the Iranian population: a case series study.	Peroxisomal disorders are a group of hereditary metabolic disorders that happen when peroxisomes are defective. Around 80% of individuals affected by peroxisomal disorders are classified within the spectrum of Zellweger syndromes with autosomal recessive inheritance pattern that results from mutations in one of the 13 PEX genes. Clinical exome sequencing plays a vital role in the diagnosis where the symptoms are atypical. In the current study, we used this technique to find the underlying genetic cause in 14 Iranian patients with peroxisomal disorders. PEX1 variants were detected in five patients. PEX2, PEX5, PEX6 and PEX7 variants were detected in three, one, one, and two cases, respectively. Finally, ACOX1 variants were identified in two cases. All cases except two cases were homozygote for the suspected variants in Zellweger syndrome-related genes. Two cases were compound heterozygote for variants in the PEX1 gene. In total, two novel variants were identified, including c.313 C > T (p.Gln105*) and c.961 A > T (p.Ile321Phe) in the PEX1 and ACOX1 genes, respectively. The present research expands the range of genetic variations observed in Iranian individuals diagnosed with various forms of Zellweger spectrum disorders.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of T1D and PE on the progression of atherosclerosis.
40205401	Multiple roles of branched-chain amino acid metabolism in tumour progression.	Metabolic reprogramming enables tumour cells to sustain their continuous proliferation and adapt to the ever-changing microenvironment. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their metabolites are involved in intracellular protein synthesis and catabolism, signal transduction, epigenetic modifications, and the maintenance of oxidative homeostasis. Alterations in BCAA metabolism can influence the progression of various tumours. However, how BCAA metabolism is dysregulated differs among depending on tumour type; for example, it can manifest as decreased BCAA metabolism leading to BCAA accumulation, or as enhanced BCAA uptake and increased catabolism. In this review, we describe the role of BCAA metabolism in the progression of different tumours. As well as discuss how BCAA metabolic reprogramming drives tumour therapy resistance and evasion of the antitumour immune response, and how these pro-cancer effects are achieved in part by activating the mTORC signalling pathway. In-depth investigations into the potential mechanisms by which BCAA metabolic reprogramming affects tumorigenesis and tumour progression can enhance our understanding of the relationship between metabolism and cancer and provide new strategies for cancer therapy.

40205398	Factors contributing to the abundance and spatial distribution of the invasive intermediate host snail (Pseudosuccinea columella) in uMgungundlovu district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.	Fascioliasis is a parasitic disease commonly affecting cattle, goats, and sheep globally. Lymnaeidae snail species are important in the epidemiology and dispersal of fascioliasis since they are intermediate hosts of the Fasciola spp. Our study mapped at micro-geographical scale, the distribution and abundance of Pseudosuccinea columella in uMgungundlovu district, which is in the northern part of the KwaZulu-Natal province, and measured physicochemical parameters at potential transmission sites. The study examined the impact of physicochemical parameters and presence of other snail species on P.columella abundance and distribution in KwaZulu-Natal's uMgungundlovu district. Data were analyzed using R studio, a negative binomial mixed model, and various statistical tests, including the variance inflation factor and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Overall, 1406 freshwater snails, distributed in 45 sampling sites. Pseudosuccinea columella (569) had a widespread coverage in 34 sites (75.6%) of them but not found at 11 sites. Water pH ranged between 6.60 ± 0.38 and 7.46 ± 0.15, while dissolved oxygen (DO) values varied across the sites. GLM analysis suggested that water pH had an influence on the abundance of P.columella. The intermediate host snail of Fasciola, P. columella is abundant and widely distributed across all the 7 municipalities in the uMgungundlovu district suggesting the need for increased snail monitoring to reduce its invasiveness and livestock productivity losses due to Fasciola infections.
40205397	Understanding the dynamics of sexual and reproductive health outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa using the Demographic and Health Survey: the need for longitudinal studies.	Sub-Saharan Africa has considerable obstacles in sexual and reproductive health, encompassing unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, sexually transmitted illnesses, and sexual assault. Although cross-sectional data, like the Demographic and Health Survey, offer useful insights, they are constrained in their ability to capture the dynamic aspects of sexual and reproductive health issues. This perspective contends that a thorough comprehension of sexual and reproductive health necessitates the incorporation of longitudinal studies to guide evidence-based practices. Longitudinal studies can monitor temporal changes, identify risk factors, assess intervention efficacy, and offer a more nuanced comprehension of sexual and reproductive health dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa. Notwithstanding the difficulties inherent in longitudinal research, commitment to this methodology is crucial for formulating effective policies and programmes aimed at enhancing sexual and reproductive health outcomes in the region.

The present study aimed to determine the influence of preoperative MME and BME on outcomes after MOWHTO.
40205392	Impact of connected toothbrushes on patient perceptions of brushing skills and oral health: results from a randomized clinical trial and a single-arm intervention study.	Connected toothbrushes, where an electric toothbrush connects wirelessly to a smartphone app that provides feedback and guidance to the user, can improve clinical indicators of oral health. However, the impact of the connected brush on user perceptions of brushing skills, behaviors, "everyday" oral health (e.g., breath odor, how clean teeth feel), and user perceptions of the smartphone app are also important. In this study, a novel PRO measure - the Everyday Oral Health and Brushing (EOHAB) Questionnaire - was implemented to capture these important views. The EOHAB was administered in: (1) a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT; N = 80) comparing a connected toothbrush to an unconnected electric brush over 6 weeks and (2) a single-arm study (N = 159), where participants used an electric brush alone for 1 week and then a connected brush for 3-4 weeks. EOHAB scores addressing perceptions of brushing behaviors/skills, oral health, and the usefulness and ease of use of the app were calculated. Impression of change items that directly asked users about changes in their perceptions were scored separately. In the single-arm study, perceptions of brushing skills and behaviors were very positive prior to using the unconnected or connected brush and then became incrementally more positive after using the electric brush alone and then the connected brush before decreasing at the last assessment interval. In both studies, cross-sectional correlations between the EOHAB scores and objective measures of brushing behavior and clinical measures were close to zero. Increased brushing duration and coverage over time were observed when participants reported improved perceptions on impression of change items and positive ratings of app utility, but not other EOHAB scores. In the RCT, the connected brush significantly improved several impression of change items, but not other EOHAB items asking about current perspectives. In sum, use of a connected toothbrush was associated with improved brushing and oral health perceptions when EOHAB questions asked directly about changes since starting use of the toothbrush. Brushing metrics improved as views on the app became more positive. Although not uniform, the results support previous studies indicating that connected brush systems can improve patient-reported outcomes.
40205391	Comparative analysis of fatty acid profiles across omnivorous, flexitarians, vegetarians, and vegans: insights from the NuEva study.	Different dietary choices can influence blood fatty acid profiles, which are crucial for maintaining physiological health and reducing disease risk.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the association between MIND diet and PPD.
40205389	Healthcare practitioners and robotic-assisted rehabilitation: understanding needs and barriers.	In recent years, numerous robotic devices, together with allied technologies, have been developed to support rehabilitation, both in research settings and industry. Although robotic-assisted rehabilitation and related technologies hold significant promise for supporting healthcare practitioners and enhancing patient care, their use in clinical practice remains limited. One of the motivations could be that final users' needs have not been given due consideration so far. As a matter of fact, understanding user needs and perceptions is crucial for designing these technological devices and for creating new organizational models within hospitals aiming to establish and maintain robotics-assisted rehabilitation gyms.

This study aimed to explore the correlation between TLS parameters and the prognosis of LARC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
40205381	Isolation and characterization of goose astrovirus genotype 1 causing enteritis in goslings from Sichuan Province, China.	Since 2017, goose astrovirus (GoAstV) has been widely prevalent in various provinces of China, causing economic losses in the goose industry, with outbreak mortality rates ranging from 10 to 60%. Notably, a goose farm in Sichuan Province has faced an outbreak of infectious disease in 1-3 weeks old goslings, with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. Viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples identified Goose astrovirus genotype 1 (GoAstV-1), and PCR analysis confirmed the presence of GoAstV-1. Furthermore, we successfully isolated a GoAstV-C1 strain using goose embryos named AAstV/Goose/CHN/2023/C1 (GenBank No. PP108251), and its viral titer was calculated as 10^4.834 ELD<sub>50</sub>/0.5 mL using the Reed-Muench method. The genome size of GoAstV-C1 was about 7,261 nucleotides through amplifying with Sanger sequencing and assembling with SeqMan software. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that GoAstV-1 strains are classified into three major subtypes: A, B, and C, with the GoAstV-C1 strain identified as a unique variant within subtype B, characterized by distinct genetic divergence features. Experimental inoculation of one-day-old goslings with the virus resulted in a mortality rate of 5 out of 15 (p-value = 0.0421) and a significant reduction in weight gain compared to controls (p-value = 0.005). Pathological examination revealed that GoAstV-C1 infection caused severe damage to the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Interestingly, unlike most GoAstV, which leads to characteristic gout symptoms, our isolates GoAstV-C1 caused obvious intestinal damage characterized by necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, and crypt architectural disruption. We indicated that GoAstV-C1 displays a unique intestinal tropism rather than characteristic gout symptoms and elucidated genomic features and evolutionary relationships of GoAstV strains. These findings help advance our knowledge of the epidemiology and pathogenicity of GoAstV-1, and the predicted structure of capsid protein could serve as a potential target for designing novel antiviral drugs or vaccines against GoAstV-1.

It remains unclear whether interoception is altered and how it relates to somatic and mood symptoms in youths with BD.
40205378	Termination sequence between an inducible promoter and ubiquitous chromatin opening element (UCOE) reduces gene expression leakage and silencing.	Inducible gene expression circuits enable precise control over target gene activation and are widely used in direct reprogramming. However, their usability is often compromised by DNA methylation-induced silencing, especially in iPSCs. This deactivates genetic circuits in engineered iPSCs preventing them from being used for long-term scalable expansion of desired cell types. A2-ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (A2UCOE) have been recognized for their anti-silencing properties, but they have not been used in human iPSCs with inducible systems for direct reprogramming. This study investigates the role of A2UCOE in inducible systems and identifies strategies to eliminate associated gene leakage enabling long-term use of engineered human iPSCs.

While factors, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and burnout, are well-documented, most studies focus on specific professions, limiting their generalizability. This study provides an interprofessional analysis of HCPs' experiences regarding their working conditions in the context of workforce shortages, identifying key challenges that could inform retention strategies.
40205360	Estimating treatment effects using parametric models as counter-factual evidence.	Randomisation controlled trial are the gold standard for causal inference, however the rapidly increasing development of new treatments and the movement towards personalised medicine mean there is a need to measure efficacy outside of the costly and time-consuming RCT.Here we propose a method of estimating treatment effects using parametric models to act as control against which to compare data from an experimental arm. This allows for treatment effects to be estimated where data are only available from an experimental arm and can be a tool useful in the analysis of observational cohorts or for the design and analysis of RCTs.We develop this approach using Bayesian estimation procedures and compare this approach against other casual inference tools. We then demonstrate how this may be used to estimate the efficacy between two treatment in different RCTs for the analysis of Pancreatic Cancer.It is proposed that with reasonable assumptions, this approach can produce a reliable estimate of efficacy and can have applications in both evaluating currently available data and in the efficient design of future trials.

Here, we profiled the tumor cellular composition and identified prognosis-related stromal signatures by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in eCCA. ECCA patients were further stratified into different categories based on identified stromal signatures.
40205357	Lenalidomide based triplets in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: analysis of the Czech Myeloma Group.	Despite significant advancements in therapy of multiple myeloma (MM) over the past 20 years, most patients experience relapse, necessitating new treatment approaches. This study aims to compare the real-world effectiveness of lenalidomide (LEN)-based triplet therapies, specifically daratumumab (DRD), carfilzomib (KRD), and ixazomib (IRD), in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).A retrospective registry-based study analyzed 538 RRMM patients undergoing therapy for their first to third relapse. The primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), with a matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAIC) employed to address cohort differences.ORR was highest for DRD at 91.4%, followed by KRD (89.6%) and IRD cohorts (Early-IRD: 79.6%, Late-IRD: 70.8%). Median PFS for DRD was greater at 23.64 months compared to KRD (16.52 months) and IRD groups (Early-IRD: 19.97 months, Late-IRD: 11.57 months). The MAIC confirmed better outcomes for the DRD regimen. High-risk features were not overcome by any of the LEN-based regimens.The findings underscore the superior efficacy of DRD in achieving sustained responses in RRMM patients. The composition of the cohort is a crucial factor, extending beyond selection criteria. This study highlights the importance of real-world evidence in assessing treatment modalities in clinical settings.

Therefore, exploring the scientific application of microbial fertilizers is of great significance for improving their application effect on crops. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Bacillus subtilis combined with liquid water-soluble carbon fertilizer on soil chemical properties and the rhizosphere microbial community of fresh maize. It employed a pot experiment design, incorporating five distinct treatments: T1 (liquid water-soluble carbon fertilizer), T2 (B. subtilis N24 fermentation solution), T3 (B. subtilis + liquid water-soluble carbon fertilizer), CK0 (clean water), and CK1 (conventional fertilization). Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze corn potting soil. The results indicated that the fertilization treatments influenced the chemical properties of the rhizosphere soil of fresh maize in the following order: T3 > CK1 > T2 > T1 > CK0. The T3 treatment significantly increased the contents of total nitrogen, available nitrogen, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter (P < 0.05). It enhanced nitrogen availability and effectively preserved phosphorus and organic matter within the soil. Furthermore, the treatment enriched the microbial community diversity in the corn rhizosphere, thereby significantly increasing the abundance of Firmicutes, Acidobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Mortierellomycota, and Basidiomycota (P < 0.05), demonstrating superior effects compared with the individual applications. The soil properties were strongly linked to microbial composition, as shown by the redundancy analysis (P < 0.05). In summary, the combined application of B. subtilis N24 and liquid water-soluble carbon fertilizer enhanced the chemical properties and fertility of the soil for fresh maize while also positively influencing the structure of the microbial community. This study provides a theoretical foundation for developing novel fertilizer application models for corn cultivation.
40205353	Development and validation of a prediction model for the risk of citrate accumulation in critically ill patients with citrate anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy: a retrospective cohort study based on MIMIC-IV database.	Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical syndrome, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU), with an incidence of more than 50% and in-hospital mortality of 30%. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is an important supportive treatment for patients with AKI (Patel in Trauma Surg Acute Care Open e001381, 2024). Citrate is the preferred anticoagulant for critically ill patients requiring CRRT. Unfortunately, such patients may be confronted with citrate accumulation during citrate anticoagulation.

40205349	Factors associated with late antenatal care booking in selected health facilities of Zoba Maekel, Eritrea: a cross-sectional study.	Antenatal care is a special care provided for pregnant women with the aim of preventing, detecting, and treating health problems in both the fetus and mother. Early antenatal care attendance promotes early detection and treatment of complications which result in proper management during delivery and puerperium. However, the majority of pregnant women in Eritrea initiate their ANC booking late. The study aims to assess factors associated with late ANC booking among pregnant mothers attending selected antenatal care services in Zoba Maekel, Eritrea.

40205345	The relationship of self-esteem and mental health among older adults with the mediating role of loneliness.	Mental health (MH) is one of the most important resources of human life, particularly during older adulthood. Self-esteem (SE) is related to mental health (MH), and loneliness may serve as a mediator in the relationship between SE and MH. However, the role of loneliness in this relationship is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the association between SE and MH in older adults, specifically focusing on the mediating role of loneliness in this relationship.
40205344	Quantitative genetic analysis of late spring mortality in triploid Crassostrea virginica.	Triploid oysters, bred by crossing tetraploid and diploid oysters, are common worldwide in commercial oyster aquaculture and make up much of the hatchery-produced Crassostrea virginica farmed in the mid-Atlantic and southeast of the United States. Breeding diploid and tetraploid animals for genetic improvement of triploid progeny is unique to oysters and can proceed via several possible breeding strategies. Triploid oysters, along with their diploid or tetraploid relatives, have yet been subject to quantitative genetic analyses that could inform a breeding strategy of triploid improvement. The importance of quantitative genetic analyses involving triploid C. virginica has been emphasized by the occurrence of mortality events of near-market sized triploids in late spring.
40205343	Anti-biofilm and anti-quorum sensing activities of galloylquinic acid against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in open wound infection: in vitro and in vivo efficacy studies.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa can proliferate in immunocompromised individuals, forming biofilms that increase antibiotic resistance. This bacterium poses a significant global health risk due to its resistance to human defenses, antibiotics, and various environmental stresses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial, anti-biofilm, and anti-quorum sensing activities of galloylquinic acid compounds (GQAs) extracted from Copaifera lucens leaves against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa. We have investigated the optimal concentration of GQAs needed to eradicate preexisting biofilms and manage wound infections caused by P. aeruginosa, in vitro and in vivo.
40205342	Ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block combined with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block in a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis: a case report.	Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), also known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN I-V), is an exceptionally rare autosomal recessive disorder. The pathogenesis of CIPA remains not fully elucidated. Clinical manifestations primarily include the absence of pain perception, painless injuries to the extremities, oral mutilation, anhidrosis accompanied by hyperthermia, and delayed intellectual development. Given the autonomic dysfunction in CIPA patients, previous reports on anesthetic management for this rare disorder have predominantly depended on general anesthesia or neuraxial anesthesia, both of which pose significant challenges. This case report presents a unique approach to anesthetic management in a child with CIPA, who successfully underwent hollow nail internal fixation for femoral neck fracture under orthopedic navigation using ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block combined with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block. The patient was sedated with dexmedetomidine and did not require any opioids during the procedure. Her vital signs remained stable throughout the surgery, and her recovery was uneventful, with discharge occurring 5 days post-operation. This case contributes to the medical literature by demonstrating a safe and effective anesthetic strategy in a pediatric CIPA patient, highlighting the potential of regional anesthesia techniques as a viable alternative to general anesthesia or neuraxial anesthesia in such high-risk cases.
40205341	Primary central nervous system tumors in patients with multiple sclerosis.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disorder that can present with clinical and radiological features indistinguishable from a central nervous system (CNS) tumor.

40205340	SEIRS model for TB transmission dynamics incorporating the environment and optimal control.	Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, claiming more than 2 million lives annually, predominantly among adults. Existing studies often neglect the environment, reinfection, relapse/reactivation, and model calibration, thus limiting their applicability. This study presents a novel data-driven model that incorporates these factors to analyze the dynamics of TB transmission. Using the next-generation matrix approach, a basic reproduction number ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>R</mi> <mn>0</mn></msub> </math> ) of 1.737266 was calculated, indicating that active TB disease will persist in the human population without robust public health interventions. The model equations were numerically solved using fourth- and fifth-order Runge-Kutta methods. The model was calibrated to the historical TB incidence data for Kenya, spanning 2000 to 2022, using least squares curve fitting. The fitting algorithm yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01% when comparing the actual data points with the results of the simulated model. This finding indicates that the proposed mathematical model closely aligns with the recorded TB incidence data. The optimal values of the model parameters were estimated from the fitting algorithm, and future TB transmission dynamics was projected for the next two decades. Key findings indicate that a 10% decrease in transmission rate, while maintaining other parameters constant, would result in a 10% reduction in TB transmission in Kenya. In addition, the incidence of tuberculosis in Kenya is expected to decrease to an estimated 35 cases per 100,000 people by 2045 with sustained efforts in Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination programs and public awareness campaigns. BCG vaccination emerges as the most cost-effective strategy to combat TB transmission in Kenya. Policymakers should prioritize investing in BCG vaccination programs to achieve optimal public health outcomes and economic benefits, aligning with Kenya's Vision 2030.

40205337	Identifying comorbidity patterns of mental health disorders in community-dwelling older adults: a cluster analysis.	As global life expectancy increases, understanding mental health patterns and their associated risk factors in older adults becomes increasingly critical. Using data from the cross-sectional Trinity Ulster Department of Agriculture study (TUDA, 2008-2012; <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>n</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>5186</mn></mrow> </math> ; mean age 74.0 years) and a subset of participants followed-up longitudinally (TUDA 5+, 2014-2018; <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>n</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>953</mn></mrow> </math> ), we perform a multi-view co-clustering analysis to identify distinct mental health profiles and their relationships with potential risk factors. The TUDA multi-view dataset consists of five views: (1) mental health, measured with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], (2) cognitive and neuropsychological function, (3) illness diagnoses and medical prescription history, (4) lifestyle and nutritional attainment, and (5) physical well-being. That is, each participant is described by five distinct sets of features. The mental health view serves as the target feature set, while the other four views are analyzed as potential contributors to mental health risks. Under the multi-view co-clustering framework, for each view data, the participants (rows) are partitioned into different row-clusters, and the features (columns) are partitioned into different column-clusters. Each row-cluster is most effectively explained by the features in one or two column-clusters. Notably, the row-clusterings across views are dependent. By analyzing the associations between row clusters in the mental health view and those in each of the other four views, we can identify which risk factors co-occur and contribute to an increased risk of poor mental health. We identify five distinct row-clusters in the mental-health view data, characterized by varying levels of depression and anxiety: Group 1, mild depressive symptoms and no symptoms of anxiety; Group 2, acute depression and anxiety; Group 3, less severe but persistent depression and anxiety symptoms; Group 4, symptoms of anxiety with no depressive symptoms; and Group 5, no symptoms of either depression or anxiety. Cross-view association analysis revealed the following key insights: Participants in Group 3 exhibit lower neuropsychological function, are older, more likely to live alone, come from more deprived regions, and have reduced physical independence. Contrasting Group 3, participants in Group 2 show better neuropsychological function, greater physical independence, and higher socioeconomic status. Participants in Group 5 report fewer medical diagnoses and prescriptions, more affluent backgrounds, less solitary living, and stronger physical independence. A significant portion of this group aligns with cognitive health row-clusters 1 and 3, suggesting a strong link between cognitive and mental health in older age. Participants with only depressive (Group 1) or anxiety symptoms (Group 4) exhibit notable differences. Those with anxiety symptoms are associated with healthier clusters across other views. The co-clustering methodology also categorizes the questions in the CES-D and HADS scales into meaningful clusters, providing valuable insights into the underlying dimensions of mental health assessment. In the CES-D scale, the questions are divided into four clusters: those related to loneliness and energy, those addressing feelings of insecurity, worthlessness, and fear, those concerning concentration and effort, and those focused on sleep disturbances. Similarly, the HADS questions are grouped into clusters that reflect themes such as a strong sense of impending doom, nervousness or unease, and feelings of tension or restlessness. By organizing the questions from both scales into these smaller groups, the methodology highlights distinct symptom patterns and their varying severity among participants. This approach could be leveraged to develop abridged versions of the assessment scales, enabling faster and more efficient triage in clinical practice.
40205336	Primary care physician engagement in health systems transformation.	Physician engagement is critical to the success of primary care transformation, yet strategies to support meaningful engagement remain understudied. Despite existing research, gaps persist in understanding how physician engagement unfolds within system-level initiatives in primary care. This paper examines physician engagement through the development of the London Middlesex Primary Care Alliance (LMPCA), a regional initiative uniting primary care providers in Southwestern Ontario to advocate for system improvements and support health system transformation, including the Middlesex-London Ontario Health Team (ML-OHT). Rather than centering solely on physician perspectives, our study explores physician engagement as part of a broader collaborative effort involving healthcare administrators and support personnel. Data were collected through interviews (n = 13; including primary care physicians, healthcare administrators, and administrative support personnel), document analysis, and an environmental scan. Findings highlight the importance of grassroots leadership, governance structures, and system-level supports in driving physician engagement. The role of a primary care transformation lead emerged as a key facilitator, while lack of compensation for system-level work remained a barrier. This study provides insights into the formation of a sustainable, self-governing primary care organization and offers considerations for scaling engagement strategies while mitigating burnout and ensuring long-term participation.
40205335	DTreePred: an online viewer based on machine learning for pathogenicity prediction of genomic variants.	A significant challenge in precision medicine is confidently identifying mutations detected in sequencing processes that play roles in disease treatment or diagnosis. Furthermore, the lack of representativeness of single nucleotide variants in public databases and low sequencing rates in underrepresented populations pose defies, with many pathogenic mutations still awaiting discovery. Mutational pathogenicity predictors have gained relevance as supportive tools in medical decision-making. However, significant disagreement among different tools regarding pathogenicity identification is rooted, necessitating manual verification to confirm mutation effects accurately.
40205334	Prognostic factors of survival in patients with lung cancer after low-dose computed tomography screening: a multivariate analysis of a lung cancer screening cohort in China.

40205333	Ciprofol versus propofol for long-term sedation in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized controlled trial.	Sedatives are often used to facilitate mechanical ventilation in patients with sepsis. Ciprofol is a new promising sedated candidate with a higher binding activity to the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor than propofol. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of ciprofol and propofol for long-term sedation in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis.
40205332	Genome-wide identification of five fern bHLH families and functional analysis of bHLHs in lignin biosynthesis in Alsophila spinulosa.	The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are involved in the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites. However, genome-wide studies on the bHLH gene family in ferns and their role in lignin biosynthesis remain limited. As the second largest group of vascular plants, ferns are of significant interest for understanding plant evolution and secondary metabolism. Among ferns, Alsophila spinulosa stands out as one of the few tree ferns with a distinctive trunk structure. Investigating the genes potentially regulating lignin biosynthesis in A. spinulosa offers valuable insights into the growth and development mechanisms of its trunk, which is pivotal for the overall architecture and function of the plant.
40205331	Prioritising patient involvement in patient reported outcome measures- a PROMising way to improve headache care.	The optimal management of migraine involves care strategies that reflect what matters most to patients. This usually involves an assessment of treatment efficacy with respect to headache reduction, safety of prescribed medications and overall patient satisfaction and/or improved quality of life. Traditionally, neurologists focus on objective measures such as monthly reductions to headache and migraine days from baseline. This is complemented with various patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) to quantify morbidity and treatment effect from the patient's perspective. We present a review of currently available headache specific PROMs to summarise the design, key attributes, response format, recall period and length of questionnaires.
40205330	Social control of egg-laying in independently nest-founding bumble bee queens.	Evolution has shaped diverse reproductive investment strategies, with some organisms integrating environmental cues into their reproductive decisions. In animal societies, social cues can further influence reproductive decisions in ways that might support the survival and success of the social group. Bumble bees are a lineage of eusocial insects wherein queens initiate nests independently. Bumble bee queens enter their eusocial phase only after successfully rearing their first offspring and thereafter exhibit an increased rate of egg-laying. We tested the idea that during bumble bee nest initiation, queen reproduction is socially context-dependent and under the control of social conditions in the nest.
40205328	Wild house mice have a more dynamic and aerotolerant gut microbiota than laboratory mice.	The mammalian gut microbiota is a complex microbial community with diverse impacts on host biology. House mice (Mus musculus) are the major model organism for research on mammals, but laboratory domestication has altered their gut microbiota from that of their wild counterparts. Knowledge about how and why the gut microbiota of this species varies between lab and wild settings and among natural populations could improve its utility as a model organism. Here, we use a large dataset comprising over 800 house mouse samples from multiple laboratory facilities and strains and wild mice from mainland and island populations to investigate gut microbiota variation in this species across contrasting genetic and environmental settings. Across geographically disparate populations, we find that wild mice possess a gut microbiota that is compositionally distinct, displays a higher relative abundance and richness of aerotolerant taxa, and is taxonomically and functionally more diverse than that of lab mice. Longitudinally sampled wild mice also display markedly higher temporal turnover in microbiota composition than lab mice. Wild mice from oceanic islands harboured microbiotas that differed subtly from those of mainland wild mice and were more divergent from lab mouse microbiotas. These findings highlight much greater spatial and temporal turnover of gut microbes in wild compared to laboratory mice.
40205327	The association between body roundness index and mortality in diabetes.

40205326	Personalized drug screening of patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters based on specimens obtained from percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy in patients with lung malignancy: a real-world study.	Patient-derived xenografts and organoids were the most common patient-derived tumor models in vitro that were utilized in personalized drug screening, and the establishment rate and duration required to be improved. Patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTCs) could be established within ten days for drug screening, with high establishment rate and accuracy in predicting clinical outcomes. This study aims to explore the accuracy of PTCs based on specimens obtained from percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PTNB) in lung malignancy (LM) patients, and to investigate the predictors for the success of PTC culture.
40205325	Natural history and long-term management of autoimmune hepatitis.	Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a relatively infrequent and complex liver disease characterized by acute or chronic inflammation, interface hepatitis in histology examination, elevation of immunoglobulin G (IgG), production of autoantibodies, and is often responsive to immunosuppression. The incidence of AIH has been increasing worldwide, affecting people of all ages and sexes. AIH represents a diagnostic challenge because of its heterogeneous presentation and the lack of pathognomonic findings. Even when treated, AIH can remain a progressive disease. In this review, we present recent data on the natural history of AIH and the developing evidence on the management of patients with AIH.
40205322	Direct Fluorescence Anisotropy Detection of miRNA Based on Duplex-Specific Nuclease Signal Amplification.	The dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with various diseases, including cancer, so miRNAs are considered a potential biomarker candidate for disease diagnosis and therapy. However, the direct, rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of miRNAs remains quite challenging due to their short length, sequence homology, and low abundance. Herein, we propose a simple and homogeneous fluorescence anisotropy (FA) strategy for the direct and rapid (∼35 min) quantification of miRNA-21 based on duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-assisted signal amplification. In the presence of target miRNA-21, the complementary single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes labeled with a single fluorophore, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR), are specifically hydrolyzed into small fragments by endonuclease DSN upon formation of the DNA/RNA hybrid, which leads to a reduction in FA due to the decrease in molecular size. However, the target miRNA remains intact during the enzymatic digestion process and is released in solution for the next round of binding, hydrolysis, and release for recycling. It is observed that the ssDNA probe labeled with TMR at the 5'-end, in which the fluorophore is nine nucleotides away from the nearest dG base to eliminate/reduce photoinduced electron transfer interaction between TMR and the dG base, exhibits the maximum FA change in response to the target miRNA-21. The change in FA enables the sensitive detection of miRNA-21 ranging from 0.050 to 2.0 nM, with a detection limit of 40 pM. In addition, this amplification strategy exhibits high selectivity and can even discriminate single-base mutations between miRNA family members. We further applied this method to detect miRNA-21 in the extract of various cancer cell lines. Therefore, this method holds great potential for miRNA analysis in tissues or cells, providing valuable information for biomedical research, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutic applications.
40205321	Online Racial Discrimination and College Student Mental Health: Social Support as a Moderator.	Many college students experience racism and discrimination, which negatively impacts their mental health. As COVID-19 has brought about increased reliance on virtual spaces, increased online racial discrimination (ORD) has also become a more prevalent issue. ORD may be defined as online behaviors that demean or marginalize individuals or groups based on race. It may occur on social media, through text messaging, online videos/games, and/or online chat rooms. Research has shown that direct ORD predicted mental health difficulties, but the link between vicarious ORD and mental health was less consistent. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate how direct or vicarious ORD impacts student mental health. This study aims to examine the relationships between direct and vicarious ORD and college student mental health (depression, anxiety, flourishing, and health-related quality of life) and compare the relationships between White students and students of color. Data were collected from a sample of 617 undergraduate students (M<sub>age</sub> = 19.5 years, SD = 1.9, 71.6% female) from two large, urban universities in the Mid-Atlantic region of the USA during COVID-19 from October to December 2021. Our findings revealed that both direct and vicarious ORD predicted depression and anxiety among students of color. However, this was not the case among White students. We also found that social support was a significant buffer on the relation between vicarious ORD and anxiety and flourishing. Social support was a buffer on the relation between direct ORD and health-related quality of life for students of color, but only at low levels of direct ORD. Our findings have implications for future intervention development.

40205318	Cost-Effectiveness of Using Conditional Economic Incentives to Improve Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Adherence Among Male Sex Workers.	Conditional economic incentives can improve medication-taking behaviors among populations at risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, there are no data on the cost-effectiveness of incentive programs for improving pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence among male sex workers (MSWs) who have one of the highest HIV acquisition rates. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of incentive programs to improve adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among male sex workers METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation of the PrEP Seguro randomized pilot trial in Mexico (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03674983). Among n = 110 MSWs, those randomized to the intervention received tiered incentives based on PrEP drug levels in scalp hair measured at three clinic visits over 6 months. The intervention led to a 28.7% increase in scalp hair PrEP concentration, consistent with increased adherence (p = 0.05). Here we use a micro-costing approach from the health system perspective to calculate costs. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated from the number of HIV infections averted through sufficient PrEP adherence (tenofovir concentration > 0.011 ng/mg corresponding to greater than or equal to three weekly doses). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) estimated the cost/QALY gained owing to the intervention.
40205317	Nanotechnology Innovations in Myocardial Infarction: Diagnosis, Treatment and the Way Forward.	Myocardial infarction (MI) is a global health concern that necessitates continued advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Nanotechnology facilitates prompt diagnosis and personalized treatment. This manuscript explicitly reviews the application of innovative methodologies for identifying cardiac biomarkers to facilitate the early diagnosis of MI and its clinical management. Nanoscale agents such as nanoparticles and nanosensors have been employed for this purpose. Technological advancements in medical imaging are revolutionizing therapeutic approaches while reducing morbidity and mortality typically associated with cardiac tissue injury. Besides all, applications of nanotechnology in therapeutics have proven extremely effective. The development of nanoparticle-based customized drug delivery systems will contribute to more effective treatments, fewer side effects, and improved therapeutic outcomes. Biomaterials and nanoscale surgical technologies may benefit patients with MI by promoting tissue regeneration and repair. This manuscript also investigates the ethical and legal limitations that could prevent seamless incorporation of nanotechnology into clinical practice.

40205305	How Fear Memory is Updated: From Reconsolidation to Extinction?	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder caused by traumatic past experiences, rooted in the neurocircuits of fear memory formation. Memory processes include encoding, storing, and recalling to forgetting, suggesting the potential to erase fear memories through timely interventions. Conventional strategies such as medications or electroconvulsive therapy often fail to provide permanent relief and come with significant side-effects. This review explores how fear memory may be erased, particularly focusing on the mnemonic phases of reconsolidation and extinction. Reconsolidation strengthens memory, while extinction weakens it. Interfering with memory reconsolidation could diminish the fear response. Alternatively, the extinction of acquired memory could reduce the fear memory response. This review summarizes experimental animal models of PTSD, examines the nature and epidemiology of reconsolidation to extinction, and discusses current behavioral therapy aimed at transforming fear memories to treat PTSD. In sum, understanding how fear memory updates holds significant promise for PTSD treatment.
40205304	The Bidirectional Role of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Alpha in Vascular Dementia Caused by Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion.	Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a critical indicator of cognitive impairment and dementia, especially vascular dementia. Cerebral blood flow disturbance alters the properties of neurons and glial cells as a result of a deficit in energy sources. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF- 1α) is a transcription factor that controls gene activity in response to low oxygen levels. It regulates a complex network of cellular adaptations to improve oxygenation, metabolic reprogramming, and cell survival in hypoxic situations. However, recent research suggests that HIF- 1α plays a role not only in neuroprotection but also in brain injury. It is therefore critical to fully comprehend the mechanisms behind these disorders. This review highlights the dual role of HIF- 1α in CCH-induced VaD. Initially, HIF- 1α provides a neuroprotection by promoting angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. However, prolonged activation can detrimentally effects, including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. Evidence suggests that HIF- 1α exerts its protective effects in acute ischemic/hypoxic-induced VaD through pathways such as PI3 K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/p-c-Jun signaling. However, its dysregulation in chronic stages of CCH contributes to cognitive decline and disease progression. Understanding the complex role of HIF- 1α and its interactions with other molecular pathways is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Therefore, an informed, in-depth discussion of its involvement in these pathologic processes is necessary, as a precise contribution of HIF- 1α to CCH-induced VaD remains to be established and requires further investigation.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a critical health concern, with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) representing a severe subtype that poses significant risks. This study aims to develop a robust diagnostic model for high-risk MASH utilizing a multi-omics approach.
40205302	Identification of potential cell surface targets in patient-derived cultures toward photoimmunotherapy of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.	Tumor-targeted, activatable photoimmunotherapy (taPIT) has shown promise in preclinical models to selectively eliminate drug-resistant micrometastases that evade standard treatments. Moreover, taPIT has the potential to resensitize chemo-resistant tumor cells to chemotherapy, making it a complementary modality for treating recurrent high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, the established implementation of taPIT relies on the overexpression of EGFR in tumor cells, which is not universally observed in HGSOCs. Motivated by the need to expand taPIT applications beyond EGFR, we conducted mRNA-sequencing and proteomics to identify alternative cell surface targets for taPIT in patient-derived HGSOC cell cultures with weak EGFR expression and lacking expression of other cell surface proteins commonly reported in the literature as overexpressed in ovarian cancers, such as FOLR1 and EpCAM. Our findings highlight TFRC and LRP1 as promising alternative targets. Notably, TFRC was overexpressed in 100% (N = 5) of the patient-derived HGSOC models tested, whereas only 60% of models had high EpCAM expression, suggesting that future larger cohort studies should include TFRC. While this study focuses on target identification, future work will expand the approaches developed here to larger HGSOC biopsy repositories and will also develop and evaluate antibody-photosensitizer conjugates targeting these proteins for taPIT applications.
40205301	A Simple Modification Results in a Significant Improvement in Measuring the Size of Extracellular Vesicles.	Size distribution is an important biophysical property of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs include small EVs (s-EVs) and large EVs (l-EVs) by size. Differential ultracentrifugation (dUC) is widely used to separate EVs from biofluids, but it can precipitate large impurity particles. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a simple and fast method for analyzing the size distribution of EVs. However, this approach is nonideal for heterogeneous and polydisperse samples since a small quantity of large impurity particles can markedly disturb the DLS results. Here, we developed a simple method to improve the reliability of DLS measurements.

Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) plays a pivotal role in many rheumatic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Targeting the IL-17 pathway has transformed the way psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) are managed, with a number of IL-17A inhibitors now available for treating rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. This narrative review will describe the opportunities presented by novel imaging techniques in understanding the metabolic and mechanical changes that characterize the pathogenesis of PsA and axSpA. It will look at the current consensus definitions of early disease in PsA and axSpA, present evidence for the benefit of early treatment, and highlight the gaps in current knowledge. Finally, it will describe novel treatment targets to address the unmet needs in giant cell arteritis (GCA) and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and discuss the potential role of IL-17A inhibition in treating GCA and PMR.
40205296	More equitable initial allocation, more abatement cost saving in using a trading ratio system for riverine water quality management.	Water quality management is essential for sustaining aquatic ecosystems and public health. Different approaches, such as trading ratio systems (TRS), offer economic incentives for reducing pollutant discharges and promote cost-effective compliance with water quality standards. This study evaluates the impact of equitable initial permit allocation on the willingness of dischargers to engage in trading and examines its effect on abatement cost savings within a TRS framework for riverine water quality management. The methodology combines a multi-objective optimization model with the Streeter-Phelps simulation to assess permit allocation and trading scenarios in the Sefidrood River. The model was calibrated and validated using 58 years of historical data, generating Pareto front curves for objective functions across three periods with progressively stricter water quality standards. According to the optimization results, equitable permit allocation significantly influenced trading behavior and cost efficiency. Equitable initial permit allocation led to significant reductions in total abatement costs: 58% in the first period, 62% in the second period, and 45% in the third period. These cost savings were achieved through increased trading participation, as evidenced by higher trading ratios and greater traded permit volumes across scenarios. Across the three evaluated periods, each consisting of seven trading scenarios, equitable permit allocation led to significant reductions in total abatement costs, with reduction of 58%, 62%, and 45% in the first, second, and third periods, respectively, while maintaining compliance with BOD standards. These findings highlight those scenarios with higher equity indices facilitated greater participation in trading, leading to increased cost savings and promoting collaborative pollution control among dischargers. The proposed TRS model effectively balances economic efficiency and fairness, offering a viable solution for sustainable water quality management. Ensuring fairness in permit allocation not only reduces individual treatment costs but also fosters cooperative pollution control, thereby enhancing both economic and environmental outcomes.
40205295	Advancements in constructed wetland technology: a state-of-the-art review on bio-electrochemical processes, tidal flow dynamics, and resilience to shock loads.	This research article presents a comprehensive examination of recent advancements in constructed wetland technology, with a primary focus on bio-electrochemical processes, including electrolysis and microbial fuel cells, as well as the impact of tidal flow and shock loads on the constructed wetland performance. To date, extensive studies and in-depth analyses in these aspects are limited, highlighting a significant research gap. Electrolysis is explored for its efficacy in dephosphorization and denitrification, particularly under conditions of low carbon availability. Additionally, microbial fuel cell technology is investigated for its dual benefits of bioenergy generation and climate change mitigation. The tidal flow component is highlighted for its ability to create anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic environments within and between cells, crucial for effective nitrogen removal. The study emphasizes the importance of constructed wetland resilience to shock loads, whether from increased discharge due to rainfall or heightened contaminant levels. The research employs bibliographic analysis and microbial community profiling and investigates factors such as nutrient removal, polarization curves, and the effects of flood/rest and flood/drain in tidal flow. Furthermore, the article delves into the impacts of hydraulic and organic shock loads on constructed wetland systems, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field.
40205294	Guiding Health Resource Allocation: Using Population Net Health Benefit to Align Disease Burden with Cost Effectiveness for Informed Decision Making.	Limited healthcare resources necessitate a strategic approach to their allocation. This paper highlights the importance of population net health benefit (NHB) metric as a means of aligning two existing concepts used for resource prioritization in health: burden of disease and cost effectiveness. By explicitly incorporating health opportunity costs and eligible patient population size, NHB provides a clearer understanding of the likely scale of impact of interventions on population health. Moreover, when expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, NHB enables policymakers to effectively communicate the population-level health gains from interventions relative to the existing disease burden. Using a stylized example, we demonstrate the estimation of population NHB for four alternative health interventions and its use in resource allocation decisions. The analysis reveals how variations in patient population size and health opportunity costs can significantly impact NHB estimates, ultimately influencing resource allocation decisions. The results further illustrate how NHB can be expressed as a proportion of the total disease burden, allowing for the consideration of the percentage of the overall burden addressed by each intervention. The paper demonstrates how population NHB combines cost effectiveness with components of disease burden, offering a more comprehensive approach to health intervention selection and implementation. As countries move towards universal health coverage, this metric can aid policymakers in making informed, evidence-based decisions.

Telehealth, defined by WHO, as the use of "telecommunications and virtual technology to deliver healthcare outside of traditional healthcare facilities", can facilitate a dynamic dialogue between patients and healthcare providers for timely interventions. With the increased use of telehealth facilitated by the infrastructure development during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an opportunity to utilize telehealth for PRO implementation and a need for guidelines for using PROs via telehealth. This study aimed to generate expert consensus on the utilization of PROs in telehealth.
40205291	Mendelian randomization study of lipid species reveals causal relationship with syphilis.	Although some studies have reported a possible association between lipid and the development and progression of syphilis, the overall causal relationship between lipid and syphilis remains unclear. Data abstracted from extensive genome-wide association studies were utilized to pinpoint genetic variations linked to 179 distinct lipid species. Subsequently, these variations served as instrumental variables in Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses, aimed at evaluating the causal impact of these lipid species on the occurrence of syphilis. A range of methods, including Weighted Mode, Weighted Median, Simple Mode, MR Egger, and Inverse Variance Weighted, were employed to determine the causal influence. For the purpose of sensitivity analysis, techniques such as Inverse Variance Weighted, MR-Egger, the MR Steiger test, the MR-Egger Intercept Test, and MR-PRESSO were applied. Additionally, Multivariate Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) analyses were conducted to directly assess the causal effect of lipid species on the risk of syphilis. Sterol ester (SE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) could potentially impact syphilis risk. Specifically, SE (27:1/16:0), SE (27:1/18:2), SE (27:1/18:3), SE (27:1/20:3), and SE (27:1/22:6) were linked to an elevated risk of syphilis. PC (18:2_0:0) was linked to an elevated risk of syphilis. In contrast, PC (16:1_18:0) exhibited a protective role against syphilis. No heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was detected. SE (27:1/16:0), SE (27:1/18:2), SE(27:1/18:3), SE (27:1/20:3), and SE (27:1/22:6) were no longer significantly associated with syphilis in the MVMR analysis (P>0.05). In addition, the previously observed effect of PC (18:2_0:0) on syphilis in univariate MR Was no longer significant in MVMR analysis. However, genetically predicted PC (16:1_18:0) was still significantly negatively associated with syphilis, consistent with univariate MR analysis. We observed that hereditary SE and PC levels appear to be associated with syphilis susceptibility. Future research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this supposed causation and to develop corresponding treatment strategies.
40205290	Anti-breast cancer activity of a novel genetically engineered fusion protein composed of HER2 affibody and proapoptotic peptide R8-KLA.	HER2-positive breast cancer is an aggressive subtype with unfavorable prognoses. Although HER2-targeted agents represented by monoclonal antibodies have achieved remarkable success in the clinic, there are still a substantial number of patients with disease relapse. Recently, multifunctional fusion proteins obtained via genetic engineering technology have received much attention in targeted tumor therapy, especially in breast cancer. In this study, we genetically engineered a novel recombinant fusion protein, named HMK, which was designed as a bifunctional construct including the HER2-specific affibody Z<sub>HER2:342</sub> for targeted receptor recognition, and a proapoptotic module featuring a cell-penetrating octa-arginine (R8) motif conjugated to an antimicrobial peptide KLA. High-purity HMK proteins were successfully obtained using E. coli expression system and Ni-Nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification method. HMK exhibited higher cytotoxicity in HER2-positive breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 (IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.36 ± 0.62 μM) compared to normal breast epithelial cells MCF-10A (IC<sub>50</sub> of 32.40 ± 2.93 μM), demonstrating favorable selectivity. HMK induced apoptosis in SK-BR-3 cells via activating both endogenous and exogenous apoptotic pathways, as evidenced by the cleavage of Caspase 8, Caspase 9, Caspase 3, and PARP. Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD significantly reversed the function of HMK in SK-BR-3 cells, suggesting that caspase-dependent apoptosis was crucial for the anti-breast cancer activity of HMK. Our results suggested that HMK protein may have the potential to become a candidate molecule for HER2-positive breast cancer treatment.

40205287	Recent Advancements for Enhanced Biocatalyst and Biotransformation.	Enzymes are essential biological macromolecules with various biological and industrial applications. As modern applications of enzymes as biocatalysts are increasingly explored, the demand for enzymes with improved catalytic properties is also increasing exponentially. Since most commercially available enzymes have a problem with long-term stability and activity under various industrial conditions, the exploration of different environments using omics technology and biotransformation of these proteins to improve stability is being recognized. Direct evolution, structure-based rational design, or de novo synthesis methods are used for enzyme engineering and developing novel enzymes with unique catalytic activity and high stability. The review provides an overview of the different classes of industrially important enzymes, their sources, and the various enzyme engineering methods used to increase their efficiency. The importance of enzyme engineering concerning the development of other techniques in the field of molecular biology is also examined.
40205286	Average Biomechanical Responses of the Human Brain Grouped by Age and Sex.	Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) occur from rapid head motion that results in brain deformation. Computational models are typically used to estimate brain deformation to predict risk of injury and evaluate the effectiveness of safety countermeasures. The accuracy of these models relies on validation to experimental brain deformation data. In this study, we create the first group-average biomechanical responses of the brain, including structure, material properties, and deformation response, by age and sex from 157 subjects. Subjects were sorted intro three age groups-young, mid-age, and older-and by sex to create group-average neuroanatomy, material properties, and brain deformation response to non-injurious loading using structural and specialized magnetic resonance imaging data. Computational models were also built using the group-average geometry and material properties for each of the six groups. The material properties did not depend on sex, but showed a decrease in shear stiffness in the older adult group. The brain deformation response also showed differences in the distribution of strain and a decrease in the magnitude of maximum strain in the older adult group. The computational models were simulated using the same non-injurious loading conditions as the subject data. While the models' strain response showed differences among the models, there were no clear relationships with age. Further studies, both modeling and experimental, with more data from subjects in each age group, are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the observed changes in strain response with age, and for computational models to better match the trends observed across the group-average responses.
40205285	ATF6 activation promotes tumorigenesis and drug resistance in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by regulating the mTOR/S6K signaling pathway.	This study analyzes the expression and functional role of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and its effects on disease progression. ATF6, a core component of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, participates in many cellular activities and notably contributes to tumorigenesis. Through a combination of techniques, including immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to assess ATF6 and pS6K levels, siRNA-mediated ATF6 knockdown, cytotoxicity assays, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), as well as Western blotting, this study clarified the functioning mechanisms of ATF6 in DLBCL and its potential clinical relevance. Further exploration of ATF6's involvement in the mTORC1 pathway was achieved through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Our findings demonstrate that ATF6 expression is upregulated in DLBCL and linked to poor prognosis, particularly in people aged over 60 with Ann Arbor stage III-IV disease, B symptoms, non-GCB subtype, an international prognostic index (IPI) score greater than 2, and extranodal involvement. Notably, the ATF6 inhibitor ceapinA7 was shown to suppress ATF6 and mTORC1 activation, leading to less cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in DLBCL cells. Additionally, ceapinA7 increased the sensitivity of DLBCL cells to adriamycin. The foregoing results underscore the critical role of ATF6 in DLBCL and lay a theoretical and experimental foundation for future targeted therapies and drug development aimed at improving treatment outcomes for DLBCL.
40205284	Epigenetic Modifications in Vitiligo.	Vitiligo is an autoimmune depigmenting skin disorder and can affect the mental health of the patients. Current research suggests that the development of vitiligo involves a combination of genetic susceptibility, immune imbalance, and oxidative stress. However, its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Epigenetic modification has gained increasing attention as an emerging way to regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Currently known modes of epigenetic modification include the regulation of non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modification. Studies suggest they play important roles in tumors, immune disorders, and inflammatory diseases. In recent years, the value of epigenetics in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of vitiligo has been explored. They showed the potential to serve as biomarkers and play a therapeutic role. In this review, we summarize the epigenetic modification mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, including physiological processes such as immune homeostasis, melanocyte survival, cell adhesion and migration, and metabolism. This will help us fully understand the progress of epigenetic research in vitiligo and lay the foundation for targeted therapeutic-related research.

40205278	A study of booster dose influenza vaccination responses compared to standard dose in lupus patients: an open-labeled, randomized controlled study.	Despite receiving an annual influenza vaccination, lupus patients showed a decline in immunological responses for various reasons. This study aimed to assess immune responses after booster- (BD) and standard-dose (SD) quadrivalent influenza vaccine and the adverse events and incidence of influenza infection among lupus patients. A randomized controlled trial was conducted between March 2021 and May 2022 at Ramathibodi Hospital. All lupus patients were stratified into two groups depending on the depth of immunosuppressive therapy and randomized to receive either BD or SD. Hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) before vaccination and 4 weeks after completion of the vaccination series were assessed. The incidence of influenza infection and vaccine-associated adverse events were recorded. A total of 109 lupus patients completed the HAI analysis. 54/109 patients were in high- (HI), and 55/109 were in low-level immunosuppressive (LI) groups. Focusing at the rates to achieve HAI ≥ 1:160, in the LI group, the rates after SD were 85.5% for H1N1, 69.2% for H3N2/Hongkong, 82.8% for H3N2/Cambodia, 85.5% for B/Victoria, and 81.8% for B/Yamagata. After BD, the HAI titer rates of ≥ 1:160 cut point were increased in all strains, approaching 100%, similar to the HI group. There was one documented influenza infection during the 12-month follow-up period in LI who received SD. No serious adverse events associated with influenza vaccination were recorded. A booster dose of influenza vaccination may provide a higher HAI titer among lupus patients. The booster influenza vaccine regimen was considered safe in the BD group. Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20230610003.
40205277	The role of budget impact in reimbursement decisions in The Netherlands: interviews with decision-makers and pharmaceutical industry representatives.	Economic evaluations of health technologies increasingly encompass a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and a supplementary budget impact analysis (BIA) to inform reimbursement decisions on health technologies. Evidence from the Netherlands suggests that CEA requirements are consistent between the different stages of the decision-making process in the Netherlands, while BIA requirements are not. It remains unclear why aspects of BIAs vary in form and importance across decision stages, and why BIA results do not have a clear and consistent relationship with CEA results. Therefore, this study aimed to obtain further insight into the role of budget impact in the different stages of the decision-making process in the Netherlands, and into the experiences of decision-makers that may explain the variation in use of BIA across these stages. To meet this aim, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 decision-makers and 3 pharmaceutical industry representatives. Our findings indicate that BIAs serve multiple purposes depending on the responsibilities and needs of decision-makers in a specific decision stage. Each purpose may be relatively well-defined, and decision-makers seemingly have a clear understanding of the evidence on (aspects of) budget impact required for achieving their specific purpose. For example, the selection of pharmaceuticals for assessment is based on the maximum financial risk associated with reimbursement, discarding evidence on savings and substitution effects in other budgets and sectors, while these broader healthcare and societal elements are included during the appraisal stage. Hence, a clear framework for the consistent use of evidence on budget impact across decision stages has not yet been established.
40205276	Improving ectomycorrhizal colonization and morpho-physiological traits of Pinus cooperi seedlings through organic nitrogen fertilization.	Mycorrhizal associations play a crucial role in afforestation efforts, as they enhance the acquisition of nutrients and water, thereby supporting seedling establishment. However, the influence of nitrogen (N) forms in the soil, particularly the organic N, on the formation of mycorrhizal associations and their subsequent effects on seedling morpho-physiology remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the mycorrhizal colonization, along with morpho-physiological and functional traits, in Pinus cooperi seedlings following fertilization with organic N in controlled nursery conditions. A factorial experiment was performed with Pinus cooperi C. E. Blanco seedlings using two N sources: organic N (amino acids) and inorganic N (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) and two N doses: low and high (60 vs 200 mg N seedling<sup>-1</sup>). Seedlings were inoculated with a mixture of native fungi, but the phylogenetic analysis showed that Suillus placidus (Bonord.) Singer was the only species colonizing roots. Organic N promoted similar morphology and nutritional status as inorganic N, though at a low N rate, it improved root growth and mycorrhizal colonization. High N fertilization improved seedling growth and nutritional status but reduced mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhizal colonization improved needle P concentration, delayed plant desiccation, and reduced root cellular damage when seedlings were subjected to desiccation, though it decreased plant growth and needle N concentration. We conclude that organic N fertilization improves mycorrhization of P. cooperi with S. placidus, but the fertilization dose should be adjusted to meet species-specific requirements in order to optimize plant quality and promote afforestation success.

However, the precise roles of ECs in this progression remain poorly defined.
40205273	Radiofrequency-based wearable sensor patch in heart failure management: a focused review.	ZOLL Heart Failure Management System (ZOLL HFMS) is a non-invasive, remote monitoring device that employs radiofrequency signals transmitted through an adhesive patch embedded with integrated sensors to evaluate lung fluid levels. By analyzing trends in lung fluid status and related parameters, ZOLL HFMS may facilitate the early detection of heart failure (HF) decompensation and enable timely interventions. Insights from the recent BMAD trial (Impact of heart failure management using thoracic fluid monitoring from a novel wearable sensor: Results of the Benefits of Microcor [µCor™] in Ambulatory Heart Failure) highlight its promise in those with recent HF hospitalization, demonstrating a reduction in time to first HF readmission and improvement in quality of life. In this review, we summarize data on the ZOLL HFMS, with a focus on its lung fluid analysis mechanism for early HF decompensation detection and the accuracy of its measurements compared to other modalities. Then, we examine key outcomes from the recent BMAD trial, highlighting their clinical relevance and identifying gaps that warrant further investigation in future clinical trials. Lastly, we outline potential directions for integrating this technology into routine HF management.
40205272	Polymer Anchored Cinchona Alkaloids: Synthesis and their Applications in Organo-Catalysis.	Cinchona alkaloids are naturally occurring chiral molecules that have emerged as catalysts in asymmetric organocatalysis especially in enantioselective transformations because of their inherent chirality and unique structural features. Immobilizing these alkaloids on polymeric supports has significantly influenced their use in catalysis. Polymer-anchored cinchona alkaloids combine the catalytic efficacy of cinchona derivatives with additional benefits of polymer chain, such as ease of recovery, recyclability, reusability, and reduced environmental impact. These polymer-supported cinchona alkaloids have found wide applications in enantioselective reactions such as Michael addition, aldol condensations, Henry reaction, dimerization reaction, dihydroxylation, and benzylation. Various strategies have been employed for anchoring cinchona alkaloids onto polymers, including covalent attachment of alkaloids in the polymer side chain or main chain, and ionic attachment of alkaloids via quaternization in the main chain or side chain of polymer. This review focuses on the various synthetic methodologies for the preparation of polymer-anchored cinchona alkaloids and their application in numerous asymmetric transformations.
40205271	An acidic microenvironment promotes lymphatic metastasis of melanoma by Thy-1 in endothelial cells and integrin αvβ3 in tumor cells.	Melanoma tissues exhibit an acidic microenvironment compared with that of surrounding normal tissues. However, the effects of acidic conditions on the lymphatic metastasis, a crucial prognostic factor for patients with melanoma, are unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of the acidic microenvironment in the function of lymphatic endothelial cells. We first conducted gene expression profiling using human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs) treated with low pH media. Based on these results, we focused on Thy-1/CD90, whose expression increased in a time-dependent manner in HDLECs under acidic conditions. Immunohistochemical analysis of primary tumor tissues in a mouse melanoma model revealed an increased expression of Thy-1 in lymphatic endothelial cells. The expression of integrin αvβ3, a receptor for Thy-1, was also up-regulated in melanoma cells under acidic conditions. The adhesion of HDLECs to melanoma cells was accelerated under acidic conditions, which was reduced by Thy-1 knockdown in HDLECs. Furthermore, lymphatic metastasis was significantly attenuated in a mouse melanoma metastasis model when inoculated with integrin αv-silenced melanoma cells. These results suggest that acid-induced Thy-1 in lymphatic endothelial cells, as well as integrin αvβ3 in melanoma cells, may promote their mutual cellular adhesion, contributing to lymphatic metastasis.
40205269	Flavonoids regulating NLRP3 inflammasome: a promising approach in alleviating diabetic peripheral neuropathy.	A common and serious side effect of diabetes is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which is characterised by gradual nerve damage brought on by oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and prolonged hyperglycemia. Studies identify NLRP3 inflammasome as a key mediator in the pathogenesis of DPN, connecting neuroinflammation and neuronal damage to metabolic failure. Because of their strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities, flavonoids, a broad class of naturally occurring polyphenols, have drawn interest as potential treatments for DPN. The various ways that flavonoids affect the NLRP3 inflammasome and their potential as a treatment for DPN are examined in this review. It has been demonstrated that flavonoids prevent NLRP3 activation, which lowers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-18 and causes neuroinflammation. Flavonoids work mechanistically by reducing oxidative stress, altering important signalling pathways, and blocking the activities of NF-κB and caspase-1, which are both essential for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Preclinical research has shown that flavonoids have strong neuroprotective benefits, and few clinical evidence also points to the potential of flavonoids to improve nerve function and lessen neuropathic pain in diabetic patients. The current review emphasises how flavonoids may be used as a treatment strategy to target inflammation in DPN caused by the NLRP3 inflammasome. By targeting important inflammatory pathways, flavonoids provide a new way to slow the progression of this debilitating illness. Further investigation into the mechanisms, clinical translation, and novel drug delivery techniques could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

40205266	Quantitative study on reducing arsenic concentration in rice by sulfur fertilizer based on meta-analysis.	Arsenic (As), a toxic metalloid, is absorbed by rice and subsequently enters the human body through the food chain. Sulfur (S) possesses the capacity to reduce As accumulation in rice tissues and has been widely researched for its contributions to enhancing soil quality. However, a clear quantitative consensus regarding the impact of S application on As bioaccumulation and bioavailability has yet to be established. To gain a more nuanced understanding of the interaction between S and As, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on 318 data sets extracted from 23 articles. Both meta-regression and subgroup analyses were employed to investigate the effect of diverse variables on As accumulation in rice. The results indicated that S had a significant dose-dependent effect on reducing As accumulation in rice. The exogenous S significantly reduced the As concentration in rice by 8.95% and the optimal S/As ratio for inhibiting As accumulation was 1-20. Apart from sulfate S, the incorporation of elemental S, persulfate, thiosulfate, and gypsum has been demonstrated to significantly reduce As accumulation in rice. The exogenous S resulted in a significant reduction in TF<sub>root to shoot</sub> content in rice, indicating that S application may impede the physiological process of As transfer from soil to the shoot of rice. Consequently, the exogenous S can effectively mitigate the As accumulation in rice, thereby offering a novel approach to reduce the As content in rice and minimize its detrimental impact on human health.

However, studies investigating the pattern of PSMA expression in primary RCC and RCC metastases according to metastatic sites are rare. 44 frozen samples of RCC, 19 primaries (9 clear cell (cc) RCC, 7 papillary (pap) RCC, and 3 chromophobe (ch) RCC) and 25 (24 samples have ccRCC histology and one is unclassified) unpaired metastases (8 from adrenals, 8 from bones, 2 from lungs, 2 from liver and 5 others (1 lymph node, 1 pancreas, 1 brain, 1 gallbladder and 1 muscle)), were available from the UroCCR project (NCT03293563). PSMA expression was assessed by autoradiography using [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 as binding agent and the specific binding (total binding-non-specific binding) was calculated and expressed as a percentage of total binding. A patient suffering from metastatic ccRCC was also administered [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 to evaluate PSMA expression.
40205263	Prognostic impact of tumor location after abdominoperineal resection of rectal cancer: A single-center propensity score matching analysis based on 1806 cases.	Randomized controlled trials have revealed that abdominoperineal resection leads to inferior oncological outcomes compared with low anterior resection, especially regarding local recurrence rates (LRRs). While neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy can lower LRRs, it is linked to potential short- and long-term radiation-induced adverse effects. Consequently, meticulous patient selection for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is imperative to balance benefits and risks.
40205262	The subclavian artery branching patterns with emphasis on the unilateral thyrovertebral trunk: a cadaver case report.	The subclavian artery is a major vessel supplying the neck and upper limbs, and significant anatomical variations are often observed in its branches. This study investigated bilateral variations in the branching of the subclavian arteries, including rare deviations such as the presence of a thyrovertebral trunk and altered origins of several branches of the subclavian arteries. The goal of this study was to contribute to the limited literature on these anomalies, which have implications for clinical practice and surgical procedures.
40205260	Autoimmune mechanisms and inflammation in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.	Obesity, characterized by the excessive accumulation of white adipose tissue, is a significant global health burden and a major risk factor for a range of diseases, including malignancies and metabolic disorders. Individuals with high visceral fat content are particularly susceptible to severe complications such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and liver disorders. However, the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic diseases extends beyond simple adiposity. Chronic obesity triggers a prolonged inflammatory response, which leads to tissue fibrosis and sustained organ damage, contributing to multi-organ dysfunction. This review explores the autoimmune mechanisms and inflammatory pathways underlying obesity-induced type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with an emphasis on their interrelated pathophysiology and the potential for therapeutic interventions.
40205259	Successful cryoablation for a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor in the maxilla causing tumor-induced osteomalacia: a case report.	A 35-year-old man was diagnosed with tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) caused by a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (PMT) in the right maxilla. The patient underwent CT-guided cryoablation at our institution, which successfully eradicated the tumor while preserving the pulpal vitality of adjacent teeth. We describe the clinical history, physical examination findings, laboratory tests, functional imaging, and follow-up protocol for evaluating treatment outcomes. Cryoablation demonstrated therapeutic efficacy through symptomatic relief, normalization of serum phosphorus levels, and maintenance of pulpal vitality, as well as preservation of neighboring natural teeth.
40205257	Assessing the Combined Toxicity of Silver and Copper Nanoparticles in Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Fingerlings.	The growing use of silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) nanoparticles (NPs) for their antimicrobial properties has raised environmental health concerns due to their coexistence in aquatic ecosystems. This study assessed the combined physiological and molecular toxicity of AgNPs and CuNPs in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of the NP mixture for 21 days. Fish were exposed to varying concentrations of co-exposure of AgNPs and CuNPs (T1 group 0.2 AgNPs + 0.2 mg/L CuNPs, T2 group 0.8 AgNPs + 0.6 mg/L CuNPs, and T3 group 1.4 AgNPs + 1.0 mg/L CuNPs). Behavioral alterations were evident, accompanied by a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and hematocrit levels, while white blood cell counts increased, indicating immune activation. Serum biochemical analyses revealed metabolic disturbances linked to oxidative stress and physiological imbalance. Enzymatic activities in gills and liver showed a dynamic response, with elevated catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels at T2 and T3 after 14 days, followed by a decline by day 21. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity increased in gills at T2 and T3 after 7 days and in the liver at T3 after 14 days, while lipid peroxidation (LPO) significantly increased in gills at T3 after 7 days and in the liver at T2 and T3 after 14 days. Molecular analysis confirmed upregulation of oxidative stress genes (SOD1, CAT) and inflammatory markers (HSP70, IL- 1β). Histopathological examination revealed gill damage, including lamellar fusion and hyperplasia, and liver degeneration, such as hepatocyte vacuolation and necrosis, with the most severe effects observed at T3. These findings highlight dose-dependent toxicity and oxidative damage caused by the AgNPs-CuONPs mixture, emphasizing its potential physiological and molecular impacts on aquatic organisms.
40205256	Eucalyptol Attenuates Lead-Induced Anxiety-like Behaviors by Suppressing Oxidative Stress and Neuroinflammation, Modulating SIRT1/NF-κB Signaling, and Upregulating BDNF Expression.	Lead is an environmental pollutant that possesses harmful effects on the nervous system. The current study was conducted to investigate the impacts of eucalyptol, a type of monoterpene, on anxiety behaviors, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death in the hippocampus of rats exposed to lead and its possible protective mechanism. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into Control, Lead, Eucalyptol, and Lead + Eucalyptol groups. The Lead and Lead + Eucalyptol groups were given lead acetate (25 mg/kg, gavage) daily for fourteen days. The Eucalyptol and Lead + Eucalyptol groups also received eucalyptol (100 mg/kg, gavage). The results showed that eucalyptol prevented an increase in malondialdehyde levels and a decrease in glutathione levels, as well as a reduction in the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes in the hippocampus of Lead + Eucalyptol animals. It also prevented an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)- 1β, and IL- 6, and a decrease in the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10. In addition, this monoterpene prevented the reduction in sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression and the increase in nuclear factor kappa b (NF-κB) expression. It enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at the level of mRNA and protein and reduced neuronal death in different subfields of the hippocampus. Eucalyptol also improved the performance of rats receiving lead acetate in elevated plus maze and open field tests. We concluded that eucalyptol reduces anxiety behaviors in lead-exposed rats by suppressing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death in the hippocampus. The anxiolytic effect of eucalyptol in lead pollution is likely mediated by modulating SIRT1/NF-κB signaling and increasing BDNF expression.
40205255	Development and Validation of an Early Recurrence Prediction Model for High-Grade Glioma Integrating Temporalis Muscle and Tumor Features: Exploring the Prognostic Value of Temporalis Muscle.	This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for early recurrence of high-grade glioma (HGG) within 180 days, assess the prognostic value of preoperative and postoperative temporalis muscle metrics (area and thickness), and explore their significance in postoperative follow-up. Seventy-one molecularly confirmed HGG patients were included, with data sourced from local data and TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive) RHUH-GBM (Río Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma) dataset. Tumor segmentation was performed using deep learning, and radiomic features were extracted following comparison with manual segmentation. Feature selection was conducted using mutual information and recursive feature elimination. A comprehensive model integrating 3D tumor radiomics and temporalis muscle metrics was developed and compared with a tumor-only model to identify the optimal predictive framework. SHAP analysis was used to evaluate model interpretability and feature importance. The TM_Tumor_HistGradientBoosting model, incorporating 16 features including temporalis muscle metrics, outperformed the tumor-only model in accuracy (0.89), recall (0.87), and F1 score (0.88). SHAP analysis highlighted that preoperative temporalis muscle cross-sectional area was strongly associated with early recurrence risk, while postoperative temporalis muscle thickness significantly contributed to recurrence prediction. Combining temporalis muscle metrics with preoperative tumor MRI substantially improved the accuracy of early recurrence prediction in HGG. Temporalis muscle metrics serve as objective and sustainable prognostic indicators with significant clinical value in postoperative follow-up.
40205254	Lignocellulose-derived inhibitors can extend residence of Clostridium beijerinckii in active solventogenic state.	Lignocellulose is a promising renewable resource for producing platform chemicals, such as acetone, butanol, and ethanol, via ABE fermentation by solventogenic clostridia. This study investigates the effects of common lignocellulose derived inhibitory compounds: ferulic acid, coumaric acid, and furfural on Clostridium beijerinckii. Dual-staining with propidium iodide and CFDA, combined with flow cytometry, was employed to assess physiological variability. The results showed that phenolic acid-induced stress helped maintain a higher proportion of viable cells during the production phase, enhancing solvent yields and reducing sporulation. At 0.4 g/L, ferulic and coumaric acids did not reduce cell viability; however, coumaric acid exposure led to an acid-crash profile. Conversely, a more robust inoculum exposed to both phenolic acids simultaneously exhibited effects similar to ferulic acid alone, including slower viability decline, reduced growth and sporulation, and improved solvent production. Furfural exposure at 1.5 g/L resulted in immediate viability loss in 20% of the population, though the overall decline accompanied by the highest sporulation rate occurred later than in the control. Additionally, furfural transformation was slower, suppressing butyrate production and reducing solvent production by 13%. This study suggests that delaying cell death mechanism may explain the stimulatory effects of inhibitors, advancing lignocellulose use in the future.
40205253	Management of Enterococcus faecalis biofilms: a combinatorial approach with phytochemical.	The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus faecalis infections was primarily due to their robust biofilm formation, highlighting the urgent need for meaningful strategies. Since combinatorial application of natural phytochemical often offer promising outcomes in dealing with microbial infections, present study indicated the pharmacological, antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of combinatorial strategies of natural phytochemical involving cuminaldehyde and thymoquinone against E. faecalis. Towards this direction, in silico analysis suggested that both compounds could show favourable oral bioavailability and high GI absorption, with a considerable solubility and drug-likeness profiles. Furthermore, in vitro antimicrobial assay indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of cuminaldehyde and thymoquinone were found to be 500 µg/mL and 30 µg/mL, respectively against E. faecalis. Thereafter, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index score of 0.73 indicated an additive effect prevailed between cuminaldehyde and thymoquinone, enhancing their antimicrobial potential. Thereafter, sub-MIC doses of cuminaldehyde (40 µg/mL) and thymoquinone (8 µg/mL) were selected to assess their antibiofilm potential. Though the compounds were able to show antibiofilm activity separately, their combination was significantly more effective, reduced biofilm formation by approximately 80%, and decreased production of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and protein content by ~ 76% and ~ 70%, respectively. Further studies revealed that the antibiofilm activity of the test compounds could likely to be attributed to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhancement of membrane permeability. Taken together, all this experimental observation revealed that combination of these natural compounds could potentially improve the treatment outcomes of biofilm-borne infections of E. faecalis.
40205252	Improve your success with fish cell lines-small things that matter.	There is a drive towards reducing animal experiments and developing robust biologically relevant in vitro models based on cell lines, including those derived from fish. At the time of writing, Cellosaurus, the knowledge base of current cell lines used in research, listed more than 900 fish cell lines in its database. One of the key challenges facing fish cell biology is the lack of fundamental technical information regarding the isolation, culture, and application of cell lines. Researchers often work in silos, encountering similar technical challenges, each spending significant time and resources overcoming the same issues for which solutions may not be readily accessible. Here, we share some of the key considerations for the isolation, culture, maintenance, and application of fish cell lines in toxicology, which we have encountered over our collective decades of experience.
40205251	Intensive care unit-acquired rectal colonization and subsequent infections with carbapenem-resistant bacteria: a cross-sectional study.	Nosocomial infections caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria (CRB) present a worldwide threat. We examined the incidence and clinical outcomes of ICU-acquired gastrointestinal colonization with CRB detected through routine weekly surveillance of rectal swabs.
40205249	The Nurse Spiritual Care Therapeutics Scale and Patient Beliefs in Indonesia: A Developmental Psychometric Study.	Across the globe, spiritual care provided by nurses is recognised as an integral component of patient care. The decision to administer this scale test was driven by the observation that the instruments employed by nurses, which are designed to be more straightforward, accessible and culturally aligned with Indonesian contexts, were not adequately addressing spiritual needs. The present study sought to assess the reliability and validity of the Indonesian version of the Nurse Spiritual Care Therapeutics Scale (NSCTS-I). The study comprised 147 participants in a pilot test and 343 participants divided into two sub-samples. Sub-sample one was used for exploratory factor analysis (EFA; 189), and sub-sample two for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; 154) of nurses working in four public hospitals who served in inpatient wards such as internal medicine wards, surgical wards, mother and child care wards, dedicated units for treating patients with COVD-19, or other treatment rooms. Construct validity was established using content validity indexing, EFA, goodness-of-fit model of a CFA which exhibited the highest comparative fit index (CFI .957), the lowest of root-mean-square-error of approximation (RMSEA .039), and standardised root-mean-square residual (SRMR .022). The analysis results indicate that the model is a well-fitted model with acceptable error margins. Correlational analysis with internal reliability of the NSCTS-I was further substantiated by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.963, thereby affirming its excellent reliability. The content validity indexing process indicated a scale CVI (S-CVI/Ave and I-CVI) of .97, an S-CVI/UA of .87, and an ICC of .927. The NSCTS-I has been developed as a tool to assess and evaluate the frequency with which Indonesian nurses provide spiritual care, with the objective of ensuring that patients' spiritual needs are met in the future.
40205248	A new person-fit statistic for the detection of aberrant responses in polytomous cognitive diagnostic models.	Assessing person-fit in cognitive diagnostic assessments is a critical research area. Inability to identify misfitting responses can lead to misinterpretation of students' attribute profiles, potentially resulting in incorrect remedial actions. Despite its importance, there is a lack of research on person-fit statistics for polytomous cognitive diagnostic models (CDM). To address this, we propose a new person-fit statistic, WR, specifically designed for polytomous items in CDMs. We evaluated WR's ability to detect three types of abnormal behaviors through simulation studies, comparing its performance with established statistics including l<sub>z</sub>, infit, and outfit. The results show that WR consistently demonstrated stable and superior detection capabilities across all experimental scenarios. Traditional methods showed inconsistent detection abilities for different anomalies; l<sub>z</sub> was more effective at detecting cheating, while infit was better for creative responses. In high-quality test environments, WR performed best, though the difference compared to traditional methods was not significant. However, in low-quality conditions, WR significantly outperformed traditional methods. Overall, WR proved to be an effective tool for detecting person misfit in polytomous scoring CDMs. Finally, we analyzed a real educational assessment data to assess the practical application of WR.

40205246	A potential therapeutic molecule target: lncRNA AK023507 inhibits the metastasis of breast cancer by regulating the WNT/DOCK4/β-catenin axis.	Breast cancer (BC) has become the most common malignant tumor in women worldwide. This study was carried out to find and validate a novel molecular therapeutic target for BC.
40205245	Identifying gene expression predictive of response to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in early breast cancer.	Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer is the most common subtype, accounting for approximately 80% of cases, with endocrine therapy as the standard postoperative treatment. However, despite risk-reducing therapies, the risk of recurrence remains substantial. Studies, including the POETIC trial, have demonstrated that low Ki67 levels following short-term neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (sNAET) are associated with a favorable prognosis. The objective of this study is to identify genes associated with the suppression of cell cycle progression by sNAET in postmenopausal patients with ER-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer.
40205244	MIS18BP1 promotes bladder cancer cell proliferation and growth via inactivating P53 signaling pathway.	MIS18 bonding protein 1 (MIS18BP1) is a subunit of MIS18 complex, accumulated specifically at telophase-G1 centromere and regulated apoptosis, proliferation and migration in cancer cells. The mechanisms about how MIS18BP1 regulate Bladder Cancer (BCa) cell development have not been previously unknown. We analyzed MIS18BP1 differential expression in BCa by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene-Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Universal Protein database. The expression of MIS18BP1 mRNA was tested using qRT-PCR. The expression of MIS18BP1 protein was examined by western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. T24 cells were transfected with an LV -MIS18BP1 -RNAi vector to decrease the MIS18BP1 expression. We used a series of experiments to detect the survival, proliferation and migration of T24. The apoptosis was analyzed by Flow cytometry assays. The expression of P53, BAX and Cleaved Casepase-3 was detected by western blot. P53 apoptosis-related proteins, proliferation and migration of cells were analyzed before and after treatment with P53 inhibitors. The expression of MIS18BP1 was higher in BCa tissues compared with control group. Its expression was in relation to clinical stage, depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis. We found that genes closely related to MIS18BP1 are mainly associated with cell cycle, chromosome separation and DNA repair in biological processes. After transfection, we found the proliferative capacity of T24 was significantly reduced. Transwell migration and scratch experiment demonstrated decreased migration. Meanwhile, downregulation of MIS18BP1 resulted in an increase in cell apoptosis. In addition, P53, BAX and Cleaved Casepase-3 were increased, whereas BCL2 protein was decreased in the MIS18BP1-downregulated T24. After treatment with Pifithrin-α, the phenotype of cell proliferation inhibition was restored. MIS18BP1 overexpression may be regulated to poor prognosis in BCa patients. MIS18BP1 may associated with cell apoptosis and proliferation in BC cells. This process may be mediated by P53 signal pathway.
40205243	Effect of air-thinning a two-step adhesive layer on bond strength to tooth substrates.	This study investigated the effect of air-thinning to a two-step adhesive (G2-BOND Universal) on the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) between bovine teeth (enamel, dentin) and a resin composite (G-ænial A'CHORD). The adhesive was applied with or without air-blowing before light curing on the bovine enamel and dentin surfaces finished using 320-grit SiC paper. After resin composite buildup, µTBS specimens (1.0 mm × 1.0 mm cross-sectional area) were fabricated. The µTBS values were determined 24 h, 4 weeks, and 6 months after the specimen preparation. Furthermore, the adhesive layer thicknesses were measured on the SEM photographs of the specimens' fractured site after the µTBS test. Except for the enamel specimens at 6 months, no significant differences were observed in µTBS determined at any time periods between specimens with and without air-blowing (p > 0.05). µTBS values in air-blown specimens increased from 24 h to 4 weeks, and the values in non-air-blown specimens were greater at 6 months than at 24 h. Specimens subjected to air-blowing showed significantly thinner adhesive layer than those without at any time periods (p < 0.05). Although air-blowing reduced adhesive layer thickness, it did not affect the bond strength except for the enamel specimens at 6 months.
40205242	Monolithic capillary electrochromatographic system based on gold nanoparticles and chitosan chiral molecularly imprinted polymers for enantioseparation of metolachlor and separation of structural analogs.	A novel monolithic capillary column (AuNPs@CMIP(poly-Chitosan)@capillary) with hybridized chiral molecular imprinted polymers (CMIPs) as stationary phase was prepared using S-metolachlor (S-MET) as template, chitosan as functional monomer, glutaraldehyde as cross-linker, and aminated-gold nanoparticles (NH<sub>2</sub>-AuNPs) as nanocarriers. The capillary electrochromatography (CEC) system constructed by AuNPs@CMIP(poly-Chitosan)@capillary achieved the efficient chiral separation of MET (resolution (Rs) = 9.83) as well as separation of its various structural analogs (Rs > 1.58). In addition, AuNPs@CMIP(poly-Chitosan)@capillary exhibits satisfactory reproducibility and stability. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of migration times and Rs for intra-day, inter-day, and inter-column were all less than 6.1%, and no significant decline in separation performance was observed after 21 days of storage. NH<sub>2</sub>-AuNPs, with their large specific surface area and stable structure, can provide abundant binding sites and play a supporting role, reducing the deformation and collapse of CMIPs' cavities, and further ensuring the structural stability and separation performance of the stationary phase. Finally, parameters such as imprinting factor and selectivity factor were calculated by adsorption experiments, and the CEC separation mechanism was discussed. The chitosan CMIPs-based capillary monolithic column developed in this work has rarely been reported and is an innovative attempt, providing a feasible and promising approach for the development of CEC chiral monolithic stationary phases.
40205241	Roles of Immunity and Endogenous Retroelements in the Pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Treatment Strategies.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints. RA usually results in synovial hyperplasia, expansion of "pannus" and destruction of cartilage. The etiology and pathogenesis of RA are not fully understood, but immunity has been shown to play an important role in the development of autoimmune diseases such as RA. In addition, endogenous retroelements, the remnants of ancient retroviruses in the human genome, are involved in cancer and/or immune disorders. As evidenced by increasing evidences that the aberrant expression of retroelements induces innate immunity, despite the fact that the expression of most retroelements has been epigenetically suppressed over a long period of evolution. With the continuous development of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), RA disease activity has been alleviated and improved. Unfortunately, some patients have a limited response to DMARDs, and the drugs also have the disadvantages of some side effects and high economic costs. This review summarizes the pathogenic mechanisms of RA and endogenous retroelements in autoimmunity, and concludes with a summary of treatments for RA, along with new therapeutic recommendations.
40205240	Applications of endophytic fungi in plant disease control.	Diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) have resulted in the quality and yield of crops, which has seriously affected the development of the agricultural economy. The prolonged use of chemical fungicides for prevention and control can lead to environmental pollution, hindering the sustainable development of safe and eco-friendly agriculture while also promoting the resistance of pathogenic microorganisms. Nevertheless, non-pathogenic endophytic fungi that form symbiotic relationships with plants still exhibit significant antagonistic effects on pathogenic microorganisms, even in small concentrations. These fungi pose no threat to human health and are highly beneficial to the ecological environment, making them an ideal alternative to chemical fungicides. They are increasingly being recognized and have been subjected to comprehensive research. Based on this, this article summarizes the types of endophytic fungi with biocontrol effects in recent years. It focuses on elucidating the mechanisms of their biocontrol from physiological and molecular perspectives. In addition, the application and development challenges of biocontrol agents (BCAs) derived from these fungi are also discussed, including difficulties in elucidating their mechanisms of action during research and development, challenges in strain selection and improvement, difficulties in controlling environmental adaptability, and stringent storage conditions. The aim is to develop more effective endophytic fungi as emerging biocontrol resources for agricultural production.
40205239	Clipless robot-assisted Retzius-sparing radical prostatectomy: a study on its safety profile and outcomes.	Retzius-sparing RARP (RS-RARP) is a modification of the standard RARP technique that traditionally requires clips to control the pedicles. We aimed to retrospectively analyze the operative, oncological, and functional outcomes of this altogether 'clipless' approach to RS-RARP from our centre. The study was conducted as a retrospective audit in our department. We included consecutive patients who underwent clipless-RS-RARP in our centre from February 2023 to December 2023. The clipless RS-RARP was done with the daVinci Xi system in all cases (primary surgeon-author WAC). No clips were used in these procedures and the preoperative, intra-operative, and postoperative data were recorded with at least 3 months of follow-up. Continence was defined as zero pad usage. A total of 138 patients underwent RS-RAP using the clipless technique during the study period. The median age was 64 years, with a median BMI of 27.25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 88.41% were ISUP 1-3 group patients. 82.61% were cT2, 17.39% were cT3, and 13.77% had median lobe in MRI. The mean console time was 99 min, with 81.16% having bilateral nerve spare, 17.39% unilateral spare, and 1.45% having none. 38.41% were fit to be discharged on the same day/evening of admission/surgery. There were no major complications (Clavien-Dindo [CD] ≥ 3) or postoperative bleeding. The margin positivity rate was 19.50%, of which 62.95% were stage ≥ pT3a. The continence rates were 86.2% at 6 weeks 89.1% at 3 months and 93.4% at 6 months. The potency and biochemical recurrence rates were 79% and 3.6%, respectively, at 6 months.Clipless RS-RARP is a safe procedure with good oncological and early continence recovery. This modification avoids clip-related complications without the expense of any higher complication rates compared to a standard RARP.
40205236	Avian influenza A(H5N6) virus detected during live-poultry market surveillance linked to a human infection in Changsha, China, from 2020 to 2023.	In November 2022, we reported a fatal case of human infection caused by a highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N6) virus bearing a clade 2.3.4.4b HA gene in Changsha City. We investigated the transmission route and distribution of the H5N6 virus in the largest live-poultry market (LPM), which is linked to the human infection. A total of 1357 samples from the LPM were collected for avian influenza A virus detection from 2020 to 2023. The proportion of LPM samples positive for H5 subtype avian influenza virus was 14.30% (194/1357). Sequences of H5N6 (n = 10) and H5N1 (n = 4) avian influenza viruses were obtained from the LPM samples using next-generation sequencing. The complete genome sequence of the H5N6 virus from the human infection case, A/Changsha/1/2022(EPI_ISL_16466440), was determined and analyzed. The PB1 and PB2 segments shared 99.65% and 99.23% sequence identity with A/duck/Hunan/S40199/2021(H5N6) and A/Whooper swan/Sanmenxia/H615/2020(H5N8), respectively. The other segments showed the highest sequence similarity to strain A/Guangdong/1/2021(H5N6), which was isolated in Guangzhou. L89V and I292V substitutions in the PB2 protein were predicted from the A/Changsha/1/2022 genome sequence. Phylogenetic analysis based on the HA gene showed that A/Changsha/1/2022 and other H5 subtype isolates obtained from the LPM grouped together in the 2.3.4.4b branch. Bayesian evolutionary analysis of the HA gene showed that clade 2.3.4.4b of the H5N6 virus is likely to have been prevalent in Hunan Province around October 2021. In conclusion, we confirmed that the clade 2.3.4.4b HA gene of A/Changsha/1/2022 virus recombined with those of local strains. These results demonstrate the importance of continuous surveillance of H5N6 influenza viruses.

Chrysomya megacephala is a forensically important dipteran that significantly facilitates the estimation of Post Mortem Interval (PMI) in forensic entomology. In this study, we investigated the sublethal effects of monocrotophos, a widely used insecticide, on third-instar larvae of Chrysomya megacephala.
40205234	Innovations in graphene-based electrochemical biosensors in healthcare applications.	The isolation of a single atomic layer of graphite, known as graphene, marked a fundamental moment that transformed the field of materials science. Graphene-based nanomaterials are recognized for their superior biocompatibility compared with many other types of nanomaterials. Moreover, one of the main reasons for the growing interest in graphene is its potential applications in emerging technologies. Its key characteristics, including high electrical conductivity, excellent intrinsic charge carrier mobility, optical transparency, substantial specific surface area, and remarkable mechanical flexibility, position it as an ideal candidate for applications in solar cells and touch screens. Its durability further establishes graphene as a strong contender for developing robust materials. To date, a variety of methods, such as traditional spectroscopic techniques and chromatographic approaches, have been developed for detecting biomolecules, drugs, and heavy metals. Electrochemical methods, known for their portability, selectivity, and impressive sensitivity, offer considerable convenience for both patients and professionals in point-of-care diagnostics. Recent advancements have significantly improved the capacity for rapid and accurate detection of analytes in trace amounts, providing substantial benefits in biosensor technology. Additionally, the integration of nanotechnology has markedly enhanced the sensitivity and selectivity of electrochemical sensors, yielding significantly improved results. Innovations such as point-of-care, lab-on-a-chip, implantable devices, and wearable sensors are discussed in this review.
40205233	Healthcare professionals' perspectives on and experiences with non-invasive prenatal testing: a systematic review.	The increasing integration of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) into antenatal practice and public healthcare systems globally raises both significant challenges in standardising service delivery and important ethical questions around routinisation and reproductive autonomy. This systematic review aims to synthesise existing primary empirical research on healthcare professionals' views on and experiences with NIPT.
40205232	Dissipation kinetics, safety evaluation and decontamination of residues of the combi-formulation emamectin benzoate 1.50% + fipronil 3.50% SC in/on chilli.	A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the persistence of emamectin benzoate 1.50% + fipronil 3.50% SC at recommended and 1.25 times the recommended doses on green, red chilli fruits and soil. QuEChERS method was validated for reliable and effective analysis of residues in green, red chilli fruits and soil matrices. Limit of quantification (LOQ) for emamectin benzoate and fipronil on chilli was 0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.002 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Initial deposits of emamectin benzoate and fipronil on green chilli at X dose were 0.261 and 0.321 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively and at 1.25X dose residues were 0.319 and 0.394 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Whereas, initial deposits of emamectin benzoate and fipronil on chilli cropped soil at X dose were 0.015 and 0.143 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively and at 1.25 X dose were 0.260 and 0.171 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. In red chilli fruits, the residues of both the test insecticides were found < LOQ at final harvest at both the doses. Safe waiting periods of 5.26 and 9.06 days for emamectin benzoate and fipronil as combi-product was suggested at X and 1.25 X dose, respectively. The half-lives for test combi-product ranged between 1.26 and 1.71 days. Dietary risk assessment revealed that Theoretical Maximum Daily Intake (TMDI) was < Maximum Permissible Intake (MPI), while Hazard Quotient (HQ) was < 1, thus indicating the combi-product to be safe for consumption. Treating chilli fruits with lukewarm water + 5% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution for 10 min removed maximum residues (63.82%) and proved as a good house hold practice.
40205231	Decision regret after external beam radiotherapy and high dose-rate brachytherapy boost for prostate cancer.	Patients with localized prostate cancer have various treatment options. Decision regret from a patient's view is an unpleasant feeling concerning a decision in health care. We aimed to explore regret and its determinants after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a high dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) boost as traditional method of treatment intensification.
40205229	The current state and implications of pre-operative fasting time in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Previous clinical practice suggests that prolonged fasting could negatively impact their hemodynamic stability and lead to children's dissatisfaction with the perioperative experience. Fasting guidelines for children are frequently updated. This study aims to explore the status of pre-operative fasting time in children and observe the practice of guidelines in clinical practice. A comprehensive search was conducted until 27 March 2024 in English. We used Stata14.0 for meta-analysis. We used the JBI cross-sectional study quality assessment tool to evaluate the quality. We applied a random effects model to conduct a separate meta-regression analysis on the age and the sample size. Our meta-analysis included 10 studies, with 1694 and 3527 children respectively included in solid and liquid fasting time. The effect magnitude of pre-operative solids fasting time was 12.694 [95% confidence interval (CI), 11.962-13.426, I<sup>2</sup>: 94.2%, p = 0.001], and the liquid fasting time was 8.379 (95% CI, 6.031-10.727, I<sup>2</sup>: 99.7%, p < 0.001), both exceedingly greater than twice the recommended time in the guidelines. The duration of preoperative fasting in children differs significantly from international guidelines, and evidence-based improvements are needed in clinical practice. Future research should focus on existing obstacles and how to address them.

40205226	[Onychomycosis in children and adolescents-case report and overview of the literature].	Fungal nail infections in children and adolescents are on the rise worldwide. Diagnosis and, above all, treatment is a challenge. A 15-year-old girl had been suffering from onychomycosis of the toenails for more than 6 years, and later also of a fingernail on her right hand. Trichophyton (T.) rubrum had already been identified by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the pathogen years ago. However, treatment attempts with topical antimycotics and fluconazole did not lead to a cure. Mycological diagnostics using PCR and sequencing of the ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) region of the rDNA of the dermatophyte confirmed the diagnosis of tinea unguium caused by T. rubrum. Ciclopiroxolamine-containing water-soluble nail varnish and oral terbinafine were used for treatment, both in off-label use and with the consent of the girl's parents. Terbinafine was given continuously once daily and subsequently intermittently once weekly. After 7 months of combined antifungal therapy, the nail mycosis of the fingernails and toenails healed completely. The endpoint of the therapy was clinical healing and negative PCR for T. rubrum. There have been no recurrences over the past more than 3 years-first under prophylaxis with the antifungal nail varnish.

40205224	Shigella flexneri evades LPS ubiquitylation through IpaH1.4-mediated degradation of RNF213.	Pathogens have evolved diverse strategies to counteract host immunity. Ubiquitylation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on cytosol-invading bacteria by the E3 ligase RNF213 creates 'eat me' signals for antibacterial autophagy, but whether and how cytosol-adapted bacteria avoid LPS ubiquitylation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the enterobacterium Shigella flexneri actively antagonizes LPS ubiquitylation through IpaH1.4, a secreted effector protein with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. IpaH1.4 binds to RNF213, ubiquitylates it and targets it for proteasomal degradation, thus counteracting host-protective LPS ubiquitylation. To understand how IpaH1.4 recognizes RNF213, we determined the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the IpaH1.4-RNF213 complex. The specificity of the interaction is achieved through the leucine-rich repeat of IpaH1.4, which binds the RING domain of RNF213 by hijacking the conserved RING interface required for binding to ubiquitin-charged E2 enzymes. IpaH1.4 also targets other E3 ligases involved in inflammation and immunity through binding to the E2-interacting face of their RING domains, including the E3 ligase LUBAC that is required for the synthesis of M1-linked ubiquitin chains on cytosol-invading bacteria downstream of RNF213. We conclude that IpaH1.4 has evolved to antagonize multiple antibacterial and proinflammatory host E3 ligases.
40205223	Ion-conducting and gating molecular mechanisms of channelrhodopsin revealed by true-atomic-resolution structures of open and closed states.	Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) have emerged as major optogenetics tools, particularly in neuroscience. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanism of ChR opening remains elusive. Moreover, all reported structures of ChRs correspond to either a closed or an early intermediate state and lack the necessary level of detail owing to the limited resolution. Here we present the structures of the closed and open states of a cation-conducting ChR, OLPVR1, from Organic Lake phycodnavirus, belonging to the family of viral ChRs solved at 1.1- and 1.3-Å resolution at physiologically relevant pH conditions (pH 8.0). OLPVR1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and crystallized using an in meso approach, and the structures were solved by X-ray crystallography. We also present the structure of the OLPVR1 protonated state at acidic pH (pH 2.5) at 1.4-Å resolution. Together, these three structures elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the channel's opening and permeability in detail. Extensive functional studies support the proposed mechanisms. Channel opening is controlled by isomerization of the retinal cofactor, triggering protonation of proton acceptors and deprotonation of proton donors located in the three gates of the channel. The E51 residue in the core of the central gate (similar to E90 of ChR2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) plays a key role in the opening of the channel. E51 flips out of the gate and towards the proton acceptor D200 (D253 in ChR2 in C. reinhardtii), establishing a hydrogen bond between them. Despite differences in subfamilies of ChRs, they share a common gate-cavity architecture, suggesting that they could have similar general gating mechanisms. These results enabled us to design viral rhodopsin with improved properties for optogenetic applications. The structural data and mechanisms might also be helpful for better understanding other ChRs and their engineering.
40205222	Appropriate excision surgery reduces intrahepatic bile duct dilatation in pediatric patients with congenital biliary dilatation.

40205204	Enhanced recovery after urological reconstructive surgery in pediatric patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a protocol that includes rules aimed to minimize surgical stress and to reduce the post-operative period. Initially applied in intestinal surgery of adults, a recent meta-analysis suggested that ERAS is valid also in pediatric gastrointestinal surgery. This study systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate ERAS benefits in pediatric urological reconstructive surgery. A PubMed search identified studies comparing ERAS and traditional protocols in pediatric urological reconstructive surgery. Data on major and minor complications, hospital readmission, and length of hospital stay were collected and analyzed. Analyses were performed using OR and Cl 95%. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 10 papers met the inclusion criteria, with 1410 included patients (492 ERAS group, 918 No-ERAS). There were significant differences in major complications (p < 0.001) and length of stay (p < 0.001) and the incidence of minor complications (p = 0.002) favoring patients undergoing ERAS protocol; differently, there was no difference in hospital readmission (p = 0.763). ERAS protocol is safe and feasible for children undergoing reconstructive urological surgery, reducing the risks of complications and the length of hospital stay, without increasing readmission risk. ERAS should also be a standardized procedure in pediatric reconstructive urological surgery.

40205199	Plasma phospho-tau217 for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in primary and secondary care using a fully automated platform.	Global implementation of blood tests for Alzheimer's disease (AD) would be facilitated by easily scalable, cost-effective and accurate tests. In the present study, we evaluated plasma phospho-tau217 (p-tau217) using predefined biomarker cutoffs. The study included 1,767 participants with cognitive symptoms from 4 independent secondary care cohorts in Malmö (Sweden, n = 337), Gothenburg (Sweden, n = 165), Barcelona (Spain, n = 487) and Brescia (Italy, n = 230), and a primary care cohort in Sweden (n = 548). Plasma p-tau217 was primarily measured using the fully automated, commercially available, Lumipulse immunoassay. The primary outcome was AD pathology defined as abnormal cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42:p-tau181. Plasma p-tau217 detected AD pathology with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.93-0.96. In secondary care, the accuracies were 89-91%, the positive predictive values 89-95% and the negative predictive values 77-90%. In primary care, the accuracy was 85%, the positive predictive values 82% and the negative predictive values 88%. Accuracy was lower in participants aged ≥80 years (83%), but was unaffected by chronic kidney disease, diabetes, sex, APOE genotype or cognitive stage. Using a two-cutoff approach, accuracies increased to 92-94% in secondary and primary care, excluding 12-17% with intermediate results. Using the plasma p-tau217:Aβ42 ratio did not improve accuracy but reduced intermediate test results (≤10%). Compared with a high-performing mass-spectrometry-based assay for percentage p-tau217, accuracies were comparable in secondary care. However, percentage p-tau217 had higher accuracy in primary care and was unaffected by age. In conclusion, this fully automated p-tau217 test demonstrates high accuracy for identifying AD pathology. A two-cutoff approach might be necessary to optimize performance across diverse settings and subpopulations.
40205198	Autologous T cell therapy for PRAME<sup>+</sup> advanced solid tumors in HLA-A*02<sup>+</sup> patients: a phase 1 trial.	In contrast to chimeric antigen receptor T cells, T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells can target intracellular tumor-associated antigens crucial for treating solid tumors. However, most trials published so far show limited clinical activity. Here we report interim data from a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, 3 + 3 dose-escalation/de-escalation phase 1 trial studying IMA203, an autologous preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME)-directed TCR T cell therapy in HLA-A*02<sup>+</sup> patients with PRAME<sup>+</sup> recurrent and/or refractory solid tumors, including melanoma and sarcoma. Primary objectives include the evaluation of safety and tolerability and the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for extension. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of IMA203 TCR-engineered T cell persistence in peripheral blood, tumor response as well as duration of response. A total of 27 patients were enrolled in the phase 1a dose escalation and 13 patients in the phase 1b dose extension. IMA203 T cells were safe, and the MTD was not reached. Of the 41 patients receiving treatment (that is, who started lymphodepletion), severe cytokine release syndrome was observed in 4.9% (2/41), and severe neurotoxicity did not occur. In the 40 patients treated with IMA203, an overall response rate consisting of patients with unconfirmed or confirmed response (u/cORR) of 52.5% (21/40) and a cORR of 28.9% (11/38) was observed with a median duration of response of 4.4 months (range, 2.4-23.0, 95% confidence interval: 2.6-not reached) across multiple indications. Rapid T cell engraftment and long-term persistence of IMA203 T cells were observed. IMA203 T cells trafficked to all organs, and confirmed responses were more frequent in patients with higher dose. T cell exhaustion was not observed in the periphery; deep responses were enriched at higher PRAME expression; and higher T cell infiltration resulted in longer progression-free survival. Overall, IMA203 showed promising anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumors, including refractory melanoma. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03686124 .
40205197	Genomic census of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella infections reveals global and local human-to-human transmission.	Extraintestinal infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae represent a global concern, further exacerbated by the growing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Among these, invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections have become increasingly challenging to manage, and their global spread remains poorly understood. Here we compiled 1,115 patient records and generated a comprehensive genomic dataset on iNTS. Age and sex emerged as significant risk factors, with Salmonella Enteritidis identified as a major cause. We observed serovar-specific AMR patterns, with notable resistance to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins. A global phylogenomic analysis of Enteritidis revealed three distinct clades, highlighting the accumulation of AMR determinants during its international spread. Importantly, our genomic and transmission analyses suggest that iNTS infections may involve human-to-human transmission, with diarrheal patients acting as potential intermediaries, deviating from typical zoonotic pathways. Collectively, our newly generated cohort and iNTS genomic dataset provide a framework for precise local iNTS burden and underscore emerging transmission trends.
40205196	Nuclear pores safeguard the integrity of the nuclear envelope.	Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange, which is essential for eukaryotes. Mutations in the central scaffolding components of NPCs are associated with genetic diseases, but how they manifest only in specific tissues remains unclear. This is exemplified in Nup133-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, which grow normally during pluripotency, but differentiate poorly into neurons. Here, using an innovative in situ structural biology approach, we show that Nup133<sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryonic stem cells have heterogeneous NPCs with non-canonical symmetries and missing subunits. During neuronal differentiation, Nup133-deficient NPCs frequently disintegrate, resulting in abnormally large nuclear envelope openings. We propose that the elasticity of the NPC scaffold has a protective function for the nuclear envelope and that its perturbation becomes critical under conditions that impose an increased mechanical load onto nuclei.
40205195	A sterile triangle positional assist for posterior approaches to the acetabulum in the lateral position: a technical trick.	Acetabular fractures are complex injuries that often pose unique challenges to orthopedic surgeons during approach, reduction, and fixation. Many of these injuries require posterior approaches that can be performed in the prone or lateral position. It is important during these posterior approaches, regardless of position, to keep the operative lower extremity in a position of safety. The limb should be positioned with the hip extended, internally rotated, and the knee flexed to relax tension on the sciatic nerve and avoid iatrogenic injury. In the lateral position a surgical assistant usually maintains the limb in this position. This article presents a simple technique of using a sterile triangle positional assist, rather than an assistant, to maintain this limb position. Over 5 years, one surgeon utilized this technique intraoperatively in 23 patients undergoing a posterior approach for fixation of acetabular fractures in the lateral position and had no iatrogenic sciatic nerve injuries. The sterile triangle positional assist represents a simple and reproducible technique for safe limb positioning during posterior approaches to the acetabulum that does not require a surgical assistant.
40205194	Effectiveness of a pelvic Binder-Only protocol for early stabilization in hemodynamically unstable pelvic ring injuries.	Hemodynamically unstable pelvic ring injuries pose significant challenges in trauma care. Although external fixation is traditionally used for initial stabilization, pelvic binders have emerged as potential alternatives. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of maintaining pelvic binders alone as a temporary stabilization method in patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic ring injuries.
40205193	Comparative analysis of the complete mitochondrial genomes of Firmiana danxiaensis and F. kwangsiensis (Malvaceae), two endangered Firmiana species in China.	We reported the mitogenomes of F. danxiaensis and F. kwangsiensis for the first time. Mitogenome size and structure differ significantly between them. Firmiana danxiaensis and F. kwangsiensis belong to the Firmiana genus and are distributed in the Danxia and Karst regions of southern China. Both species have been designated as endangered. Currently, the chloroplast genomes of F. danxiaensis and F. kwangsiensis have been sequenced, but the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of these two species has not been reported. To further understand the mitogenome characteristics, evolution, and phylogeny of F. danxiaensis and F. kwangsiensis, we assembled the mitogenomes of these two species based on a combination of Illumina and Nanopore sequencing methods. The mitogenome of F. danxiaensis exhibits a branching structure consisting of nine circular molecules with a total length of 938,890 bp, while the F. kwangsiensis has a circular structure with a length of 736,334 bp. Compared to F. kwangsiensis, F. danxiaensis has more tRNA genes, SSRs, tandem repeats, and dispersed repeats, while the codon use patterns are similar in these two species. There were 24 and 23 homologous sequences between mitogenome and chloroplast genome of F. danxiaensis and F. kwangsiensis, accounting for 0.37% and 0.49% of the mitogenome, respectively. In addition, the Ka/Ks ratio and the nucleic acid diversity analysis revealed that most of the mitochondria protein-coding genes in F. danxiaensis and F. kwangsiensis are highly conserved and may have undergone purifying selection. Furthermore, the collinear and comparative analysis showed that extensive genomic rearrangement events existed among the Malvaceae species. Lastly, a phylogenetic tree based on shared mitochondrial PCGs of 29 species revealed that F. danxiaensis and F. kwangsiensis form a sister group with high support values. Overall, the current study reports two mitogenomes (F. danxiaensis and F. kwangsiensis) in the Firmiana genus for the first time, which will help enhance comprehension of the mitogenome evolutionary patterns within Firmiana and promote the evolutionary and comparative genomic analyses within Malvaceae species.
40205192	Discovery of the potentially invasive Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann (Acari: Ixodidae) in Türkiye: an unexpected finding through citizen science.	The Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann, is a species commonly found in Central Asia, East Asia, and Australia, but it has recently emerged in the USA as a significant disease threat. The tick exhibits a fascinating biological trait, as certain populations are capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually via parthenogenesis. As a result, a single asexual female has the potential to initiate the establishment of a new population when introduced into a novel geographical region. Haemaphysalis longicornis is of considerable medical and veterinary importance, being associated with more than 30 human pathogens, including Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Coxiella, Rickettsia, Theileria, and others. It is also a competent vector for the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus) in Eastern Asia. The tick can also cause heavy infestations in cattle and transmit the hemoprotozoan parasite Theileria orientalis genotype Ikeda, resulting in significant economic losses within the cattle industry. In the present study, we report the morphological and molecular identification of H. longicornis in the European part of Türkiye. Additionally, we offer hypotheses regarding how H. longicornis ticks may have arrived in Türkiye, potential risks, and the necessary precautions that should be taken.

40205189	Mechanistic insights into LdCen1-LdDRP interaction facilitating UV-induced DNA damage repair in Leishmania donovani.	Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of the fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL) disease in humans in the tropical regions, mainly the Indian Subcontinent and Africa. We have previously described centrin1, a basal body associated cell division specific protein in this parasite important for the parasite's host intracellular stage. In this study, we identified a novel centrin1-binding protein called LdDRP through pull-down and MS/MS analysis, which is a homolog of the XPC protein of humans involved in DNA damage. The protein interaction with LdCen1 was also confirmed through peptide spectrum analysis against the UniProt database. Immunofluorescence analysis confirms that LdDRP is localized within the nucleus, suggesting the protein's possible role in DNA interaction. The overexpression of three LdDRP forms in the parasite, each fused with HA-tag (LdDRPF [full length] LdDRPN [only N-terminal], and LdDRPC [only C-terminal]), revealed that only LdDRPF and LdDRPC were able to support the retention of the parasite's shape and promote rapid division following the UV-damage recovery period. This was also correlated to the elevated expression level of both LdDRPC and LdCen1, by Western blot analysis soon after UV-C exposure in the parasites compared to control. The study emphasizes the role of the LdDRP, and its crucial domains involved in the DNA binding process, DNA damage response, and interaction with centrin, particularly in response to UV-C light-induced DNA damage.
40205188	[Grossing and reporting of the radical prostatectomy specimen].	The grossing and reporting of radical prostatectomy specimens are key issues in pathology. Consensus conferences have defined clear guidelines for UICC/TNM-relevant parameters, while the extent of embedding remains controversial. Various embedding protocols, such as the Bonn protocol, enable efficient processing with consistent diagnostic significance. The increasing use of standardized diagnostic schemes, such as those developed by the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR), can ensure (international) comparability of diagnoses. This paper explains the criteria for embedding and reporting with a particular focus on prognostically relevant findings such as the differentiation between pT2 and pT3 tumors.

Higher ultra-processed food and drink (UPFD) consumption has been linked with increased risk of non-communicable diseases. Low-grade systemic inflammation may partly underlie this relationship, yet limited research on UPFDs exists in this context. We examined UPFD associations with inflammatory biomarkers and explored whether relationships are mediated by adiposity.

Following liver resection (LR), recurrence is critical to the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A higher level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is typically associated with poor prognosis and recurrence concerns. Specifically, we attempted to determine whether high AFP (> 1,000ng/ml) and other potentially relevant factors affect survivals of patients with BCLC stage 0 HCC after LR.

40205180	Comparison of the Swallowing Function After Reconstruction of Cervical Esophagus with Jejunum, Ileocolon or Skin Flap: Method of Physiotherapy for Deglution and Long Term Follow-Up.	The swallowing function is a major goal of reconstruction for the patients who had hypopharyngeal cancer and received total pharyngolaryngectomy with or without voice reconstruction. We would like to share our experience in reconstruction of swallowing function using jejunum, ileocolon, or anterolateral thigh flap for cervical esophagus. In this study, we proposed that the jejunum flap is the most suitable option for restoring swallowing function, owing to its physiological characteristics. A retrospective study was conducted in 36 patients undergoing reconstruction of cervical esophagus with free jejunum flap (7 cases), ileocolon flap (21 cases), or anterolateral flap (8 cases). Esophagography, time required to achieve swallowing of semisolid diet without tube feeding, changes in body weight before and after the surgery, and <sup>99m</sup>Tc for transit scan to evaluate pharyngeal clearance were used to evaluate the swallowing function of the patients. Patients with jejunum flap had the best swallowing function, followed by ileocolon and then ALT flap. Besides, no conduits needed to be modified in jejunum and ileocolon flap. Regarding swallowing function, for patients with longer life expectancy and no contraindication of laparotomy, jejunum flap should be the first choice to obtain optimal swallowing function for cervical esophagus. Anterolateral flap is the easiest and most commonly used flap and provides fair swallowing function if there is no leakage. However, the anterolateral thigh flap tends to develop narrowing on long-term following-up. Based on completeness of pharyngeal transit of bolus and lack of complications, patients with jejunal flap reconstruction showed best swallowing function, followed by ileocolon and then ALT flaps.
40205179	Complex dynamics in plant-pollinator-parasite interactions: facultative versus obligate behaviors and novel bifurcations.	Understanding the dynamics of plant-pollinator interactions is crucial for maintaining ecosystem stability and biodiversity. In this paper, we formulate a novel tripartite plant-pollinator-parasite model that incorporates the influence of parasites on mutualistic relationships. Our model consists of the plant-pollinator subsystem, which exhibits equilibrium dynamics with up to four bistable states; the pollinator-parasite subsystem, where stability is significantly affected by pollinator density and growth rate; and the complete system combining all three species. We perform comprehensive mathematical and bifurcation analyses on both the subsystems and the full system. We have many interesting findings, including that (1) plant-pollinator-parasite interactions are dependent on the properties of plants and pollinators (i.e., facultative or obligate interactions). For example, systems with facultative pollinators are more likely to exhibit multistability and periodic oscillations, thereby enhancing resilience, whereas scenarios with obligate pollinators are more likely to lead to system collapse. (2) Critical parameters such as parasite mortality and conversion rates can drive complex behaviors, including supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcations, saddle-node bifurcations, chaos, and heteroclinic orbits. Notably, we introduce three new concepts-the left bow, right bow, and wave bow phenomena-to characterize variations in oscillation amplitude resulting from parameter bifurcations. These important results provide theoretical guidance for ecological management strategies aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience and stability by considering the complex interactions among plants, pollinators, and parasites.
40205178	Expression of costimulatory molecule CD70 is prognostic in small cell lung cancer.	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor survival outcomes. The CD70-CD27 axis has been implicated in immune regulation and tumor progression across cancers, but its role in SCLC has not yet been elucidated. This research explores the expression patterns and prognostic significance of CD70 and CD27 in early-stage SCLC.
40205177	Critical analysis of descriptive microRNA data in the translational research on cardioprotection and cardiac repair: lost in the complexity of bioinformatics.	The unsuccessful translation of cardiac regeneration and cardioprotection from animal experiments to clinical applications in humans has raised the question of whether microRNA bioinformatics can narrow the gap between animal and human research outputs. We reviewed the literature for the period between 2000 and 2024 and found 178 microRNAs involved in cardioprotection and cardiac regeneration. On analyzing the orthologs and annotations, as well as downstream regulation, we observed species-specific differences in the diverse regulation of the microRNAs and related genes and transcriptomes, the influence of the experimental setting on the microRNA-guided biological responses, and database-specific bioinformatics results. We concluded that, in addition to reducing the number of in vivo experiments, following the 3R animal experiment rules, the bioinformatics approach allows the prediction of several currently unknown interactions between pathways, coding and non-coding genes, proteins, and downstream regulatory elements. However, a comprehensive analysis of the miRNA-mRNA-protein networks needs a profound bioinformatics and mathematical education and training to appropriately design an experimental study, select the right bioinformatics tool with programming language skills and understand and display the bioinformatics output of the results to translate the research data into clinical practice. In addition, using in-silico approaches, a risk of deviating from the in vivo processes exists, with adverse consequences on the translational research.

Understanding the genetic basis of nutrient accumulation in wheat is crucial for improving its nutritional content and addressing global food security challenges. Here, we identified stable pleiotropic loci controlling the accumulation of 13 nutritional elements in wheat across diverse environments using a large wheat population of 1470 individuals. Our analysis revealed significant variability in SNP-based heritability values across 13 essential elements. Genetic correlations among elements uncovered complex relations, with positive correlations observed within two distinct groups, where calcium (Ca), cobalt (Co), potassium (K), and sodium (Na) formed one group, and copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), phosphorus (P), and zinc (Zn) formed the other. Negative correlations were observed among elements across both groups. Through MetaGWAS analysis, we identified stable QTL associated with individual elements and elements with high positive correlations. We identified 67 stable QTL across environments that are independent from grain yield, of which 56 were detected using the MetaGWAS analysis indicating their pleiotropic effect on multiple elements. A major QTL on chromosome 7D that can shift the phenotype up to one standard deviation compared to the mean phenotype in the population exhibited differential effects on multiple elements belonging to both groups. Our findings offer novel insights into the genetic architecture of nutrient accumulation in wheat and have practical implications for breeding programmes aimed at enhancing multiple nutrients simultaneously. By targeting stable QTL, breeders can develop wheat varieties with improved nutritional profiles, contributing to global food security and human health.
40205170	Hemisphere- and condition-specific alpha oscillations support semantic and spatial cognition in aging.	Neuroimaging studies have shown age-related alterations in brain structure and function supporting semantic knowledge, although the significance of these is not fully understood. Herein, we report novel temporal, spectral, and spatial information on age-related changes from the largest dynamic functional mapping study of semantic processing. Participants (N = 130, age range 21-87 years, M<sub>age</sub> = 51.05, SD = 14.73, 68 females) performed a semantic judgement task during magnetoencephalography (MEG), and significant task-related oscillatory responses were projected into anatomical space using a beamformer. Voxel-wise linear mixed-effects models were performed to assess semantic-related neural oscillations, irrespective of and influenced by age. Mediation analyses were performed to assess if local oscillations mediated the relationship between age and reaction time. Whole-brain analyses revealed stronger left-lateralized alpha/beta oscillations in frontotemporal cortices during semantic trials and stronger right-lateralized alpha/beta responses in temporoparietal regions during length trials (all ps <.001). Older adults showed stronger left temporoparietal alpha and left frontal beta during semantic processing and stronger alpha in the right temporal cortex during the length condition (all ps <.001). Alpha oscillations further mediated the relationship between age and reaction time in a hemisphere- and condition-specific manner, whereby right temporal activity mediated the age-behavior relationship in the length but not semantic condition (Z = 2.01, p =.022), while left temporoparietal activity significantly mediated this relationship in the semantic but not length condition (Z =  - 2.41, p =.008). Altogether, our findings demonstrate accentuated oscillations in aging which are hemisphere- and condition-specific and support compensatory processing to aid in maintaining adequate behavioral performance, lending clear support to leading neuroscientific models of aging.
40205169	Association of Klotho and FGF23 with cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic older adults with chronic limb-threatening ischemia: a prospective study.	Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is more prevalent in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The most severe complication of PAD is chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), which is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE) following lower limb revascularization (LER). This study investigates the relationship between baseline levels of Klotho and FGF23 and the risk of cardiovascular and limb-related outcomes after LER in a selected cohort of older adults. The study enrolled 109 older patients with PAD and CLTI requiring LER. Baseline levels of Klotho and FGF23 were measured, and their associations with subsequent MACE and MALE were analyzed over a 12-month follow-up period. Using stepwise multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models, we found that among 109 older patients with PAD and CLTI undergoing LER, independent predictors of MACE included age (p = 0.016), male sex (p = 0.006), BMI (p = 0.004), diabetes duration (p = 0.031), hypertension (p = 0.013), and smoking status (p < 0.001), with higher FGF23 (p < 0.001) and lower Klotho levels (p = 0.002) significantly associated with increased risk; in the Cox model, increased Klotho was linked to a reduced risk of MACE (95% CI: 0.994-1.000, p = 0.022), while multivariate analysis for MALE confirmed Klotho as an independent predictor (p < 0.01). These findings reinforce the hypothesis that altered baseline levels of Klotho, and FGF23 are associated with adverse cardiovascular and limb outcomes in diabetic individuals over 75 years old with PAD and CLTI, highlighting their potential role as biomarkers for post-revascularization risk stratification.
40205168	Visible-light photocatalytic activity of rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>) annealed with melamine under an argon atmosphere.	Visible-light active photocatalysts were obtained by rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>) high-temperature treatment in an inert argon atmosphere with addition of different amounts of melamine. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance, photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of NH<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and thermogravimetric analysis. The effect of varying melamine amount on the crystal phase, crystallite size, and morphological and optical properties of the prepared materials was investigated. The photocatalytic activity was tested in the two types of reactions: photooxidation of dyes and photoreduction of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>-2</sup> under UV and visible-light irradiation. Rutile with the addition of melamine, annealed in an argon atmosphere, exhibited photocatalytic activity when irradiated with visible light in all the reactions studied. We explain this by a change in its morphological and optical properties, such as the formation of new surface-active centers and increased absorption in the visible range of light.
40205167	Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction complicated with sand-like enterolithiasis: case report.	Enterolithiasis is typically associated with gastrointestinal tract stasis. Here, we report on a rare case of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction with sand-like enterolithiasis in an 18-year-old Japanese female admitted to our hospital with high fever and abdominal pain. Despite initiating antibiotic treatment, the fever persisted. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed colonic enlargement and a large amount of residue with a high-density area in the ascending colon. A colonoscopy revealed sand-like enteroliths in the ascending colon, which were drained using a colonoscope. The patient's symptoms improved significantly after the drainage and antibiotic therapy. The granules were white-brown in color and smaller than 300 μm in size. Infrared spectroscopy indicated similar peaks for crystals and hydroxypropyl cellulose which is an additive used in certain medications. We hypothesized that hydroxypropyl cellulose contributed to the formation of sand-like enteroliths in cases of severe intestinal dysmotility. Intestinal failure may cause enterolithiasis due to an unharmful additive and require careful follow-up.
40205166	Predicting immune status and gene mutations in stomach adenocarcinoma patients based on inflammatory response-related prognostic features.

40205164	Uric Acid-Degrading Lacticaseibacillus paracasei CPU202306 Ameliorates Hyperuricemia by Regulating Uric Acid Metabolism and Intestinal Microecology in Mice.	Hyperuricemia, characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, poses a significant health threat due to its association with various adverse health outcomes, and lactic acid bacteria from the gut microbiota may offer solutions. Our investigation focused on Lacticaseibacillus paracasei CPU202306, isolated from fermented pickles for its potent uric acid degradation and probiotic properties. This bacterium effectively reduced blood uric acid levels by breaking down uric acid and inhibiting hepatic xanthine oxidase (XOD) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzymes. Additionally, it stimulated the production of short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) in the colon, enhancing the expression of uric acid secretion transport proteins (ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 and organic anion transporter 3) while suppressing absorption transport proteins (glucose transporter 9 and uric acid transporter 1). This orchestrated process promoted uric acid excretion. L. paracasei CPU202306 also improved gut microbiota health by reinforcing tight junction proteins, shifting the microbiota to a healthier composition, and reducing harmful bacteria. This transformation inhibited kidney TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB inflammatory signaling, leading to a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, mitigating kidney inflammation. Furthermore, the bacterium supported kidney health by influencing amino acid metabolic pathways linked to the gut-kidney axis. In summary, our study highlights the diverse mechanisms through which L. paracasei CPU202306 addresses hyperuricemia, showcasing its therapeutic potential for this condition.
40205163	Supplemental Probiotics, Postbiotics, and Their Combination on the Growth, Slaughter Variables, Organ Development, Intestinal Morphology, and Cecal Microbiota of Broilers.	This study was performed to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with viable Bacillus subtilis, inactivated Lactobacillus plantarum, and their combination on growth and slaughter performance, immune organ and small intestine development, and cecal microbiota of broilers. A total of 480 one-day-old broilers were used across a 42-day feeding experiment and were fed a basal diet, a basal diet + 300 mg/kg viable B. subtilis (probiotic), 320 mg/kg heat-killed L. plantarum (postbiotic), or their mixtures (combination). Each diet had six replicates, and each replicate had 20 broilers. Compared to the control group, the final body weight and average daily gain increased, and the feed conversion ratio decreased in the probiotic and postbiotic groups, while the combination group showed parameters comparable to those of the postbiotic group. Feeding broilers with probiotic, postbiotic, and their combination increased the dressing-out percentage, indices of the spleen and bursa of Fabricius, and lengths and weights of the small intestine. In addition, the villus height/crypt depth ratio of both the duodenum and jejunum was increased in the probiotic and postbiotic groups. Broilers in the combination group had a lower abundance of Proteobacteria, while those in the probiotic and postbiotic groups had a higher abundance of Desulfovibrio in the cecum. Overall, we concluded that dietary supplementation with viable B. subtilis and inactivated L. plantarum could improve growth and slaughter performance, organ development, intestinal morphology, and cecal microbiota of broilers. However, their combination had not yielded a synergistic and additive effect on broilers.
40205162	Ductal or Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells do not contribute to adult pancreatic islet beta-cell neogenesis in homeostasis.	The adult pancreatic ducts have long been proposed to contain rare progenitors, some of which expressing Ngn3, that generate new beta cells in endocrine-islet homeostasis. Due to their postulated rarity and the lack of definitive markers, the existence or absence of ductal endocrine progenitors remains unsettled despite many studies. Genetic lineage tracing of ductal cells or Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells with currently available CreER drivers has been complicated by off-target labeling of pre-existing beta cells. Here, using dual-recombinase-mediated intersectional genetic strategy and newly-derived Ngn3-2A-CreER and Hnf1b-2A-CreER knock-in drivers, we succeeded in specifically labeling Ngn3-positive cells and Hnf1b-positive ductal cells without marking pre-existing beta cells. These data revealed no evidence of de novo generation of insulin-producing beta cells from ductal cells or endogenous Ngn3-positive cells in the adult pancreas during homeostasis.
40205161	Temporal refinement of Dach1 expression contributes to the development of somatosensory neurons.	During somatosensory neurogenesis, neurons are born in an unspecialized transcriptional state. Several transcription factors in these cells follow a broad-to-restricted expression trajectory as development proceeds, giving rise to neuron subtypes with different identities. The relevance of this temporal refinement of transcription factor expression remains unclear as the functions of transcription factors with broad-to-restricted expression patterns have been mostly studied in those neuron subtypes in which they remain active. Here we show that Dach1 encodes a bona fide transcription factor with a broad-to-restricted expression pattern retained and required in tactile somatosensory neurons. In developing nociceptors, Prdm12 contributes to Dach1 silencing. Using genetic approaches to prevent its temporal restriction during mouse somatosensory development, we reveal that Dach1 expression refinement is a prerequisite for the acquisition of an appropriate transcriptional profile in those somatosensory neuron subtypes in which it becomes ultimately silenced. These findings highlight the essential role played by Dach1 during somatosensory neuron development and demonstrate that the temporal pattern of broad-to-restricted expression followed by several transcription factors is physiologically important for the development of somatosensory neurons.
40205160	Do clinical caries-preventive interventions applied to expectant mothers affect caries-related parameters in their children? A systematic review.

40205159	Clinical performance of two chemomechanical caries removal agents in primary molars: a randomized controlled trial.	The concept of Chemomechanical Caries Removal (CMCR) includes the selective removal of caries-infected tissue while preserving caries-affected tissue. However, studies examining its application to children are scarce. The aim was to assess pain perception and time duration of CMCR agents when removing caries in primary molars in a sample of children compared to the conventional method of caries removal using rotary burs.
40205158	The mitochondrial unfolded protein response inhibits pluripotency acquisition and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in somatic cell reprogramming.	The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>), a mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde pathway that promotes the maintenance of mitochondrial function in response to stress, plays an important role in promoting lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans<sup>1,2</sup>. However, its role in mammals, including its contributions to development or cell fate decisions, remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that transient UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation occurs during somatic reprogramming in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We observe a c-Myc-dependent, transient decrease in mitochondrial proteolysis, accompanied by UPR<sup>mt</sup> activation at the early phase of pluripotency acquisition. UPR<sup>mt</sup> impedes the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) through c-Jun, thereby inhibiting pluripotency acquisition. Mechanistically, c-Jun enhances the expression of acetyl-CoA metabolic enzymes and reduces acetyl-CoA levels, thereby affecting levels of H3K9Ac, linking mitochondrial signalling to the epigenetic state of the cell and cell fate decisions. c-Jun also decreases the occupancy of H3K9Ac at MET genes, further inhibiting MET. Our findings reveal the crucial role of mitochondrial UPR-modulated MET in pluripotent stem cell plasticity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the UPR<sup>mt</sup> promotes cancer cell migration and invasion by enhancing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Given the crucial role of EMT in tumour metastasis<sup>3,4</sup>, our findings on the connection between the UPR<sup>mt</sup> and EMT have important pathological implications and reveal potential targets for tumour treatment.

40205156	Bortezomib-loaded hybrid liposome inducing pyroptosis for targeted therapy against colorectal cancer.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly invasive malignant tumor. At present, the combination of surgery with chemotherapy constitutes the predominant strategy in the treatment of CRC. The serious side effects of chemotherapy profoundly impair patients' quality of life. It is of great importance to develop novel approach to reduce side effects and increase anti-tumor efficacy in CRC treatment. Bortezomib (Btz), a reversible proteasome inhibitor, possessing both chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic effects by inducing cell pyroptotic. However, the application of Btz is impeded by their lack of tumor-targeting capability and lipid solubility. To address these restrictions and develop an ideal drug carrier, we performed a biohybrid approach by fusing liposomes with artificial extracellular vesicles engineered from cancer cells to generate hybrid liposomes (HV@Btz) for the targeted delivery of Btz. In contrast to liposomes, HV@Btz possessed higher cellular uptake efficiency and strong cytotoxicity against CT26 cells by inducing cell pyroptotic. Additionally, HV@Btz had superior tumor-targeting ability and prolonged circulation time. HV@Btz significantly suppressed tumor growth and triggered robust anti-tumor immune response with minimum systemic toxicity in both subcutaneous and orthotopic CRC-bearing mice. This study demonstrated that HV@Btz could serve as a scalable approach by inducing cell pyroptotic for the management of colorectal cancer.
40205155	mPEG-PLA micelles for nose-to-brain delivery of crizotinib-heptamethine cyanine dye conjugate for potential treatment of glioblastoma.	Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most challenging tumours to treat, with considerable intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity and limited treatment options, mainly because of the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Heptamethine cyanine dyes (HMCDs), such as IR786, have been recently utilised to improve tumour tissue specificity of drugs for treating brain cancers. Their conjugates with drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which can target multiple pathways aberrantly activated in GBM, provide new avenues for GBM treatment. To improve the therapeutic potential of such drug-dye conjugates and minimise the off-target effects, polymeric micelles prepared using methoxy polyethylene glycol-block-polylactic acid (mPEG-PLA), were developed for encapsulation of a conjugate consisting of ALK inhibitor crizotinib and HMCD IR786 for nose-to-brain (intranasal) delivery. Crizotinib-IR786 micelles were 99.6 ± 9.1 nm in diameter with a zeta potential of 12.8 ± 2.2 mV and average drug loading of 2.9%. On U87MG and KNS42 GBM cell models, crizotinib-IR786 micelles showed comparable cytotoxicity to that of free crizotinib-IR786, and both were significantly more potent than crizotinib alone or crizotinib-only micelles. In a preliminary proof-of-concept trial, the crizotinib-IR786 micelles when administered intranasally to orthotopic GBM mice, demonstrated uptake through the nasal epithelium and accumulated in the GBM tumour, confirming the nose-to-brain delivery pathway. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the mPEG-PLA micelles can be potentially used as a suitable delivery vehicle for nose-to-brain delivery of crizotinib-IR786 for the treatment of GBM. The promising in vivo preliminary proof-of-concept warrants further detailed in vivo efficacy studies.

40205152	Unravelling the role of protein kinase R (PKR) in neurodegenerative disease: a review.	Protein Kinase R is an essential regulator of many cell activities and belongs to one of the largest and most functionally complex gene families. These are found all over the body, and by adding phosphate groups to the substrate proteins, they regulate their activity and coordinate the action of almost all cellular processes. Recent research has illuminated the involvement of PKR in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), thereby expanding our understanding of intricate molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression. Through their inhibition or activation, they hold potential therapeutic targets for the pathogenesis or protection of NDs. In the case of AD (AD), PKR contributes to the protection or elevation of Aβ accumulation, neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity alterations, and neuronal excitability. Similarly, in Parkinson's disease (PD), PKR again has a dual role in dopaminergic neuronal loss, gene mutations, and mitochondrial dysfunction via various pathways. Notably, neuronal excitotoxicity, as well as genetic mutations, have been linked to ALS. In Huntington's disease (HD), PKR is associated with decreased or increased mutated genes, striatal neuron degeneration, neuroinflammation, and excitotoxicity. This review emphasizes strategies that target PKR for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Doing so offers valuable insights that can guide future research endeavors and the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.

40205143	From Clinical Trials to Real-World Experiences: Evidence About Cefiderocol Use and Potential Role in Empirical Therapy.	Cefiderocol is a novel siderophore cephalosporin that has gained attention for its potent activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens, making it a valuable addition to the antimicrobial armamentarium. Its efficacy in treating complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and nosocomial pneumonia has been well-established, although challenges remain regarding its role in Acinetobacter baumannii infections and the possible emergence of resistance. The decision to use cefiderocol as a monotherapy or in combination should be guided by pathogen susceptibility, clinical severity, and local epidemiology. Then, the potential to serve as an effective empirical therapy, careful stewardship, and further research are essential to maximize its therapeutic benefits and ensure its long-term efficacy. This review explores the efficacy of cefiderocol, resistance development, heteroresistance, its use as monotherapy or in combination therapy, and its role in empirical treatment regimens. We discuss data about clinical trials and real-world evidence to assess the future role of cefiderocol in antibiotic regimens.

40205140	Isolation, characterization, and genomic analysis of phage MY02 targeting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.	Abuse of antibiotics has led to increased rates of resistance in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and an acceleration in the emergence of drug-resistant strains, which can have serious consequences for nosocomial infections. In this study, phage MY02, which infects ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, was isolated from sewage and characterized. Phage MY02 was found to have an optimal multiplicity of infection of 0.001, with a lysis period of up to 40 minutes and an average burst of about 80 plaque-forming units per cell. The phage was found to be stable over a temperature range of -20 to 60°C and a pH range of 3-11 and to have a broad host range. Whole-genome sequencing showed that the genome of phage MY02 is ??171,821?? bp in length and contains 293 open reading frames. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed that phage MY02 belongs to the genus Marfavirus in the class Caudoviricetes. This novel broad-spectrum Klebsiella pneumoniae phage has potential applications against bacterial infections.
40205139	Improved robotic-assisted cardiac surgery outcomes with greater hospital volume: a national representative cohort analysis of 10,543 cardiac surgery surgeries.	Robot-assisted surgical techniques have enhanced surgical precision, control, stability, and vision, particularly in cardiac interventions. However, the relationship between hospital volume and the clinical and readmission outcomes of robot-assisted cardiac surgery remains undefined. This retrospective cohort study analyzed Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) data from 2010 to 2020. Patients who underwent various cardiac procedures were categorized into three groups based on hospital volume of robot-assisted cardiac surgery: low-volume centers (LVCs), medium-volume centers (MVCs), and high-volume centers (HVCs). Our primary outcome variables of interest were the incidence of perioperative complications, 30-day readmission, and in-hospital mortality. 10,543 patients were included in the analysis. Compared with those treated in LVCs, the adjusted OR of 30-day readmission [OR, 0.70; (95% CI 0.53-0.92), P = 0.014] was lower in HVCs. However, higher perioperative bleeding rates were observed in MVCs (OR, 1.38; (95% CI 1.14-1.66), P = 0.001) and HVCs (OR, 1.84; (95% CI 1.52-2.21), P = 0.001). No significant differences were found in in-hospital mortality. Our research demonstrated that higher hospital surgical volume was associated with better outcomes in robot-assisted cardiac surgery, despite higher perioperative bleeding rates.

40205136	Safe utilization of cadmium-rich soil for planting lilies and maize using a random forest model based on soil properties.	The factors influencing the uptake of soil Cd by crops are complex and closely related to the different crop varieties. Efficient and safe utilization of land resources with high soil Cd levels has become a significant challenge in the scientific community. This study focuses on the anomalously high Cd distribution area in the northern part of Longshan County, Hunan, China. By systematically collecting and testing Cd content in the edible parts of lily and maize, as well as corresponding root soil Cd, pH, and oxides, the study reveals the differences in the bioconcentration factors of Cd (BCF-Cd) for lily and maize and their influencing factors. Using the random forest method and hyperparameter optimization, optimal prediction models for BCF-Cd in lily and maize were established. The results indicate that the BCF-Cd of lily is significantly higher than that of maize. The primary factors influencing BCF-Cd in lily and maize include soil pH, Mn, OM, and ba. Feature importance analysis identifies pH as the most critical factor affecting BCF-Cd in both lily and maize. Based on the prediction results of the random forest model, this study proposes a zoning scheme for the safe utilization of arable land to maximize benefits while ensuring the medicinal safety of lily and the food safety of maize. This provides scientific evidence for ensuring food security and maximizing the productive value of land resources.

40205134	A lexical database of British Sign Language (BSL) and German Sign Language (DGS): Iconicity ratings, iconic strategies, and concreteness norms.	Iconicity, understood as a resemblance relationship between meaning and form, is an important variable that has important psycholinguistic effects in lexical processing and language learning across modalities of language. With the growing interest in iconicity, clear operationalizations in terms of the different ways in which iconicity is construed and measured are critical for establishing its broader psycholinguistic profile. This study reports a normed database of iconicity ratings for the same concepts in British Sign Language (BSL) and German Sign Language (DGS). As a related dimension, we also report the type of iconic mapping strategy, i.e., a nominal variable that reflects the different ways in which signs make form-meaning associations for each sign. Finally, we include concreteness ratings for the same concepts. Data from deaf and hearing signers show that iconicity ratings are strongly correlated across both languages, with different distributions across the different strategies, and skewed towards the iconic end of the scale for all groups except German hearing non-signers. Concreteness ratings in BSL and DGS are correlated, though more weakly, and skewed towards the concrete end of the scale. Interestingly, this differs from findings for spoken languages, where concreteness ratings exhibit substantially stronger correlations and abstract concepts are more predominantly represented. We also find that iconicity and concreteness ratings have a moderate positive and strong positive correlation in BSL and DGS, respectively. These results will be useful in psycholinguistic research and highlight differences that can be attributed to the manual-visual modality of signs.

40205132	Pubertal Timing, Positive Contexts, and Emotional Symptoms in Early Adolescence: Examining Sex Differences With a Dual Grade Cohort Design.	Earlier puberty predicts emotional symptoms during adolescence, with potential sex disparities in how developmental contexts moderate this relationship. Under the differential susceptibility framework, negative contextual amplifiers are well-documented, but positive contextual attenuators remain under-researched. Acknowledging girls' earlier pubertal onset, this study employed a dual grade cohort design (5th- and 7th-grade cohorts) to examine sex-specific positive contextual moderators (family members, general peers, teachers) in the longitudinal association between pubertal timing and emotional symptoms. This approach enabled sex comparisons at similar chronological ages (controlling for social timing) and at comparable pubertal stages (accounting for measurement timing). Multiple grade cohorts from a three-wave survey in China were analyzed, including six-month (5th: N = 10,544, 46.6% girls; 6th: N = 5991, 47.6% girls; 7th: N = 7028, 47.4% girls; 8th: N = 4832, 48.2% girls) and one-year (5th: N = 14,580, 45.8% girls; 6th: N = 11,845, 46.6% girls; 7th: N = 10,347, 47.6% girls) nested samples. Through within-grade and cross-grade comparisons, linear mixed-effects models tested each pubertal timing × positive context × sex interaction in predicting future emotional symptoms, adjusting for school-level clustering, socio-demographics, and baseline emotional symptoms. Results identified earlier puberty as a risk for both sexes. Results revealed schoolwide teacher-student relations as a positive contextual moderator only for 5th-grade girls, with no other significant contextual moderators observed for either sex. These findings underscore the importance of improving school-level teacher-student interactions to mitigate the emotional challenges faced by early-maturing girls.
40205131	Global Profiles of Positive Youth Development: A Person-Oriented Analysis among Emerging Adults Living in 21 Countries.	Although global research on the 5Cs model of Positive Youth Development (PYD; competence, confidence, connection, character, and caring) has expanded in recent years, there is a lack of understanding about distinct and consistent PYD profiles across youth from diverse socio-cultural contexts. To address this gap, this study utilized a person-oriented analytic approach to examine the PYD profiles of 11,481 emerging adults (M<sup>age</sup> = 21.77; SD<sup>age</sup> = 2.74; 68.66% females) from 21 countries in four continents. Results of the multi-group latent profile analysis revealed four consistent profiles of PYD across countries: high/balanced (41%), self-efficacious (28%), socio-emotional (20%), and low/self-centered (11%). Participants' age, gender, educational attainment, and country-level collectivism were also found to be associated with specific profiles. Older and more-educated females from less collectivistic countries were more likely to be in a high/balanced profile, while younger males from more collectivistic countries tend to be in a low/self-centered profile. Older and more-educated males from less collectivistic countries were more likely to be in a self-efficacious profile, while younger and less-educated females from more collectivistic countries tend to be in a socio-emotional profile. Controlling these socio-contextual covariates, the four profiles exhibited distinct relations with adaptive (resilience and contribution) and maladaptive outcomes (anxiety and adverse life experiences) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight the importance of fostering a balanced set of Cs, which include both self-efficacious and socio-emotional qualities, to promote positive adaptation in challenging times across diverse developmental settings.
40205130	Impact of intra-articular injection on infection risk and therapeutic effect after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a retrospective cohort study.	Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an effective treatment for single-compartment knee osteoarthritis. However, some patients experience lateral compartment pain after UKA. The impact of lateral compartment intra-articular injection on infection risk of the medial prosthesis and therapeutic outcomes in these patients remains controversial.
40205129	Mapping the complexity of motor variability: From individual space of variability to motor fingerprints.	Traditional average-based metrics have long been considered the gold standard in behavioral and brain research. However, recent advances emphasize the importance of examining the dispersion around the mean to uncover the nuances of individual differences and challenge simplistic assumptions. Thus, the study of variability is becoming increasingly central across a wide range of domains. Here, we tackle the composite architecture of motor variability by proposing a new geometric method to model it. Three independent gait datasets are used to: i) develop the method (Dataset 1), ii) evaluate its performance when transitioning from optoelectronic cameras to inertial measurement units (Dataset 2), and iii) generalize it in an experimental design with cognitive manipulations (Dataset 3). The method is based on the Procrustes transformation and multidimensional scaling. This geometric approach allows us to define the individual space of variability (i.e., the amount of bidimensional space covered by each individual's trial-by-trial data). In turn, it provides robust evidence to identify each individual unique and specific motor signature (motor fingerprint). Our approach represents a fundamental shift from previous research: It is not the value of kinematic parameters per se that defines an individual's motor signature, but rather the distinct way in which each individual varies these parameters, i.e., the dispersion of the distribution of their kinematic data. This novel perspective provides a single-subject-weighted proxy for motor signature, based on the characteristic dispersion of each individual's data. The potential applications of this new method in research and clinical settings represent a fascinating future challenge.

40205123	Rhodosporidium toruloides-a new surrogate model to study rapamycin induced effects on human aging and cancer.	The haploid, olegenious yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides accumulates intracellular lipids and carotenoids upon metabolic stress. Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling, essential for cell proliferation, is known to affect cellular lipid accumulation. In contrast to the conventional surrugate cell model S. cerevisiae, which harbours two TOR kinases within its TOR complex, R. toruloides only harbours one TOR kinase, mimicking mammalian systems. We used a proteomics centered approach to probe the cellular response, of the two R. toruloides haplotypes, IFO0559 and IFO0880 upon treatment with the TOR inhibitor rapamycin, with an original focus on difference in carotenoid and lipid accumulation. Unexpectedly, IFO0880 displayed severe growth arrest in response to rapamycin, while IFO0559 did not. Proteomic anaysis revealed differential expression of several proteins involved in cell cycle control, lipogensis, amino acid metabolism and autophagy between the two haplotypes. Among those we identified several proteins previously described in both mammalian oncogenic and aging contexts. This differential haplotype response to rapamycin treatment positions R. toruloides as a promising cell surrugate model to study cellular mechanisms underlying rapamycin response especially for systems with high lipid contents, an emerging hallmark of different forms of mammalian cancer and age related disease.
40205122	Initial experience with augmented reality in planning renal access for PCNL.	Achieving renal access during percutaneous nephrolithotomy is challenging, with a complication rate of 10-20%. This study aims to assess a novel technique for planning access to the renal collecting system using augmented reality (AR). Using Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine software (DICOM 2-print), we generated 3-dimensional (3D) models of patients with different types of kidney stones (staghorn, lower pole, and pelvic stones) who underwent PCNL between 2018 and 2022. After viewing the patient's CT scans, surgeons explored the anatomical models using an AR system with a stereoscopic 3D lens array display. Using questionnaires, we quantitatively estimated the model's contribution on a scale of "1" ("poor") to "5" ("excellent") to the surgeon's understanding of stone location, patient anatomy, and ease of access compared to 2D CT imaging. A total of 38 questionnaires were completed by 13 urologists. Estimating renal location, renal pelvis, and stone mass were better demonstrated by AR (5 vs. 4, p < 0.001). The orientation of adjacent organs was better understood using AR (5 vs. 4, p = 0.004). In 86.8% of cases, surgeons preferred using AR models both before and during surgery, with 69.2% suggesting that AR could enhance procedural safety. The time frames for testing the models differed between senior and junior practitioners (p = 0.016) and were significantly reduced with model experience (p < 0.001). When comparing CT to 3D imaging, AR models provide a better understating of stone location, patient anatomy, and route of access to the collecting system. Further research is required to implement this innovative technique preoperatively and intra-operatively.

40205118	Improving ultrasound image classification accuracy of liver tumors using deep learning model with hepatitis virus infection information.	In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) using deep learning methods for medical images has been studied. Although studies have been conducted to classify ultrasound images of tumors of the liver into four categories (liver cysts (Cyst), liver hemangiomas (Hemangioma), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and metastatic liver cancer (Meta)), no studies with additional information for deep learning have been reported. Therefore, we attempted to improve the classification accuracy of ultrasound images of hepatic tumors by adding hepatitis virus infection information to deep learning.

Hiatal hernia (HH) is frequent in patients with obesity who have undergone bariatric surgery, but there is controversy about HH repair (HHR) during bariatric surgery. This study aimed to analyze the safety and efficacy of concomitant laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and HHR in patients with severe obesity.
40205115	Impact of dementia-landscaped therapy garden on psychological well-being- A pilot study.	Non-pharmacological interventions are increasingly recognized as first-line therapies for managing dementia symptoms alongside pharmacologic strategies. Among these, therapy gardens and horticultural interventions have emerged as promising adjunctive approaches. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of a six-month dementia-friendly therapy garden intervention on psychological well-being, specifically depression levels, and to determine whether baseline dementia severity predicts treatment success. The study was conducted in a real-world setting, with a final sample of 28 dementia patients. Unlike previous studies, this intervention incorporated multimodal stimulation, including sensory, motor, and cognitive elements. Results indicated a significant reduction in depression, as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) after six months of intervention (p <.05). However, depression scores assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) showed only a trend toward improvement but did not reach statistical significance. No improvements were observed at the three-month mark, suggesting that sustained engagement is necessary for measurable benefits. Cognitive function, as assessed by dementia severity, did not show significant improvement, and dementia severity at baseline was not a significant predictor of treatment response. These findings underscore the potential of dementia-friendly therapy gardens to provide meaningful psychological benefits by significantly reducing depression over time. Notably, even individuals with more advanced dementia benefited, challenging the prevailing notion that non-pharmacological interventions are primarily effective in early disease stages. These results highlight the need for further research on the long-term effects and mechanisms underlying garden-based interventions in dementia care.

40205083	Islamic Jurisprudence, Biomedical Ethics, and the Social Construct in Relation to Intersex People: A Scoping Review.	In Islamic jurisprudence, intersex people are known as khuntha-those who have both male and female multiplicative organs. Taking into account the fragmented evidence on the role of science in the treatment of the khuntha, the socioethical demands, and expectations of people depending on their gender, this study aims to better understand the existing literature on the khuntha people in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA)-the perception, acceptance, and treatment from families, communities, and health care providers. This study used a scoping review framework and was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). The included studies are presented as a narrative account, which gradually achieves the aim of the study. Findings were synthesized thematically. Three themes emerged from the data: Islamic jurisprudence and khuntha people, biomedical ethics and khuntha people, and social construct. These themes highlight the fact that, despite advances in scientific and social interest in equal rights and opportunities for everyone, in the MENA region, people with sexual and gender diversity continue to be stigmatized within their families, society, and, most thought-provokingly, by health care providers. These findings highlight the need for health care providers to be knowledgeable and skilled communicators, in order to provide age-appropriate information and support, and ensure individual choice in gender identity for khuntha people.

40205080	ICG fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy for decision-making in lateral lymph node dissection in local advanced rectal cancer: a retrospective study.	Local advanced rectal cancer (LARC) carries high recurrence risks, especially with lateral lymph node (LLN) involvement. This study aims to evaluate the role of ICG-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with clinical negative LLNs (maximum diameter < 7 mm), potentially reducing unnecessary surgeries and associated complications in patients with LARC. A retrospective analysis of 301 consecutive patients with lower LARC who underwent fluorescent lateral pelvic sentinel lymph node biopsy (FL-SLNB) or conventional LLND at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between 2018 and 2022 was conducted. Clinical and pathological data were collected, and the patients were grouped into FL-SLNB and non-SLNB groups. Postoperative complications, recurrence rates, and survival outcomes were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using χ<sup>2</sup> tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and Cox proportional hazards models. FL-SLNB (173 patients) showed better perioperative outcomes than non-SLNB (128 patients), with shorter hospital stays (7 vs. 10 days, P = 0.027), less blood loss (150 vs. 180 mL, P = 0.032), and fewer complications: intraoperative bleeding (2.9% vs. 6.3%, P = 0.041), anastomotic leakage (1.7% vs. 3.9%, P = 0.045), and urinary dysfunction (3.5% vs. 7.0%, P = 0.039). No significant differences were observed in survival or recurrence rates (P > 0.05). pN stage was a significant predictor of distant metastasis (HR 1.953, P = 0.037). ICG-guided SLNB enhanced surgical precision and reduced unnecessary LLND in lower LARC with clinically negative LLNs, and improved surgical decision-making and minimizes postoperative complications.

40205078	Differential modulation of freezing and 22-kHz USVs by shock intensity, tone-duration matching, and anxiety levels in rodent fear-conditioning paradigms.	The concept of fear in animals, particularly its manifestation and measurement, remains a focal point in psychological research. This study builds on the systematic review and meta-analysis work of Bao et al. (Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, 157: 105537, 2024), which posits that freezing behavior and 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) may represent objective and subjective fear states in rodents, respectively. We further investigated how these responses are modulated by shock intensity, tone-duration matching, and individual anxiety levels in rodent fear-conditioning paradigms. Experiment 1 manipulated shock intensity during fear learning and tone-duration matching between learning and cue tests, revealing that while freezing behavior was consistent across conditions, 22-kHz USVs varied significantly and appeared later than freezing. This divergence was more pronounced in fear generalization tests. Experiment 2 explored the response differences in rodents with high and low anxiety, demonstrating that highly anxious individuals exhibited more 22-kHz USVs but not increased freezing during cue tests. These findings suggest that while freezing may reflect automatic defensive reactions, 22-kHz USVs are more indicative of rodents' cognitive appraisal and their subjective experience of fear. This distinction provides valuable insights that could improve the translation of animal fear models to human psychiatric conditions related to fear and anxiety.

40205073	Promoting health and survival through lowered body temperature.	Core body temperature (T<sub>b</sub>) is a long-established determinant of longevity across species. In this Perspective, we first summarize evidence demonstrating that reducing T<sub>b</sub> increases lifespan and that lowered T<sub>b</sub> contributes to the antiaging effects of calorie restriction. Next, we discuss recent data that diverge from prior hypotheses on the mechanisms by which T<sub>b</sub> affects longevity, suggesting these are limited neither to the thermodynamics of nonenzymatic chemical reactions, nor reduced formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species nor lowered metabolic rate. Instead, recent findings in invertebrates show that cold promotes longevity via specific pathways including nutrient sensing and proteostasis, as well as modulating the thermodynamics of proteins and nucleic acids by changing their structure and function, for example, affecting temperature-sensitive ion channels, long-lived temperature-sensitive dauer mutations, base-pair stability and stem-loop RNA structures. Temperature affects the epigenetic signature and inflammation, and lowering T<sub>b</sub> can also induce RNA-binding cold shock proteins, activate cold-sensitive kinases and differential splicing to potentially reshape the cellular environment. Finally, we reflect on important future work and the translational potential of temperature management and temperature mimetics.

40205071	Photocatalytic Performance of Ag/Humic Acid Magnetic Nanoparticles for Degradation of Methylene Blue in Aqueous Medium.	The contamination of water as a result of the discharge of organic dyes from industrial facilities that process pharmaceuticals, textile fabrics, leather, and petrochemicals, is a significant concern. The water quality of the aquatic environment is mostly impacted by pigments, even in small amounts less than 1 mgL<sup>-1</sup> (Sharma et al. 2021). Methylene blue which is considered as mutagenic, toxic, and non-biodegradable, was selected as a model in this study to represent the azo-dye class. The undesired effects of dye contamination can be eliminated through the sustainable and eco-friendly remediation procedure of photocatalytic degradation. The properties and efficiency of the catalytic reaction are significantly influenced by the morphology of the catalyst. Mott Schottky measurements and chronoamperometry were employed to elucidate the electronic properties of a composite silver humic acid magnetic nanoparticle (Ag/HA MNP) with a core-shell structure. The nanoparticle was subsequently employed in the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. The indirect band gap energy was calculated as 1.82 eV by employing Ultraviolet-Visible Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-DRS). The optimal parameters established in the study were used to maintain the effective photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in an aqueous medium. Optimization studies for photocatalytic degradation of model dye-MB showed that the optimum degradation percentage (42%) was achieved rapidly in a short time period of 30 min with 0.06 g MNP in 10 mgL<sup>-1</sup> solution. The first-order rate constant was determined to be 4.4 × 10<sup>-2 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. This study contributes to the literature by proposing Ag/HA magnetic nanoparticles which were synthesized and installed for the first time as a catalyst for the photodegradation of methylene blue in aqueous medium.
40205070	The impact of periodic updates to health benefits plan: access gains without cost savings?	Expanding explicit Health Benefit Plans (HBP) is a key strategy for achieving universal health coverage while maintaining financial sustainability. However, little is known about the broader effects of periodic updates to these plans on healthcare utilization, expenditures, and market dynamics. This study examines the impact of including new health technologies in Colombia's HBP covered by the Capitation Payment Unit (CPU) between 2012 and 2019, using administrative data and a difference-in-differences approach with multiple periods. Our results indicate that inclusion in the HBP-CPU led to a substantial increase in utilization and access, particularly in remote areas, but had mixed effects on expenditures. While the number of unique users and prescription frequency rose significantly, the cost per user remained stable for procedures but increased for medications, likely due to higher demand and market structures. These findings suggest that although periodic HBP updates enhance access and effective coverage, they do not necessarily generate cost savings. Strengthening health technology assessment processes, integrating price regulation policies, and implementing cost-containment mechanisms are essential for ensuring the financial sustainability of health systems that regularly update benefit plans.

40205068	LINC01559: roles, mechanisms, and clinical implications in human cancers.	Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1559 (LINC01559), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located on chromosome 12p13.1, plays a critical role in the progression of various cancers. The aberrant expression of LINC01559 significantly impacts multiple biological processes in tumor cells, including cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and cellular stemness. Notably, the expression levels of LINC01559 correlate with the pathological features and prognosis of several cancers, such as pancreatic, breast, and gastric cancers, and it may serve as a diagnostic marker for non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, the expression of LINC01559 is regulated by various mechanisms and can influence cancer initiation and progression through a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, where it interacts with a cohort of eight different microRNAs (miRNAs). Additionally, LINC01559 may directly interact with downstream proteins, thereby promoting their functions or enhancing their stability. LINC01559 is also implicated in key signaling pathways associated with cancer development, including the PI3 K/AKT, RAS, and autophagy signaling pathways. Furthermore, it has been linked to drug resistance in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the clinical implications of dysregulated LINC01559 expression across various cancer types, highlighting its crucial functions and underlying molecular mechanisms in tumorigenesis. Additionally, we present in-depth discussions and propose hypotheses regarding the functional roles of LINC01559 in cancer pathogenesis, while outlining potential research avenues for future exploration of this molecular target.

40205066	CAVE: Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine.	Advances in electron microscopy, image segmentation and computational infrastructure have given rise to large-scale and richly annotated connectomic datasets, which are increasingly shared across communities. To enable collaboration, users need to be able to concurrently create annotations and correct errors in the automated segmentation by proofreading. In large datasets, every proofreading edit relabels cell identities of millions of voxels and thousands of annotations like synapses. For analysis, users require immediate and reproducible access to this changing and expanding data landscape. Here we present the Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE), a computational infrastructure that provides scalable solutions for proofreading and flexible annotation support for fast analysis queries at arbitrary time points. Deployed as a suite of web services, CAVE empowers distributed communities to perform reproducible connectome analysis in up to petascale datasets (~1 mm<sup>3</sup>) while proofreading and annotating is ongoing.
40205064	Effectiveness and Safety of Nemolizumab in Patients with Prurigo Nodularis: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.	Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic, severely pruritic condition that markedly impairs quality of life. Existing treatments show limited efficacy, prompting investigation of nemolizumab, an IL-31 receptor antagonist. This meta-analysis evaluated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nemolizumab with placebo in patients with PN. Effectiveness endpoints included a ≥ 4-point improvement in the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS4), a ≥ 2-point reduction in the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), and a ≥ 4-point improvement in the Sleep Disturbance Numerical Rating Scale (SD-NRS). Three RCTs involving 497 patients met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analyses showed nemolizumab significantly increased the likelihood of achieving PP-NRS4 response (OR = 6.92, 95% CI: 3.84-12.45, P < .00001), IGA reduction (OR = 7.59, 95% CI: 3.58-16.12, P < .00001), and SD-NRS improvement (OR = 3.99, 95% CI: 2.39-6.66, P < .00001). Safety outcomes did not differ significantly between nemolizumab and placebo for adverse events, serious adverse events, or other specific categories. In conclusion, while maintaining a favorable safety profile, nemolizumab demonstrates robust efficacy in reducing pruritus, lesion severity, and sleep disturbance in patients with PN. While these findings are promising, the small number of included studies and potential for publication bias warrant cautious interpretation and highlight the need for further research. These findings support its role as a promising option for individuals with PN who are unresponsive to standard therapies.
40205063	DNA-guided transcription factor interactions extend human gene regulatory code.	In the same way that the mRNA-binding specificities of transfer RNAs define the genetic code, the DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) form the molecular basis of the gene regulatory code<sup>1,2</sup>. The human gene regulatory code is much more complex than the genetic code, in particular because there are more than 1,600 TFs that commonly interact with each other. TF-TF interactions are required for specifying cell fate and executing cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. Despite this, the landscape of interactions between DNA-bound TFs is poorly defined. Here we map the biochemical interactions between DNA-bound TFs using CAP-SELEX, a method that can simultaneously identify individual TF binding preferences, TF-TF interactions and the DNA sequences that are bound by the interacting complexes. A screen of more than 58,000 TF-TF pairs identified 2,198 interacting TF pairs, 1,329 of which preferentially bound to their motifs arranged in a distinct spacing and/or orientation. We also discovered 1,131 TF-TF composite motifs that were markedly different from the motifs of the individual TFs. In total, we estimate that the screen identified between 18% and 47% of all human TF-TF motifs. The novel composite motifs we found were enriched in cell-type-specific elements, active in vivo and more likely to be formed between developmentally co-expressed TFs. Furthermore, TFs that define embryonic axes commonly interacted with different TFs and bound to distinct motifs, explaining how TFs with a similar specificity can define distinct cell types along developmental axes.
40205062	Timing and trajectory of BCR::ABL1-driven chronic myeloid leukaemia.	Mutation of some genes drives uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer. The Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) provided the very first such genetic link to cancer<sup>1,2</sup>. However, little is known about the trajectory to CML, the rate of BCR::ABL1 clonal expansion and how this affects disease. Using whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 haematopoietic colonies from nine patients with CML aged 22 to 81 years, we reconstruct phylogenetic trees of haematopoiesis. Intronic breaks in BCR and ABL1 were not always observed, and out-of-frame exonic breakpoints in BCR, requiring exon skipping to derive BCR::ABL1, were also noted. Apart from ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations, extra myeloid gene mutations were mostly present in wild-type cells. We inferred explosive growth attributed to BCR::ABL1 commencing 3-14 years (confidence interval 2-16 years) before diagnosis, with annual growth rates exceeding 70,000% per year. Mutation accumulation was higher in BCR::ABL1 cells with shorter telomere lengths, reflecting their excessive cell divisions. Clonal expansion rates inversely correlated with the time to diagnosis. BCR::ABL1 in the general population mirrored CML incidence, and advanced and/or blast phase CML was characterized by subsequent genomic evolution. These data highlight the oncogenic potency of BCR::ABL1 fusion and contrast with the slow and sequential clonal trajectories of most cancers.

The Saharo-Arabian Desert is one of the largest biogeographical barriers on Earth, impeding dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, including movements of past hominins. Recent research suggests that this barrier has been in place since at least 11 million years ago<sup>1</sup>. In contrast, fossil evidence from the late Miocene epoch and the Pleistocene epoch suggests the episodic presence within the Saharo-Arabian Desert interior of water-dependent fauna (for example, crocodiles, equids, hippopotamids and proboscideans)<sup>2-6</sup>, sustained by rivers and lakes<sup>7,8</sup> that are largely absent from today's arid landscape. Although numerous humid phases occurred in southern Arabia during the past 1.1 million years<sup>9</sup>, little is known about Arabia's palaeoclimate before this time. Here, based on a climatic record from desert speleothems, we show recurrent humid intervals in the central Arabian interior over the past 8 million years. Precipitation during humid intervals decreased and became more variable over time, as the monsoon's influence weakened, coinciding with enhanced Northern Hemisphere polar ice cover during the Pleistocene. Wetter conditions likely facilitated mammalian dispersals between Africa and Eurasia, with Arabia acting as a key crossroads for continental-scale biogeographic exchanges.
40205060	Seismic imaging of a basaltic Lesser Antilles slab from ancient tectonics.	At subduction zones, lithospheric material descends through the upper mantle to the mantle transition zone (MTZ), where it may continue to sink into the lower mantle or stagnate<sup>1,2</sup>. Several factors may be important in influencing this flow, including chemical heterogeneity<sup>3-5</sup>. However, tight constraints on these mantle flows and the exact factors that affect them have proved challenging. We use P-to-S receiver functions to image the subducting slab and the MTZ beneath the Lesser Antilles subduction zone. We image a singular, superdeep (>700 km) 660-km discontinuity over a 200-km-wide zone within the slab, accompanied by nearby double 660 discontinuity phases (normal and superdeep). Combined geodynamic and waveform modelling shows that this observation cannot be explained by temperature effects in typical mantle compositions but requires a large basalt-rich chemical anomaly, strongest in the location of the singular, deep 660. The inferred basalt signature is near the proposed location of a subducted extinct spreading ridge<sup>6,7</sup>, where basalt is probably present in greater proportions. Our finding suggests that past tectonic events impart chemical heterogeneity into slabs, and the heterogeneities, in turn, may affect the inherent tendency of the slab to sink.
40205059	Ultra-broadband optical amplification using nonlinear integrated waveguides.	Four-wave mixing is a nonlinear optical phenomenon that can be used for wideband low-noise optical amplification and wavelength conversion. It has been extensively investigated for applications in communications<sup>1</sup>, computing<sup>2</sup>, metrology<sup>3</sup>, imaging<sup>4</sup> and quantum optics<sup>5</sup>. With its advantages of small footprint, large nonlinearity and dispersion-engineering capability, optical integrated waveguides are excellent candidates for realizing high-gain and large-bandwidth four-wave mixing for which anomalous dispersion is a key condition. Various waveguides based on, for example, silicon, aluminium gallium arsenide and nonlinear glass have been studied<sup>6-10</sup>, but suffer from considerable gain and bandwidth reductions, as conventional design approaches for anomalous dispersion result in multi-mode operation. We present a methodology for fabricating nonlinear waveguides with simultaneous single-mode operation and anomalous dispersion for ultra-broadband operation and high-efficiency four-wave mixing. Although we implemented this in silicon nitride waveguides, the design approach can be used with other platforms as well. By using higher-order dispersion, we achieved unprecedented amplification bandwidths of more than 300 nm in these ultra-low-loss integrated waveguides. Penalty-free all-optical wavelength conversion of 100 Gbit s<sup>-1</sup> data in a single optical channel of over 200 nm was realized. These single-mode dispersion-engineered nonlinear waveguides could become practical building blocks in various nonlinear photonics applications.
40205058	Evidence of star cluster migration and merger in dwarf galaxies.	Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are the densest stellar systems in the Universe. These clusters can be found at the centre of all galaxy types but tend to favour galaxies of intermediate stellar mass around 10<sup>9</sup>M<sub>⊙</sub> (refs. <sup>1,2</sup>). At present, two main processes are under debate to explain their formation: in situ star formation from gas infall<sup>3</sup> and migration and merging of globular clusters (GCs) caused by dynamical friction<sup>4</sup>. Studies<sup>5-9</sup> of NSC stellar populations suggest that the former predominates in massive galaxies, whereas the latter prevails in dwarf galaxies, and both contribute equally at intermediate mass. However, until now, no ongoing merger of GCs has been observed to confirm this scenario. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of five dwarf galaxies with complex nuclear regions, characterized by multiple nuclei and tidal tails, using high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. These structures have been reproduced in complementary N-body simulations, supporting the interpretation that they result from migrating and merging of star clusters. The small detection rate and short simulated timescales (below 100 Myr) of this process may explain why this has not been observed previously. This study highlights the need for large surveys with high resolution to fully map the migration scenario steps.
40205057	Active energy compression of a laser-plasma electron beam.	Radio-frequency (RF) accelerators providing high-quality relativistic electron beams are an important resource enabling many areas of science, as well as industrial and medical applications. Two decades ago, laser-plasma accelerators<sup>1</sup> that support orders of magnitude higher electric fields than those provided by modern RF cavities produced quasi-monoenergetic electron beams for the first time<sup>2-4</sup>. Since then, high-brightness electron beams at gigaelectronvolt (GeV) beam energy and competitive beam properties have been demonstrated from only centimetre-long plasmas<sup>5-9</sup>, a substantial advantage over the hundreds of metres required by RF-cavity-based accelerators. However, despite the considerable progress, the comparably large energy spread and the fluctuation (jitter) in beam energy still effectively prevent laser-plasma accelerators from driving real-world applications. Here we report the generation of a laser-plasma electron beam using active energy compression, resulting in a performance so far only associated with modern RF-based accelerators. Using a magnetic chicane, the electron bunch is first stretched longitudinally to imprint an energy correlation, which is then removed with an active RF cavity. The resulting energy spread and energy jitter are reduced by more than an order of magnitude to below the permille level, meeting the acceptance criteria of a modern synchrotron, thereby opening the path to a compact storage ring injector and other applications.
40205056	Giant electrocaloric effect in high-polar-entropy perovskite oxides.	Materials with a high electrocaloric effect (ECE)<sup>1,2</sup> tend to favour a disordered yet easily tunable polar structure. Perovskite ferroelectrics<sup>3</sup> stand out as ideal candidates owing to their high dielectric responses and reasonable thermal conductivity. The introduction of multielement atomic distortions induces a high-polar-entropy state<sup>4</sup> that notably increases the ECE by effectively overcoming the constraints imposed by highly ordered, polar-correlated perovskite structures. Here we developed a lead-free relaxor ferroelectric with strong polar disorder through targeted multielement substitution at both the A and B sites of the perovskite, effectively distorting the lattice structure and inducing a variety of nanoscale polar configurations, polymorphic polar variants and non-polar regions. A combination of these multielement-induced features led to an increased density of interfaces, significantly enhancing the polar entropy. Remarkably, a high ECE for an entropy change of about 15 J kg<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> under a 10 MV m<sup>-1</sup> field is observed for the material across a broad temperature range exceeding 60 °C. The formation of ultrafine, dispersed, multiphase lattice configurations leads to high-polar-entropy ferroelectric oxides with a high ECE and a long lifetime of over 1 million cycles that are suitable for manufacturing multilayer ceramic capacitors for practical electrocaloric refrigeration applications.
40205055	Transforming ceria into 2D clusters enhances catalytic activity.	Ceria nanoparticles supported on alumina are widely used in various catalytic reactions, particularly in conjunction with platinum group metals (PGMs)<sup>1-9</sup>. Here we found that treating these catalysts at temperatures between 750 and about 1,000 °C in the presence of CO and NO in steam (reactive treatment under reducing atmosphere) leads to the dispersion of ceria nanoparticles into high-density 2D (roughly one atomic layer thin) Ce<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub> domains, as confirmed by microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These domains, which densely cover the alumina, exhibit substantially enhanced oxygen mobility and storage capacity, facilitating easier extraction of oxygen and the formation of Ce<sup>3+</sup> sites and oxygen vacancies. As a result, these catalysts-whether with or without PGMs, such as Rh and Pt-show improved activity for several industrially important catalytic reactions, including NO and N<sub>2</sub>O reduction, as well as CO and NO oxidation, even after exposure to harsh ageing conditions. This study shows a catalyst architecture with superior redox properties under conditions that typically cause sintering, offering a pathway to more efficient metal-ceria catalysts for enhanced general catalysis.
40205054	Multimodal cell maps as a foundation for structural and functional genomics.	Human cells consist of a complex hierarchy of components, many of which remain unexplored<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we construct a global map of human subcellular architecture through joint measurement of biophysical interactions and immunofluorescence images for over 5,100 proteins in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Self-supervised multimodal data integration resolves 275 molecular assemblies spanning the range of 10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> m, which we validate systematically using whole-cell size-exclusion chromatography and annotate using large language models<sup>3</sup>. We explore key applications in structural biology, yielding structures for 111 heterodimeric complexes and an expanded Rag-Ragulator assembly. The map assigns unexpected functions to 975 proteins, including roles for C18orf21 in RNA processing and DPP9 in interferon signalling, and identifies assemblies with multiple localizations or cell type specificity. It decodes paediatric cancer genomes<sup>4</sup>, identifying 21 recurrently mutated assemblies and implicating 102 validated new cancer proteins. The associated Cell Visualization Portal and Mapping Toolkit provide a reference platform for structural and functional cell biology.
40205053	Swinging lever mechanism of myosin directly shown by time-resolved cryo-EM.	Myosins produce force and movement in cells through interactions with F-actin<sup>1</sup>. Generation of movement is thought to arise through actin-catalysed conversion of myosin from an ATP-generated primed (pre-powerstroke) state to a post-powerstroke state, accompanied by myosin lever swing<sup>2,3</sup>. However, the initial, primed actomyosin state has never been observed, and the mechanism by which actin catalyses myosin ATPase activity is unclear. Here, to address these issues, we performed time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)<sup>4</sup> of a myosin-5 mutant having slow hydrolysis product release<sup>5,6</sup>. Primed actomyosin was predominantly captured 10 ms after mixing primed myosin with F-actin, whereas post-powerstroke actomyosin predominated at 120 ms, with no abundant intermediate states detected. For detailed interpretation, cryo-EM maps were fitted with pseudo-atomic models. Small but critical changes accompany the primed motor binding to actin through its lower 50-kDa subdomain, with the actin-binding cleft open and phosphate release prohibited. Amino-terminal actin interactions with myosin promote rotation of the upper 50-kDa subdomain, closing the actin-binding cleft, and enabling phosphate release. The formation of interactions between the upper 50-kDa subdomain and actin creates the strong-binding interface needed for effective force production. The myosin-5 lever swings through 93°, predominantly along the actin axis, with little twisting. The magnitude of lever swing matches the typical step length of myosin-5 along actin<sup>7</sup>. These time-resolved structures demonstrate the swinging lever mechanism, elucidate structural transitions of the power stroke, and resolve decades of conjecture on how myosins generate movement.
40205052	Complete sequencing of ape genomes.	The most dynamic and repetitive regions of great ape genomes have traditionally been excluded from comparative studies<sup>1-3</sup>. Consequently, our understanding of the evolution of our species is incomplete. Here we present haplotype-resolved reference genomes and comparative analyses of six ape species: chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, Sumatran orangutan and siamang. We achieve chromosome-level contiguity with substantial sequence accuracy (<1 error in 2.7 megabases) and completely sequence 215 gapless chromosomes telomere-to-telomere. We resolve challenging regions, such as the major histocompatibility complex and immunoglobulin loci, to provide in-depth evolutionary insights. Comparative analyses enabled investigations of the evolution and diversity of regions previously uncharacterized or incompletely studied without bias from mapping to the human reference genome. Such regions include newly minted gene families in lineage-specific segmental duplications, centromeric DNA, acrocentric chromosomes and subterminal heterochromatin. This resource serves as a comprehensive baseline for future evolutionary studies of humans and our closest living ape relatives.
40205051	Water abundance in the lunar farside mantle.	The water contents of the lunar interior record important clues for understanding the formation and subsequent thermochemical evolution of the Moon<sup>1</sup>. The Chang'e-6 (CE6) mission returned samples from the South Pole-Aitken impact basin of the lunar farside<sup>2-4</sup>, providing an opportunity to study the water contents of the farside mantle. Here we report the water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions of apatite and melt inclusions from CE6 mare basalt, derived from partial melting of the lunar mantle. The parent magma of CE6 mare basalt is estimated to have a water abundance of 15-168 μg g<sup>-1</sup> with a δD value of -123 ± 167‰. Our estimate of water abundance of 1-1.5 μg g<sup>-1</sup> for the mantle source indicates that the farside mantle is potentially drier than its nearside counterpart. This contrast thus suggests that the distribution of water in the interior of the Moon may exhibit a hemispheric dichotomy similar to numerous surface features<sup>5</sup>. The new estimate for the lunar farside mantle represents a landmark for estimating the water abundance of the bulk silicate Moon, providing critical constraints on the giant impact origin hypothesis<sup>6-8</sup> and the subsequent evolution of the Moon for which the role of water is central<sup>1,9</sup>.
40205050	Towards conversational diagnostic artificial intelligence.	At the heart of medicine lies physician-patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking enables effective diagnosis, management and enduring trust<sup>1,2</sup>. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians' expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based<sup>3</sup> simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE's performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination<sup>4,5</sup>. The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM-patient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.
40205049	Towards accurate differential diagnosis with large language models.	A comprehensive differential diagnosis is a cornerstone of medical care that is often reached through an iterative process of interpretation that combines clinical history, physical examination, investigations and procedures. Interactive interfaces powered by large language models present new opportunities to assist and automate aspects of this process<sup>1</sup>. Here we introduce the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a large language model that is optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its ability to generate a differential diagnosis alone or as an aid to clinicians. Twenty clinicians evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from published case reports. Each case report was read by two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: assistance from search engines and standard medical resources; or assistance from AMIE in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline, unassisted differential diagnosis prior to using the respective assistive tools. AMIE exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians (top-10 accuracy 59.1% versus 33.6%, P = 0.04). Comparing the two assisted study arms, the differential diagnosis quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by AMIE (top-10 accuracy 51.7%) compared with clinicians without its assistance (36.1%; McNemar's test: 45.7, P < 0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4%; McNemar's test: 4.75, P = 0.03). Further, clinicians assisted by AMIE arrived at more comprehensive differential lists than those without assistance from AMIE. Our study suggests that AMIE has potential to improve clinicians' diagnostic reasoning and accuracy in challenging cases, meriting further real-world evaluation for its ability to empower physicians and widen patients' access to specialist-level expertise.
40205048	Reprogramming site-specific retrotransposon activity to new DNA sites.	Retroelements have a critical role in shaping eukaryotic genomes. For instance, site-specific non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons have spread widely through preferential integration into repetitive genomic sequences, such as microsatellite regions and ribosomal DNA genes<sup>1-6</sup>. Despite the widespread occurrence of these systems, their targeting constraints remain unclear. Here we use a computational pipeline to discover multiple new site-specific retrotransposon families, profile members both biochemically and in mammalian cells, find previously undescribed insertion preferences and chart potential evolutionary paths for retrotransposon retargeting. We identify R2Tg, an R2 retrotransposon from the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, as an orthologue that can be retargeted by payload engineering for target cleavage, reverse transcription and scarless insertion of heterologous payloads at new genomic sites. We enhance this activity by fusing R2Tg to CRISPR-Cas9 nickases for efficient insertion at new genomic sites. Through further screening of R2 orthologues, we select an orthologue, R2Tocc, with natural reprogrammability and minimal insertion at its natural 28S site, to engineer SpCas9<sup>H840A</sup>-R2Tocc, a system we name site-specific target-primed insertion through targeted CRISPR homing of retroelements (STITCHR). STITCHR enables the scarless, efficient installation of edits, ranging from a single base to 12.7 kilobases, gene replacement and use of in vitro transcribed or synthetic RNA templates. Inspired by the prevalence of nLTR retrotransposons across eukaryotic genomes, we anticipate that STITCHR will serve as a platform for scarless programmable integration in dividing and non-dividing cells, with both research and therapeutic applications.
40205047	Immune checkpoint TIM-3 regulates microglia and Alzheimer's disease.	Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain and have pivotal roles in neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation<sup>1,2</sup>. This study investigates the function of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease<sup>3</sup>, and it can induce T cell exhaustion<sup>4</sup>. However, its specific function in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice. Our findings reveal that TIM-3 mediates microglia homeostasis through TGFβ signalling and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial TIM-3 in Alzheimer's disease.
40205046	Goal-specific hippocampal inhibition gates learning.	Goal-directed navigation in a new environment requires quickly identifying and exploiting important locations. Identifying new goal locations depends on neural computations that rapidly represent locations and connect location information to key outcomes such as food<sup>1</sup>. However, the mechanisms to trigger these computations at behaviourally relevant locations are not well understood. Here we show that parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in the mouse hippocampal CA3 have a causal role in identifying and exploiting new food locations such that decreases in inhibitory activity around goals enable reactivation to bind goal locations to food outcomes. PV interneurons in the CA3 substantially reduce firing on approach to and at goal locations while food-deprived mice learn to find food. These inhibitory decreases anticipate reward locations as the mice learn and are more prominent on correct trials. Sparse optogenetic stimulation to prevent goal-related decreases in PV interneuron firing impaired learning of goal locations. Disrupting goal-related decreases in PV interneuron activity impaired the reactivation of new goal locations after receipt of food, a process that associates previous locations to food outcomes such that the mice know where to seek food later. These results reveal that goal-selective and goal-predictive decreases in inhibitory activity enable learning, representations and outcome associations of crucial locations.
40205045	Spatial multi-omics reveals cell-type-specific nuclear compartments.	The mammalian nucleus is compartmentalized by diverse subnuclear structures. These subnuclear structures, marked by nuclear bodies and histone modifications, are often cell-type specific and affect gene regulation and 3D genome organization<sup>1-3</sup>. Understanding their relationships rests on identifying the molecular constituents of subnuclear structures and mapping their associations with specific genomic loci and transcriptional levels in individual cells, all in complex tissues. Here, we introduce two-layer DNA seqFISH+, which enables simultaneous mapping of 100,049 genomic loci, together with the nascent transcriptome for 17,856 genes and subnuclear structures in single cells. These data enable imaging-based chromatin profiling of diverse subnuclear markers and can capture their changes at genomic scales ranging from 100-200 kilobases to approximately 1 megabase, depending on the marker and DNA locus. By using multi-omics datasets in the adult mouse cerebellum, we showed that repressive chromatin regions are more variable by cell type than are active regions across the genome. We also discovered that RNA polymerase II-enriched foci were locally associated with long, cell-type-specific genes (bigger than 200 kilobases) in a manner distinct from that of nuclear speckles. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that cell-type-specific regions of heterochromatin marked by histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and histone H4 trimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me3) are enriched at specific genes and gene clusters, respectively, and shape radial chromosomal positioning and inter-chromosomal interactions in neurons and glial cells. Together, our results provide a single-cell high-resolution multi-omics view of subnuclear structures, associated genomic loci and their effects on gene regulation, directly within complex tissues.
40205044	Phenotypic complexities of rare heterozygous neurexin-1 deletions.	Given the large number of genes significantly associated with risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, a critical unanswered question is the extent to which diverse mutations-sometimes affecting the same gene-will require tailored therapeutic strategies. Here we consider this in the context of rare neuropsychiatric disorder-associated copy number variants (2p16.3) resulting in heterozygous deletions in NRXN1, which encodes a presynaptic cell-adhesion protein that serves as a critical synaptic organizer in the brain. Complex patterns of NRXN1 alternative splicing are fundamental to establishing diverse neurocircuitry, vary between the cell types of the brain and are differentially affected by unique (non-recurrent) deletions<sup>1</sup>. We contrast the cell-type-specific effect of patient-specific mutations in NRXN1 using human-induced pluripotent stem cells, finding that perturbations in NRXN1 splicing result in divergent cell-type-specific synaptic outcomes. Through distinct loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms, NRXN1<sup>+/-</sup> deletions cause decreased synaptic activity in glutamatergic neurons, yet increased synaptic activity in GABAergic neurons. Reciprocal isogenic manipulations causally demonstrate that aberrant splicing drives these changes in synaptic activity. For NRXN1 deletions, and perhaps more broadly, precision medicine will require stratifying patients based on whether their gene mutations act through LOF or GOF mechanisms, to achieve individualized restoration of NRXN1 isoform repertoires by increasing wild-type and/or ablating mutant isoforms. Given the increasing number of mutations predicted to engender both LOF and GOF mechanisms in brain disorders, our findings add nuance to future considerations of precision medicine.
40205043	A Jurassic acanthocephalan illuminates the origin of thorny-headed worms.	Acanthocephala (thorny-headed worms), characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis with hooks, are a diverse endoparasitic group that infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates<sup>1</sup>. Although long regarded as a separate phylum, they have several putative sister taxa based on morphological features, including Platyhelminthes (flatworms)<sup>2</sup>, Priapulida (penis worms)<sup>3</sup> and Rotifera (wheel animals)<sup>4</sup>. Molecular phylogenies have instead recovered them within rotifers<sup>5-10</sup>, suggesting acanthocephalans are derived from free-living worms with a jaw apparatus (Gnathifera). Their only fossil record is Late Cretaceous eggs<sup>11</sup>, contributing limited palaeontological information to deciphering their early evolution. Here we describe an acanthocephalan body fossil, Juracanthocephalus daohugouensis gen. et. sp. nov., from the Middle Jurassic Daohugou biota of China. Juracanthocephalus shows unambiguous acanthocephalan characteristics, for example a hooked proboscis, a bursa, as well as a jaw apparatus with discrete elements that is typical of other gnathiferans. Juracanthocephalus shares features with Seisonidea (an epizoic member of Rotifera) and Acanthocephala, bridging the evolutionary gap between jawed rotifers and the obligate parasitic, jawless acanthocephalans. Our results reveal previously unrecognized ecological and morphological diversity in ancient Acanthocephala and highlight the significance of transitional fossils, revealing the origins of this highly enigmatic group of living organisms.
40205042	Small molecules restore mutant mitochondrial DNA polymerase activity.	Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is replicated by DNA polymerase γ (POLγ), a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic POLγA subunit and two accessory POLγB subunits<sup>1</sup>. More than 300 mutations in POLG, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit, have been linked to severe, progressive conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality, for which no treatment exists<sup>2</sup>. Here we report on the discovery and characterization of PZL-A, a first-in-class small-molecule activator of mtDNA synthesis that is capable of restoring function to the most common mutant variants of POLγ. PZL-A binds to an allosteric site at the interface between the catalytic POLγA subunit and the proximal POLγB subunit, a region that is unaffected by nearly all disease-causing mutations. The compound restores wild-type-like activity to mutant forms of POLγ in vitro and activates mtDNA synthesis in cells from paediatric patients with lethal POLG disease, thereby enhancing biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery and cellular respiration. Our work demonstrates that a small molecule can restore function to mutant DNA polymerases, offering a promising avenue for treating POLG disorders and other severe conditions linked to depletion of mtDNA.
40205041	Leaf absorption contributes to accumulation of microplastics in plants.	Plant absorption is important for the entry of many pollutants into food chains. Although terrestrial microplastics (MPs) can be absorbed by the roots<sup>1,2</sup>, their upward translocation is slow<sup>1</sup>. Meanwhile, atmospheric MPs are widely present<sup>3,4</sup>, but strong evidence on their direct absorption by plants is still lacking. Here, analyses using mass spectrometry detection show the widespread occurrence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) polymers and oligomers in plant leaves, and identify that their levels increase with atmospheric concentrations and the leaf growth duration. The concentrations of PET and PS polymers can reach up to 10<sup>4</sup> ng per g dry weight in leaves at the high-pollution areas studied, such as the Dacron factory and a landfill site, and 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>3</sup> ng per g dry weight of PET and PS can be detected in the open-air-grown leafy vegetables. Nano-sized PET and PS particles in the leaves were visually detected by hyperspectral imaging and atomic force microscopy-infrared spectroscopy. Absorption of the proactively exposed non-labelled, fluorescently labelled or europium-labelled plastic particles by maize (Zea mays L.) leaves through stomatal pathways, as well as their translocation to the vascular tissue through the apoplastic pathway, and accumulation in trichomes was identified using hyperspectral imaging, confocal microscopy and laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that the absorption and accumulation of atmospheric MPs by plant leaves occur widely in the environment, and this should not be neglected when assessing the exposure of humans and other organisms to environmental MPs.
40205040	Supramolecular docking structure determination of alkyl-bearing molecules.	Numerous natural products and drugs contain flexible alkyl chains. The resulting conformational motion can create challenges in obtaining single crystals and thus determining their molecular structures by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD)<sup>1-11</sup>. Here we demonstrate that by using pillar[5]arene-incorporated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and taking advantage of pillar[5]arene-alkyl chain host-guest recognition<sup>12-15</sup>, it is possible to reduce this motion and bring order to alkyl-chain-containing molecules as the result of docking within accessible pillar[5]arene units present in an overall MOF. This has allowed the single-crystal structures of 48 alkyl-chain-containing molecules, including 6 natural products, 2 approved drugs and 18 custom-made compounds collected from 16 research groups, to be determined using standard SCXRD instrumentation. The structures of alkyl-chain-containing molecules derived from crude reaction products can also be determined directly by SCXRD analyses without further purification. The simplicity, high efficiency and apparent generality of the present pillar[5]arene-incorporated MOF-based supramolecular docking approach suggest that it could emerge as a new tool for the analyses of natural products and drugs that might not be amenable to traditional SCXRD-based structure determination.
40205039	Human assembloid model of the ascending neural sensory pathway.	Somatosensory pathways convey crucial information about pain, touch, itch and body part movement from peripheral organs to the central nervous system<sup>1,2</sup>. Despite substantial needs to understand how these pathways assemble and to develop pain therapeutics, clinical translation remains challenging. This is probably related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models of the polysynaptic pathway. Here we established a human ascending somatosensory assembloid (hASA), a four-part assembloid generated from human pluripotent stem cells that integrates somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids to model the spinothalamic pathway. Transcriptomic profiling confirmed the presence of key cell types of this circuit. Rabies tracing and calcium imaging showed that sensory neurons connect to dorsal spinal cord neurons, which further connect to thalamic neurons. Following noxious chemical stimulation, calcium imaging of hASA demonstrated a coordinated response. In addition, extracellular recordings and imaging revealed synchronized activity across the assembloid. Notably, loss of the sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, which causes pain insensitivity, disrupted synchrony across hASA. By contrast, a gain-of-function SCN9A variant associated with extreme pain disorder induced hypersynchrony. These experiments demonstrated the ability to functionally assemble the essential components of the human sensory pathway, which could accelerate our understanding of sensory circuits and facilitate therapeutic development.
40205038	Stress dynamically modulates neuronal autophagy to gate depression onset.	Chronic stress remodels brain homeostasis, in which persistent change leads to depressive disorders<sup>1</sup>. As a key modulator of brain homeostasis<sup>2</sup>, it remains elusive whether and how brain autophagy is engaged in stress dynamics. Here we discover that acute stress activates, whereas chronic stress suppresses, autophagy mainly in the lateral habenula (LHb). Systemic administration of distinct antidepressant drugs similarly restores autophagy function in the LHb, suggesting LHb autophagy as a common antidepressant target. Genetic ablation of LHb neuronal autophagy promotes stress susceptibility, whereas enhancing LHb autophagy exerts rapid antidepressant-like effects. LHb autophagy controls neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity by means of on-demand degradation of glutamate receptors. Collectively, this study shows a causal role of LHb autophagy in maintaining emotional homeostasis against stress. Disrupted LHb autophagy is implicated in the maladaptation to chronic stress, and its reversal by autophagy enhancers provides a new antidepressant strategy.
40205037	Comprehensive interrogation of synthetic lethality in the DNA damage response.	The DNA damage response (DDR) is a multifaceted network of pathways that preserves genome stability<sup>1,2</sup>. Unravelling the complementary interplay between these pathways remains a challenge<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening to comprehensively map the genetic interactions required for survival during normal human cell homeostasis across all core DDR genes. We captured known interactions and discovered myriad new connections that are available online. We defined the molecular mechanism of two of the strongest interactions. First, we found that WDR48 works with USP1 to restrain PCNA degradation in FEN1/LIG1-deficient cells. Second, we found that SMARCAL1 and FANCM directly unwind TA-rich DNA cruciforms, preventing catastrophic chromosome breakage by the ERCC1-ERCC4 complex. Our data yield fundamental insights into genome maintenance, provide a springboard for mechanistic investigations into new connections between DDR factors and pinpoint synthetic vulnerabilities that could be exploited in cancer therapy.
40205036	Translational genomics of osteoarthritis in 1,962,069 individuals.	Osteoarthritis is the third most rapidly growing health condition associated with disability, after dementia and diabetes<sup>1</sup>. By 2050, the total number of patients with osteoarthritis is estimated to reach 1 billion worldwide<sup>2</sup>. As no disease-modifying treatments exist for osteoarthritis, a better understanding of disease aetiopathology is urgently needed. Here we perform a genome-wide association study meta-analyses across up to 489,975 cases and 1,472,094 controls, establishing 962 independent associations, 513 of which have not been previously reported. Using single-cell multiomics data, we identify signal enrichment in embryonic skeletal development pathways. We integrate orthogonal lines of evidence, including transcriptome, proteome and epigenome profiles of primary joint tissues, and implicate 700 effector genes. Within these, we find rare coding-variant burden associations with effect sizes that are consistently higher than common frequency variant associations. We highlight eight biological processes in which we find convergent involvement of multiple effector genes, including the circadian clock, glial-cell-related processes and pathways with an established role in osteoarthritis (TGFβ, FGF, WNT, BMP and retinoic acid signalling, and extracellular matrix organization). We find that 10% of the effector genes express a protein that is the target of approved drugs, offering repurposing opportunities, which can accelerate translation.
40205035	Hunter-gatherer sea voyages extended to remotest Mediterranean islands.	The Maltese archipelago is a small island chain that is among the most remote in the Mediterranean. Humans were not thought to have reached and inhabited such small and isolated islands until the regional shift to Neolithic lifeways, around 7.5 thousand years ago (ka)<sup>1</sup>. In the standard view, the limited resources and ecological vulnerabilities of small islands, coupled with the technological challenges of long-distance seafaring, meant that hunter-gatherers were either unable or unwilling to make these journeys<sup>2-4</sup>. Here we describe chronological, archaeological, faunal and botanical data that support the presence of Holocene hunter-gatherers on the Maltese islands. At this time, Malta's geographical configuration and sea levels approximated those of the present day, necessitating seafaring distances of around 100 km from Sicily, the closest landmass. Occupations began at around 8.5 ka and are likely to have lasted until around 7.5 ka. These hunter-gatherers exploited land animals, but were also able to take advantage of marine resources and avifauna, helping to sustain these groups on a small island. Our discoveries document the longest yet-known hunter-gatherer sea crossings in the Mediterranean, raising the possibility of unknown, precocious connections across the wider region.
40205034	Comparison of all-cause mortality with different blood glucose control strategies in patients with diabetes in the ICU: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	The optimal glucose control strategy for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with diabetes remains a topic of debate. This study aimed to compare the effects of strict glucose control, intermediate strict glucose control, liberal glucose control, and very liberal glucose control on reducing all-cause mortality in ICU patients with diabetes through a network meta-analysis.
40205033	Porous covalent architecture-involved luminescent smart hydrogel with target-responsive framework for signal-amplified inspection of aflatoxin B1.	Robust detection techniques combined with functional micro-/nano-entities can be an ideal solution for food-safety risk treatment related to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In this work, a porous covalent architecture-involved luminescent smart hydrogel with dynamic cross-linking and target-responsive framework was prepared for specific determination of AFB1 with remarkable sensitivity. Different from the existing hydrogel probe, the introduction of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enhanced the hydrophobicity of hydrogel, enabling the selective capture of AFB1 with improved affinity while excluding large matrix molecules, thus creating an anti-interference detection environment. Additionally, the pH-responsive carbon dots (CDs) embedded in the smart hydrogel contributed to a dual signal amplification, induced by deconstruction of hydrogel to release the CDs and urease-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction to increase the pH, when the AFB1 presented. In view of this signal amplification and trace enrichment strategy, this smart hydrogel can achieve robust determination of AFB1 with a detection limit of 0.03 µM as well as good specificity. The method was validated using real-world samples, demonstrating excellent accuracy and precision compared to standard HPLC methods. This work not only advances the field of AFB1 detection but also provides a versatile and cost-effective platform that can be adapted for the detection of other toxins and biomolecules, addressing global food safety and environmental monitoring challenges.
40205032	Less frequent complications following CAR T-cell therapies: hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, graft-versus-host disease, thrombotic microangiopathy, coagulation disorders and secondary malignancies: best practice recommendations from the EBMT Practice Harmonization and Guidelines Committee.	CAR T-cell therapies have revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies; however, alongside the well-known complications of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT), and infections, other non-classical toxicities are emerging. This review, developed by the EBMT Practice Harmonization and Guidelines Committee, addresses the management of other critical post-CAR T-cell complications including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), coagulation disorders and secondary malignancies. These complications, though less frequent, present a significant challenge, often contributing to morbidity and mortality with no standardized management protocols. This review provides best practice recommendations for early identification, risk mitigation, and therapeutic interventions, supported by limited but emerging clinical evidence. Comprehensive expert guidance is essential for optimal management of these under-explored toxicities following CAR T-cell therapies.
40205031	Characterization of exoribonuclease XRN1 as a cancer target and identification of adenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate as a potent enzyme inhibitor.	XRN1 (5'-3' exoribonuclease 1) degrades RNA from the 5' → 3' direction and utilizes both single- and double-stranded RNA as substrates. XRN1 plays a critical role in mRNA turnover as well as regulating the cellular response to viral infection. XRN1 also protects the cell by preventing endogenous double-stranded RNA accumulation. XRN1 was identified as a putative vulnerability in a subset of cancer cell lines through analysis of publicly available CRISPR data. The role of XRN1 was explored using a set of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with differential predicted XRN1 dependency to validate XRN1 as an oncology target. In predicted sensitive cell lines, XRN1 knockout reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and activated the pPKR and MDA5 dsRNA sensing pathways. To facilitate drug discovery targeting XRN1, a suite of biochemical and biophysical assays was developed. These assays were used to characterize adenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (pAp), a non-selective nuclease inhibitor, as a nanomolar inhibitor of XRN1. Additionally, the crystal structure of human XRN1 was solved with pAp bound, demonstrating distinct interactions for the compound in the XRN1 active site. These studies provide a strong foundation for the discovery of potent, selective inhibitors of XRN1 as a novel approach to cancer therapeutics.
40205030	Linked emergence of racial disparities in mental health and epigenetic biological aging across childhood and adolescence.	Marginalization due to structural racism may confer an increased risk for aging-related diseases - in part - via effects on people's mental health. Here we leverage a prospective birth cohort study to examine whether the emergence of racial disparities in mental health and DNA-methylation measures of biological aging (i.e., DunedinPACE, GrimAge Acceleration, PhenoAge Acceleration) are linked across childhood and adolescence. We further consider to what extent racial disparities are statistically accounted for by perinatal and postnatal factors in preregistered analyses of 4898 participants from the Future of Families & Child Wellbeing Study, of which 2039 had repeated saliva DNA methylation at ages 9 and 15 years. We find that racially marginalized children had higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behaviors and diverging longitudinal internalizing slopes. Black compared to White identifying children, children living in more racially segregated neighborhoods, and racially marginalized children more affected by colorism tended to have higher age-9 levels of biological aging and more biological age acceleration over adolescence. Notably, longitudinal increases in internalizing and externalizing behavior were correlated with increases in biological aging. While racial and ethnic disparities in mental health were largely statistically accounted for by socioeconomic variables, differences in biological aging were often still visible after including potential mediating variables. These findings underscore the urgency for future research to consider biological aging processes from early life and collect more comprehensive measures of structural racism in developmental cohorts. Programs dedicated to advancing racial health equity must address the psychological and physical effects of structural racism on children and adolescents.
40205029	Aberrant personal space is associated with paranoia, altered stress regulation, and unfavourable outcomes at 6 months' follow-up in schizophrenia.	Paranoia is a central feature of schizophrenia and linked with poor outcomes. Paranoid experience is sometimes hard to identify in the clinical interview. In contrast, personal space (PS) measures detected patients with paranoia with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Here we test whether we can substantiate aberrant PS regulation in paranoia and whether PS was associated with stress markers and longitudinal outcomes. We included 144 participants (92 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 52 age and sex-matched healthy controls). We measured PS and stress markers during two behavioural tasks on interpersonal distance. In addition, we assessed social outcomes at baseline and after 6 months. Data corroborated that paranoia increased PS. Moreover, we confirmed that PS detected paranoia with excellent sensitivity (92%) at 1.1 m, and severe paranoia with 87% sensitivity and 81% specificity at 1.6 m. In addition, stress (Electrodermal activity) during the PS task was associated with paranoia and PS. Furthermore, higher stress at baseline predicted less improvement of social outcome after 6 months. Finally, improvement of PS over 6 months was associated with improvement of social functioning. PS may indeed serve as a simple bedside test for paranoia. Furthermore, results have direct implications in clinical practice as they suggest that it is advisable to maintain increased PS with paranoid patients. In addition, altered stress regulation and persistently increased PS may indicate unfavourable outcomes in the short-term follow-up. Thus, patients with persistently increased PS may benefit from special therapeutic attention.
40205028	Polymorphisms in SOD2 and SOD3 Genes are Associated with Dental Caries in Primary Dentition of Brazilian Children.	To investigate the association of polymorphisms in the SOD2 (rs5746136, rs10370, and rs4880) and SOD3 (rs2855262, and rs13306703) genes and dental caries in primary dentition. This cross-sectional study included 753 children aged from 2 to 6 years in primary dentition from 33 public preschools in Nova Friburgo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Covariates such as gender and body mass index were collected. Dental caries experience was evaluated using WHO (2013) criteria. Phenotypes were classified as absence (dmft = 0), presence (dmft ≥ 1) or high caries experience (dmft ≥ 5). Genotyping of the selected polymorphisms was carried out by TaqMan real-time PCR using genomic DNA extracted from buccal cells. Allele and genotype frequencies in recessive, co-dominant and dominant models were compared between phenotype groups. Covariates did not influence on caries experience in any phenotype analyzed. The allele C in rs2855262 (SOD3) presented association with high dental caries experience (dmft ≥ 5) (p = 0.04). The polymorphisms rs5746136 (SOD2) and rs2855262 (SOD3) presented association with caries experience (respectively, dmft ≥ 1 and dmft ≥ 5) in recessive models (p = 0.02). The findings suggest that polymorphisms in SOD2 (rs5746136) and SOD3 (rs2855262) genes are associated with dental caries experience in children with primary dentition. The cross-sectional study design presents known limitations, such as the inability to establish causal relationships. Therefore, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution, and further is needed to confirm the results and investigate the function of these genes function and their involvement in dental caries and other oral conditions. Altered salivary oxidative stress biomarkers, influenced by genetic variations, play a significant role in the development of dental caries. It emphasizes the importance of genetic screening in oral health assessments. Understanding the SOD2 and SOD3 polymorphisms, could pave the way for personalized preventive strategies and targeted therapeutic interventions in pediatric dentistry.
40205027	Probiotics reduce negative mood over time: the value of daily self-reports in detecting effects.	The burgeoning field of the microbiome-gut-brain axis has inspired research into how the gut microbiome can affect human emotion. Probiotics offer ways to investigate microbial-based interventions but results have been mixed, with more evidence of beneficial effects in clinically depressed patients. Using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in 88 healthy volunteers, we conduct a comprehensive study into effects of a multispecies probiotic on emotion regulation and mood through questionnaires, emotional processing tests and daily reports. We find clear evidence that probiotics reduce negative mood, starting after two weeks, based on daily monitoring, but few other changes. Our findings reconcile inconsistencies of previous studies, revealing that commonly used pre- versus post-intervention assessments cannot reliably detect probiotic-induced changes in healthy subjects' emotional state. We conclude that probiotics can benefit mental health in the general population and identify traits of individuals who derive greatest benefit, allowing future targeting of at-risk individuals.
40205026	Modified versus conventional percutaneous kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture treatment: a systematic review and pilot meta-analysis.	This study compares the safety and clinical effectiveness of modified percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) approaches (transverse process-pedicle or extrapedicular) with the conventional transpedicular approach for treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.
40205025	Pioneering protein degradation for agricultural applications.	As the world of agrochemicals is entering a race for efficient and safe modalities, there is an urgent and specific need for entirely new modes of action. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) recruit naturally occurring E3 ubiquitin ligases to induce potent and selective degradation of protein targets via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Herein, we demonstrate the degradative abilities of the insect VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) E3 ligase, making it the first PROTAC-ready ligase for agriculture applications. In doing so, we developed VHL-recruiting PROTACs capable of degrading fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) sfBRD3 protein with potencies as high as >80% in Sf9 cells and >60% in larvae. We also successfully designed, optimized, and tested PROTACs that significantly degraded sfWDS protein in both cells and whole organisms. This proof-of-concept study pioneers the use of PROTACs for agricultural applications and establishes this modality as a promising, disruptive alternative to traditional small molecule inhibitors.
40205023	Lipolysis-derived fatty acids are needed for homeostatic control of sterol element-binding protein-1c driven hepatic lipogenesis.	Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is translated as an inactive precursor (P-SREBP-1c) postprandially. Low levels of unsaturated fatty acids (uFAs) and high insulin promote its proteolytic activation, yielding N-SREBP-1c that drives fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis. During fasting, however, lipogenesis is low, and adipose tissue lipolysis supplies the organism with FAs. Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL) is the rate-limiting enzyme for adipose tissue lipolysis, and it preferentially releases uFAs. Therefore, we hypothesized that adipose ATGL-derived uFAs suppress P-SREBP-1c activation in the liver. In this study, we show that (I) N-SREBP-1c is transiently higher in livers of fasted and refed adipose specific Atgl knockout mice than in control livers. (II) This effect is reversed by injection of uFAs. (III) uFAs inhibit endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi-apparatus transport of SREBP Cleavage-Activating Protein (SCAP) in hepatocytes, which is essential for SREBP activation. Our findings demonstrate that adipose tissue ATGL derived uFAs attenuate P-SREBP-1c activation in the liver mainly after refeeding. We propose that this ATGL/SREBP-1c axis adds an additional layer of coordination between lipogenesis and lipolysis.
40205022	Can the molecular and transgenic breeding of crops be an alternative and sustainable technology to meet food demand?	The gradual increase in the worldwide population represents various challenges, and one of the most alarming being the food demand. Historically technological advances led to the development of crops that meets the requirements and demands. Currently, molecular breeding unlocks the genetic potential of crops for their improvement, positioning it as a key technology for the development of new crops. The implementation of OMICs sciences, such spatial and single cell transcriptomics is providing a large and precise information, which can be exploited for crop improvement related to increasing yield, improving the nutritional value; designing new strategies for diseases resistance and management and for conserving biodiversity. Furthermore, the use of new technologies such CRISPR/CAS9 brought us the ability to modify the selected regions of the genome to select the superior's genotypes at a short time and the use of artificial intelligence aid in the analysis of big data generated by OMICS sciences. On the other hand, the application of molecular improvement technologies open up discussion on global regulatory measures, the socio-economic and socio-ethics, as the frameworks on its global regulation and its impact on the society create the public perception on its acceptance. In this review, the use and impact of OMICs sciences and genetic engineering in crops development, the regulatory measures, the socio-economic impact and as well as the mediatic information on genetically modified crops worldwide is discussed along with comprehensive insights on the potential of molecular plant breeding as an alternative and sustainable technology to meet global food demand.
40205020	"Putting the cart before the horse": an update on promiscuous gene fusions in soft tissue tumors.	The ever-increasing availability and affordability of molecular genetic testing has revolutionized our understanding of the pathogenesis and proper classification of soft tissue tumors but has also brought new challenges. As is known, many soft tissue tumors harbor gene fusion events, and while it was initially thought that individual entities would be defined by single, specific fusions, it quickly became clear that some entities could be caused by several different fusion events (e.g., EWSR1::FLI1, EWSR1::ERG, EWSR1:FEV and others in Ewing sarcoma). More recently, it has become apparent that these fusion events themselves are "promiscuous", appearing in more than one discrete entity (e.g., EWSR1::CREB1 in clear cell sarcoma, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma and others). This review article will briefly discuss the best known examples of genetic promiscuity, the EWSR1/FUS::ATF1/CREB1 and ETV6::NTRK3 fusions, and more comprehensively cover recently discovered and less well-known examples of genetic promiscuity, including EWSR1::WT1, MALAT1::GLI1, YAP1::TFE3 and fusions involving members of the FET and ETS gene families.
40205019	Evaluation of 5 Intermediate Structural Variations of Microglia Within an Organotypic Hippocampal Slice Model After Regionalized Toxic Injury.	The dendritic cell of the CNS, the microglia (MG), is an initiation point of the immunological response within the post-blood-brain barrier (BBB) compartment. Microglia drastically changes in response to cell stress to a much different non-dendritic morphologies. This investigation postulates that if the first MG responses to toxic injury are isolated and studied in greater morphological detail, there is much to be learned about microglia's metamorphosis from and M2 to an M1 state. The organotypic hippocampal slice was the experimental setting used to investigate microglial response to toxic injury; this isolates dendritic cell to post-BBB cells dynamics from the impact of nonspecific of in vivo blood-derived signaling. Within the context of biochemically verified precise toxic cell injury/death (induced with mercury or cyanide in combination with 2-deoxy-glucose) to a specific region within the hippocampal slice, MG's morphological response was evaluated. There was up to 35% increase in microglia activation proximally to injury (CA3 region) and no changes distally (DG region) when compared to control slices treated with PBS. Maximum microglia activation consisted of a 3 plus-fold increase in the distance between the nucleus membrane and the cell membrane, which underscores an extensive and quantifiable amount of membrane rearrangement. This quantification can be applied to contemporaneous AI image analysis algorithms to demarcate and quantify relative MG activation in and around a site of injury. In between baseline and activated MG morphologies, 5 intermediate morphologies (or structural variations) are described as it relates to its cell body, nucleus, and dendrites. The result from this study reconciles details of MG's structure to its holistic characteristics in relation to parenchymal cell stress.

40205015	Transcriptome-wide association study of alternative polyadenylation identifies susceptibility genes in non-small cell lung cancer.	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) plays a crucial role in cancer development and prognosis. However, the molecular characteristics of APA related to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) susceptibility remain understudied, especially in East Asian populations. In this study, we constructed an atlas of APA-regulated 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and profiled its genetic regulation in 747 lung tissue samples (including tumors and paired normal tissues) from 417 NSCLC Chinese patients. We verified a significant global shortening of 3'UTRs in tumor samples compared to normal samples and underscored the value of APA-regulation as a prognostic marker. The 3'UTR APA quantitative trait loci (3'aQTL) was identified by regressing the percentage of distal poly(A) site usage index (PDUI) value on genetic variants. We found that a significant proportion 3'aQTLs are independent of genetic regulation of expression and are specific in Chinese. We also conducted a 3'UTR APA transcriptome-wide association study (3'aTWAS) by integrating the APA regulation atlas with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for NSCLC involving 7035 cases and 185,413 cancer-free controls. We identified NSCLC-associated genes, highlighting TUBB, TEAD3, and PPP1R10. Combining the consistent results from colocalization analysis, differential APA analysis, and survival analysis, we provide novel evidence for the role TUBB APA regulation in NSCLC and identified potential upstream regulators. Overall, our study profiled the APA regulation and highlighted the substantial role of APA in NSCLC carcinogenesis and prognosis in East Asian populations.
40205014	Studying the cellular efficacy and tolerability of using CRISPR-gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex for in-vitro knockdown of TRIB2 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells as preliminary clinical evaluations.	Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a complex, genetically driven cancer disease with several mutations that complicate therapy regimes. The Tribbles gene family, specifically the TRIB2 gene, has garnered substantial interest as a crucial oncogenic factor of AML progression. Studying cancer through gene expression studies and focusing on the primary oncogenes provide accurate information for future therapies. Here, CRISPR stands as the most exceptional tool used to explore both oncogene functionalities and therapeutic utilities. The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) mode of CRISPR formation and usage are preferred compared to plasmid-mediated CRISPR systems, however, it can lead to complications post-transfection to sensitive cellular entities such as human cancer cells in-vitro, transcribing to similar outcomes in-vivo as well. Therefore, this study describes the use of in-house designed CRISPR-RNP systems targeting the TRIB2 oncogene and evaluates their post-transfection cellular safety and efficacy aspects for future clinical applications.
40205013	Psilocybin therapy for mood dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: an open-label pilot trial.	Mood dysfunction is highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD), a main predictor of functional decline, and difficult to treat-novel interventions are critically needed. Psilocybin shows early promise for treating depression and anxiety, but its potential in PD is unknown, as safety concerns have excluded people with neurodegenerative disease from previous trials. In this open-label pilot (NCT04932434), we examined the feasibility of psilocybin therapy among people with mild to moderate stage PD plus depression and/or anxiety. 12 participants (mean age 63.2 ± 8.2 years, 5 women) received psilocybin (one 10 mg followed by one 25 mg dose) with psychotherapy. There were no serious adverse events, no medical interventions required to manage effects of psilocybin, and no exacerbation of psychosis. Ten participants experienced treatment-emergent adverse events; the most frequent were anxiety, nausea, and increased blood pressure. We observed no worsening of PD symptomology measured by the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). On the contrary, non-motor (MDS-UPDRS Part I: -13.8 ± 1.3, p < 0.001, Hedges' g = 3.0) and motor symptoms (Part II: -7.5 ± 0.9, p < 0.001, g = 1.2; Part III: -4.6 ± 1.3, p = 0.001; g = 0.3) as well as performance in select cognitive domains (Paired Associates Learning [-0.44 ± 0.14, p = .003, g = 0.4], Spatial Working Memory [-0.52 ± 0.17, p = 0.003, g = 0.7], and Probabilistic Reversal Learning [2.9 ± 0.9, p = 0.003, g = 1.3]) improved post-treatment, and improvements were sustained until the final safety assessment one month following drug exposure. Baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores were 21.0 ± 8.7 and 17.0 ± 3.7, respectively. Both improved to a clinically meaningful degree post-treatment; these improvements persisted to the final assessment three months following drug exposure (MADRS: -9.3 ± 2.7, p = .001, g = 1.0; HAM-A: -3.8 ± 1.7; p = 0.031, g = 0.7). This study provides the first data on psilocybin's effects in any neurodegenerative disease. Results suggest that psilocybin therapy in PD warrants further investigation.
40205012	Aversion-induced dopamine reductions predict drug-taking and escape behaviors.	Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) has long been associated with the promotion of motivated behavior. However, inhibited dopamine signaling can increase behavior in certain settings, such as during drug self-administration. While aversive environmental stimuli can reduce dopamine, it is unclear whether such stimuli reliably engage this mechanism in different contexts. Here we compared the physiological and behavioral responses to the same aversive stimulus in different designs to determine if there is uniformity in the manner that aversive stimuli are encoded and promote behavior. NAcC dopamine was measured using fiber photometry in male and female rats during cocaine self-administration sessions in which an acutely aversive 90 dB white noise was intermittently presented. In a separate group of rats, aversion-induced changes in dopamine were measured during an escape design in which operant responses terminated aversive white noise. Aversive white noise significantly reduced NAcC dopamine and increased cocaine self-administration in both male and female rats. The same relationship was observed in the escape design, in which white noise reduced dopamine and promoted the performance of escape behavior. In both designs, the magnitude of the dopamine reduction predicted behavioral performance. While prior research demonstrated that pharmacologically reduced dopamine signaling can promote intake, this report demonstrates that this physiological mechanism is naturally engaged by aversive environmental stimuli and is generalizable to non-drug contexts. These findings illustrate a common physiological signature in response to aversion that may promote both adaptive and maladaptive behavior.

40205009	Wogonin attenuates septic cardiomyopathy by suppressing ALOX15-mediated ferroptosis.	Septic cardiomyopathy (SCM), a severe complication in sepsis, significantly increases the mortality of septic patients. Ferroptosis, an iron-regulated cell death, has been implicated in the development of SCM. Wogonin, a flavonoid from the root of the skullcap, exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and anti-apoptotic activities. In this study, we investigated the effects of wogonin on SCM and associated cardiomyocyte ferroptosis. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery was performed in mice to establish a SCM model. Wogonin (20, 40 and 60 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, i.p.) was administered 2 h prior to CLP surgery. We showed that wogonin pretreatment dose-dependently mitigated CLP-induced cardiac dysfunction, myocardial damage, and deranged cardiomyocyte contractility. Furthermore, wogonin pretreatment ameliorated cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in CLP-challenged mice. We demonstrated that wogonin exerted the cardioprotective effects through suppressing cardiomyocyte ferroptosis both in vivo and in vitro. We revealed that wogonin directly bound to and inhibited ALOX15 (arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase), a lipoxygenase that governed the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids to initiate ferroptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of ALOX15 using a specific inhibitor ML351 (10 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.p. for 7 days prior to CLP surgery) markedly diminished cardiac abnormalities and cardiomyocyte ferroptosis in CLP-challenged mice. In LPS-challenged HL-1 cardiomyocytes, overexpression of ALOX15 or supplement of its downstream metabolite 15-HpETE (1 μM) diminished the anti-ferroptotic effects of wogonin. Our results demonstrate that wogonin protects against SCM through inhibition of ALOX15-meditated ferroptosis.
40205008	FGFR as a Predictive Marker for Targeted Therapy in Gastrointestinal Malignancies: A Systematic Review.	Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers constitute approximately 25% of cancers worldwide. The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family is a promising target for immunotherapy aiming  to enhance survival rates. FGFR alterations are associated with GI carcinomas. Their predictive value in different malignancies remains a focus area. While FGFR inhibitors have been approved for cholangiocarcinoma (CC) therapy, uncertainties remain regarding other GI cancers.
40205007	Implementation of double Feynman gate in high dimensional quantum systems.	The photonic platform has emerged as a preferred choice for quantum computing and information processing due to its low loss and high integration capabilities. In the present research, we propose a high-dimensional double Feynman gate utilizing single-photon hybrid degrees of freedom coding. This gate can manipulate two qubits simultaneously, demonstrating effective quantum state conversion. Our experimental design offers valuable insights for the investigation of high-dimensional optical quantum logic gates and advances quantum fundamental research.
40205006	A Comparative Study on the Construction of Research Integrity in Public Medical Universities/Colleges in China: 2020-2024.	The medical field is highly susceptible to research misconduct, making research integrity in medical universities and colleges crucial for its prevention and management. While both Chinese and international researchers have conducted extensive studies on fostering research integrity in higher education institutions, comparative analyses focusing specifically on medical universities and colleges in China remain insufficient. To address this gap, this study examines the state of research integrity construction in 83 Chinese public medical universities/colleges during 2020 and 2024, exploring the underlying factors influencing this development. The findings indicate that research integrity initiatives in Chinese medical universities and colleges are predominantly reactive, driven by compliance with government regulations and mandated tasks, rather than proactive, guided by intrinsic awareness and moral commitment. These results underscore the need to go beyond addressing Two-Points to emphasize Key-Points, advocating for a greater role of scientific autonomy in shaping research integrity, as opposed to reliance on government oversight.
40205005	Effects of insecticide use, host plant resistance, and nitrogen fertilization on the density of Melanaphis sorghi and the production of grain sorghum.	Melanaphis sorghi is a serious economically important pest of sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.), across the southern USA. Therefore, developing and refining integrated strategies that provide effective control is key to the management of this pest. The current study examined the influence of nitrogen (N) fertilization, sorghum cultivar and insecticide applications on M. sorghi and grain sorghum yield at Tifton, Georgia (31.5120° N, 83.6434° W). Field trials with three insecticide treatments (untreated control, flupyradifurone in-furrow at 117 g/ha, and flupyradifurone foliar at 73 g/ha), three nitrogen fertilization rates (25, 50 and 100 kg/ha) and two sorghum cultivars (resistant: DKS37-07 and susceptible: DKS53-53) were conducted on grain sorghum in the spring/summer of 2022 and 2023. Compared to the medium N fertilization, Low and high N fertilization supported higher aphid density and severity of infestation (cumulative insect days [CID]) on both the susceptible and resistant cultivars for both 2022 and 2023. Aphid density and severity of infestation on the susceptible sorghum cultivar (DKS53-53) were 3.4-4.8-fold greater than on the resistant cultivar (DKS37-07) for both low and high N fertilization plots in 2022. While a single foliar and in-furrow insecticide application significantly reduced infestations below the economic threshold across all treatment combinations in 2022, aphid populations were too low to warrant foliar application in 2023. Nitrogen fertilization was associated with improved yield as the high N fertilization preserved yield for both sorghum cultivars. Compared to untreated plots, in-furrow and foliar insecticide applications supported greater grain sorghum yield across all insecticide treatments only in 2022. The study suggests that manipulating N fertilization, utilizing resistant sorghum cultivars and in-furrow and foliar insecticide application can synergistically suppress aphid infestations and improve grain yield in sorghum production in southern USA.
40205004	3-Dimensional printing and bioprinting in neurological sciences: applications in surgery, imaging, tissue engineering, and pharmacology and therapeutics.	The rapid evolution of three-dimensional printing (3DP) has significantly impacted the medical field. In neurology for instance, 3DP has been pivotal in personalized surgical planning and education. Additionally, it has facilitated the creation of implants, microfluidic devices, and optogenetic probes, offering substantial implications for medical and research applications. Additionally, 3D printed nasal casts are showing great promise for targeted brain drug delivery. 3DP has also aided in creating 3D "phantoms" aligning with advancements in neuroimaging, and in the design of intricate objects for investigating the neurobiology of sensory perception. Furthermore, the emergence of 3D bioprinting (3DBP), a fusion of 3D printing and cell biology, has created new avenues in neural tissue engineering. Effective and ethical creation of tissue-like biomimetic constructs has enabled mechanistic, regenerative, and therapeutic evaluations. While individual reviews have explored the applications of 3DP or 3DBP, a comprehensive review encompassing the success stories across multiple facets of both technologies in neurosurgery, neuroimaging, and neuro-regeneration has been lacking. This review aims to consolidate recent achievements of both 3DP and 3DBP across various neurological science domains to encourage interdisciplinary research among neurologists, neurobiologists, and engineers, in order to promote further exploration of 3DP and 3DBP methodologies to novel areas of neurological science research and practice.
40205003	A nationwide analysis of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior among stroke survivors in Korea.	This study aimed to identify key predictors of physical inactivity and prolonged sedentary behavior among stroke survivors (SSs) using data from the 2016-2020 Korea National Health and Nutrition Surveys. Of the 28,146 participants, 633 had a history of stroke. The results showed that SSs were significantly more likely to be physically inactive and spend longer sedentary times than controls. Multivariate analysis identified that age ≥ 80 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.96-15.15), lower education level (≤ 9 years) (aOR = 2.18, 95%CI 1.13-4.18), and living in rural areas (aOR = 1.91, 95%CI 1.11-3.29) were associated with aerobic physical inactivity. Female sex (aOR = 2.36, 95%CI 1.28-4.35) and lower education (aOR = 2.31, 95%CI 1.01-5.34) were linked to insufficient resistance exercises (≤ 1 day per week). Long sedentary time (≥ 8 h daily) was associated with being economically inactive (aOR = 1.90, 95%CI 1.21-2.96), single (aOR = 1.68, 95%CI 1.07-2.64), and perceiving oneself as unhealthy (aOR = 1.59, 95%CI 1.01-2.49). These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions, including community-based exercise programs and policy initiatives, to reduce sedentary behavior and promote physical activity among SSs. Implementing accessible and tailored rehabilitation strategies may help mitigate long-term health risks in this population.
40205001	A prospective study using questionnaires and urodynamic assessments to evaluate bladder function and continence changes after robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.	Post-prostatectomy continence status, in addition to lower urinary tract symptoms, is a major concern among patients after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RaRP). In this prospective study, we enrolled patients undergoing RaRP to evaluate subjective urinary symptoms and objective urodynamic parameters before and after surgery. Patients were recruited before RaRP surgery between January 2019 and August 2020. One day before surgery, the participants completed three questionnaires and pressure-flow studies, which were repeated approximately 3 months postoperatively. Of the total 135 patients initially enrolled, 85 (63.0%) completed the entire follow-up period. Three months after RaRP, the International Prostate Symptom Score showed significant increases in storage symptoms. Similar trends were observed in the Urinary Distress Inventory Short Form, and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score questionnaires. More than half of the patients regained continence within 2 months, although 9.6% remained incontinent after 1 year. Postoperative urodynamic studies indicated increased bladder hypersensitivity and significantly decreased detrusor pressure at peak flow. Furthermore, the bladder contractility index and bladder outlet obstruction index were reduced postoperatively. Ten patients (11.8%) developed de novo detrusor overactivity. The multivariate analysis identified age and cross-sectional area of the bladder neck as predictors of immediate continence after RaRP.
40204999	Green jackfruit flour ameliorates MASH and development of HCC via the AMPK and MAPK signaling pathways in experimental model systems.	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a serious public health concern. Given the paucity of approved therapeutic strategies for this lifestyle disorder, dietary interventions may prove effective. We evaluated the mechanisms of how green jackfruit flour (JF) ameliorates metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and halts the progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study used murine models of MASH and MASH-HCC that closely mimic human MASLD. C57Bl/6 male mice were fed with chow or western diet with normal or sugar water for 12 weeks, then randomized to receive either 5 kcal% green jackfruit flour (JF) or an equal volume of placebo flour (PB). JF significantly reduced body weight, liver injury, and insulin resistance, and alleviated obesity, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development in WDSW or WDSW/CCl<sub>4</sub> mice compared to placebo. Furthermore, JF activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibited MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways in MASH and MASH-HCC models, respectively. Sodium propionate treatment, the primary short-chain fatty acid entering the liver from JF's soluble fiber microbial fermentation, further supported these mechanistic insights. Hence, our findings present strong evidence of JF's therapeutic potential in attenuating MASH and MASH-HCC, warranting further investigation of JF's efficacy as a dietary intervention in clinical trials.
40204998	The problematic of soil contamination by industries in a protected area in Portugal.	Understanding the environmental legacy surrounding abandoned industrial sites, once powered by fossil fuels and operated in times of less stringent environmental regulations, is crucial today. This issue is especially pertinent in regions that have since become protected areas. Cabo Mondego, recognized internationally for its geological diversity, designated as a National Monument of Portugal, and included in the Atlantic Geopark project, represents such a region due to its history of potentially degrading activities associated with coal mining and an industrial complex focused on cement and lime production. To ensure the sustainable use of this protected area, it is essential to assess soil health. In this study, fifty soil samples were collected from areas bordering the decommissioned industrial complex and coal mining remnants. The research detected contaminants, their geochemical associations, and potential sources. The evaluation included comparisons with reference values, assessment of the contamination severity, multivariate data analysis, and spatial distribution analysis. Three primary anthropogenic sources of soil contamination were identified: (1) atmospheric emissions from the industrial complex, primarily linked to As and Se contamination, with additional samples showing contamination by Ni, V, and Cr; (2) localized coal mining waste disposal, associated with As, Mo, and Se contamination; and (3) isolated fuel contamination, indicated by elevated Pb levels. Additionally, the study suggests that geogenic sources contribute to the elevated As and U levels in soils with specific geological characteristics. This characterization of potential toxic contaminants in Cabo Mondego enhances the understanding of the region's vulnerabilities and highlights the importance of its protection.
40204996	Regorafenib plus avelumab in advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: a phase 2 trial and correlative analysis.	Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) are heterogeneous tumors with limited treatment options. This phase 2 Bayesian study evaluated the combination of regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, and avelumab, a programmed death 1 (PD1) ligand 1 inhibitor, in advanced grade 2-grade 3 well-differentiated GEP neuroendocrine tumors or grade 3 GEP neuroendocrine carcinomas after progression on prior therapies. A total of 47 participants were enrolled and 42 were evaluable for efficacy. Participants received regorafenib (160 mg per day) and avelumab (10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> biweekly) in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint, 6-month objective response rate per the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1, was 18% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8-31%), with a median progression-free survival of 5.5 months (95% CI: 3.6-8). Durable responses were noted (16.6 months; 95% CI: 3.7-no response). Treatment-related adverse events were manageable, with fatigue, diarrhea and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia being most common. Exploratory biomarker analysis identified PD1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 expression and activity as potential resistance markers. These findings highlight the clinical potential of regorafenib and avelumab in GEP-NENs, emphasizing the need for predictive biomarkers and validation in future randomized trials. Clinical Trial registration: NCT03475953 .

40204992	Site-directed multivalent conjugation of antibodies to ubiquitinated payloads.	Antibody conjugates are the foundation of a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Although many antibody-conjugation techniques are robust and efficient, obtaining homogeneous multimeric conjugation products remains challenging. Here we report a modular and versatile technique for the site-directed multivalent conjugation of antibodies via the small-protein ubiquitin. Specifically, multiple ubiquitin fusions with antibodies, antibody fragments, nanobodies, peptides or small molecules such as fluorescent dyes can be conjugated to antibodies and nanobodies within 30 min. The technique, which we named 'ubi-tagging', allowed us to efficiently generate a bispecific T-cell engager as well as nanobodies conjugated to dendritic-cell-targeted antigens that led to potent T-cell responses. Using both recombinant ubi-tagged proteins and synthetic ubiquitin derivatives allows for the iterative, site-directed and multivalent conjugation of antibodies and nanobodies to a plethora of molecular moieties.

40204990	Clinically translatable mitochondrial gene therapy in muscle using tandem mtZFN architecture.	Mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) often lead to clinical pathologies. Mitochondrially-targeted zinc finger nucleases (mtZFNs) have been successful in reducing the levels of mutation-bearing mtDNA both in vivo and in vitro, resulting in a shift in the genetic makeup of affected mitochondria and subsequently to phenotypic rescue. Given the uneven distribution in the mtDNA mutation load across tissues in patients, and a great diversity in pathogenic mutations, it is of interest to develop mutation-specific, selective gene therapies that could be delivered to particular tissues. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of in vivo mitochondrial gene therapy using a novel mtZFN architecture on skeletal muscle using adeno-associated viral (AAV) platforms in a murine model harboring a pathogenic mtDNA mutation. We observed effective reduction in mutation load of cardiac and skeletal muscle, which was accompanied by molecular phenotypic rescue. The gene therapy treatment was shown to be safe when markers of immunity and inflammation were assessed. These results highlight the potential of curative approaches for mitochondrial diseases, paving the way for targeted and effective treatments.

However, data on premotor non-motor burden and motor progression in these subtypes remain inconsistent.
40204987	Magnetically actuatable 3D-printed endoscopic microsystems.	In endoscopy, there is a crucial demand for compact system designs to allow for imaging in narrow spaces and reduce the risk of damage during endoscopic procedures. Enhanced functionality of lensed endoscopes can be realized by integrating actuatable imaging systems with flexible fiber bundles. Conventionally fabricated actuatable endoscopes are, however, limited in their miniaturization capability, typically resulting in system diameters greater than 1 mm. In this work, we present highly compact magnetically actuatable 3D-printed and endoscopically integrated microsystems that are fabricated on the end-facet of imaging fiber bundles using two-photon polymerization. Electromagnetic microcoils affixed to the fiber bundles are utilized to stimulate embedded polymer-magnets to achieve axial, lateral, or rotatory displacement of microoptical elements leading to zooming, resolution enhancement, and increased field of view capabilities. All demonstrated systems achieve overall system diameters well below 900 µm, marking a distinct advancement in the miniaturization of actuatable endoscopic devices. This work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating highly functional and compact optical systems within endoscopes, unlocking new potential for their application in diverse fields, for example in minimally invasive ("keyhole") surgery or intravascular imaging.
40204986	Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in Brazil in the past 55 years (1967-2022): evolutionary rates and patterns.	Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a common virus that infects pigs. It exhibits marked genetic variability, which is affected by factors such as vaccination and commercial trade. In this study, a retrospective analysis of PCV2 was performed based on molecular characterization, Bayesian inference, and haplotype networks in tissue samples obtained from Brazilian pig herds from 1967 to 2018. A nested PCR targeting a 225-nucleotide fragment of the PCV2 capsid gene was performed, followed by bidirectional sequencing. Out of 178 samples tested, 39 (21.9%) were positive for PCV2. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strains from this study collected before the introduction of a PCV2 vaccine clustered with genotype 2d reference strains. The mean substitution rate was 1.54 × 10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per site per year (s/s/y). The haplotype diversity of PCV2 was 0.98, which shows a high mutation rate compatible with the topology found in the haplotype network. Our study shows that most of the Brazilian isolates, including those obtained before the introduction of the PCV2 vaccine, were similar to PCV2d reference strains, suggesting that this genotype was already circulating before the introduction of the vaccine in Brazil. One of the PCV2 sequences was from an isolate from 1967, making it the oldest sequenced isolate from the Americas, and the second oldest worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis and haplotype network analysis indicated a high degree of diversity of PCV2 as well as a high rate of evolution. These results increase our knowledge about the genetic diversity, evolution, and dispersal patterns of PCV2 in Brazil.

40204984	LncRNA H19 inhibited dermal papilla cell senescence process through miR-29a by targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.	Androgenetic alopecia is a common type of hair loss disease. As the most promising seeder for cell-based therapy, dermal papilla cells are prone to undergo premature senescence during passaging in vitro. Our previous studies revealed high expression of lncRNA H19 in early-passage dermal papilla cells and the maintenance of hair follicle-inducing ability upon prolonged culture. However, the exact mechanism of H19 regulating Wnt signaling pathway related to hair follicle regeneration has not been fully elucidated. Here, a cell senescence model was constructed by continuous cultivation in vitro to investigate the molecular mechanism of H19 in human dermal papilla cells. Animal hair follicle inductivity, cell proliferation and molecular experiments were performed to evaluate the cell inductivity, proliferation, senescence, expression of Wnt signaling key factors in early- and late-passage dermal papilla cells. Ectopic expression and silencing experiments were conducted to estimate effects of H19 on the proliferation and senescence of dermal papilla cells and the possible mechanism. Hair follicles from frontal baldness-prone and occipital non-balding areas of patients with androgenetic alopecia were exploited to detect the expression of H19 and relevant factors. Results showed late-passage DP8 cells exhibited lost hair follicle inductive properties, attenuated cell proliferation, elevated senescent marker and key Wnt factor levels, decreased inducing marker levels. Furthermore, overexpression of H19 inhibited senescence marker expression by binding to SAHH to upregulate miR-29, thus activating the Wnt signaling pathway to maintain inducing ability of DP cells. Knockdown of H19 showed opposite experimental results. Consistently, H19 together with miR-29a levels were lower and the expression levels of miR-29a target genes (DKK1, SFRP2) increased in the dermal papilla cells from frontal baldness-prone and occipital non-balding areas. Conclusively, our data provide a novel insight into the regulation and mechanism of H19 in inhibiting dermal papilla cell senescence, suggesting a potential therapy strategy for androgenetic alopecia.
40204983	Factors affecting irreversible inhibition of EGFR and influence of chirality on covalent binding.	The discovery of targeted covalent inhibitors is of increasing importance in drug discovery. Finding efficient covalent binders requires modulation of warhead reactivity and optimisation of warhead geometry and non-covalent interactions. Uncoupling the contributions that these factors make to potency is difficult and best practice for a testing cascade that is pragmatic and informative is yet to be fully established. We studied the structure-reactivity-activity relationships of a series of analogues of the EGFR inhibitor poziotinib with point changes in two substructural regions as well as variations in warhead reactivity and geometry. This showed that a simple probe displacement assay that is appropriately tuned in respect of timing and reagent concentrations can reveal structural effects on all three factors: non-covalent affinity, warhead reactivity and geometry. These effects include the detection of potency differences between an enantiomeric pair that differ greatly in their activity and their capacity to form a covalent bond. This difference is rationalised by X-ray crystallography and computational studies and the effect translates quantitatively into cellular mechanistic and phenotypic effects.
40204982	Complementary approaches define the metabolic features that accompany Richter syndrome transformation.	Richter syndrome (RS) is the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into a high-grade lymphoma with previously unknown metabolic features. Transcriptomic data from primary CLL and RS samples, as well as RS-patient-derived xenografts, highlighted cellular metabolism as one of the most significant differentially expressed processes. Activity assays of key enzymes confirmed the intense metabolic rewiring of RS cells, which is characterized by an elevated rate of Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and glutamine metabolism. These pathways were sustained by increased uptake of glucose and glutamine, two critical substrates for these cells. Moreover, RS cells showed activation of anabolic processes that resulted in the synthesis of nucleotides and lipids necessary to support their high proliferation. Exposure to drugs targeting PI3K and NF-kB, two master regulators of cellular metabolism, resulted in the shutdown of ATP production and glycolysis. Overall, these data suggest that metabolic rewiring characterizes the transformation of CLL into RS, presenting new translational opportunities.

40204980	Benchmark of computational methods to detect digenism in sequencing data.	Digenic inheritance is characterized by the combined alteration of two different genes leading to a disease. It could explain the etiology of many currently undiagnosed rare diseases. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, the identification of digenic inheritance patterns has become more technically feasible, yet still poses significant challenges without any gold standard method. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of the existing methods developed to detect digenic inheritance in sequencing data and provide a classification in cohort-based and individual-based methods. The latter category of methods appeared the most applicable to rare diseases, especially the ones not needing patient phenotypic description as input. We discuss the availability of the different methods, their output and scalability to inform potential users. Focusing on methods to detect digenic inheritance in the case of very rare or heterogeneous diseases, we propose a benchmark using different real-life scenarios involving known digenic and putative neutral pairs of genes. Among these different methods, DiGePred stood out as the one giving the least number of false positives, ARBOCK as giving the greatest number of true positives, and DIEP as having the best balance between both. By synthesizing the state-of-the-art techniques and providing insights into their practical utility, this benchmark serves as a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians in selecting suitable methodologies for detecting digenic inheritance in a wide range of disorders using sequencing data.
40204979	Pulmonary hypertension in pediatrics: from clinical suspicion to management.	Pediatric pulmonary hypertension differs from adult pulmonary hypertension in many ways, including multifactorial etiologies and comorbidities that can impact diagnosis, response to therapy, and outcome. The main etiologies of pediatric PH are idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), PAH associated with congenital heart disease (PAH-CDH) and developmental lung disorders. Thorough diagnostic evaluation is necessary to properly classify pulmonary hypertension, find a potential treatable cause, and guide therapy. Diagnosis still relies on invasive hemodynamics that require sedation in most children. Management of pediatric pulmonary hypertension is mainly guided by small-scale studies, expert opinion, and extrapolation of adult data considering the paucity of trials in this population. The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date summary of current knowledge on pediatric pulmonary hypertension, covering diagnosis to management, and to highlight the key takeaways from the pediatric task force of the 7th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension, particularly regarding classification modifications, risk stratification, and management. What is known: • Pediatric pulmonary hypertension is a rare condition, with the main etiologies being idiopathic, associated with congenital heart disease and developmental lung disorders. • A risk-oriented treatment approach is recommended, with lower-risk mortality as the therapeutic target. Treatment should be escalated if the treatment response is unsatisfactory. What is new: • Classification of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease is expanded beyond the concept of a shunt. • Risk stratification is refined through the use of 25 validated risk factors.

40204970	Transcriptomic profiling of individual bacteria by MATQ-seq.	Bacterial single-cell transcriptomics is revolutionizing our understanding of cell-to-cell variation within bacterial populations and enables gene expression profiling in complex microbial communities. Using the eukaryotic multiple annealing and dC-tailing-based quantitative single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) (MATQ-seq) approach, we have developed a robust bacterial scRNA-seq protocol, which integrates index sorting, random priming and rRNA depletion. This method stands out for its high rate of cell retention and its suitability for experiments with limited input material, offering a reliable method even for small sample sizes. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol covering the entire process of generating single-bacteria transcriptomes, including experimental and computational analysis. It involves (i) single-cell isolation via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and cell lysis, (ii) reverse transcription and cDNA amplification using robotic liquid handling, (iii) rRNA depletion, (iv) indexing and sequencing, and (v) data processing steps to start comprehensive data analysis. Using model organisms such as Salmonella enterica, we show that the method achieves a retention rate of 95%, defined as the rate of initially sorted cells converted into effective sequencing libraries. This substantially surpasses other available protocols. The method robustly detects 300-600 genes per cell, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing a broad transcriptomic profile. The entire procedure from FACS-based single-cell isolation to raw data generation spans ~5 d. As MATQ-seq has already been proven robust in several bacterial species, it holds promise for the establishment of a streamlined microbial scRNA-seq platform.
40204969	Enhanced energy storage in high-entropy ferroelectric polymers.	Relaxor ferroelectrics have been intensively studied during the past two decades for capacitive energy storage in modern electronics and electrical power systems. However, the energy density of relaxor ferroelectrics is fundamentally limited by early polarization saturation and largely reduced polarization despite high dielectric constants. To overcome this challenge, here we report the formation of a high-entropy superparaelectric phase in relaxor ferroelectric polymers induced by low-dose proton irradiation, which exhibits delayed polarization saturation, reduced ferroelectric loss and markedly improved polarizability. Our combined theoretical and experimental results reveal that new chemical bonds generated by the irradiation-induced chemical reactions are essential to the formation of the high-entropy state in ferroelectric polymers. The high-entropy superparaelectric phase endows the polymer with a substantially enhanced intrinsic energy density of 45.7 J cm<sup>-3</sup> at room temperature, outperforming the current ferroelectric polymers and nanocomposites under the same electric field. Our work widens the high-entropy concept in ferroelectrics and lays the foundation for the future exploration of high-performance ferroelectric polymers.
40204968	DNA photofluids show life-like motion.	As active matter, cells exhibit non-equilibrium structures and behaviours such as reconfiguration, motility and division. These capabilities arise from the collective action of biomolecular machines continuously converting photoenergy or chemical energy into mechanical energy. Constructing similar dynamic processes in vitro presents opportunities for developing life-like intelligent soft materials. Here we report an active fluid formed from the liquid-liquid phase separation of photoresponsive DNA nanomachines. The photofluids can orchestrate and amplify nanoscale mechanical movements by orders of magnitude to produce macroscopic cell-like behaviours including elongation, division and rotation. We identify two dissipative processes in the DNA droplets, photoalignment and photofibrillation, which are crucial for harnessing stochastic molecular motions cooperatively. Our results demonstrate an active liquid molecular system that consumes photoenergy to create ordered out-of-equilibrium structures and behaviours. This system may help elucidate the physical principles underlying cooperative motion in active matter and pave the way for developing programmable interactive materials.
40204967	Transcriptional regulation of ETV5 by mitogen-activated protein kinase via ETS-1 in human pancreatic cancer cells.	Pancreatic cancer is characterized by constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase /extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) driven by gain-of-function mutations of KRAS. Our previous transcriptome sequencing of ERK1/2-attenuated cultured pancreatic cancer cells unveiled numerous downstream genes activated by ERK1/2 including ETV5. In this study, we explored the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of ETV5 by ERK1/2 in human pancreatic cancer cells. Detailed reporter assays uncovered a core promoter region spanning between - 350 and - 985 from the transcription start site of ETV5 as a strong responsive element to ERK1/2 activity. Moreover, ETS proto-oncogene 1, transcription factor (ETS-1) was found to bind to one of consensus binding sites in the core region and to promote ERK1/2-mediated upregulation of ETV5. Investigation of functional significances of ETS variant transcription factor 5 (ETV5) expression in the pancreatic cancer cells revealed that ETV5 was associated with resistance to gemcitabine; while no significance in proliferation, migration, and invasion. ETV5 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues resected from patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with KRAS mutations, which was consistent with ETV5 as a downstream upregulated molecule of RAS-ERK1/2 pathway. This study elucidated the mechanism of ERK1/2-mediated transcriptional regulation of ETV5 in human cancer cells, which could contribute to understand pancreatic cancer pathobiology.
40204965	Improvement of flicker phenomenon at low frequencies in AMOLED displays by applying compensation scheme of variable reset voltage.	In this study, we propose a novel compensation scheme that utilizes variable reset voltage (VRV) to mitigate the flicker phenomenon observed in low temperature poly-Si and oxide (LTPO) active-matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) displays at low frequencies. We have experimentally demonstrated that the flicker caused by luminance fluctuations at low frequencies is the result of interactions between the slow transient de-trapping of the oxide thin film transistor (TFT) and hysteresis of the driving TFT (D-TFT). Although slow transient de-trapping of the oxide TFT is difficult to be compensated, we have demonstrated that D-TFT hysteresis can be modulated by adjusting the gate in panel (GIP) timing and reset voltage. Accordingly, the luminance amplitude component at 1 Hz was significantly reduced from 0.201 cd/m<sup>2</sup> to 0.093 cd/m<sup>2</sup> by applying sequentially modulated VRV within the skip frame where image data were not updated. Consequently, the flicker phenomenon was improved at low driving frequencies below 10 Hz.
40204964	Prescribed burning has negligible effects on the plant-soil system in Pinus sylvestris L. forests of the European Alps.	The current increase in large wildfires is a socio-economic and ecological threat, particularly in populated mountain regions. Prescribed burning is a fuel management technique based on the planned application of fire to achieve land management goals; still, little is known about its potential impacts on tree physiology and soil properties in the European Alps, where it has never been applied. In spring 2022, we tested the effects of prescribed burning for fire hazard reduction in a dry conifer forest dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). We generated an intensity gradient by manipulating surface fuels at the base of selected trees and evaluated prescribed burning effects on branch hydraulic conductivity, wood anatomy and soil physico-chemical properties in the short- and mid-term, up to one year after the treatment, with controls outside the treated area. The results showed that prescribed burning led to an effective surface fuel load reduction, and the plant-soil system was resistant, despite being affected by a considerable lack of rainfall. We conclude that even a high-intensity prescribed burning can be considered sustainable for reducing fire hazard in Scots pine forests of the European Alps, with these findings being extendable to similar forest ecosystems.
40204963	Monocyte-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (MHR) as a novel Indicator of gout risk.	Gout, a common inflammatory arthritis, is associated with elevated monocyte levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). However, the relationship between the monocyte-to-HDL-C ratio (MHR) and gout risk remains unexplored. This study investigates the association between MHR and gout risk, examines the role of MHR in gout with comorbid renal dysfunction, and provides a theoretical basis for gout prevention and treatment. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2005-2016), a cross-sectional analysis was conducted to assess the correlation between MHR levels and gout. Multiple logistic regression, subgroup analyses, and exploration of nonlinear relationships were employed. Among 7247 participants, MHR was significantly higher in gout patients (0.54 ± 0.31) compared to non-gout patients (0.47 ± 0.24). After adjustments, MHR was significantly associated with gout risk (OR = 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.2, P = 0.012). Subgroup analyses revealed a positive correlation between MHR and gout risk in males, Mexican Americans, married individuals, those with insufficient physical activity, and diabetic patients. In gout patients with renal dysfunction, MHR was 0.6 ± 0.5, showing a stronger positive association (OR = 7.4, 95%CI 2.2-25.3, P = 0.001). The prevalence of gout with renal dysfunction in the highest MHR quartile was 1.7 times higher than in the lowest quartile (OR = 2.7, 95%CI 1.1-6.7, P = 0.028). These findings suggest a significant positive correlation between MHR and gout risk in U.S. adults, as well as a link between MHR and the severity of renal dysfunction in gout patients. MHR may serve as a valuable indicator for assessing gout risk and its complications, highlighting the need for further large-scale prospective studies to confirm these results.

40204959	[Routine diagnostics prior to ear surgery-results of a survey among otorhinolaryngology departments in German-speaking countries. German version].	Diagnostic testing prior to ear surgery is an important part of the work of ear specialists in hospitals. To date, there is no national or international diagnostic standard. Rather, the test batteries used are dependent on hospitals' own doctrinal opinions.
40204958	[Fitting of cochlear implant systems].	The technical fitting of cochlear implant (CI) systems is a central component of the CI care process. On the one hand, this consists of a standardized procedure, while on the other, the individual needs of the patient are taken into account. It starts with the "initial fitting" during basic therapy, where the initial focus is on achieving a satisfactory impression of sound and loudness. In the follow-up therapy, fine adjustment is carried out to achieve the best possible speech perception in quiet and in noise. The aim is to individually adjust the CI processor to audiological targets. The fitting is carried out by a specially qualified professional in accordance with the German CI fitting guidelines and takes into account anatomical conditions, electrophysiological measurements, and audiological evaluation data. The CI fitting should maintain hearing and speech perception throughout life, thus ensuring a significant improvement in quality of life. In children, achieving the best possible CI fitting is fundamental to facilitating normal speech development.
40204957	[Swallowing and swallowing disorders at the focus of otorhinolaryngology : From diagnosis to individualized treatment].	Dysphagia refers to painless impairment of the transport of liquid or solid food from the oral cavity to the stomach. If pain accompanies swallowing, this is termed odynophagia, and discomfort when swallowing saliva suggests a globus pharyngis. Swallowing disorders can occur during any one or all phases of bolus transport. The causes are manifold, due to the involvement of central control areas within the brain as well as the peripheral nervous system. The diagnosis consists of a detailed case history as well as screening forms and questionnaires. In Germany, the gold standard diagnostic procedure is flexible (video-)endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. Videofluoroscopy and electrophysiological examinations complement the diagnosis. Therapeutic options comprise functional strategies and rehabilitative exercises. However, the most important task of otorhinolaryngologists, in addition to the primary surgical treatment of tumors in the area of the upper swallowing tract (taking into account the preservation of swallowing structures), is the assessment of posttreatment dysphagia with the option of individualized surgical measures to improve swallowing.

This review provides an introduction to the topic. The first section describes the surgical anatomy and physiology of the thyroid gland. Subsequently, the most frequent benign and malignant diseases of the thyroid gland are discussed. Regarding treatment of thyroid diseases, the focus is placed on surgical therapy with all its perioperative issues as well as surgical complications and their management.
40204955	Under the covert norm: a qualitative study on the role of residency culture in burnout.	Burnout has become a major concern within healthcare. Medical residents comprise a notorious at-risk population in which approximately half of the population is affected. While previous work highlights the role of organizational risk factors as the main contributors to occupational burden, research on culture in medicine as a potential organizational risk factor is limited. The main objective of this qualitative study was to explore the expression of cultural norms from the medical resident perspective to establish the stage for future high-impact interventions.

People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) often show a mismatch between disability and T2-hyperintense white matter (WM) lesion volume (LV), that in general is referred to as the clinico-radiological paradox.
40204953	Enhancement of colorectal cancer therapy through interruption of the HSF1-HSP90 axis by p53 activation or cell cycle inhibition.	The stress-associated chaperone system is an actionable target in cancer therapies. It is ubiquitously upregulated in cancer tissues and enables tumorigenicity by stabilizing oncoproteins. Most inhibitors target the key component, heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90). Although HSP90 inhibitors are highly tumor-selective, they fail in clinical trials. These failures are partly due to interference with a negative regulatory feedback loop in the heat-shock response (HSR): in response to HSP90 inhibition, there is compensatory synthesis of stress-inducible chaperones, mediated by the transcription factor heat-shock-factor 1 (HSF1). We recently identified that wild-type p53 reduces the HSR by repressing HSF1 via a p21-CDK4/6-MAPK-HSF1 axis. Here, we test whether in HSP90-based therapies, simultaneous p53 activation or direct cell cycle inhibition interrupts the deleterious HSF1-HSR axis and improves the efficiency of HSP90 inhibitors. We found that the clinically relevant p53 activator Idasanutlin suppresses the HSF1-HSR activity in HSP90 inhibitor-based therapies. This combination synergistically reduces cell viability and accelerates cell death in p53-proficient colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, murine tumor-derived organoids, and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Mechanistically, upon combination therapy, CRC cells upregulate p53-associated pathways, apoptosis, and inflammatory pathways. Likewise, in a CRC mouse model, dual HSF1-HSP90 inhibition represses tumor growth and remodels immune cell composition. Importantly, inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6) under HSP90 inhibition phenocopies synergistic repression of the HSR in p53-proficient CRC cells. Moreover, in p53-deficient CRC cells, HSP90 inhibition in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors similarly suppresses the HSF1-HSR and reduces cancer growth. Likewise, p53-mutated PDOs respond to dual HSF1-HSP90 inhibition, providing a strategy to target CRC independent of the p53 status. In sum, we provide new options to improve HSP90-based therapies to enhance CRC therapies.
40204952	The BCL-2 protein family: from discovery to drug development.	The landmark discovery of the BCL-2 gene and then its function marked the identification of inhibition of apoptotic cell death as a crucial novel mechanism driving cancer development and launched the quest to discover the molecular control of apoptosis. This work culminated in the generation of specific inhibitors that are now in clinical use, saving and improving tens of thousands of lives annually. Here, some of the original players of this story, describe the sequence of critical discoveries. The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, frequently observed in follicular lymphoma, allowed the identification and the cloning of a novel oncogene (BCL-2) juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus (IgH). Of note, BCL-2 acted in a distinct manner as compared to then already known oncogenic proteins like ABL and c-MYC. BCL-2 did not promote cell proliferation but inhibited cell death, as originally shown in growth factor dependent haematopoietic progenitor cell lines (e.g., FDC-P1) and in Eμ-Myc/Eμ-Bcl-2 double transgenic mice. Following a rapid expansion of the BCL-2 protein family, the Abbott Laboratories solved the first structure of BCL-XL and subsequently the BCL-XL/BAK peptide complex, opening the way to understanding the structures of other BCL-2 family members and, finally, to the generation of inhibitors of the different pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, thanks to the efforts of Servier/Norvartis, Genentech/WEHI, AbbVie, Amgen, Prelude and Gilead. Although the BCL-2 inhibitor Venetoclax is in clinical use and inhibitors of BCL-XL and MCL-1 are undergoing clinical trials, several questions remain on whether therapeutic windows can be achieved and what other agents should be used in combination with BH3 mimetics to achieve optimal therapeutic impact for cancer therapy. Finally, the control of the expression of BH3-only proteins and pro-survival BCL-2 family members needs to be better understood as this may identify novel targets for cancer therapy. This story is still not concluded!
40204951	Re-appraising assays on permeabilized blood cancer cells testing venetoclax or other BH3 mimetic agents selectively targeting pro-survival BCL2 proteins.	BH3 mimetic drugs that selectively target the pro-survival BCL2 proteins are highly promising for cancer treatment, most notably for treating blood cancers. Venetoclax, which inhibits BCL2, is now approved for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Preferably, robust and validated assays would identify patients most likely to benefit from therapy with venetoclax itself or with inhibitors of other pro-survival proteins. A sophisticated method that has been developed is the BH3 profiling assay. In this assay, permeabilized, instead of intact, cells are treated for a few hours with inhibitors of the pro-survival BCL2 proteins, and the resultant mitochondrial depolarization measured. Sensitivity to a specific inhibitor (e.g., venetoclax or other BH3 mimetics) is then used to infer the reliance of a tumor (e.g., CLL) on one or more pro-survival BCL2 proteins. However, we found that this methodology cannot reliably identify such dependencies. In part, this is because almost all cells express multiple pro-survival BCL2 proteins that restrain BAX and BAK which must be inhibited before mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis can proceed. Using genetic and pharmacological tools across multiple cell line models of blood cancer, we demonstrated that selective BCL2 inhibitors have important flow-on effects that includes the redistribution of BH3-only proteins to ancillary pro-survival proteins not directly engaged by the inhibitor. These secondary effects, critical to the biological action of selective inhibitors, were not accurately recapitulated in permeabilized cells, probably due to the limited time frame possible in such assays or the altered biophysical conditions when cells are permeabilized. While we could consistently define the sensitivity of a tumor cell to a particular BH3 mimetic drugs using intact cells, this was not reliable with permeabilized cells. These studies emphasize the need to carefully evaluate assays on permeabilized cells undertaken with inhibitors of the pro-survival BCL2 proteins.
40204950	Formyl peptide receptor 1 and its antagonist T0080 in atherosclerosis.	Focal inflammation and arterial damage driven by macrophages are key pathogenic processes in atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms that regulate these processes remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) agonist, a mitochondrial N-formyl peptide, is elevated in the blood of patients with atherosclerosis and correlates with carotid stenosis. Macrophages expressing FPR1 were found in atherosclerotic lesions. Conditional deletion of Fpr1 in macrophages reduced plaque formation, local inflammation, and aortic atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)<sup>-/-</sup> mice. FPR1 activates protein kinase C (PKC) in macrophages, promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), which accelerates the apoptosis of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. To inhibit FPR1 bioactivity, we developed an antagonist, T0080. Therapeutic administration of T0080 attenuates atherosclerotic progression in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of FPR1 in macrophage-mediated atherosclerotic plaque formation and support further investigation of T0080-mediated FPR1 inhibition as a potential treatment for atherosclerosis.
40204946	In-utero and newborn factors and thyroid cancer incidence in adult women in the Sister Study cohort.

Our study aimed to investigate associations of in-utero and newborn characteristics with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) incidence in adult women.
40204945	Fine mapping and identification of CqMYB62 as the subgynoecy gene in chieh-qua (Benincasa hispida Cogn. var. Chieh-qua How).	It was hypothesized that Bch08G003160 (CqMYB62), located in the 51.08 Kb region on chromosome 08, might be an important candidate gene for the subgynoecy trait in chieh-qua, based on BSA-seq and linkage mapping approaches. In cucurbit crops, the use of female lines can greatly increase the yield of a single plant and is especially important for the production of hybrid generation seeds, thus being of great interest to breeders. To identify genes regulating sex differentiation in chieh-qua, genetic analysis of the subgynoecy trait was conducted using a chieh-qua F<sub>2</sub> population. Initial localization of the locus was done using BSA-seq, followed by fine mapping with a large F<sub>2</sub> population (n = 2,741). The locus was ultimately narrowed down to a 51.08 Kb region on Chr08, revealing a single gene Bch08G003160 (CqMYB62) in this region. Further analysis revealed that the presence of two variant loci (SNP_416 and SNP_317) in the coding region resulted in premature termination of the codon and loss of function of the structural domain of the PLN03212 superfamily. Moreover, our research indicated that the subgynoecy trait mediated by CqMYB62 in chieh-qua is potentially regulated by gibberellic acid (GA). Two efficient dCAPS markers were developed to distinguish subgynoecy. In summary, these findings highlight the critical role of CqMYB62 in subgynoecy trait regulation, offering potential implications for chieh-qua breeding programs.
40204943	Investigating the role of HMGA2 plasma level as a diagnostic marker in bladder urothelial carcinoma patients.	Bladder Cancer (BC) is an environmental cancer caused by exposure to a globally widespread carcinogen, which is smoking, and it is characterized by high rates of recurrence and mortality. High Mobility Group A2 (HMGA2) protein is an oncofetal protein that belongs to the HMG family proteins. It is involved in various stages of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. This study investigated the presence and levels of the HMGA2 protein in bladder urothelial carcinoma patients' plasma and in healthy individuals and their association with the clinicopathological features of bladder urothelial carcinoma.

40204939	Identification and validation of five novel protein targets for type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Despite advances in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) therapy, challenges remain due to the lack of novel therapeutic targets. We used Mendelian randomization to integrate cis-expression quantitative trait loci data for circulating proteins from the eQTLGen Consortium (31,684 individuals) with T2DM summary statistics from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit Open Genome-Wide Association Studies Project (61,714 cases, 593,952 controls). 42 genes were significantly associated with T2DM. Colocalization analysis revealed that six genes (CLSTN1, KCNJ11, MLX, DLD, RELA, and ULK1) shared common causal variants with T2DM. Among them, CLSTN1 (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70-0.90), KCNJ11 (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.60-0.73), and MLX (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.65-0.82) were negatively associated with T2DM, while DLD (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.15-1.65), RELA (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.41-2.55), and ULK1 (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.17-1.71) were positively associated with T2DM. A matched case-control study further validated these associations, except for DLD, showing significant downregulation of CLSTN1, KCNJ11, and MLX (P < 0.05) alongside upregulation of RELA and ULK1 (P < 0.05) in T2DM patients. These findings underscore the potential of these proteins as drug targets, warranting further clinical investigation to confirm their therapeutic relevance.

40204937	Regulating Sirtuin 3-mediated mitochondrial dynamics through vanillic acid improves muscle atrophy in cancer-induced cachexia.	Cancer cachexia is a cancer-associated disease characterized by gradual body weight loss due to pathologic muscle and fat loss, but effective treatments are still lacking. Here, we investigate the possible effect of vanillic acid (VA), known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects, on mitochondria-mediated improvement of cancer cachexia. We utilized cachexia-like models using CT26 colon cancer and dexamethasone. VA improved representative parameters of cancer cachexia including body weight loss and increased serum intereukin-6 levels. VA also attenuated muscle loss in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles, inhibited proteolytic markers including muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MURF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and improved mitochondrial function through alteration of sirtuins 3 (SIRT3) and mitofusin 1 (MFN1). Importantly, silencing the SIRT3 gene abolished the effect of VA, indicating that SIRT3 is important in the mechanism of action of VA. Overall, we suggest using VA as a novel therapeutic agent that can fundamentally treat and recover muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia patients.
40204936	Platelet miRNAs as early biomarkers for progression of idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder to a synucleinopathy.	Individuals diagnosed with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) have a high risk of developing Lewy body disorders (LBD), mainly Parkinson's disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). As we have previously identified seven platelet-derived miRNAs as potential biomarkers for DLB, in this pilot study we aimed to investigate whether specific expression changes of these miRNAs are also present in IRBD. RNA was obtained from platelets of individuals with IRBD (n = 29) and controls (n = 34), and miRNA levels were determined with a miRCURY LNA miRNA Custom PCR Panel. miRNA interactomes of deregulated miRNAs were determined, and mRNA quantification of miRNA target genes was carried out using real-time PCR and the ΔΔCt method. We found that the expression of hsa-miR- 139 - 5p (p = 0.010) and hsa-miR- 142 - 3p (p = 0.017) was diminished, while hsa-miR- 191 - 5p (p = 0.023) was increased in platelets of IRBD patients compared with controls. Interactome analysis of these miRNAs showed that hsa-miR- 142 - 3p regulates genes related to the structure and maintenance of the cytoskeleton. Of the 15 genes expressed in platelets, the expression of WASL, a gene involved in actin filament organization, was increased in platelets of IRBD patients. Additionally, WASL expression correlated inversely with hsa-miR- 142 - 3p expression. Since the interactomes of hsa-miR- 139 - 5p and hsa-miR- 191 - 5p play a role in several cancer types, their expression was not addressed. Changes in hsa-miR- 142 - 3p, hsa-miR- 139 - 5p, and hsa-miR- 191 - 5p expression were found in IRBD platelets and might represent early biomarkers for LBD involving cytoskeleton dysfunction. Increased expression of WASL could indicate that altered platelet activation occurs early during the development of LBD.

Intradermal injections of fillers such as poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) microspheres and hyaluronic acid (HA) offer the possibility of skin rejuvenation. However, the biological effects of these fillers and the mechanisms underlying collagen synthesis have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the histological effects of PLLA microsphere fillers on the rat dermis.
40204931	Evaluation of the efficacy and predictive indicators of PD- 1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic cancer.	Patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) generally face a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of combining PD- 1 inhibitors with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced PDAC, and to explore the correlation between various clinical parameters and treatment outcomes.This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 57 patients with advanced PDAC treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University from January 2022 and June 2024. Patients were allocate into the two groups: the chemotherapy-alone group (29 cases) (CT), which received either the AG regimen or the mFOLFIRINOX regimen, and the imimmunotherapy plus chemotherapy group (28 cases) (ICT), which received the AG regimen or mFOLFIRINOX regimen in combination with PD- 1 inhibitors.The study compared progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse reactions between the two groups. Additionally, it analyzed the correlation between various clinical indicators and their dynamic changes over time in relation to treatment outcomes. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted for survival analysis, and log-rank tests assessed PFS and OS differences.Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified independent risk factors for prognosis, while logistic regression assessed the correlation between these factors and treatment response.The median PFS and OS in immunotherapy plus chemotherapy group were significantly superior to those in the chemotherapy-alone group (PFS: 7.3 vs. 5.8 months, P = 0.005; OS: 12 vs. 10.2 months, P = 0.031). The ORR in the group receive immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy was also significantly higher compared to the group treated with chemotherapy alone (42.86% vs. 17.24%, P = 0.03). No significant differences were observed in the incidence or severity of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAEs) between the CT and ICTgroups (any grade: 93.10% vs. 96.45%, P = 0.574; grade 3 or 4: 31.3% vs. 28.57%, P = 0.839). Patients without liver metastasis, without diabetes, or those who experience a increase in SOD levels following treatment may constitute an advantageous population for immune combination therapy. In conclusion, chemotherapy combined with PD- 1 inhibitors demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability, and significantly improved PFS, OS, and ORR compared to chemotherapy alone.

40204929	The impact of exogenous Oxytocin on visual cortex plasticity across different stages of visual development.	The plasticity of ocular dominance is most prominent during the critical period of visual development, influenced by the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the visual cortex. Astrocytes play a crucial role in regulating synaptic plasticity through phagocytosis of synapses. However, the ability of astrocytes to modulate synaptic plasticity after the critical period remains unclear. Oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide involved in neural circuit formation, has shown potential in enhancing synaptic plasticity. This study explores the role of OT in restoring visual cortical plasticity during and after the critical period of visual development. We performed monocular deprivation (MD) on mice during the critical period and extended the deprivation until adulthood. Visual cortical plasticity was evaluated using pattern visual evoked potentials (PVEPs), immunofluorescence staining, and western blotting. Excitatory synaptic markers (VGLUT1, PSD- 95) and inhibitory synaptic markers (VGAT, Gephyrin) were analyzed. The effects of OT administration, alone or combined with reverse occlusion (RO), on ocular dominance plasticity and astrocyte activity were assessed. During the critical period, MD induced a significant ocular dominance shift with reduced cortical response from the deprived eye, primarily through decreased excitatory synaptic markers (VGLUT1: P < 0.05; PSD- 95: P < 0.05). OT administration further enhanced this shift by reducing GFAP expression and decreasing astrocytic phagocytosis of excitatory synapses. After the critical period, prolonged MD reduced excitatory synaptic marker expression in the visual cortex (P < 0.05), and RO alone did not restore cortical plasticity. However, the combination of OT and RO increased excitatory synaptic marker expression (VGLUT1: P < 0.05; PSD- 95: P < 0.05 and restored ocular dominance plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that OT can modulate astrocyte activity and enhance excitatory synaptic plasticity, facilitating the recovery of visual cortical plasticity both during and after the critical period. These results highlight the potential of OT as a therapeutic intervention for visual impairments caused by disrupted sensory experiences during development.
40204928	Recommendations for robust and reproducible research on ferroptosis.	Ferroptosis is a necrotic, non-apoptotic cell death modality triggered by unrestrained iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. By unveiling the regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis and its relevance to various diseases, research over the past decade has positioned ferroptosis as a promising therapeutic target. The rapid growth of this research field presents challenges, associated with potentially inadequate experimental approaches that may lead to misinterpretations in the assessment of ferroptosis. Typical examples include assessing whether an observed phenotype is indeed linked to ferroptosis, and selecting appropriate animal models and small-molecule modulators of ferroptotic cell death. This Expert Recommendation outlines state-of-the-art methods and tools to reliably study ferroptosis and increase the reproducibility and robustness of experimental results. We present highly validated compounds and animal models, and discuss their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the regulatory mechanisms and the best-studied players in ferroptosis regulation, such as GPX4, FSP1, SLC7A11 and ACSL4, discussing frequent pitfalls in experimental design and relevant guidance. These recommendations are intended for researchers at all levels, including those entering the expanding and exciting field of ferroptosis research.
40204927	p53-regulated non-apoptotic cell death pathways and their relevance in cancer and other diseases.	Programmed cell death is a mechanism that is crucial for numerous physiological and pathological processes. Whereas p53-mediated apoptosis is a major cell death pathway in cancer, accumulating evidence indicates that p53 also has crucial roles in controlling different non-apoptotic cell death (NACD) pathways, including ferroptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy-dependent cell death, entotic cell death, parthanatos and paraptosis, and may regulate PANoptosis, cuproptosis and disulfidptosis. Notably, the function of p53 in these NACDs substantially contributes to its biological effects, particularly in cancer development and other pathological processes. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the roles and underlying mechanisms of p53-mediated NACDs, focusing on ferroptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis. We discuss the complex and distinct physiological settings in which NACDs are regulated by p53, and potential targeting of p53-regulated NACDs for the treatment of cancer and other human diseases. Finally, we highlight several important questions concerning p53-regulated NACDs that warrant further investigation.

40204924	Analysis of machining performance in turning with trihybrid nanofluids and minimum quantity lubrication.	Mono-type and dihybrid nanoparticle-enriched cutting fluids in machining processes are gaining popularity because of their outstanding benefits such as enhanced tool life and surface finish. In this work, a trihybrid nanocutting fluid was developed by mixing MWCNT Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> graphene nanoparticles with different weight concentrations. The prepared tri-hybrid nanofluids were tested during the machining of SS304 steel. Coated tungsten carbide and PVD TiAlN carbide tools are used for the machining. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to analysed the obtained data. ANOVA revealed that the interaction of cutting speed and feed had shown a good impact on surface roughness. The combinations of minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and tri-hybrid nanofluid characteristics increase surface quality by 16% and the cutting temperature by 76%, respectively, which offers future applications in the machining industry. The correlations are verified using a conformance test and have acceptable variances of 3.11% and 1.13% with the ANN approach regression analysis.
40204923	Second trimester soft markers: still worth to be mentioned?	Despite the widespread use of cell-free DNA in screening for trisomy 21, soft markers continue to be assessed in the second trimester, leading to confusion about how they affect the risk of trisomy 21, especially after an earlier screening test such as cell-free DNA screening. In this review, we provide an overview of commonly used second trimester soft markers, explain how they can be used to calculate the risk for trisomy 21, and discuss what other chromosomal or structural abnormalities might be associated with these markers. We especially focus on pathogenic copy number variants as these, in aggregate, are common and are very difficult to detect using cfDNA or even standard karyotyping.
40204922	Impact of risk and lifestyle factors on therapy goals in the treatment of breast cancer and gynecological cancer patients with integrative medicine.	As a result of advancements in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, the prognosis for cancer patients has significantly improved. The benefits of a significantly enhanced survival time lead to a more extensive concern with quality of life and managing the side effects during oncological treatment. Implementing integrative medicine strategies has been found to reduce the side effects of therapy and disease. In 2021 the S3 guideline on complementary medicine in oncology was published for the first time, which takes a stand on the most common aspects of complementary and integrative medicine in Germany. The aim was to see whether a previous healthy life style impacts the success of integrative medicine for patients.
40204921	The relationship between ethical climate and organizational cynicism: mediating role of match and identification with the organization.	Depending on its type, the ethical climate of an organization has either beneficial or detrimental effects in the workplace. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the role of employees' attachment to the organization and the coherency of values between employees and organizations in the relationship between different types of ethical climates and negative attitudes toward the organization. This cross-sectional study tested the mechanisms of the direct and indirect effects of ethical climate on organizational cynicism through person-organization fit, organizational pride, and affective commitment, attempting to determine the protective function of different ethical climates on organizational cynicism, which is an undesirable workplace phenomenon. The study focused on 1071 Polish employees from different business areas with contracts of employment. The results showed that an instrumental ethical climate had positive direct and indirect effects on organizational cynicism through all three mediators, person-organization fit, organizational pride, and affective commitment. Moreover, beneficial indirect effects of caring and independent climates on organizational cynicism through person-organization fit, organizational pride, and affective commitment were also confirmed. Law and code and rules climates were positively and indirectly related to organizational cynicism via organizational pride but not organizational affective commitment. Discussed the impact of different ethical climates on organizational cynicism and the beneficial role of person-organization fit, organizational pride, and affective commitment underlying this relationship, emphasizing the preventing function of organizational attachment, organizational pride, and values consistency between employee and organization in referring cynical attitudes in the workplace.
40204920	Cross ethnic Mendelian randomization analysis reveals causal relationship between air pollution and risk of kidney stones.	Accumulating evidence has indicated that exposures to air pollution increase the odds of kidney stones. However, the previous research methods were limited. To address this gap, we employed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets and Mendelian randomization (MR) to verify the causation. Applying publicly accessible summary datasets from UK Biobank, FinnGen consortium and Biobank Japan, a two-sample MR, and further multivariate MR were carried out to calculate the causality between air pollution [particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), PM2.5 absorbance, PM2.5-10, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides] and kidney stone risk in three different populations (European, East Asian, and South Asian). The inverse variance weighted (IVW) was utilized for its first-step assessment, supplemented with MR-Egger, weighted median, Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept and leave-one-out analysis to ensure the robustness. Employing IVW, we discovered in the European population that PM2.5 absorbance was statistically correlated with kidney stone risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.94; P = 0.04), with no heterogeneity, pleiotropy, or sensitivity observed. Additionally, the MVMR result revealed the directly causative connection between a single PM2.5 absorbance and the increase in kidney stone risk (OR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.06-2.98, p = 0.03). Our investigation proposed the correlation between PM2.5 absorbance and an increased risk of kidney stones in European populations. The control of air pollution, especially PM2.5, may have crucial implications for the prevention of kidney stones.
40204919	The use of artificial intelligence-based Siamese neural network in personalized guidance for sports dance teaching.	This work aims to explore an accurate and effective method for recognizing dance movement features, providing precise personalized guidance for sports dance teaching. First, a human skeletal graph is constructed. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to extract features from the nodes (joints) and edges (bone connections) in the graph structure, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics between joints. The GCN generates effective motion representations by aggregating the features of each node and its neighboring nodes. A dance movement recognition model combining GCN and a Siamese neural network (SNN) is proposed. The GCN module is responsible for extracting spatial features from the skeletal graph, while the SNN module evaluates the similarity between different skeletal sequences by comparing their features. The SNN employs a twin network structure, where two identical and parameter-sharing feature extraction networks process two input samples and calculate their distance or similarity in a high-dimensional feature space. The model is trained and validated on the COCO dataset. The results show that the proposed GCN-SNN model achieves an accuracy of 96.72% and an F1 score of 86.55%, significantly outperforming other comparison models. This work not only provides an efficient and intelligent personalized guidance method for sports dance teaching but also opens new avenues for the application of artificial intelligence in the education sector.
40204918	Digital twin-driven management strategies for logistics transportation systems.	With the development of Industry 5.0, the logistics industry, serving as a bridge between production and consumption, is undergoing profound changes. However, this transformation faces challenges such as data fragmentation, difficult system integration, and insufficient real-time monitoring capabilities. Consequently, the modern logistics system demands higher standards for the prediction and management of transportation behavior. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Digital Twin (DT) technology and proposes a research methodology for DT-driven management strategies. DT technology constructs virtual models of physical objects to enable real-time monitoring and data analysis of unmanned vehicle states, effectively resolving the identified issues. Specifically, the proposed method leverages DT to integrate multi-source heterogeneous data and establishes a digital model of unmanned vehicles. Furthermore, it combines the LSTM neural network algorithm to design a predictive model for time-series forecasting of transportation behaviors. The digital model is dynamically adjusted based on prediction results, further optimizing the management strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a case study on unmanned vehicle transportation behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the DT-based management strategy significantly improves the accuracy of predicting unmanned vehicle transportation behaviors and exhibits superior performance in decision aid and fault tolerance. Additionally, simulation tests confirm the reliability and efficiency of the improved algorithm in practical applications, providing an important reference for the intelligent development of modern logistics systems.
40204916	Transmission of tomato fruit blotch virus by the tomato russet mite: epidemiological implications for an emerging/re-emerging tomato disease.	The tomato russet mite (TRM), Aculops lycopersici (Trombidiformes: Eriophyoidea), was recently suspected to be the vector of tomato fruit blotch virus (ToFBV; Blunervirus solani), a newly identified kitavirus infecting tomato cultivation worldwide. Tomato fruit blotch virus represents a serious threat to tomato crops, and its transmission needs to be clarified to achieve better disease control and monitoring. Two independent transmission trials were performed by inoculating 20 and 18 healthy tomato plants with viruliferous TRM specimens. A total of 13 plants (34.21%) resulted to be infected at different time points across an 18-week period, and showed foliar symptoms consisting of slight mosaic, chlorotic areas and discoloration that were solely attributed to ToFBV infection. This is the first evidence of the ability of TRM to acquire and transmit ToFBV from and to tomato plants. The highest rate of infection and the peak of virus titre occurred late, between ten and 14 weeks after inoculation. Afterwards, a general decrease in virus infection was recorded, in association with two opposite phenological responses in the host plants that worsened or improved their vegetative status. The involvement of the eriophyid vector and the limited adaptation of ToFBV to tomato are possible explanations for such slow and erratic infection dynamics.
40204915	Understanding embolus transport and source to destination mapping of thromboemboli in hemodynamics driven by left ventricular assist device.	Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) are a key treatment option for patients with advanced heart failure, but they carry a significant risk of thromboembolic complications. While improved LVAD design, and systemic anticoagulation regimen, have helped mitigate thromboembolic risks, ischemic stroke due to adverse thromboembolic events remains a major concern with current LVAD therapies. Improved understanding of embolic events, and embolus movement to the brain, is critical to develop techniques to minimize risks of occlusive embolic events such as a stroke after LVAD implantation. Here, we address this need, and devise a quantitative in silico framework to characterize thromboembolus transport and distrbution in hemodynamics driven by an operating LVAD. We conduct systematic numerical experiments to establish that our framework can quantify the source-to-destination transport patterns of thromboemboli as a function of: LVAD outflow graft anastomosis, LVAD operating pulse modulation, thromboembolus sizes, and origin locations of emboli. Additionally, we demonstrate how the resulting embolus distribution patterns compare and correlate with descriptors based solely on hemodynamic patterns such as helicity, vorticity, and wall shear stress. Using the concepts of size-dependent embolus-hemodynamics interactions, and jet impingement driven flow for hemodynamics under LVAD operation as established in our prior works, we gain valuable insights on departure of thromboembolus distribution from flow distribution, and establish that our in silico model can generate deep insights into embolus dynamics which is not otherwise available from standard of care imaging and clinical data.
40204914	A hybrid theoretical-numerical-experimental framework for robust health monitoring of thin-walled hollow composite members using guided waves.	Thin-walled hollow composite members (HCM) are extensively employed in aerospace and automotive industries due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and design flexibility. This study introduces a hybrid -numerical-experimental framework for robust detection and characterisation of barely visible damage in HCM using guided waves (GW). It focuses on assessing surface abrasion and hairline cracks, two common yet challenging damage types encountered in the field. A semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) formulation is developed for the dispersion analysis alongside numerical simulations using finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics<sup>®</sup>, and experimental validation is performed to ensure accurate and reliable results. The study focuses on GW propagation and scattering behaviour under varying damage scenarios, exploring the effects of damage size, position, and its offset on wave features. Parametric analyses show significant variations in wave characteristics such as group velocity, amplitude, and mode features. A waveform and statistical approach incorporating continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and energy enables precise damage classification. Results show that abrasion-induced damages cause substantial changes in GW features in terms of DIs and statistical parameters, while hairline cracks marginally affect the damage indices and wave features, aiding in distinguishing between different damage types. These findings contribute to the development of robust damage identification algorithms for structural health monitoring, providing valuable insights for optimising the maintenance and performance of composite structures in critical engineering environments, ensuring safety and operational efficiency.
40204913	S100PBP interacts with nucleoporin TPR and facilitates XY crossover formation in mice.	During meiosis, at least one crossover is selectively generated per pair of homologous chromosomes through homologous recombination to ensure their faithful segregation. The molecular mechanisms controlling meiotic recombination, particularly in XY chromosomes that share a tiny region of homology (i.e., the pseudoautosomal region, PAR), remain poorly understood. Here, we identify S100PBP as a key modulator of both XY and autosomal recombination in mice. S100pbp-knockout mice exhibit male infertility and spermatogenesis arrest at meiotic metaphase I, resulting from a drastic reduction in XY crossovers. This failure in XY crossover formation is due to a reduction in TEX11/M1AP-bound recombination intermediates at the PAR. By contrast, disruption of S100PBP significantly increases the number of recombination intermediates and crossovers on autosomes. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry revealed that S100PBP interacts with the nucleoporin TPR. Furthermore, S100PBP is localized specifically to the nuclear pores of meiocytes, likely in a TPR-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that S100PBP promotes XY crossover formation while limiting excess autosomal crossovers and shed light on the potential role of nuclear pores in regulating meiotic recombination.
40204912	TLR4 endocytosis and endosomal TLR4 signaling are distinct and independent outcomes of TLR4 activation.	Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling at the plasma membrane and in endosomes results in distinct contributions to inflammation and host defence. Current understanding indicates that endocytosis of cell surface-activated TLR4 is required to enable subsequent signaling from endosomes. Contrary to this prevailing model, our data show that endosomal TLR4 signaling is not reliant on cell surface-expressed TLR4 or ligand-induced TLR4 endocytosis. Moreover, previously recognized requirements for the accessory molecule CD14 in TLR4 endocytosis and endosomal signaling are likely attributable to CD14 binding as well as trafficking and transferring lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to TLR4 at different subcellular localizations. TLR4 endocytosis requires the TLR4 intracellular signaling domain, contributions by phospholipase C gamma 2, spleen tyrosine kinase, E1/E2 ubiquitination enzymes, but not canonical TLR signaling adaptors and cascades. Thus, our study identifies independently operating TLR4 signaling modes that control TLR4 endocytosis, pro-inflammatory cell surface-derived, as well as endosomal TLR4 signaling. This revised understanding of how TLR4 functions within cells might be harnessed to selectively amplify or restrict TLR4 activation for the development of adjuvants, vaccines and therapeutics.
40204911	CCL3 correlates with ferroptosis in intervertebral disc degeneration and its prognostic significance.	Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a prevalent and debilitating condition associated with low back pain (LBP). Despite its significant impact, effective diagnostic markers for early-stage IVDD remain elusive. Recent research has implicated ferroptosis, a newly recognized form of programmed cell death, in the pathogenesis of IVDD, particularly involving disturbances in iron homeostasis. Additionally, the CC Chemokine Ligand 3 (CCL3) has been linked to macrophage migration and the progression of IVDD, yet its precise diagnostic and prognostic utility remains uncertain. This study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis and the involvement of CCL3 in IVDD, with the objective of establishing their diagnostic and prognostic significance. By uncovering these mechanisms, novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the diagnosis and prognosis of IVDD may be identified. Single-cell sequencing data were acquired from the TCGA database, and a range of bioinformatics methods were employed for comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, validation experiments were conducted using in vitro techniques, including the analysis of human tissue samples, co-culture assays with neutralizing antibodies, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting. Our findings suggest that CCL3 holds promise as a diagnostic and may was prognostic biomarker for IVDD. Validation experiments demonstrated that CCL3 functions via the pAMPK/AMPK pathway, thereby modulating apoptosis and impacting the progression of IVDD. Our study underscores the diagnostic and prognostic potential of CCL3 in patients with IVDD. Further investigations are warranted to explore therapeutic strategies targeting CCL3, ultimately enhancing the management of IVDD.
40204910	Renal denervation plus cardiac ablation vs. cardiac ablation alone for patients with atrial fibrillation and uncontrolled arterial hypertension : A systematic review and updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex arrhythmia often worsened by hypertension (HTN). Pharmacological treatments frequently underperform, and the best approach, particularly combining renal denervation (RDN) with cardiac ablation (CA), remains unclear.
40204909	Plasticity in inhibitory networks improves pattern separation in early olfactory processing.	Distinguishing between nectar and non-nectar odors is challenging for animals due to shared compounds and varying ratios in complex mixtures. Changes in nectar production throughout the day and over the animal's lifetime add to the complexity. The honeybee olfactory system, containing fewer than 1000 principal neurons in the early olfactory relay, the antennal lobe (AL), must learn to associate diverse volatile blends with rewards. Previous studies identified plasticity in the AL circuits, but its role in odor learning remains poorly understood. Using a biophysical computational model, tuned by in vivo electrophysiological data, and live imaging of the honeybee's AL, we explored the neural mechanisms of plasticity in the AL. Our findings revealed that when trained with a set of rewarded and unrewarded odors, the AL inhibitory network suppresses responses to shared chemical compounds while enhancing responses to distinct compounds. This results in improved pattern separation and a more concise neural code. Our calcium imaging data support these predictions. Analysis of a graph convolutional neural network performing an odor categorization task revealed a similar mechanism for contrast enhancement. Our study provides insights into how inhibitory plasticity in the early olfactory network reshapes the coding for efficient learning of complex odors.
40204908	Global coordination of brain activity by the breathing cycle.	Neuronal activities that synchronize with the breathing rhythm have been found in humans and a host of mammalian species, not only in brain areas closely related to respiratory control or olfactory coding but also in areas linked to emotional and higher cognitive functions. In parallel, evidence is mounting for modulations of perception and action by the breathing cycle. In this Review, we discuss the extent to which brain activity locks to breathing across areas, levels of organization and brain states, and the physiological origins of this global synchrony. We describe how waves of sensory activity evoked by nasal airflow spread through brain circuits, synchronizing neuronal populations to the breathing cycle and modulating faster oscillations, cell assembly formation and cross-area communication, thereby providing a mechanistic link from breathing to neural coding, emotion and cognition. We argue that, through evolution, the breathing rhythm has come to shape network functions across species.

40204906	Magnetically adjustable AND/XOR logic gates using Terfenol-D in phononic crystal.	This study present novel configurations for magnetically tunable AND/XOR logic gates, employing ring resonators, cross-shaped waveguides, and Terfenol-D cylinders integrated into a solid-solid phononic crystal. The proposed design provides the varying magnetic field intensities of Terfenol-D within the MHz frequency spectrum. These gates boast an ultra-compact design with a footprint measuring just 249× [Formula: see text] m² and 129× [Formula: see text] m², featuring two input waveguides and one output waveguide, each outfitted with two ring resonators. Each ring resonator integrates three utilized Terfenol-D cylinders that enable modulation of Young's modulus. The symmetrical configuration of the structures facilitates the creation of unique resonant frequencies for the AND/XOR gates, adapting identically to variations in magnetic field intensities. These tunable AND/XOR gates are designed to be influenced by external magnetic fields, utilizing the variations in Young's modulus that occur in magnetostrictive materials under various magnetic field intensities. The tunability and operational efficiency of these gates are greatly play a crucial role for enhancing the resonance frequency numbers of the ring resonators and the dynamic modulation of the Terfenol-D properties. Tunability experiments were conducted at several Young's modulus values of Terfenol-Ds, corresponding to three varying magnetic field intensities, resulting in resonance frequencies of 1.5030 MHz, 1.5032 MHz, and 1.5033 MHz for the AND gate and 1.5040 MHz, 1.5044 MHz, 1.5047 MHz for the XOR gate. The performance of the gates was appraised using the finite element method, which yielded an average contrast ratio of 11.59 dB and 12.15 dB for AND logic gate and XOR logic gate, respectively. The suggested AND/XOR gates present a simple yet efficient solution for acoustic communication systems, networks, and digital acoustic computing circuits.
40204905	The role for pancreatic preserving surgery for duodenal (D2) gastrointestinal stromal tumours.	A variety of surgical options are available to achieve a complete oncological resection for duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). The most common location of such tumours is the second portion (D2) of the duodenum. The key step in assessing the feasibility of localised duodenal resection is the relationship between the GIST and ampulla. We present our surgical approach and results for patients with D2 GISTs undergoing surgical resection at our tertiary oncology centre.

Clinical guidelines (CGs) developed by expert communities benefit both the patient and the clinician. Meanwhile a considerable proportion of specialists are not familiar with or follow them in their daily practice. Colonic diverticulitis (CD) is the third most common cause of hospitalization among patients with gastrointestinal diseases and common indication for colon resection. Actual tactics for diagnosis and treatment of CD, as well as data on what influences its choice and how the decisions made agree with the existing CGs can be identified by anonymous surveys.
40204903	Antiviral potential of Melissa officinalis extracts against influenza and emerging coronaviruses.	Melissa officinalis is a perennial medicinal plant traditionally used for its diverse biological activities, including antiviral properties. This study investigates the antiviral efficacy of various extracts, including water, acetone, alkaloid, non-alkaloid, ethanol, and methanol extracts, against influenza A (H1N1), SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. The water extract demonstrated significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 421.9 µg/mL) and MERS-CoV (IC<sub>50</sub> = 222.1 µg/mL) in Vero E6 cells (an African green monkey kidney cell line), with a CC<sub>50</sub> of 4221 µg/mL, indicating a favorable selectivity index. Additionally, it exhibited strong activity against H1N1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (MDCK cells) (IC<sub>50</sub> = 57.30 µg/mL, CC<sub>50</sub> = 3073 µg/mL). Among all the extracts, the methanol extract showed the highest antiviral activity. It has IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.549 µg/ml and selectivity index (SI) = 230 against H1N1.While it showed IC<sub>50</sub> = 10.83 µg/ml against SARS-CoV-2 and 9.82 µg/ml against MERS-CoV with SI values of 54.2 and 59.77, respectively. Molecular docking studies revealed that 5-Methyl-5 H-naphtho[2,3-c]carbazole,7 H-Dibenzo[b, g]carbazole, 7-methyl, hesperidin, luteolin-7-glucoside-3'-glucuronide, Melitric acid A, and other compounds exhibited high binding affinities to the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV spike glycoproteins, suggesting their potential to interfere with viral entry. Furthermore, GC-MS-identified bioactive compounds, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), paromomycin, and phenolic acids, demonstrated additional antiviral potential. These results underscore the potential of M. officinalis extracts as natural antiviral agents, offering a foundation for further in vitro and in vivo validation and potential therapeutic applications against respiratory viral infections, including coronaviruses and influenza viruses.
40204902	Novel deep learning algorithm based MRI radiomics for predicting lymph node metastases in rectal cancer.	To explore the value of applying the MRI-based radiomic nomogram for predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM) in rectal cancer (RC). This retrospective analysis used data from 430 patients with RC from two medical centers. The patients were categorized into the LNM negative (LNM-) and LNM positive (LNM+) according to their surgical pathology results. We developed a physician model by selecting clinical independent predictors through physician assessments. Additionally, we developed deep learning radscore (DLRS) models by extracting deep features from multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) images. A nomogram model was constructed by combining the physician model and DLRS models. Among the patients, 192 (44.65%, 192/430) experienced LNM+. Six prediction models were developed, namely the physician model, three sequence models, the DLRS, and the nomogram. The physician model achieved AUC of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values of 0.78, 0.79, and 0.7, whereas the sequence models, DLRS model, and nomogram model achieved AUC values ranging from 0.83 to 0.99. The predictive performance of the DLRS and nomogram models was superior to that of the physician model. DLRS and nomogram models based on mpMRI provided higher accuracy in predicting LNM status in patients with RC than the other models.

40204900	Is Botulinum toxin A effective in treating dry eye disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Dry eye disease (DED) is a complex condition characterized by tear film instability, inflammation, and neurosensory abnormalities. The efficacy of Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) in treating DED is unknown. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases for studies published until December 2024. Inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs examining BTX-A's effects on DED, with TBUT, Schirmer test scores, tear meniscus height (TMH), and OSDI as primary outcomes. Data were synthesized using fixed and random-effects models, accounting for heterogeneity. Fourteen studies (total n = 634 patients) were included. This meta-analysis evaluates the effectiveness of BTX-A in improving outcomes for DED. In 10 studies with 513 participants, BTX-A significantly improved TBUT by 1.79 s (95% CI: 1.48 to 2.10, p < 0.00001), Schirmer test scores by 3.72 mm (95% CI: 3.50 to 3.95, p < 0.00001), and OSDI scores by -7.51 (95% CI: -10.76 to -4.26, p < 0.00001). TMH increased by 0.10 mm (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.11, p < 0.00001). This meta-analysis demonstrates that BTX-A effectively improves clinical outcomes in DED. Post-treatment, TBUT increased by 1.79 s, Schirmer test scores improved by 3.72 mm, OSDI scores decreased by -7.51 points, and TMH increased by 0.10 mm, reflecting enhanced tear stability, production, and symptom relief. These findings support the use of BTX-A in clinical practice as a promising treatment for DED.

40204897	Formulation optimization and synergistic effects of flocculation-solidification-vacuum preloading on sludge treatment.	Rapid infrastructure development generates large volumes of high-water-content sludge, creating an urgent need for efficient recycling and management strategies. This study introduces the flocculation-solidification-vacuum preloading (FSVP) method to enhance dewatering efficiency and strength development, facilitating subsequent mechanical construction requirements. To enhance solidification and reduce cement consumption, the response surface method was used to determine the optimal composite curing agent, which consists of 53% cement, 32% rice husk ash, and 15% sodium silicate. Vacuum dewatering was applied to sludge samples treated with different flocculants and curing agents to assess their synergistic effects on soil improvement. The mixed flocculant of polyaluminum chloride and anionic polyacrylamide significantly increased the micropore content and compactness, with pore sizes primarily concentrated around 0.01 μm. While the flocculant facilitated efficient drainage, required unconfined compressive strength could only be achieved with the further addition of a curing agent. The optimal composite curing agent formulation induced hydration and pozzolanic reactions, filling larger pores with cementitious materials and enhancing soil strength. As a result, the vane shear strength reached 58 kPa and unconfined compressive strength reached 365 kPa at 7 days, further increasing to 586 kPa at 28 days.
40204896	Asciminib in combination with imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase: phase 1 study final results.	Data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that asciminib, the first BCR::ABL1 inhibitor that Specifically Targets the ABL Myristoyl Pocket (STAMP), synergizes with adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to prevent emergence of and overcome resistance. Combination therapy may provide new treatment options for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with suboptimal responses to ATP-competitive TKI monotherapy. Preliminary analysis of asciminib combined with nilotinib, imatinib, or dasatinib in a phase 1 dose-escalation study suggested promising efficacy and safety for patients with CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase treated with prior ATP-competitive TKIs; herein, we present final results from the 3 combination therapy arms. Asciminib, in combination with ATP-competitive TKIs, demonstrated rapid efficacy offset by a decreased tolerability compared with asciminib monotherapy. Based on these safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy results, asciminib 40 mg twice daily (BID) plus nilotinib 300 mg BID, asciminib 40 or 60 mg once daily (QD) plus imatinib 400 mg QD, and asciminib 80 mg QD plus dasatinib 100 mg QD were identified as recommended doses for expansion. The maximum tolerated dose was reached at asciminib 60 mg QD plus imatinib 400 mg QD and was not reached with asciminib plus nilotinib or dasatinib.

40204894	Cell polarity: cell type-specific regulators, common pathways, and polarized vesicle transport.	Cell polarity, the asymmetric organization of cellular components, is evolutionarily conserved from unicellular and multicellular organisms and is crucial for many biological processes. Polarity is required to maintain cell and tissue integrity by regulating cell division, migration, orientation, cell-cell interactions, and morphogenesis. Impaired polarity leads to dysregulation of cellular functions and is associated with disease. Understanding how polarity is established, maintained, and regulated is thus critical to improving our knowledge of pathologies and devising novel therapies. Here, we explore the various manifestations of cell polarity across different model systems, tissues, and cell types and focus on known polarity mechanisms in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We discuss how cells with vastly different functions utilize conserved molecular complexes to establish cell polarity while adapting polarity proteins to unique cell-type-specific functions. In this discussion, we attempt to extract common themes and concepts to improve our understanding of cell polarity in hematological malignancies and other diseases. Finally, we summarize, compare, and evaluate classical as well as recently developed methods to quantify cell polarity, highlight important advances in imaging and analytical techniques, and suggest critical next steps required to move the field forward.
40204893	DEK::NUP214 acts as an XPO1-dependent transcriptional activator of essential leukemia genes.	The t(6;9)(p22.3;q34.1) translocation/DEK::NUP214 fusion protein defines a distinct subgroup of younger AML patients classified as a separate disease entity by the World Health Organization. DEK is a nuclear factor with multifunctional roles, including gene regulation, while its fusion partner, NUP214, plays a pivotal role in nuclear export by interacting with transport receptors such as XPO1. However, the precise mechanism by which DEK::NUP214 drives leukemia remains unclear. A comprehensive multi-omics comparison of 57 AML primary samples (including whole genome sequencing, targeted sequencing, transcriptomics, and drug screening with >500 compounds) revealed that t(6;9) cases display a selective response to XPO1 inhibitors (Selinexor & Eltanexor) and a distinct transcriptomic signature characterized by the overexpression of FOXC1 and HOX genes that are key leukemia mediators. CUT&RUN experiments demonstrated the direct binding of DEK::NUP214 to the promoters of FOXC1 and HOXA/B clusters. Strikingly, the expression of these genes and the binding of DEK::NUP214 to their regulatory regions were selectively reduced upon XPO1 inhibition in t(6;9) cells. Altogether, these results identified a novel function of DEK::NUP214 as an XPO1-dependent transcriptional activator of key leukemia drivers and provide a rationale to explore the use of XPO1 inhibitors in this patient population.

Asciminib is the first approved BCR::ABL1 inhibitor that Specifically Targets the ABL Myristoyl Pocket (STAMP). The present final analysis of the phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized trial (NCT02081378) assessed the long-term safety, tolerability, and antileukemic activity of asciminib in 115 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase without the BCR::ABL1<sup>T315I</sup> mutation who received asciminib 10-200 mg twice daily (BID) or 80-200 mg once daily (cutoff: March 14, 2023). Median exposure duration was 5.9 (range, 0-8.4) years; 60.9% of patients continued receiving asciminib through post-trial access. Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 88 patients (76.5%). AEs led to treatment discontinuation, dose adjustment/interruption, or additional therapy in 15 (13.0%), 74 (64.3%), and 106 (92.2%) patients, respectively. Most first-ever AEs, particularly hematologic AEs, presented within the first year and no new safety signals emerged. Of 56 patients who achieved major molecular response, 50 maintained the response by cutoff; the Kaplan-Meier-estimated probability of maintaining this response for ≥432 weeks ( ≈ 8.3 years) was 88% (95% confidence interval, 78.2-97.0%). The recommended dose for expansion was determined at 40 mg BID. With up to 8.4 years of treatment, asciminib continued to demonstrate long-term safety and efficacy in this population.
40204891	Application and exploration of garbage enzymes in soil remediation of multiple heavy metal pollution.	[Objective] To assess the bioremediation potential of garbage enzymes in heavy metal-contaminated lead-zinc mine soils. [Method] A pot experiment evaluated garbage enzymes application effects on: (1) Pb/Zn/Cd bioavailability and phytoavailability, (2) soil fertility parameters, (3) soil enzyme activities, and (4) physiological responses of Chinese cabbage. [Results] Garbage enzymes significantly reduced heavy metal bioavailability, decreasing leaf Pb/Zn/Cd concentrations by 66.8%/17.6%/37.4% and root levels by 34.3%/23.4%/46.8% versus controls. Soil fertility improved substantially, with available N/P/K increments of 2.43-31.2%, 1.86-45.5%, and 3.40-22.3%, respectively. Key soil enzymes (urease, sucrase, catalase, phosphatase) exhibited enhanced activities. Garbage enzymes treated plants showed increased biomass (fresh weight), chlorophyll (21.8%), and soluble sugars, alongside reduced stress markers: nitrate-N (-24.3%), malondialdehyde (-33.6%), proline (-18.9%), and superoxide dismutase (-42.1%). [Conclusions] Garbage enzymes demonstrate dual functionality in metal immobilization and soil revitalization, offering an eco-sustainable solution for restoring agricultural productivity in contaminated ecosystems.
40204890	The Katakori disability index has cross-cultural validity for disability due to stiff neck/shoulder across Japan, the US, and Singapore.	Katakori, or neck and shoulder stiffness, is a common issue in Japan but also affects people globally. Recently, the Katakori Disability Index (KDI) was developed to measure the disability caused by Katakori, but its cross-cultural validity was unconfirmed. This study examined the KDI's validity across Japan, the US, and Singapore through cross-sectional surveys of individuals aged 20-69 experiencing Katakori. Using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA), cross-cultural validity was deemed to exist if no statistically significant difference was found after changing to the partial metric invariance. Further, internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha, and KDI scores across the three countries were compared. MGCFA established cross-cultural validity by achieving partial metric invariance in 26 of 55 item combinations. Prevalence was 61.8% (420/680 participants) in the US and 75.1% (417/555 participants) in Singapore. Singaporeans (n = 162) reported the highest % KDI scores, followed by the US (n = 149), with the lowest scores being observed in Japan (n = 515). Internal consistency was strong across all countries (95% CI of alpha > 0.9). In conclusion, the KDI is valid for measuring Katakori disability across Japan, the US, and Singapore. This study underscores the need for global research on Katakori.
40204889	Antibiotic therapy and clinical outcomes of penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (PSSA) bloodstream infection (BSI): a ten-year retrospective cohort study.	In recent years, the incidence of penicillin-susceptible S. aureus (PSSA) bloodstream infection (BSI) has increased worldwide. However, the preferred antibiotic remains uncertain due to concerns of inducible resistance to benzylpenicillin. We compared outcomes associated with benzylpenicillin versus other antibiotics and investigated risk factors influencing treatment failure. Patients were grouped into benzylpenicillin and non-benzylpenicillin beta-lactam treatment groups (including anti-staphylococcal penicillins and cephalosporins). The primary outcome was overall treatment failure (30-day all-cause mortality and/or 90-day relapse). Of 335 patients, 74 (22.09%) received benzylpenicillin and 261 (77.91%) received a non-benzylpenicillin beta-lactam. While rates of overall treatment failure (13.51% vs. 17.24%; P = 0.45) and occurrence of adverse drug events (6.76% vs. 7.66%; P = 0.79) were comparable to non-benzylpenicillin beta-lactams, benzylpenicillin showed faster microbiological clearance [3.00 days (IQR, 2.00-4.00 days) vs. 4.00 days (IQR, 3.00-5.00 days); P = 0.03] and fewer persistent infections (22.97% vs. 36.02%; P = 0.04), suggesting potential to improve patient outcomes. We also found that unknown source (aOR 4.63, 95% CI 1.47-14.64; P < 0.01) was associated with treatment failure, while review by Infectious Disease (ID) specialists (aOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.73; P = 0.01) was protective, stressing the importance of early ID referral and thorough source identification. This study highlights benzylpenicillin as an effective treatment for PSSA BSI.
40204888	Damage mechanism and evolution model of geopolymer stabilized coarse grained fillings subjected to repeated freeze-thaw actions.	The freeze-thaw damage of cementitious coarse grained fillings (CCGFs) significantly affects the firmness, stability, and durability of high-speed railway subgrades. It is favorable to employ geopolymer binders to improve the engineering performance of coarse grained fillings (CGFs), further ensure the safety of high-speed railway subgrades in cold regions due to their excellent mechanical and environmental-friendly performances. This study conducted a series of freeze-thaw and mechanical tests on geopolymer stabilized coarse grained fillings (GSCGFs). The influence of gradation, compaction degree, and freeze-thaw cycles on the integrity, strength, and stiffness of GSCGFs was investigated. The evolution law of their freeze-thaw damage was discussed quantitatively based on an improved damage factor. The results show that the mass loss rate of Group B GSCGFs with a fine-grained particle content of less than 15% was lower than that of Group A GSCGFs with a fine particle content between 15% and 30% overall. When other conditions remain unchanged, the mass loss rate of GSCGFs decreased with the increase of compaction degree but increased nonlinearly with the freeze-thaw cycles. The strength and stiffness of GSCGFs decrease nonlinearly with the freeze-thaw cycles and presented a first fast and then slow-down change trend, their stiffness evolution at different compaction degrees revealed a big difference due to the weakening bite effect and enhancing overhead structure among rock blocks. The strength reduction of Group A GSCGFs was less than that of Group B under the high compaction degree. The stiffness deterioration of Group A GSCGFs was about twice that of Group B. There seemed to be no absolute correlation that the strength of GSCGFs was positively correlated with their stiffness. By building an exponential relationship between the compressive strength of GSCGFs and the freeze-thaw cycles that followed the findings of previous several studies, an improved exponential damage evaluation model was proposed to represent the performance degradation of GSCGFs. The outcomes of this study can provide theoretical support for understanding the physical and mechanical behaviors of GSCGFs and applying them in engineering practices.
40204887	Associations between indoor air exposures and cognitive test scores among university students in classrooms with increased ventilation rates for COVID-19 risk management.	Past work demonstrating an association between indoor air quality and cognitive performance brought attention to the benefits of increasing outdoor air ventilation rates beyond code minimums. These code minimums were scrutinized during the COVID-19 pandemic for insufficient ventilation and filtration specifications. As higher outdoor air ventilation was recommended in response, questions arose about potential benefits of enhanced ventilation beyond infection risk reduction.
40204886	The association between albumin corrected calcium levels and mortality in ICU patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.	While the relationship between albumin corrected calcium (ACC) levels and unfavourable outcomes has been previously investigated, existing studies have been limited in their specific application to patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) in intensive care unit (ICU). This retrospective cohort study aimed to explore the association between baseline ACC and 28-day in-hospital mortality in ICU patients undergoing MHD. Logistic regression model, smooth curve fitting, piecewise linear regression, subgroup analyses, and a series of sensitivity analyses were employed. Of the 2114 patients with a median age of 64 years, 290 (13.72%) died within 28 days after ICU admission. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that, in comparison with the lowest tertile, the highest tertile of ACC was associated with a higher mortality rate (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.09-1.53, P = 0.0032). When the ACC levels were < 8.04 mg/dL, the mortality rate decreased with an adjusted OR of 0.44 (95% CI 0.20-0.98, P = 0.0438) for every 1 mg/dL increase in the ACC levels. When the ACC levels were ≥ 8.04 mg/dl, the mortality rate increased with an adjusted OR of 1.36 (95% CI 1.13-1.64, P = 0.0011) for every 1 mg/dl increase in the ACC levels. Non-linear relationship between ACC and 28-day in-hospital mortality were identified in patients undergoing MHD in the ICU. However, the findings of this study need to be confirmed through prospective studies.

40204884	Tobacco smoking and the risk of aortic dissection in the UK Biobank and a meta-analysis of prospective studies.	Tobacco smoking is thought to increase risk of aortic dissection, however, few prospective studies have been published on the association to date and little is known about the effect of smoking cessation on risk of aortic dissection. To clarify these associations we investigated the association between different aspects of tobacco smoking and aortic dissection in the UK Biobank Study and we summarized the available data in a meta-analysis of cohort studies. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between smoking and risk of aortic dissection in the UK Biobank. PubMed and Embase were searched up to 19th of July 2024 to identify relevant cohort studies and random effects models were used to calculate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs in the meta-analysis. During a mean follow-up of 12.3 years a total of 376 incident cases of aortic dissection were identified among 499,078 participants. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for current and former smokers versus never smokers were 2.48 (1.87-3.29) and 1.03 (0.81-1.29), respectively. There was a dose-response between increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day and aortic dissection risk with HRs (95% CIs) of 2.31 (1.13-4.71), 2.94 (1.88-4.58), and 2.63 (1.65-4.37) for 1-9, 10-19, and ≥ 20 cigarettes/day among current smokers. Greater number of pack-years was positively associated with aortic dissection (1.66, 1.21-2.28 for ≥ 30 pack-years vs. never smokers). Former smokers who had quit for varying durations had a 48-75% reduction in aortic dissection risk when compared to current smokers. In the meta-analysis, the summary RR was 2.44 (1.65-3.60, I<sup>2</sup> = 68%, n = 3) for current and 1.32 (0.72-2.40, I<sup>2</sup> = 75%, n = 3) for former vs. never smokers, 1.52 (1.30-1.79, I<sup>2</sup> = 31%, n = 3) per 10 cigarettes/day, 1.16 (1.06-1.28, I<sup>2</sup> = 44%, n = 3) per 10 pack-years, and 0.78 (0.71-0.86, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%, n = 2) per 10 years since quitting smoking. These results provide further support that tobacco smoking increases the risk of developing aortic dissection with some indication of a dose-response with increasing intensity and amount, while smoking cessation attenuated this risk. Although further studies are needed, these findings provide further support for policies to reduce the prevalence of smoking in the general population and to promote smoking cessation among smokers.
40204883	The crucial role of neutrophil extracellular traps and IL-17 signaling in indomethacin-induced gastric injury in mice.	The homeostasis of gastric mucosa is extremely delicate. Neutrophils, the most abundant immune cells in human circulation, are regarded crutial in the regulation of gastric mucosal immune response. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induced gastric injury is the second major reason for gastric ulcers. The relations between neutrophils and Indomethacin-induced gastric injury are not fully understood. A mouse model of gastric injury was established using Indomethacin, followed by proteomic analysis (raw data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD058482). GO functional annotations and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were conducted on significant differential proteins. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was observed using ELISA and immunofluorescence. TEM, Western blot and Real-time PCR were applied to observe programmed death of gastric epithelial cells (GECs), and ELISA was conducted to measure levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in the gastric tissue. Deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNase 1), a NETs inhibitor, was administered intraperitoneally to inhibit NETs formation. In vitro, neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of mice and co-cultured with mouse GECs cell line, different dosage of Indomethacin were added to the culture dish, the levels of inflammatory factors, formation of NETs and GECs programmed death were assessed in vitro. Poly morphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were extracted from mouse peripheral blood and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was further applied (raw data are available via Genome Sequence Archive with identifier CRA020950) to explore the intracellular mechanism of NETs formation. ELISA and immunofluorescence were performed to validate expression of IL-17 signaling pathway. After Indomethacin gavage, obvious gastric injury was observed. Proteomic analysis indicated that NETs formation played a crucial role in Indomethacin-induced gastric injury. Compared to control group, Indomethacin treatment resulted in NETs formation, elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-1β and GECs programmed death. Inhibition of NETs significantly reduced inflammatory factor levels and mitigated gastric injury caused by indomethacin. In vitro, 200 µL, 400 µL and 600 µL of Indomethacin caused excessive NETs formation in neutrophils. Besides, Indomethacin-induced NETs formation led to GECs programmed death in vitro. scRNA-seq revealed that neutrophils enrichment in the peripheral blood of Indomethacin-induced gastric injury and IL-17 signaling might be the key intracellular of NETs formation. Expressions of neutrophil IL-17R and concentration of IL-17 were significantly higher in model group. NETs formation is pivotal in Indomethacin-induced gastric injury, contributing to programmed cell death of GECs and inflammation; IL-17 signaling might be the key intracellular mechanism of NETs formation.
40204882	Reinforcement of impaired shield tunnel structure by stainless steel corrugated plate.	This paper presents a case study on the reinforcement of an impaired shield tunnel structure using Stainless Steel Corrugated Plate (SSCP) in China. The SSCP used in this study is made from the novel duplex stainless steel S32001, characterized by its high strength, light weight, and corrosion resistance. A full-scale test is conducted to investigate the mechanical behavior of the SSCP-reinforced tunnel structure. Experimental results reveal that SSCP reinforcement significantly enhances structural bearing capacity and stiffness, with shear failure at the bonding interface identified as the primary failure mode. Based on these findings, two design concepts are proposed: enhancing interface bonding shear strength and improving connecting stiffness between SSCPs. The practical application of SSCP reinforcement in the case study tunnel is then carried out, where the design concepts are successfully applied. Additionally, the practical implementation also reveals that SSCP reinforcement offers superior construction and economic efficiency compared to traditional steel plate reinforcement. This study provides valuable insights into both academic research and engineering practice, demonstrating the potential of SSCP as an effective solution for reinforcing impaired shield tunnels.
40204880	Gene signatures and genotype-phenotype correlations of sensorineural hearing loss in Noonan syndrome and related RASopathies.	Hearing loss frequently occurs in Noonan syndrome and related RASopathies (NS-RAS), with conductive hearing loss being common. However, the genotypic and phenotypic features of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in NS-RAS, as well as genotype-phenotype correlations, remain unknown. Leveraging in-house database for syndromic deafness (N = 1666), we analyzed the genomic landscape and clinical phenotypes of 94 NS-RAS families with genetically confirmed via targeted panel sequencing. In particular, we explored the genetic signature of SNHL in NS-RAS and provided a detailed description of the auditory characteristics of SNHL, including its natural progression and outcomes of audiological rehabilitation. Additionally, molecular modeling and functional assays were conducted to explore how PTPN11 variants with distinct auditory phenotypes affect downstream signaling pathways. Resultantly, eighteen (19.1%) exhibited SNHL, predominantly with PTPN11 (88.9%) and RAF1 (11.1%) variants. Of these patients, the majority exhibited severe-to-profound SNHL with congenital onset, and cochlear implantation yielded favorable auditory outcomes. The remaining patients maintained normal hearing throughout the follow-up periods. The PTPN11 variants linked to SNHL compromise autoinhibition between the N-SH2 and PTP domains or disrupts the interaction between the C-SH2 domain and phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr), showing a gain-of-function effect on the RAS/ERK cascade. Specifically, those variants associated with high penetrance and severe expressivity significantly enhanced ERK phosphorylation more than the variants associated with low penetrance and milder expressivity. This is the first cohort study on NS-RAS in South Korea, elucidating the gene signatures and phenotypic characteristics of SNHL and suggesting genotype-auditory phenotype correlations that inform clinical practice.

40204878	Metamaterials with asymmetric transmission effect based on magnetic field manipulation.	Realization of asymmetric transmission (AT) effect in metamaterial has drawn great interest in the past decade years since it indicates broad applications such as isolators and chiral polarization transistors which are highly demanded in various areas. However, most realization of AT is through the manipulation of electric field in chiral metamaterial, which limits the applications in the regimes requiring magnetic responses. In this article, we propose a metamaterial with chiral structure composed of connected metal loops placed on orthogonal directions, where the response orthogonal to the magnetic field of incident electromagnetic wave can be generated. Such manipulation of magnetic field is quantified with the equivalent permeability tensor of the metamaterial. The presented material exhibits AT characteristics of linear polarized electromagnetic wave sensitive to both polarization directions and propagation directions. Our work provides a new approach for AT, which has potential application of polarization sensitive devices, such as polarization rotators and circular polarizers.

40204876	Response Surface Methodology using desirability functions for multiobjective optimization to minimize indoor overheating hours and maximize useful daylight illuminance.	Improving thermal comfort often impacts daylight, creating trade-offs that remain underexplored, particularly in tropical dwellings. Overheating metrics-essential for assessing thermal conditions in warm regions-are entirely absent from daylight performance analysis. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and desirability functions were employed to optimize the thermal and daylight performance of a typical low-rise tropical housing typology. Specifically, this approach simultaneously optimized Indoor Overheating Hours (IOH) and Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) metrics through an Overall Desirability (D). Each response required only 138 simulation runs (~ 30 h: 276 runs) to determine optimal values for passive strategies: window-to-wall ratio (WWR) and roof overhang depth across four orientations (eight factors). Initial screening based on [Formula: see text] fractional factorial design, identified four key factors using stepwise and Lasso regression, narrowed down to three: roof overhang depth on the south and west, WWR on the west, and WWR on the south. Then, RSM optimization yielded an optimal solution (west/south roof overhang: 3.78 m, west WWR: 3.76%, south WWR: 29.3%) with a D of 0.625 (IOH: 8.33%, UDI: 79.67%). Finally, robustness analysis with 1,000 bootstrap replications provided 95% confidence intervals for the optimal values. This study balances thermal comfort and daylight with few experiments using a computationally-efficient multiobjective approach.

40204874	Optimizing the compliance third-party supervision workflow of involved enterprises using artificial intelligence ant colony algorithm.	This article optimized the compliance third-party supervision workflow of the involved enterprises based on the artificial intelligence ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The basic principles and application advantages of ACO were introduced, and a heuristic information matrix was defined using ACO to optimize the data collection and analysis stage of the compliance third-party supervision workflow. During the experimental phase, a feasibility analysis was conducted on the optimization of third-party supervision workflows for compliance by ACO involved enterprises through simulation experiments. The experiments were evaluated from four aspects: data quality, model performance, scheme effectiveness, and supervision effectiveness. Among the metrics data for the ACO-optimized test set were 0.03 and 0.025 for MSE (Mean Square Error) and Γ, 0.8, 0.78, 0.79, and 0.88 for Accuracy, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC (Area Under the Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristic), and 0.28, 0.4, 0.88, and 0.12 for CER (Cost-Effectiveness Ratio), NPV (Net Present Value), SCR (Supervision Coverage Rate), and CRC (Compliance Rate Change), respectively. The experimental results showed that, in terms of data quality, model performance, scheme effectiveness, and supervision effectiveness, the evaluation indicators of the compliance third-party supervision workflow of the involved enterprises optimized using ACO were superior to those without ACO optimization.
40204873	Nationwide demonstration of improved COVID-19 vaccination uptake through behavioural reminders.	Here we report the results of two nationwide randomized controlled trials. By refining behavioural-science-informed text messages notifying patients of their vaccine eligibility, we observed improvements in vaccination rates. The randomized controlled trials involved adults aged 40-44 years (n = 1,825,937) and 24-29 years (n = 2,174,064) in England. Messages emphasizing 'Top of queue' status led to small, but policy-relevant, increases in vaccination rates in both the 40-44 age group (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.03) and the 24-29 age group (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.04). Consequently, the 'Top of queue' message was nationally rolled out to other age groups. These findings demonstrate the potential of 'queue' framing in relevant contexts and the value of rigorous testing of public health messaging.
40204872	The proteome of osteoblasts in a 3D culture perfusion bioreactor model compared with static conditions.	Bone disorders represent a significant global burden. Currently, animal models are used to develop and screen novel treatments. However, interspecies variations and ethical concerns highlight the need for a more complex 3D bone model. In this study, we developed a simplified in vitro bone-like model using a U-CUP perfusion-based bioreactor system, designed to provide continuous nutrient flow and mechanostimulation through 3D cultures. An immortalized human fetal osteoblastic cell line was seeded on collagen scaffolds and cultured for 21 days in both a perfusion bioreactor system and in static cultures. PrestoBlue™ assay, scanning electron microscopy, and proteomics allowed monitoring of metabolic activity and compared morphological and proteome differences between both conditions. Results indicated an altered cellular morphology in the bioreactor compared to the static cultures and identified a total of 3494 proteins. Of these, 105 proteins exhibited significant upregulation in the static culture, while 86 proteins displayed significant downregulation. Enrichment analyses of these proteins revealed ten significant pathways including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, TNF-alpha signaling via NF-kB, and KRAS pathway. The current data indicated of osteogenic differentiation enhancement within the bioreactor on day 21 compared to static cultures. In conclusion, the U-CUP perfusion bioreactor is beneficial for facilitating osteogenic differentiation in 3D cultures.

40204868	Numerical analysis of building damage caused by the exposure of a terrain threshold as a result of underground mining-induced subsidence.	Underground mining exploitation causes deformations on the ground surface as a result of the filling of the resulting voids. In certain situations, apart from mild continuous deformations, discontinuous deformations may occur in the form of, e.g., steps in the ground. Unexpectedly occurring discontinuous deformations cause significant damage to buildings protected against the influence of continuous deformations, but do not lead to their complete destruction. For this reason, the aim of this paper is to present a numerical analysis of such an impact case, which, on the one hand, is sufficiently accurate and reflects the behaviour of the real structure, and on the other hand, it will be a guide for experts who will aim to determine the safety of similar structures. In the presented case, the multiple longwall mining of coal ended in the same place resulting in the formation of a step in the ground about 15 cm high under a residential building. Not protected building against such deformations, suffered significant damage. The numerical analysis of the residential building was carried out with the advanced ATENA software package. In order to accurately represent the building and the impacts, the structure and the surrounding ground were modelled. The structure of building and the ground were modelled with tetrahedron- and hexahedral-shaped volumetric elements. On the contact surface of the structure elements and the ground, flat contact elements were used. The loads on the structure were introduced in the form of displacements caused by the appearance of a terrain threshold. The results of numerical calculations are presented in the form of color stress maps. The obtained calculation results are very close to the actual damages, which confirms the correctness of the analysis.

40204866	Anatomy guided modality fusion for cancer segmentation in PET CT volumes and images.	Segmentation in computed tomography (CT) provides detailed anatomical information, while positron emission tomography (PET) provide the metabolic activity of cancer. Existing segmentation models in CT and PET either rely on early fusion, which struggles to effectively capture independent features from each modality, or late fusion, which is computationally expensive and fails to leverage the complementary nature of the two modalities. This research addresses the gap by proposing an intermediate fusion approach that optimally balances the strengths of both modalities. Our method leverages anatomical features to guide the fusion process while preserving spatial representation quality. We achieve this through the separate encoding of anatomical and metabolic features followed by an attentive fusion decoder. Unlike traditional fixed normalization techniques, we introduce novel "zero layers" with learnable normalization. The proposed intermediate fusion reduces the number of filters, resulting in a lightweight model. Our approach demonstrates superior performance, achieving a dice score of 0.8184 and an [Formula: see text] score of 2.31. The implications of this study include more precise tumor delineation, leading to enhanced cancer diagnosis and more effective treatment planning.
40204865	Anticancer properties of Cirsium vulgare (Savi) ten. Dry extracts from different plant parts and phenological stages of Raw material collection.	This study explores the anticancer potential of Cirsium vulgare dry extracts in human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) and gastric carcinoma (KATO III) cell lines using both traditional 2D monolayer models and advanced 3D spheroid systems. Cell viability was assessed via the MTT assay, while the influence on cell migration was evaluated using a wound-healing assay. In 3D cultures, extract activity was further examined through magnetic 3D bioprinting to monitor spheroid growth dynamics, and viability of cells in spheroids was assessed by the WST-1 assay. Among the tested extracts, those derived from C. vulgare inflorescences (U1) and roots (U6, U7, U8, U9) demonstrated higher anticancer activity. The inflorescence extract (U1) exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity against both cancer cell lines, while root-derived extracts, particularly U7, showed potent suppression of HT-29 cell migration, achieving the most significant reduction in wound closure after 36 h (p < 0.05) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. In spheroid models, U1 and U8 extracts reduced HT-29 cancer cell viability by 53.3-77.9% and 56.7-81.5%, respectively, and U1 emerged as the most effective inhibitor of spheroid growth, reducing diameter by 7-10%, compared to untreated controls. These findings underscore the promising anticancer activity of C. vulgare extracts, particularly U1 and U8, highlighting their potential as innovative therapeutic candidates for treating colorectal and gastric cancers. Further investigations are warranted to refine their application in oncological research.
40204864	Divergent alpha and beta diversity trends of soil nematode fauna along gradients of environmental change in the Carpathian Ecoregion.	There is a significant lack of research on how climate change influences long-term temporal trends in the biodiversity of soil organisms. Nematodes may be specifically adequate to test soil biodiversity changes, because they account for ~80% of all Metazoans and play key roles in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we report on the first synthesis study focused on temporal trends of nematode fauna over a period of 14 years (1986-1999) across the Carpathian Ecoregion. We provide new evidence that wetter conditions associated to global change contributes to driving nematode diversity at genus/family level. We observed opposite trends in soil nematode alpha diversity (increase) and beta diversity (decrease) consistent across ecosystem types and soil horizons, providing strong evidence for the influence of climate change on soil biodiversity at large spatial scales. An increase in the community functional uniformity along with a decline in beta diversity indicated more homogenous soil conditions over time. The Soil Stability Index (metric devised to assess soil homeostasis based on the functional composition of nematode communities) increased over time, indicating a decline of soil disturbances and more complex soil food webs. Our results highlight the importance of nematodes as powerful indicators of soil biodiversity trends affected by multiple facets of environmental change in long-term soil monitoring.
40204863	Optimization of bile preparation for liquid biopsy in cholangiocarcinoma focusing on circulating tumor DNA and protein stability.	Liquid biopsy using bile offers a promising non-invasive approach for molecular analysis in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). However, the stability of key biomarkers, such as proteins and circulating DNA (ctDNA), at room temperature has not been fully elucidated. This study investigates the temporal stability of proteins and ctDNA in bile samples under room temperature conditions to optimize pre-analytical handling for molecular diagnostics. Bile samples were collected from six patients diagnosed with CCA. Protein concentrations, enzyme activity (E-Cadherin and N-Cadherin), and mutant KRAS ctDNA levels were assessed at 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-hour intervals using quantitative assays and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Proteins and enzyme activity demonstrated no significant degradation over the 7-hour room temperature storage period (P > 0.05). Similarly, mutant KRAS ctDNA levels remained stable without significant changes (P > 0.05), confirming the preservation of molecular integrity in bile samples. This study demonstrates that bile samples can maintain the stability of proteins and ctDNA for up to 7 h at room temperature. These findings provide critical insights into bile sample handling, supporting its application in liquid biopsy and molecular diagnostics for CCA.
40204862	A photonic crystal receiver for Rydberg atom-based sensing.	Rydberg atom-based sensors use atoms dressed by lasers to detect and measure radio frequency electromagnetic fields. The absorptive properties of the atomic gas, configured as a Rydberg atom-based sensor, change in the presence of a radio frequency electromagnetic field. While these sensors are reasonably sensitive, the best conventional radio frequency sensors still outperform Rydberg atom-based sensors with respect to sensitivity. One approach to increase the sensitivity of Rydberg atom-based sensors is to engineer the vapor cell that contains the atomic gas. In this work, we introduce a passive, all-dielectric amplifier integrated into a Rydberg atom-based sensor vapor cell. The vapor cell is a combination of a slot waveguide and a photonic crystal. The structural features of the vapor cell yield a power amplification of ~24 dB. The radio frequency electromagnetic field is coupled adiabatically into the slot waveguide and slowed to increase the interaction between the radio frequency field and the atoms to effectively amplify the incoming signal, i.e., increase the Rabi frequency on the radio frequency transition. The work shows the utility of vapor cell engineering for atom-based quantum technologies and paves the way for other such devices.
40204861	Orogenic structure and topography track subduction singularities during slab delemination and detachment.	A new model of Alpine mountain-building based on state-of-the-art seismic imaging explains how slab delamination and detachment facilitated indentation and led to along-strike changes in orogenic structure, denudation and basin dynamics. After Adria-Europe plate collision (40-32 Ma), slab steepening and delamination of the European slab changed the taper angle of the orogenic wedge in the Central Alps as the subduction singularity migrated northward. This induced rapid exhumation and denudation of the Lepontine orogenic core, accompanied by waves of clastic deposition in the overfilled western foreland basin. In the Eastern Alps, the heavier part of the slab delaminated further northward, driving prolonged subsidence and marine sedimentation in the underfilled eastern foreland basin. At ~ 20 Ma, the slab segment beneath the Eastern Alps detached, facilitating fragmentation of the indenting northern edge of the Adriatic Plate. This offset the collisional edifice while reorganizing subduction singularities and bifurcating drainage divides. Slab detachment triggered rapid uplift and terrigenous filling of the eastern foreland basin, together with orogen-parallel extrusion of the rapidly exhuming Tauern orogenic core toward the Pannonian Basin. There followed a dramatic shift in thrust-activity and -vergence from northward to southward. Similar lateral variations are documented for other orogens experiencing slab delamination and detachment.
40204860	The innovation path of VR technology integration into music classroom teaching in colleges and universities.	Traditional music education in higher education institutions has traditionally followed a one-size-fits-all teaching model, which limits student interaction and hinders personalized learning. This approach does not align with the expectations of modern students, who seek a more engaging and effective learning experience. With the growing integration of Virtual Reality (VR) technology in education, its immersive and interactive features offer new possibilities for enhancing music instruction in colleges and universities. To explore these possibilities, this study proposes an Intelligent Interactive Music Teaching (IIMT) model that combines VR technology with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithms. The study utilizes publicly available music teaching videos and virtual environment interaction data. After applying data cleaning, noise reduction, and normalization techniques, the processed data is used to construct training and validation datasets. Experimental results indicate that the IIMT model generates images and audio with detail richness and clarity scores ranging from 0.7 to 1.0. The optimized system maintains a response time between 85 and 115 milliseconds and an average frame rate of 55 to 65 frames per second, ensuring smooth interaction. In a "vocal training" scenario, the IIMT model achieves an efficiency score of 0.96 and a task completion rate of 98.77%, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving instructional quality and enhancing students' learning experiences. These findings suggest that the IIMT model can serve as a valuable tool for educators and institutions seeking to modernize music education through interactive and intelligent teaching methodologies.
40204859	New design of three-qubit system with three transmons and a single fixed-frequency resonator coupler.	The transmon, which has a short gate time and remarkable scalability, is the most commonly utilized superconducting qubit, based on the Cooper pair box as a qubit or coupler in superconducting quantum computers. Lattice and heavy-hexagon structures are well-known large-scale configurations for transmon-based quantum computers that classical computers cannot simulate. These structures share a common feature: a resonator coupler that connects two transmon qubits. Although significant progress has been made in implementing quantum error correction and quantum computing using quantum error mitigation, fault-tolerant quantum computing remains unachieved due to the inherent vulnerability of these structures. This raises the question of whether the transmon-resonator-transmon structure is the best option for constructing a transmon-based quantum computer. To address this, we demonstrate that the average fidelity of CNOT gates can exceed 0.98 in a structure where a resonator coupler mediates the coupling of three transmon qubits. This result suggests that our novel structure could be a key method for increasing the number of connections among qubits while preserving gate performance in a transmon-based quantum computer.
40204857	Moroccan genome project: genomic insight into a North African population.	Africa's 1.5 billion people are underrepresented in genomic databases. The African Genome Variation Project exclusively focuses on Sub-Saharan populations, making Morocco, located in North Africa, a valuable site for studying genetic diversity. Understanding genetic variation and customized therapy requires population-specific reference genomes. This study presents Phase 1 results from the Moroccan Genome Project (MGP), which sequenced 109 Moroccan genomes. We report over 27 million variants, including 1.4 million novel ones, of which 15,378 are highly prevalent in the Moroccan population. Furthermore, we propose a Moroccan Major Allele Reference Genome (MMARG), generated using high-coverage consensus sequences from the 109 whole genomes. This MMARG represents more accurately the Moroccan genetic variation than GRCh38. This baseline study also generates an informative genetic variation database that supports regional population-specific initiatives and precision medicine in Morocco and North Africa. The results stress the necessity of population-relevant data in Human genetic research.
40204856	Carbon emissions peak of China's apple cultivation achieved in 2014: a comprehensive analysis and implications.	Carbon sequestration and emission reduction in apple cultivation are of great significance for achieving sustainable agricultural development and combating climate change. However, the status of carbon emissions from apple cultivation is unclear, and this study will provide implications for the agriculture sector. This study applied the life cycle assessment method to quantify carbon emissions and analysed the footprint composition of apple orchards in China, and identified the emissions peak based on the Mann-Kendall analysis. The results showed that the carbon emissions of apple cultivation reached the carbon peak in 2014. The carbon emissions per unit area (CEA) and per unit yield (CEY) were 5.79 t CO<sub>2</sub>eq ha<sup>-1</sup> and 0.23 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq kg<sup>-1</sup> in 2021, respectively. Carbon emissions from fertilizers (54.4%) and irrigation electricity (30.9%) were identified as the dominant components in apple orchards. Specifically, Henan and Shandong exhibited higher growing advantages, characterized by higher carbon economic efficiency and lower CEY. The carbon emissions of the ideal scenario will be decreased 69.6% through optimizing fertilizers and energy restructuring. In conclusion, promoting low-carbon development in apple orchards can be achieved through targeted in-field mitigation measures, such as optimizing the amount and types of fertilizers, and adopting new energy for agricultural machinery.
40204855	Functional study of Bergeyella cardium KP-43 subfamily peptidases as putative T9SS cargo.	Bergeyella cardium causes infections in human organs. However, the mechanism of the virulence of B. cardium is unclear. Peptidases are important virulence factors in bacterial pathogens. Here, we identified three KP-43 subfamily peptidases, SpBcA, SpBcB and SpBcC, which are putative T9SS cargo proteins, and analyzed their protease activity. SpBcA and SpBcB are active in vitro and contain a propeptide that passes through the active site of the S8 peptidase domain and inhibits its activity. SpBcA activates itself by cleaving the propeptide at N102 within the TSNA (100-103) peptide and a putative cleavage site at 116-120 (TSPGL). Additionally, SpBcA degrades host defense molecules, fibrinogen, antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and gelatin in vitro and induces cell death in vivo, suggesting its role as a virulence factor. This study revealed the self-cleavage regulatory mechanism of SpBcA and provided a basis for studying how B. cardium uses peptidases as virulence factors in vivo.
40204854	Safety of intensive care hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions at a tertiary academic hospital.	This study aimed to identify, based on available literature, the risk factors for adverse events during transport and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) sessions in intensive care unit patients and to determine their impact on intra-ward mortality and hospitalization duration. A retrospective analysis was conducted on hospitalized intensive care patients requiring HBOT between 2013 and 2023 at the Department of Hyperbaric Medicine and Sea Rescue, University Centre for Maritime and Tropical Medicine in Gdynia, Poland. A total of 176 patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The following risk factors for adverse events during transport and HBOT sessions were identified: continuous intravenous infusions of catecholamines and analgo-sedation, nighttime HBOT sessions (56.55% of all sessions), presence of pleural cavity drainage, and mechanical ventilation via an intubation tube. The number of HBOT sessions had a statistically significant effect in reducing the risk of death (RR = 0.71, p < 0.001), while the administration of catecholamines significantly increased the risk of death (RR = 3.56, p = 0.045). Patients with severe infections (NSTI and gas gangrene) are at higher risk of adverse events and mortality. Therefore, every effort should be made to prevent untoward incidents during their HBOT sessions, including transport to the hyperbaric chamber. The first 72 h of hospitalization for critically ill patients receiving HBOT are crucial for intra-ward survival.
40204853	A new dynamic model of supply boundary at low pressure in tight gas reservoir.	Tight gas is a clean and low-carbon energy with great development potential. However, in the middle and late stages of development of tight gas reservoirs, there are characteristics of low pressure, low production and high water cut. At present, there are few studies on the dynamic supply boundary considering the threshold pressure gradient, reservoir and fracture stress sensitivity and slip effect for the gas-water two-phase model of tight gas reservoirs. In order to improve the assessment of the supply boundary and production capacity features of tight gas wells at low pressure, a new coupling model of gas-water two-phase was established in this paper and the threshold pressure gradient, stress sensitivity and slip effect are taken into account the built model. Subsequently, the steady-state substitution method and the material balance method were used to develop the supply boundary calculation model. Finally, an analysis is done on how the supply boundary is affected by the threshold pressure gradient production, stress sensitivity and production pressure difference. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to the slower propagation observed in the matrix zone, the supply boundary propagates relatively quickly within the fracture modification zone. The threshold pressure gradient and stress-sensitive increase the resistance of gas seepage and delay the propagation of the supply boundary, which reduces the production of gas well. The propagation of the supply boundary accelerates with increasing production pressure difference, but the pressure difference's effect decreases. The production of gas is significantly impacted by the threshold pressure gradient, stress sensitivity and production pressure difference. Efficient production of tight gas reservoirs necessitates minimizing water production and preserving formation pressure.
40204852	Inter-cofactor protein remodeling rewires short-circuited transmembrane electron transfer.	Intraprotein electron transfer (ET) requires explicit local control of the environment of cofactors to influence their intermolecular distances, relative orientations, and redox properties. Efficient, longer-range ET often utilizes molecular orbitals of aromatic residues present in the intervening space. Here, revitalization of a vestigial ET pathway in the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center is achieved by scanning with tryptophans to uncover markedly improved routes of electron conduction in a key stabilizing step spanning 15 Å between tetrapyrrole and quinone cofactors. This ET event is maximally enhanced by pairing one or more tryptophans with a threonine to influence quinone binding and/or redox potential. Synergistic effects of these substitutions increase the yield of that ET step to ~95%. Joining these substitutions with mutant residues that improve initial ET steps dramatically enhances transmembrane charge separation via this redesigned version of a pathway that is quantitatively inactive in the native protein-cofactor complex.
40204851	Responses of the physiological characteristics and endophytic bacteria of Urtica cannabina to simulated drought stress.	Drought is widespread worldwide and has a negative impact on the growth and development of plants. As a kind of high-quality feed resource with great potential, nettle is also facing the severe test of drought stress. At present, more and more attention has been paid to the strategy of microbial drought resistance, which is expected to bring a turning point for alleviating the survival pressure of nettles under drought. In this study, nettle plants (Urtica cannabina) were obtained from a temperate desert steppe in the Tianshan Mountains, Xinjiang, China. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used to simulate a high/low gradient of drought stress. The results indicate that under mild drought stress, drought damage in nettle is reduced through proline (Pro), soluble protein (SP) and soluble sugar (SS) accumulation and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity. At the same time, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr) and stomatal conductance (Gs) of nettle leaves decreased to resist mild drought stress. However, if the drought is too severe or too prolonged, nettle plants wilt considerably. Under drought stress, the community structure of endophytic bacteria in the nettle plants changed, and the relative abundances of Pseudomonas, Halomonas, Nesterenkonia and Aliihoeflea decreased, while that of Romboutsia increased. Halomonas, Romboutsia, Sphingomonas, Bifidobacterium and Pseudomonas are highly correlated with the physiological characteristics and chlorophyll content of nettle, among which Pseudomonas is the key factor of endophytic bacterial in nettle under drought stress. In this study, the changes of physiological characteristics and endophytic bacterial community of Urtica cannabina under different degrees of drought stress provided a preliminary foundation for field experiments under natural drought conditions and the verification of drought-related microorganisms.
40204850	Dyadic effects of perceived burden and psychological distress on quality of life among Chinese advanced cancer patients and their caregivers.	This study aims to explore the mediating role of psychological distress in the association between perceived burden and quality of life (QoL) in advanced cancer patient-caregiver dyads. 241 dyads in five tertiary hospitals in a province were investigated by using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, Zarit Burden Interview, the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative scores, and the Short Form Health Survey 8. The actor-partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM), which assesses both individual (actor) and interdependent (partner) effects within dyadic relationships, was employed to analyze how burden and psychological distress interact across dyad members. Analysis was conducted using Mplus v8.0. Regarding the actor effects, the mediating role of psychological distress between perceived burden and QoL was confirmed in advanced cancer patients (B = -0.223, p = 0.001) and their caregivers (B = -0.168, p < 0.001). Regarding the partner effects, there were no significant correlations between caregiver burden and patients' psychological distress (B = 0.015, p = 0.199), patients' QoL (B = 0.113, p = 0.278), or the indirect association of caregiver burden with patients' QoL through psychological distress (B = -0.034, p = 0.259). However, caregivers' psychological distress was positively correlated with patients' symptom burden and mediated the association between patients' symptom burden and caregivers' QoL (B = -0.090, p = 0.001). The study highlights the importance of taking a dyadic perspective in the context of advanced cancer. Dyadic interventions targeting their perceived burden and psychological distress may be beneficial to their QoL.
40204849	Psychological distress in health care workers during the beginning, the middle, and the last part of the COVID-19 pandemic.	The COVID-19 pandemic placed significant psychological strain on healthcare workers. Our study tracked health care workers in the Czech Republic throughout the pandemic to examine the impact of stressors on psychological distress over time and explore gender differences in these associations. We studied health care workers from the Czech arm of the international COVID-19 HEROES Study who took part in all three waves of data collection in 2020, 2021 and 2022 (n = 264). We employed a path model to examine the relationships among six stressors (low trust in workplace, assignment of new tasks, prioritization of patients, experience of death due to COVID-19, experience of discrimination or violence, contact with COVID-19 patients), psychological distress (measured by General Health Questionnaire), and covariates (age, gender, occupation). We incorporated autoregressive paths and interactions to assess the longitudinal impact of stressors. Prior levels of distress predicted subsequent distress, with significant carry-over effects observed between each wave. Stressors had direct association to distress in the same wave of data collection (2020 and 2021), but not in subsequent waves, and stressors in 2022 did not have a significant direct effect to distress. Men reported lower distress in 2020 and 2021, but not in 2022. Furthermore, no significant interactions between stressors and gender were found. Age and occupation were not related to distress levels. There is a need for adaptable mental health support that addresses current stressors through targeted interventions, while also providing ongoing monitoring beyond crises, particularly for individuals with high distress levels.
40204848	A comparison of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms between android and iOS CoronaCheck app users.	This study explored differences in COVID-19 infections and symptoms between Android and iOS users using data from the CoronaCheck app. This cross-sectional analysis included 23,063 global users (20,753 Android and 2310 iOS) from April 2020 to February 2023. Participants reported COVID-19 symptoms and contact risks, with data analyzed to adjust for age, sex, education, and country. Android users were generally younger, more often male, had a lower educational level, and reported more symptoms on average (2.1 vs. 1.6) than iOS users. Android users also had higher suspected COVID-19 infection rates (24% vs. 11%), with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.21 (95% CI: 1.93-2.54). These findings suggest platform-based differences in COVID-19 infection rates and symptom reporting, highlighting potential biases in mobile health research. Adjusting for device operating systems may be crucial in improving the reliability of population-based health data collected through mobile platforms.
40204846	Cytogenomic characterization of karyotypes with additional autosomal material.	Chromosomal rearrangements involving additional material in individuals with phenotypic alterations usually result in partial trisomy, often accompanied by partial monosomy. To characterize chromosomal rearrangements and analyze genomic characteristics in the breakpoint regions in 31 patients with additional material on an autosomal chromosome. Different tests were performed to characterize these patients, including karyotyping, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). In silico analyses evaluated A/B chromosomal compartments, segmental duplications, and repetitive elements at breakpoints. The 31 rearrangements resulted in 47 copy number variations (CNVs) and a range of structural aberrations were identified, including six tandem duplications, 19 derivative chromosomes, two intrachromosomal rearrangements, one recombinant, two dicentric chromosomes, and one triplication. A deleted segment was associated with the duplication in 16 of the 19 patients with derivative chromosomes from translocation. Among the trios whose chromosome rearrangement origin could be investigated, 54,5% were de novo, 31,9% were maternally inherited, and 13,6% were paternally inherited from balanced translocations or inversion. Breakpoint analysis revealed that 22 were in the A compartment (euchromatin), 25 were in the B compartment (heterochromatin), and five were in an undefined compartment. Additionally, 14 patients had breakpoints in regions of segmental duplications and repeat elements. Our study found that a deletion accompanied by additional genetic material was present in 51.6% of the patients, uncovering the underlying genetic imbalances. Statistical analyses revealed a positive correlation between chromosome size and the occurrence of CNVs in the rearrangements. Furthermore, no preference was observed for breakpoints occurring in compartments A and B, repetitive elements, or segmental duplications.
40204845	Investigation of water treatment residues as corrosion inhibitors in acidic environment.	The present research focuses on the valorization of residues from the treatment of colored wastewater as eco-friendly corrosion inhibitors for mild steel in a 1 M HCl medium. These residues are derived from Aleppo pine fibers treated with Maxilon Blue dye (RFPABM) and Eriochrome Black dye (RFPANE). The study evaluated their corrosion inhibition performance using weight loss measurements, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) was employed to analyze the surface morphology of the mild steel samples. The results demonstrated significant inhibition efficiencies of 84.3% for crude Aleppo pine fiber extract (FPA), 90.5% for RFPABM, and 90.1% for RFPANE at an optimal concentration of 1 g/L. The polarization studies identified these extracts as mixed-type inhibitors, effectively reducing both anodic and cathodic reactions. EIS analysis revealed a decrease in double-layer capacitance (C<sub>dl</sub>) with increasing inhibitor concentration, indicating robust adsorption of the inhibitors on the steel surface and the formation of a protective barrier. Adsorption isotherm analysis showed that the adsorption of FPA and RFPABM on the mild steel surface follows both Langmuir and Temkin models, suggesting monolayer adsorption with possible lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules. In contrast, RFPANE strictly adhered to the Langmuir model, indicating uniform adsorption sites without significant interactions between adsorbed molecules. SEM-EDX analysis corroborated these findings by revealing smoother and less corroded surfaces in the presence of inhibitors compared to the uninhibited sample, which exhibited severe degradation. The protective film formed by the inhibitors was rich in oxygen and carbon, confirming the presence of adsorbed organic compounds from the extracts.
40204843	A new human-based offensive defensive optimization algorithm for solving optimization problems.	A novel human-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, termed Offensive Defensive Optimization, has been introduced to address single-objective optimization problems. This algorithm draws inspiration from the varied strategies utilized by players in board games, emulating and conceptualizing offensive and defensive behaviors within a hybrid search framework. The integration of mixed search behaviors facilitates a more efficient exploration and exploitation of the search space, thereby enhancing the algorithm's capability to surmount local minima. The algorithm was evaluated using the benchmark test suites from the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2017 and 2022, in addition to two real-world engineering design problems. In comparison to eight well-established metaheuristic algorithms, the proposed method demonstrated superior performance in 80% of the CEC2017 cases and 72% of the CEC2022 cases, with statistically significant improvements. The results further indicate that the proposed algorithm exhibits satisfactory convergence efficiency, along with robust exploration and exploitation capabilities, while maintaining a balanced equilibrium between these two processes. Additionally, the outcomes of the engineering design problems suggest that the proposed algorithm effectively manages optimization tasks, demonstrating clear superiority and enhanced competitiveness.
40204842	A paper-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for highly pathogenic avian influenza.	Avian influenza outbreaks have had significant economic and public health consequences worldwide. Therefore, prompt, reliable, and cost-effective diagnostic devices are crucial for scrutinizing and confining highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs). Our study introduced and evaluated a novel paper-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test for diagnosing the H5 subtype of the avian influenza virus (AIV). We meticulously designed and screened LAMP primers targeting the H5-haemagglutinin (H5-HA) gene of AIV and fine-tuned the paper-based detection assay for best performance. The paper-based LAMP assay demonstrated a detection limit of 500 copies per reaction (25 copies/µl). Additionally, the assay exhibited no cross-reactivity with common bovine and avian pathogens, confirming its specificity. Spiking experiments revealed that the assay could accurately detect 1000 copies of synthetic HPAIV RNA (per reaction) when spiked into oropharyngeal swab samples, achieving 100% analytical sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. This inexpensive, user-friendly point-of-need diagnostic tool holds great promise, especially in resource-limited settings. It only requires a water bath for incubation and enables visual detection of results without special equipment. Overall, the paper-based LAMP assay provides a promising method for rapidly and reliably detecting the H5 subtype of AIV, contributing to improved surveillance and early intervention strategies.
40204841	Research on water body information extraction and monitoring in high water table mining areas based on Google Earth Engine.	The extensive and intensive exploitation of coal resources has led to a particularly prominent issue of water accumulation in high groundwater table mining areas, significantly impacting the surrounding ecological environment and directly threatening the red line of cultivated land and regional food security. To provide a scientific basis for the ecological restoration of water accumulation areas in coal mining subsidence, a study on the extraction of water body information in high groundwater level subsidence areas is conducted. The spectral characteristics of land types within mining subsidence areas were analyzed through the application of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) big data cloud platform and Landsat series imagery. This study addressed technical bottlenecks in applying traditional water indices in mining areas, such as spectral interference from coal slag, under-detection of small water bodies, and misclassification of agricultural fields. An Improved Normalized Difference Water Index (INDWI) was proposed based on the analysis of spectral characteristics of surface objects, in conjunction with the OTSU algorithm. The effectiveness of water body extraction using INDWI was compared with that of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Enhanced Water Index (EWI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The results indicated that: (1) The INDWI demonstrated the highest overall accuracy, surpassing 89%, and a Kappa coefficient exceeding 80%. The extraction of water body information in mining areas was significantly superior to that achieved by the other three prevalent water indices. (2) The extraction results of the MNDWI and INDWI water Index generally aligned with the actual conditions. The boundaries of water bodies extracted using MNDWI in mining subsidence areas were somewhat ambiguous, leading to the misidentification of small water accumulation pits and misclassification of certain agricultural fields. In contrast, the extraction results of INDWI exhibited better alignment with the imagery, with no significant identification errors observed. (3) Through the comparison of three typical areas, it was concluded that the clarity of the water body boundary lines extracted by INDWI was higher, with relatively fewer internal noise points, and the soil ridges and bridges within the water bodies were distinctly visible, aligning with the actual situation. The research findings offer a foundation for the formulation of land reclamation and ecological restoration plans in coal mining subsidence areas.
40204840	Selection of alfalfa water and nitrogen management regimes based on the DSSAT model.	Forage crop production globally faces challenges of low water and nitrogen use efficiency alongside increased environmental pressures, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The Hetao Irrigation District, a representative area of such regions, is characterized by limited rainfall, high evaporation, insufficient water, and severe soil salinization, which significantly hinder agricultural development. The findings from this study not only address local challenges but also provide insights applicable to other regions facing similar climatic and environmental constraints. This study aimed to optimize water and nitrogen management strategies for alfalfa production in the Hetao Irrigation District by calibrating and validating the DSSAT-FORAGES-Alfalfa model using field experimental data collected during 2022-2023. The calibration involved adjusting key parameters to minimize discrepancies between simulated and observed values, and validation was performed using an independent dataset, evaluated based on metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R<sup>2</sup>. The novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive calibration and validation process, which provides a robust framework for simulating alfalfa growth under diverse management scenarios. Various management scenarios were simulated, including six nitrogen application rates (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and seven irrigation levels (45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, and 105 mm), to comprehensively evaluate their impacts on alfalfa yield and quality. These scenarios were designed to cover a wide range of practices, from deficit to excessive irrigation and fertilization, providing a robust assessment of optimal management strategies. Results indicated high predictive accuracy, with all performance metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE, and R<sup>2</sup>) demonstrating the model's reliability in simulating alfalfa growth under varying management conditions. Specifically, the normalized RMSE was below 10%, and the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) exceeded 0.9, confirming the model's robustness. Optimal management involving 260-340 mm of irrigation and 100-150 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> nitrogen application over the full growth cycle not only maximizes water use efficiency, but also achieves over 9% water saving and more than 25% reduction in nitrogen fertilizer application, compared to traditional local practices. These findings demonstrate the potential of optimized management strategies to significantly reduce ecological pressures while maintaining high crop productivity.
40204839	Differential influence of 1,8-Cineol on distinct hypoxia-related immune alterations in human monocytes.	1,8-Cineol is a natural plant-based therapeutic agent and is commonly used to treat a broad range of acute and chronic airway inflammatory diseases. 1,8-Cineol has recently been shown to attenuate the checkpoint molecule PDL-1 in circulating monocytes in patients with chronic Otitis media (OM) and was associated with an improved clinical outcome. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is thought to play an essential role in the middle ear inflammatory process, mainly due to dysfunctions of the eustachian tube. However, the unambiguous impact of 1,8-Cineol on hypoxia-driven immune alterations of human monocytes and the related inflammatory microenvironment have not been investigated thus far. Therefore, we used the human monocytes to investigate the impact of 1,8-Cineol on the cellular hypoxia response with regards to expression levels of different adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors, and different cell stress-related proteins. Furthermore, the secretion patterns of a variety of chemokines and cytokines were evaluated. The study aimed to better understand the influence of the monoterpene 1,8-Cineol on hypoxia and normoxia-associated monocyte characteristics and related inflammatory processes, all of which are crucial for the development of various human diseases.
40204838	Spatiotemporal evolution and multiscenario simulation of cultivated land ecosystem services in the Dongting Lake Plain.	With the rapid development of the social economy, human dependence on and interference with cultivated land ecosystems have increased. Improving the understanding of changes in ecosystem services is conducive to avoiding and reducing the risk of ecosystem service degradation. This study evaluated seven key ecosystem services of cultivated land in the Dongting Lake Plain from 2000 to 2020, analysed their spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and correlations between ecosystem service pairs, and identified the key factors driving their changes. Finally, the PLUS model was used to predict land use changes and ecosystem service responses under the baseline scenario, farmland protection scenario, and ecological protection scenario in 2040. The results revealed that (1) from 2000 to 2020, in addition to the degradation of carbon storage services and habitat quality services, the food production, environmental purification, water conservation, soil conservation and landscape aesthetic services of the Dongting Lake Plain all showed increasing trends. The high- and low-value areas of each ecosystem service vary, but the overall spatial pattern is relatively stable. (2) In 2000, 2010 and 2020, the proportions of trade-off relationships among the 21 ecosystem service pairs in the Dongting Lake Plain were 52.38%, 51.74% and 28.57%, respectively. During the study period, the dominant correlation between ecosystem services shifted from trade-offs to synergies. (3) Ecosystem services are influenced by both natural background conditions and human activities. Natural factors have a greater impact than do socioeconomic factors. Precipitation, temperature and altitude are the key factors driving changes in ecosystem services. (4) The simulation results of multiple scenarios reveal that by 2040, the cultivated land in the Dongting Lake Plain will suffer the greatest loss under the baseline scenario, with the percentage decreasing from 54.07% to 51.64%. In addition to the improvement of environmental purification services, the total amount of various services will also increase. The reduction is the most significant in this scenario, followed by the ecological protection scenario. In the farmland protection scenario, ecosystem services are protected to a certain extent.
40204836	ZTE MRI improves detection of calcific deposits and differentiation between resorptive and formative phases in calcific tendinitis of shoulder.	The purpose of study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of the ZTE sequence of shoulder MRI in patients with calcific tendinitis by comparing conventional sequences. Seventy-nine patients (43 patients with calcific tendinitis and 36 control group) who underwent both radiography and MRI including ZTE sequence were enrolled in our study. Two radiologists assessed the SNR, image quality, presence, size, multiplicity, shape, margin, signal intensity, composition, and location of calcific deposits on ZTE image, FSPDWI, and T2WI. The diagnostic performance was calculated with radiography as the standard of reference. The inter-reader agreement and differentiation of the resorptive phase and formative phase on ZTE were compared to that on FSPDWI and T2WI. A total 59 calcific deposits in 43 patients were found on radiography and classified into type 1 resorptive phases (n = 20) and type 2 formative phases (n = 39). ZTE image quality was for diagnostic use with substantial inter-reader agreement. Sensitivity and detection rate of ZTE image was better than those of FSPDWI and T2WI. The inter-reader agreement of ZTE image was equal to FSPDWI and better than T2WI. The features of calcific deposits on ZTE images were significantly different between two phases. In the resorptive phase, a greater percentage of calcific deposits showed irregular shapes, ill-defined margin, heterogeneous compositions on ZTE images. In conclusion, ZTE sequence may provide useful information for the diagnosis of calcific tendinitis of the shoulder.
40204835	Distinct proteomic profiles of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles in healthy, benign, and triple-negative breast cancer: candidate biomarkers for liquid biopsy.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from plasma, measuring up to 150 nm, act as molecular messengers transmitting critical information to recipient cells, making them valuable candidates for liquid biopsy applications in cancer diagnostics. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is particularly challenging due to its aggressive nature, metastasis potential, and limited treatment options. This study aimed to identify EV-associated proteins in blood samples that could serve as potential TNBC biomarkers. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we detected unique and differentially expressed proteins across healthy individuals, patients with benign breast conditions, and those with TNBC. While EVs size and concentration showed no differences, the proteomic profile varied significantly among these groups. Several immune-related proteins were found exclusively in healthy individuals but were diminished in both benign and malignant cases. We also assessed the impact of surgery on EVs protein content and identified Histone H2A as a TNBC-specific marker present before surgery. Its expression was further validated through immunohistochemistry and Western blotting in TNBC biopsies and cell lines. Notably, surgical intervention enhanced immune response pathways in TNBC patients. In conclusion, liquid biopsy has the potential to serve as a non-invasive tool for TNBC diagnosis and monitoring, revealing a post-surgery molecular landscape that supports combining immunotherapy with mastectomy.
40204834	Research on failure properties and analysis methods of Q690D based on energy characteristics of AE signal.	The bearing properties of high-strength steel (HSS) structures determine their safety, and the energy conversion and mechanical state evolution during their failure process are closely related. Therefore, determining the corresponding relationship between micro failure characteristics and macro mechanical state changes is of great significance for structural safety monitoring. In this paper, the acoustic-mechanical energy characteristic relationship during the tensile failure process of Q690 HSS is studied based on acoustic emission (AE) technology. The distribution law of characteristic parameters of AE signals during the Q690D tensile test is analyzed based on the AE mechanism, and the energy conversion characteristics of Q690 HSS failure process are determined from time- and space-dimension through the AE energy parameter. Besides, based on the mechanical state of the specimens during the loading process, combined with strain signals and finite element analysis, the failure process was divided into multiple intervals. Finally, a comparative analysis was conducted to obtain the relationship and variation rules between the macroscopic mechanical state changes and acoustic characteristics, which provides a reference for the application of AE energy signals in the state monitoring of Q690 structures.
40204833	Time lag effect of precipitation on groundwater level based on wavelet analysis in the People's Victory Canal irrigation area, China.	The People's Victory Canal irrigation area is an important agricultural irrigation region in the North China Plain, where groundwater resources play a crucial role in both agricultural production and the ecological environment. However, in recent years, the increasing depth of the groundwater, influenced by climate change and human activities, has posed significant challenges to the sustainable use of water resources in the region. Therefore, exploring the lag effect and its trends between precipitation and groundwater depth is essential for the scientific management of groundwater resources and optimizing water allocation. This study is based on the monthly average precipitation and groundwater depth data from the Xiazhuang in the People's Victory Canal irrigation area from 1993 to 2021. It uses methods such as continuous wavelet transform, cross-wavelet transform, and cross-correlation analysis to systematically analyze the lag effect and its changing patterns of groundwater table depth in response to precipitation at different time scales. The study finds that during the research period, precipitation generally showed a downward trend, while the groundwater table depth continuously increased and experienced a sudden change in 1999, after which it rose significantly. Before 2000, there was a strong correlation between precipitation and groundwater depth, with a noticeable response of groundwater depth to changes in precipitation, and the lag time was about 58.97 days. However, after 2000, this relationship gradually weakened, especially in years other than those with abundant rainfall, where the influence of precipitation on groundwater depth decreased significantly, and the lag time increased to 6 to 8 months. The study shows that before 2000, abundant precipitation led to a shallower groundwater, and the groundwater was more significantly influenced by precipitation. After 2000, reduced precipitation and the increased depth of the groundwater table weakened the response of groundwater to precipitation, thus enhancing the lag effect. This trend reflects a change in the mechanism of precipitation recharge to groundwater, which is likely closely related to intensified human activities, changes in the irrigation water extraction methods, and over-extraction of groundwater. The findings of this study can provide a scientific basis for water resource management in the irrigation area, helping to formulate appropriate groundwater regulation measures and ensure the sustainable use of regional water resources.
40204832	Multi-disciplinary approaches paving the way for clinically effective peptide vaccines for cancer.	Cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte (CTL) cells are central in mediating antitumor immunity. Induction of a robust CTL response requires, CTL interaction with professional antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, displaying onco-antigenic peptide, often derived from tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or neoantigens, and costimulation via CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells which then elicits an effector and memory immune response that targets and kills cancer cells. Despite the tumoricidal capacity of CTLs, cancer cells can escape immune surveillance and killing due to their immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, to harness the CTL immune response and combat the effect of the TME, peptide-based T cell vaccines targeting specific onco-antigens, conjugated with adjuvants are a subject of ongoing research for cancer immunotherapy; particularly, multi-peptide vaccines, containing both CTL and CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cell epitopes along with an immunostimulant. Historically, peptide-based T cell vaccines have been investigated as a potential strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Despite initial enthusiasm, these peptide vaccines have not demonstrated success in clinical outcomes. However, recent advancements in our understanding of cancer immunology and the design of peptide vaccines targeting specific tumor antigens have paved the way for novel strategies in peptide-based immunotherapy. These advancements have reignited optimism surrounding the potential of peptide-based vaccines as a viable cancer therapeutic. This review explores the new strategies and discusses the exciting possibilities they offer. Specifically, this review develops an understanding of vaccine design and clinical outcomes, by discussing mechanisms of CTL effector and memory responses, and how peptide-based vaccines can induce and enhance these responses. It addresses the challenge of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) restriction, which limits the effectiveness of traditional peptide vaccines in individuals with diverse MHC types. It also delves into the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and overcoming its inhibitory effects using peptide-based vaccines for efficient cancer cell elimination. The review aims to provide an understanding of the complexities faced by each field in vaccine design, enhancing dialogue and understanding among researchers by bringing together the chemistry of vaccine synthesis, cancer immunology, and clinical studies to support the development of a peptide-based vaccine.
40204831	Olfactory epithelium electrical stimulation mitigates memory and synaptic deficits caused by mechanical ventilation.	Mechanical ventilation (MV) causes a wide range of cognitive impairments. Unfortunately, to date, we are lacking knowledge about its underlying neural mechanisms and significant treatment options for the condition. Here, we show that MV-induced memory impairment in rats stems from dysfunctions in the olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex-ventral hippocampus network and hippocampal synaptic currents imbalance. More importantly, we introduce a novel treatment approach, namely olfactory epithelium electrical stimulation (OEES) that shows promising preclinical results in mitigating the mentioned behavioral and neural disorders caused by MV. These results pave the way for research on non-invasive brain stimulation approaches and introduce the olfactory system as a potential target for treating cognitive or psychiatric disorders induced by MV.
40204830	Analysis of clinical features and SS-OCT findings in patients with focal choroidal excavation.	To analyze the epidemiology, clinical features, and Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography findings in patients with Focal Choroidal Excavation. 97 patients with FCE were identified from 50,000 scans of 25,000 individuals who underwent SS-OCT examinations. These patients' clinical and imaging features were recorded, while data from 37 individuals with follow-up records were analyzed. FCE lesions were classified into three subtypes: (1) type 1: leptochoroid type (SFCT: <100 μm), (2) type 2: normochoroid type (SFCT: 100-200 μm), and (3) type 3: pachychoroid type (SFCT: >200 μm). A total of 108 FCEs were identified in 100 eyes, with 66 (61.1%) classified as Conforming type and 42 (38.9%) as non-conforming type. The maximum depth of FCEs in the study cohort was 96.6 ± 78.4 μm, the maximum width was 875.1 ± 960.1 μm, and choroidal thickness under FCE was 200.5 ± 191.5 μm. We observed 10 chorioretinopathy coexisting with FCE and categorized FCE based on choroidal thickness, highlighting three distinct types associated with different chorioretinopathy. Follow-up assessments revealed the relative stability of FCE and the efficacy of Anti-VEGF treatment for FCE-related CNV. Choroidal thickness playing a role in determining the specific type of FCE when combined with chorioretinopathy. Factors such as choroidal inflammation, scarring, and abnormal dilation of choroidal blood vessels may contribute to the damage or loss of outer retinal and inner choroidal tissues in FCE cases. FCE typically demonstrates stability over time, and Anti-VEGF treatment has shown efficacy in managing FCE-related CNV.
40204829	Bimetallic Au-Ru nanoparticles supported on zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 as highly efficient catalysts for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol.	A highly dispersed bimetallic catalyst, AuRu/ZIF-67, and monometallic catalysts, Au/ZIF-67 and Ru/ZIF-67, were successfully prepared herein via co-impregnation/impregnation and hydrogen reduction methods. The catalytic performances of the bimetallic Au-Ru and monometallic Au and Ru catalysts for benzyl alcohol oxidation were compared under an O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Results revealed that the addition of Ru to the Au catalyst reduced the oxidation activity of benzyl alcohol while considerably improving the yield of benzaldehyde. The reaction solvent, temperature, pressure and time exerted crucial effects on the catalytic performance of AuRu/ZIF-67. The optimal reaction conditions when using AuRu/ZIF-67 for benzyl alcohol oxidation were 70℃, 5 bar O<sub>2</sub> and 4 h with tetrahydrofuran as the solvent. The benzyl alcohol conversion and benzaldehyde yield were 82.9% and 47.5%, respectively, under the optimal reaction conditions. AuRu/ZIF-67 exhibited excellent applicability towards alcohols; particularly for aromatic and aliphatic alcohols, where good conversions and acceptable yields of aldehydes were obtained. Moreover, the AuRu/ZIF-67 catalyst demonstrated good stability for benzyl alcohol oxidation, and it could be recycled four times without any changes in the benzaldehyde yield.
40204828	Synovial macrophages drive severe joint destruction in established rheumatoid arthritis.	To investigate the synovial pathological predictors associated with the progression to severe bone erosion in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This retrospective study analyzed 41 active RA patients with a disease duration of more than 24 months at our center between March and December 2023. All of these patients underwent synovial biopsy to obtain synovial tissue. These patients were divided into two groups (mild group and severe group) based on the severity of bone erosion assessed by plain X-ray. HE and immunohistochemical staining for CD3, CD20, CD68, and CD138 were conducted on synovium. Stained cells positive for these markers were observed under microscope. the number of positive cells per 20× high-power field in the sublining layer was recorded for each marker. The mild group consisted of 25 patients (23 females) with a median age of 58 years and a median disease duration of 114 months. The severe group included 16 patients (13 females) with a median age of 56 years and a median disease duration of 120 months. There were no significant differences between the mild and severe groups in terms of age, gender, disease duration, RF, ACPA, ESR, and CRP (P > 0.05). However, the disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS-28) of severe group were significantly higher than mild group (5.16 vs. 4.53, P = 0.010). Inflammatory infiltration score observed with HE staining was significantly higher in severe group (P = 0.033), whereas synovial hyperplasia, neovascularization, and stromal activation did not show significant differences between the two groups. The results of immunohistochemistry revealed significantly higher expression of synovial CD68-positive cells in severe group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that synovial CD68-positive cells (OR = 1.020, P = 0.011) were independent risk factors for progressive bone erosion in RA. Synovial macrophage infiltration is an independent risk factor leading to severe progression of bone erosion in RA.
40204827	Establishment and validation survival prediction models for T1 locally advanced breast cancer after breast conservation surgery versus mastectomy.	Previous reports have indicated that the survival rate of total mastectomy (TM) is higher than that of breast-conserving surgery (BCS). This study established survival prediction models for T1-stage locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) comparing TM and BCS, aiming to identify risk factors for overall survival (OS) associated with different surgical approaches and provide a basis for individualized treatment by clinicians. Cases of pathologically confirmed T1 LABC between 2010 and 2015 were retrieved from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. COX regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between LABC TM, BCS and various factors. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated to determine the possible influencing factors. Significant factors from multivariate COX regression were included into the models construct nomograms. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), area under the curve of ROC (AUC), calibration curves, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for the calibration curves were generated. Model validation was conducted in a separate validation group. The results of COX regression analysis on survival rates for T1 LABC patients undergoing TM and BCS showed that the 5-year overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were higher in the BCS group compared to the TM group. Age, race, histological grade, N stage, molecular subtype, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (RT) were associated with 5-year OS of BCS. Similarly, age, race, pathological type, histological grade, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, N stage, molecular subtype, chemotherapy, and RT were correlated with 5-year OS of TM. Prediction nomograms were established using the aforementioned predictors, resulting in AUCs of 0.743 (for 5-year OS of BCS) and 0.718 (for 5-year OS of TM) in the modeling group. Both models were well-validated in the validation group. This study found that the survival rate of the BCS group was higher than that of the TM group, indicating that tumor size determines the survival rate of BCS to some extent. Lymph node status cannot be considered a contraindication for BCS surgery, suggesting that BCS can be considered for LABC patients with smaller tumors and more lymph node metastases. However, patients with primary tumors in N3 stage, triple-negative, and inner upper quadrant have a higher risk of death after BCS compared to other groups, so BCS should be carefully considered for these patients.
40204826	Efficacy of furanone in reducing the bacterial contamination and marginal bone loss of dental implants.	In two-piece dental implants, gaps at the implant-abutment interface (IAI) allow bacterial contamination, contributing to peri-implantitis and marginal bone loss (MBL). This study investigates the clinical efficacy of (5Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5 H)-furanone (furanone), a quorum sensing inhibitor, for mitigating bacterial contamination and MBL around dental implants. Dental implants with dog's bacteria and various concentrations of furanone were incubated anaerobically for 7 days to evaluate the anti-bacterial effect of furanone, and bacterial quantification was performed in vitro. The mandibular premolars and molars of three mongrel dogs were extracted three months before implant placement. After the implant fixture was placed, furanone and/or bacteria were added to the inner space of the fixture and connected with a healing abutment. The MBL was assessed by soft X-ray microscopy after 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of implant placement. Furanone (20 and 30 mM) significantly inhibited bacterial growth at the IAI in vitro. The MBL at the IAI by bacterial contamination was reduced with furanone (20 mM) in vivo. Bacterial contamination at the IAI causes a substantial MBL, which can be effectively mitigated by furanone, thereby highlighting its potential as an antibacterial agent for reducing MBL for the long-term survival of the dental implants.
40204825	Alterations in fecal microbiota composition and cytokine expression profiles in adolescents with depression: a case-control study.	Emerging evidence has highlighted that altered gut microbiota are associated with the onset and progression of depression via regulating the gut-brain axis. However, existing research has predominantly focused on children and adults, frequently neglecting adolescent depression. Given the rising prevalence and substantial impact of adolescent depression on functional impairment and suicidality, it is essential to focus more on this age group. In this study, we examined the fecal microbiota and inflammatory profiles of 99 depressed adolescents and 106 age-matched healthy controls using Illumina NovaSeq sequencing and multiplex immunoassays, respectively. Our findings revealed lower bacterial α-diversity and richness, alongside altered β-diversity in adolescents with depression. Gut dysbiosis associated with adolescent depression was characterized by increased pro-inflammatory genera such as Streptococcus and decreased anti-inflammatory genera like Faecalibacterium. These differential genera may serve as potential non-invasive biomarkers for adolescent depression, either individually or in combination. We also observed disruptions in the inferred microbiota functions in adolescent depression-associated microbiota, particularly in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Additionally, depressed adolescents exhibited systemic immune dysfunction, with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which showed significant correlations with the differential genera. Our study bridges the gap between children and adults by providing new insights into the fecal microbiota characteristics and their links to immune system disruptions in depressed adolescents, which offer new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of depression in this age group.
40204824	Seismic collapse capacity analysis of degrading SDOF systems with uncoupled negative and positive stiffness mechanism.	The negative-positive-uncoupled stiffness device (NPUSD) is a novel variable stiffness system recently developed by the authors, designed to efficiently and cost-effectively achieve multi-level seismic fortification in structures. This study aims to integrate the NPUSD with a viscous damper in parallel, forming an innovative negative-positive-uncoupled stiffness amplifying damper (NPUSAD). Additionally, it establishes the collapse capacity spectra for a degrading single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system equipped with the NPUSAD under three distinct seismic record sets. The study investigates the influence of both the SDOF structural parameters and the NPUSAD parameters on the collapse capacity spectra. The results indicate that the NPUSAD-SDOF system significantly enhances the collapse resistance of long-period structures, with improvements of 30%, 40%, and 50% under far-field non-impulsive, near-field non-impulsive, and near-field impulsive seismic record sets, respectively. Among the parameters of structural element, the ductility ratio, soften stiffness coefficient, and stability coefficient have a significant impact on the collapse capacity spectra. For the NPUSAD parameters, the transition displacement ratio has the greater influence, followed by the positive-to-negative stiffness ratio, while the connecting stiffness ratio has the least impact.
40204823	Construction and optimization of ecological security patterns in Chinese black soil areas considering ecological importance and vulnerability.	As important guarantees of national food security, black soil regions have faced many ecological problems in recent years, such as soil erosion and salinization, which threaten the sustainable development of agriculture and ecological security. This study explores the dynamic changes in the ecological security pattern of China's black soil region in a time series and proposes corresponding optimization suggestions on the basis of the characteristics of these changes. Taking 2002, 2012 and 2022 as the time nodes, we identified ecological source areas through analyses of ecosystem service value and ecological sensitivity and then constructed ecological corridors by combining the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and circuit theory. The findings are as follows: (1) Ecosystem service functions exhibit a spatial pattern of higher values in the east and lower values in the west, with ecological sensitivity decreasing annually. Although the number of ecological source areas has decreased, their total area has increased. (2) The number of ecological corridors has decreased, but their length has fluctuated, and the number of stepping stones has significantly increased. (3) On the basis of the results of this study, a "point-line-polygon-network" optimization strategy is proposed, which includes constructing ecological belts, strengthening ecological barriers, and restoring the connectivity of ecological nodes and corridors to improve regional ecosystem stability and sustainability, providing policymakers with scientific guidance.
40204822	Empirical research of urban land use eco-efficiency in the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration.	Having developed rapidly for more than 40 years of reform and opening up, the supply of the urban land in the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRDUA) has been increasingly tense. Based on a panel data set for the period 2006-2021, this paper applied a super-efficiency epsilon-based measure (EBM) model with undesirable outputs to calculate the urban land utilization eco-efficiency (ULUEE) of nine cities in the PRDUA, subsequently using a Tobit model to analyze the influencing factors of ULUEE. The results show that: (1) ULUEE in the PRDUA during the study period presents a fluctuating character over time. (2) ULUEE was at a higher level around Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan, while ULUEE in Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Dongguan was lower. (3) Economic development, and opening up to the outside world had positive impacts on ULUEE, while government intervention and infrastructure construction had a negative impact on ULUEE.
40204821	Breast milk Na<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio predict delayed onset of lactogenesis in gestational hyperglycemia.	To investigate the predictive value of breast milk Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio on delayed onset of lactogenesis (DOL) in puerpera with gestational hyperglycemia. Puerpera with gestational hyperglycemia who delivered at The First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University in China between October 20, 2023, and April 1, 2024, were enrolled. The concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in breast milk samples were examined from study participants on days 1-3 of the postpartum period. The predictive value of Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio on DOL were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Both the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio in breast milk collected on day 3 could effectively predict DOL, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of the ROC curve and 95%CI values of 94.7% (95%CI = 0.901-0.992) and 94.2% (95%CI = 0.890-0.994), respectively. The optimized cutoffs were Na<sup>+</sup> concentration ≥ 26.25 mmol/L (sensitivity = 88.2%, specificity = 92.2.8%) and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio ≥ 1.646 (sensitivity = 79.4%, specificity = 98.4%). Both the Na⁺ concentration and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio in breast milk were found to be effective in predicting DOL in puerpera with gestational hyperglycemia.
40204820	Alamandine enhanced spatial memory in rats by reducing neuroinflammation and altering BDNF levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.	Our study aims to determine the effects of alamandine, the newest component of the renin-angiotensin system, on cognitive functions, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of depression. 35 male Sprague dawley rats, three months old, weighing between 300 and 350 g, were used. The chronic, unpredictable mild stress model of depression was performed. Experimental animals were divided into five groups: control (C), depression (D), alamandine (50 µg/kg, ip) (D + ALA), A779 (300 µg/kg, ip) (D + A779), and both alamandine and A779 treatment groups (D + ALA + A779). After confirming the development of depression through behavioral tests, the animals' learning and memory performances were measured using the Morris water maze test. At the end of the experiment, the animals' prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and blood samples were isolated for biochemical studies and gene expression analyses. The sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, tail suspension, and forced swimming tests were performed to determine the animals' anxiety levels. There was a significant increase in anxiety-like behaviors in the D group and the A779-treated group, while alamandine exhibited an anxiolytic effect. Moreover, improvements in cognitive skills observed in the Morris water maze test were paralleled by molecular changes, including an increase in BDNF protein levels and NMDA receptor expression and a decrease in GABA levels. In addition, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and oxidative stress markers were increased in the depression groups while significantly decreased with alamandine treatment. It was concluded that alamandine has an anxiolytic effect and facilitates spatial memory by reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.
40204817	Adaptive energy loss optimization in distributed networks using reinforcement learning-enhanced crow search algorithm.	Modern power distribution network incorporates distributed generation (DG) for numerous benefits. However, the incorporation creates numerous challenges in energy management and to handle the challenges it requires advanced optimization techniques for an effective operation of the network. Unlike traditional methods such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and standard Crow Search Algorithm (CSA), which suffer from premature convergence and limited adaptability to real-time variations, Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Crow Search Algorithm (RL-CSA) which is proposed in this research work solves network reconfiguration optimization problem and minimize energy losses. Unlike conventional heuristic methods, which follow predefined search patterns, RL-CSA dynamically refines its search trajectory based on real-time feedback, ensuring superior convergence speed and global search efficiency. The novel RL-CSA enables real-time adaptability and intelligent optimization for energy loss reduction in distributed networks. The proposed model validation is performed on the IEEE 33 and 69 Bus test systems considering diverse performance metrics such as power loss reduction, voltage stability, execution time, utilization efficiency for DG deployment, and energy cost minimization. Comparative results show that RL-CSA achieves a 78% reduction in energy losses, limiting power loss to 5 kW (IEEE 33-Bus) and 8 kW (IEEE 69-Bus) whereas traditional models converge at higher loss levels. The execution time is optimized to 1.4 s (IEEE 33-Bus) and 1.8 s (IEEE 69-Bus), significantly faster than GA, PSO, and CSA, making RL-CSA more efficient for real-time power distribution applications. By balancing exploration-exploitation using CSA while adapting search parameters through reinforcement learning, RL-CSA ensures scalability, improved DG utilization (98%), and better voltage stability (< 0.005 p.u.), making it a robust and intelligent alternative for modern smart grid optimization.
40204816	Examining the role of compression in influencing AI-generated image authenticity.	The rapid development of AI-generated Content (AIGC) in recent years has narrowed the gap between virtual and realistic. Among them, AI-generated Images (AIGIs) are particularly significant, as their emergence has led to a profound impact on education, art, virtual reality, etc. However, little research has been conducted to investigate whether compression artifacts can influence the subjective authenticity of AIGIs. In this paper, we systematically study this problem by creating the first-ever AIGC image dataset for subjective evaluations of authenticity discrimination. The dataset contains 500 AIGIs and 500 natural images with a resolution of 768 × 768. The content of the images therein has been categorized into 5 major categories and 20 subcategories to study the performance of AIGIs on different contents. Subsequently, we introduce four varying degrees of compression distortion (QP = 22, 32, 42, 52) on all images utilizing the standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC). It is interesting to find that with an increase in compression distortion, the accuracy of human vision in determining the AIGIs descends. The proposed study is expected to shed light on future research that aims to achieve a good balance between authenticity and visual quality.
40204815	Interaction between depressive state and high-fat diet and its impact on behavioral and body weight changes in male mice.	Depression and obesity are common chronic diseases in modern society. Meta-analyses consistently reveal a bidirectional relationship: individuals with depression have a higher risk of obesity, while obese individuals are more prone to depression. High-fat diet (HFD) consumption is a risk factor of obesity. However, the impact of depression on obesity and the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. We aim to assess the impact of a long-term depressive state throughout adulthood on body weight changes induced by HFD, and whether HFD affects depressive state in mice. We established a depression mouse model using a Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS) paradigm. Following the stress period, male mice were fed with a normal diet or a HFD for seven weeks prior to behavioral tests and body weight measurements. Our results suggest that exposure to CUMS initially accelerated weight gain in mice; however, it did not significantly affect final body weight or white adipose tissue weight. Additionally, while HFD did not significantly impact measures of depression-like behavior in CUMS mice but tended to induce depression-like behavior in control mice. Overall, contrary to clinical observations, our findings revealed that a depressive state did not significantly affect the development of obesity in mice, nor did HFD significantly exacerbate depressive-like behaviors in mice.
40204814	Study on broadband vibration reduction characteristics and optimal design of the acoustic black hole plate with damping oscillators.	The acoustic black hole (ABH) can alter the velocity of bending waves and concentrate vibration energy with the change of thickness. However, the frequency of the ABH is primarily concentrated above the cut-off frequency and the effect on frequencies below the cut-off frequency is negligible. This paper investigates the vibration characteristics of the ABH damping oscillator (ABH-DO) structure in the frequency range below the cut-off frequency and the corresponding structural parameter influence analysis is conducted. Subsequently, the vibration property of ABH-DO in multiple array configurations are analyzed and the ability of absorbing the vibration energy is experimentally verified. Finally, orthogonal experiments are performed on ABH-DO structures in multiple array configurations. The results reveal that both single and multiple ABH-DO structures demonstrate effective vibration reduction. Among the parameters of ABH-DO, the oscillator mass has the most pronounced effect on vibration peaks. The vibration characteristics of the ABH-DO structure can be optimized by adjusting the oscillator mass. Optimal parameters are determined within a given range through orthogonal experiments. The vibration characteristics of the ABH-DO structure at the optimal factor level are enhanced to varying extents.
40204813	Predicting the strengths of basalt fiber reinforced concrete mixed with fly ash using AML and Hoffman and Gardener techniques.	Basalt fiber-reinforced concrete (BFRC) mixed with fly ash, combined with advanced machine learning techniques, offers a practical, cost-effective, and less time-consuming alternative to traditional experimental methods. Conventional approaches to evaluating mechanical properties, such as compressive and splitting tensile strengths, typically require sophisticated equipment, meticulous sample preparation, and extended testing periods. These methods demand substantial financial resources, specialized labor, and considerable time for data collection and analysis. The integration of machine learning provides a transformative solution by enabling accurate prediction of concrete properties with minimal experimental data. The methods of data collection from literature and analysis were used and 121 records were collected from experimentally tested basalt fiber reinforced concrete samples measuring the compressive and splitting tensile strengths of the concrete. Eleven (11) critical factors have been considered as constituents of the studied concrete to predict the Fc-Compressive strength (MPa) and Fsp-Splitting tensile strength (MPa), which are the output parameters. The collected records were divided into training set (96 records = 80%) and validation set (25 records = 20%) following the requirements for data partitioning for sustainable machine learning application. Seven (7) selected machine learning techniques are applied in the prediction. Further, performance evaluation indices were used to compare the models' abilities and lastly, the Hoffman and Gardener's technique was used to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters on the concrete strengths. At the end of the exercise, results were collated. In predicting the compressive strength (Fc), AdaBoost similarly excels, matching XGBoosting's validation performance with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.98 and the same MAE values. This shows the effectiveness of boosting techniques for predictive modeling in concrete strength estimation. For splitting tensile strength (Fsp), AdaBoost also outperforms most models, achieving an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.96 for training and validation phases. Its exceptionally low validation MAE of 0.124 MPa underscores its excellent generalization capabilities. Overall, XGBoosting and AdaBoost consistently demonstrate superior performance for both compressive and splitting tensile strength predictions, followed closely by KNN. These models benefit from advanced ensemble techniques that efficiently handle non-linear patterns and noise. SVR also performs admirably, whereas GEP and GMDHNN exhibit weaker predictive capabilities due to limitations in handling complex data dynamics. For the sensitivity analysis, the Hoffman and Gardener's method of sensitivity analysis proves instrumental in identifying key drivers of strength in fiber-reinforced concrete, guiding informed decision-making for material optimization and sustainable construction practices.

The study incorporates a microsphere membrane into the glucose composite membrane theory, highlighting its role in planar diffusion and reaction processes. It includes a numerical analysis of factors influencing gluconic acid concentration, such as diffusion coefficients, reaction kinetics, and membrane properties. We have effectively compared an analytically derived methodology using the homotopy perturbation method (HPM) with the Hyperbolic Function Method(HFM). These findings deepen the understanding and optimisation of enzyme kinetics, contributing to more efficient biocatalytic systems. The ability to predict and control enzyme behaviour in these settings opens the door to significant advancements in biotechnology, with potential applications in pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and industrial bioprocesses.
40204811	Implantation of a vaccine platform for extended antigen release (VPEAR) induces long-term immunity against Haemonchus contortus in sheep.	The nematode Haemonchus contortus causes severe anemia in sheep and goats. Drug-resistant isolates are common, prompting a need for parasite control measures beyond chemotherapeutics. Vaccination is one promising approach for mitigation of clinical signs associated with haemonchosis. One challenge for H. contortus vaccine efforts is the need to administer repeated boosting doses at regular intervals. In this study, we evaluated a vaccine platform for extended antigen release (VPEAR) designed to initiate and maintain long-term immunity following a single immunization event in sheep. We compared a soluble vaccine depot with montanide adjuvant to the VPEAR platform with two different adjuvant combinations. Vaccination with VPEAR adjuvanted with DEAE-dextran induced antibody titers in 5 out of 6 vaccinated sheep up to 47 weeks post-vaccination. Challenge experiments revealed a 73% decrease in adult worm burden in this vaccine group compared to adjuvant alone and serum antibodies from these animals bound the luminal surface of the parasite intestine. Overall, the VPEAR platform was effective for long-term vaccination with no indication of immune tolerance to the parasite upon challenge.
40204810	A lightweight deep learning model for multi-plant biotic stress classification and detection for sustainable agriculture.	Plant pathogens and pests hinder general plant health, resulting in poor agricultural yields and production. These threaten global food security and cause environmental and economic shortages. Amidst the available existing heavy deep learning (DL) models, there is an increasing demand for computation resources, memory constraints, delayed interface time, unscalable deployment, increased training time, higher data requirements, and inflexibility. To solve all these challenges, this study presents a robust and lightweight "AgarwoodNet" DL model. The research introduces and uses a new raw curated Agarwood pest and disease dataset (APDD) with 14 classes and 5,472 Agarwood leaf images from Brunei and the Turkey Plant Pests and Diseases (TPPD) dataset with 4,447 images categorized into 15 diverse classes of six plants. MATLAB deep learning toolbox was used to train the DL architectures. The performance assessment parameters considered Cohen's Kappa, specificity precision, F1 scores, and recall. The proposed AgarwoodNet achieved impressive Macro-average performance of 0.9666, 0.9714, and 0.9859 in Precision, Recall, and F1 Scores, respectively, and 0.9859 on Kappa when tested on APDD. More so, the model attained 95.85%, 96.13%, and 95.90% in testing using TPPD and 96.84% on Kappa with the model size of 37 megabytes, making it a lightweight model in relation to the pre-trained convolutional neural network a considerably heavy, others twice the proposed model. This model size is considerably light and can be implemented on low-memory devices, thus supporting sustainable agricultural applications that are precise and accurate in classifying and detecting plant diseases and diseases.
40204809	Techno-economic and environmental analysis of a fully renewable hybrid energy system for sustainable power infrastructure advancement.	Integrating renewable energy (RE) into electricity generation enhances sustainability, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves energy security, lowers costs, and supports sustainable development, particularly in remote and underserved regions. This study evaluates the feasibility and performance of a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) designed to meet the energy demands of Hobyo Seaport, Somalia. The proposed HRES incorporates a photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WT), diesel generator (DG), pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), and battery energy storage system (BESS). Four configurations-PV/WT/PHES, PV/WT/DG/PHES, PV/WT/DG/BESS, and WT/DG/PHES-were analyzed using HOMER Pro and MATLAB software to optimize system sizing and assess techno-economic and environmental performance. Results indicate that the PV/WT/PHES configuration is the most efficient, achieving a 100% renewable energy fraction, a net present cost of $619,720, the lowest levelized cost of electricity at $0.03845/kWh, and a simple payback period of 0.31 years. Additionally, the system offers significant environmental benefits, mitigating 1,029 tons of CO annually, valued at $20,593 in carbon credits. Over a 20-year period, it reduces cumulative cash flow by 97.1% compared to a diesel-based system. These findings highlight the proposed HRES as a cost-effective and environmentally advantageous solution, establishing its sustainability and practicality for enhancing energy infrastructure in Somalia's Seaports and similar coastal regions.
40204808	Spatiotemporal dynamic and catalytically mediated reconfiguration of compartmentalized cyanuric acid/polyadenine DNA microdroplet condensates.	Native cells possess membrane-bound subcompartments, organelles, such as mitochondria and lysosomes, that intercommunicate and regulate cellular functions. Extensive efforts are directed to develop synthetic cells, or protocells, that replicate these structures and functions. Among these approaches, phase-separated coacervate microdroplets composed of polymers, polysaccharides, proteins, or nucleic acids are gaining interest as cell-mimicking systems. Particularly, compartmentalization of the synthetic protocell assemblies and the integration of functional constituents in the containments allowing signaling, programmed transfer of chemical agents, and spatiotemporal controlled catalytic transformations across the protocell subdomains, are challenging goals in developing artificial cells. Here, we report the assembly of compartmentalized, phase-separated cyanuric acid/polyadenine coacervate microdroplets. Hierarchical, co-centric compartmentalization is achieved through the dynamic and competitive spatiotemporal occupation of pre-engineered barcode domains within the polyadenine microdroplet framework by invading DNA strands. By encoding structural and functional information within these DNA-invaded compartments, the light-triggered, switchable reconfiguration of compartments, switchable catalytic reconfiguration of containments, and reversible aggregation/deaggregation of the compartmentalized microdroplets are demonstrated.
40204807	Cancer patients' acceptance of virtual reality interventions for self-emotion regulation.	This study investigates the acceptability of Virtual reality (VR) technology for emotional regulation among cancer patients. Drawing from extensive literature, we enhanced external variables across user characteristics, product impact factors, and social environment influences, creating the "Theoretical Model of Cancer Patients' Acceptance of VR Intervention for Self-Emotion Regulation." Surveying 489 Chinese cancer patients validated the model's strong reliability through SPSS AMOS analysis. The acceptance of VR intervention for self-emotional regulation among cancer patients was assessed, revealing that the average scores across all 13 dimensions exceeded 3. This indicates that cancer patients hold a positive attitude toward VR-based emotional regulation interventions. Perceived usefulness, usage attitude, social norms, immersion, and personal innovation correlated positively with behavioral intention, while technological anxiety and perceived risk showed negative correlations. Findings support 15 hypotheses, offering theoretical backing for VR technology in emotional regulation for cancer patients. These insights provide medical institutions with valuable data on patient attitudes, facilitating the development of targeted treatment approaches.
40204806	Mapping the extracellular molecular architecture of the pAg-signaling complex with α-Butyrophilin antibodies.	Target cells trigger Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation by signaling the intracellular accumulation of phospho-antigen metabolites (pAgs) through Butyrophilin (BTN)-3A1 and BTN2A1 to the Vγ9Vδ2 T cell receptor (TCR). An incomplete understanding of the molecular dynamics in this signaling complex hampers Vγ9Vδ2 T cell immunotherapeutic efficacy. A panel of engineered α-BTN3A1 and α-BTN2A1 antibody (mAb) reagents was used to probe the roles of BTN3A1 and BTN2A1 in pAg signaling. Modified α-BTN3A1 mAbs with increased inter-Fab distances establish that tight clustering of BTN3A1 is not necessary to stimulate Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation, and that antagonism may occur through occlusion of a critical binding interaction between BTN3A1 and a yet unknown co-receptor. Finally, a panel of additional α-BTN2A1 antagonists utilize different biophysical mechanisms to compete with Vγ9Vδ2 TCRs for BTN2A1 binding. The complex structures of BTN2A1 ectodomain and Fabs from three antagonist mAbs provide molecular insights into BTN2A1 epitopes critical for pAg-signaling.
40204805	The impact of biological variables on cell kinetics and differentiation dynamics in the mouse incisor epithelium.	The mouse incisor is a key model system for understanding the regulatory mechanisms governing dental stem cells (SCs). However, the effects of sex, age and strain on mouse incisor morphology and epithelial SC function remain unclear. We used micro-computed tomography and histology to analyze the apical region in males and females, two age groups, and two commonly used strains. Cell kinetics, enamel density, and volume were assessed to determine their impact on SC behavior and enamel properties. No differences were found in cell kinetics or enamel properties between male and female mice at 8 weeks of age. However, 3-week-old mice exhibited higher cell proliferation, lower enamel density, and reduced volume than 8-week-olds, highlighting age-dependent changes in SC activity and enamel formation. Additionally, strain-specific variations were observed, with ICR mice showing increased numbers of preameloblasts and higher enamel volume with lower density when compared to C57BL/6 mice at 8 weeks old. Our results establish a standardized framework for the examination of mouse incisor epithelial SCs. These standards will enhance research reproducibility and consistency, facilitate constructive critique by reviewers, and enable a deeper understanding of the complex factors influencing SC behavior across diverse physiological contexts.
40204804	Spike-phase coupling of subthalamic neurons to posterior perisylvian cortex predicts speech sound accuracy.	Speech provides a rich context for understanding how cortical interactions with the basal ganglia contribute to unique human behaviors, but opportunities for direct human intracranial recordings across cortical-basal ganglia networks are rare. Here we have recorded electrocorticographic signals in the cortex synchronously with single units in the basal ganglia during awake neurosurgeries where participants spoke syllable repetitions. We have discovered that individual subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons have transient (200 ms) spike-phase coupling (SPC) events with multiple cortical regions. The spike timing of STN neurons is locked to the phase of theta-alpha oscillations in the supramarginal and posterior superior temporal gyrus during speech planning and production. Speech sound errors occur when this STN-cortical interaction is delayed. Our results suggest that timely interactions between the STN and the posterior perisylvian cortex support auditory-motor coordinate transformation or phonological working memory during speech planning. These findings establish a framework for understanding cortical-basal ganglia interaction in other human behaviors, and additionally indicate that firing-rate based models are insufficient for explaining basal ganglia circuit behavior.
40204802	Leaf drought and heat tolerance are integrated across three temperate biome types.	Leaf-scale heat and drought tolerance provide direct measures of the ability to withstand environmental stress and can be used to evaluate plant susceptibility to emerging climatic extremes. However, recent droughts increasingly occur with heatwaves, causing plants to withstand two simultaneous environmental stresses. Tolerance of leaf-level processes to heat and drought stress have mostly been studied independently, preventing an understanding of whether tolerance co-occurs for these two environmental stresses. To address this, we measured leaf photosynthetic heat tolerance as the critical temperatures at which photosystem II efficiency starts to decrease (T<sub>crit</sub>) and shows a decrease of 50% (T<sub>50</sub>) or 95% (T<sub>95</sub>) in three temperate biomes (desert, oak-pine forest, and mediterranean-type shrubland). We also characterized drought tolerance as the water potential at leaf turgor loss point (π<sub>tlp</sub>) and cellular membrane stability in response to simulated drought. We found coordination of heat and drought tolerance through a significant relationship of π<sub>tlp</sub> with T<sub>50</sub> and T<sub>crit</sub> that varied with season, whereas T<sub>95</sub> showed no relation to π<sub>tlp</sub>. Species with greater drought tolerance also showed greater membrane stability, implicating membrane leakiness as a potential mechanism of physiological decline during stress. Despite local variation in temperature and precipitation extremes, leaf heat and drought tolerance converged to common cross-biome relationships, providing evidence of interdependence that spanned distinct climates.
40204800	Exploring the feasibility and effectiveness of a naturalistic family centered intervention to enhance early interactions in toddlers with Down syndrome.	This study analyses the feasibility and effectiveness of BabyMICARE, a manualised intervention programme aimed at improving the interactions between caregivers and infants and toddlers with Down syndrome. The programme's goal is to enhance caregivers' sensitivity and reduce directivity during early interactions, particularly during play and daily routines. A pre-test and post-test design was used with 40 dyads of infants with Down syndrome and their caregivers, who were divided into a control group (n = 20) and an intervention group (n = 20), based on baseline scores in key interaction subscales. Sessions were conducted over 10 weeks by trained psychologists. Parent-infant interaction was assessed using the MACI coding system, which measures aspects such as sensitive responsiveness, directivity and the level of reciprocity between the parent and the child. The programme showed high feasibility, with a 100% attendance rate but some rescheduling. Caregivers evaluated it positively. The intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in five of eight MACI scales, particularly in sensitive responsiveness and nondirectiveness, while no changes were observed in the control group. The results suggest that BabyMICARE is a feasible and effective intervention for promoting more responsive, less directive interactions, which may be crucial in fostering children's development.
40204799	Voice biomarkers as prognostic indicators for Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques.	Many people suffer from Parkinson's disease globally, a complicated neurological condition caused by the deficiency of dopamine, an organic chemical responsible for regulating movement in individuals. Patients with Parkinson face muscle stiffness or rigidity, tremors, vocal impairment, slow movement, loss of facial expressions, and problems with balance and coordination. As there is no cure for Parkinson, early diagnosis can help prevent the progression of this disease. The study explores the potential of vocal measures as significant indicators for early prediction of Parkinson. Different machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT) are used to detect Parkinson using voice measures and differentiate between the healthy and Parkinson patients. The dataset contains 195 vocal recordings from 31 patients. The Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) is used for handling class imbalance to improve the performance of the models. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was used for feature selection. The study uses different parameters to evaluate the model's classification results. The results highlight RF as the most effective model with an accuracy of 94% and a precision of 94%. In addition, SVM achieves an accuracy score of 92%, and precision of 91%. However, with the PCA method, SVM achieves an accuracy of 89%, 92%, and 87% for RF and DT respectively. This study highlights the significance of using vocal features along with advanced machine learning methods to reliably diagnose Parkinson's disease, considering the challenges associated with early detection.
40204798	Predicting diabetic kidney disease with serum metabolomics and gut microbiota.	This study aims to identify biomarkers for reliably predicting diabetic kidney disease (DKD), systematically characterize serum metabolites and gut microbiota in DKD patients, and investigate the correlation between differential serum metabolites and gut microbiota. From September 2021 to January 2023, 90 subjects were recruited: 30 with DKD, 30 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 30 normal controls (NCs). Serum metabolites, including 180 different metabolites, were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics UPLC-MS/MS, and gut microbiota were assessed via 16S rRNA sequencing. Differential metabolites were identified through univariate (t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.05) and multivariate analyses (OPLS-DA model, VIP > 1, P < 0.05), followed by selection using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The selected overlapping serum metabolites, along with DKD-associated differential gut microbiota, were used to develop a logistic regression prediction model for DKD based on six markers. In the DKD group compared to the DM and NC groups, 39 and 60 differential serum metabolites were identified, respectively (VIP > 1, P < 0.01). Among these, 36 serum metabolites, including alpha-Hydroxyisobutyric acid, were significantly elevated in DKD patients compared to those with DM. Of these, 28 metabolites showed a negative correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), while 29 showed a positive correlation with urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR). Patients with DKD were further categorized into subgroups (DKD middle and DKD early) based on eGFR (eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>), revealing 23 differential metabolites. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota was evident in DKD patients, with lower relative abundances of g_Prevotella and g_Faecalibacterium compared to the DM and NC groups. Subgroup analysis indicated decreased relative abundances of g_Prevotella and g_Faecalibacterium in the DKD middle group, along with a decrease in g_Klebsiella compared to the DKD early group, which correlated positively with DKD patients' eGFR. There were 11 common metabolites among the three groups of differential metabolites. Among these, three serum metabolites-imidazolepropionic acid, adipoylcarnitine, and 1-methylhistidine-were identified as predictive serum metabolic markers. Disease prediction models (logistic regression models) were constructed based on these three metabolites combined with three genera of bacteria. These models demonstrated strong discriminatory power for diagnosing patients with DKD compared to patients with DM (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.939 and precision-recall curve (AUPR) = 0.940). The models also effectively discriminated between patients with DKD and NCs (0.976, 0.973). This study revealed distinctive serum metabolites and gut microbiota in patients with DKD. It demonstrated the potential utility of three specific serum metabolites and three genera of bacteria in diagnosing patients with DKD and assessing their renal dysfunction.
40204797	Investigating the impact of glycated hemoglobin levels on stroke severity in patients with acute ischemic stroke.	Stroke is a sudden neurological decline caused by cerebrovascular diseases or impaired blood circulation. Research investigating the connection between glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and stroke severity is limited. This study examined the connection between HbA1c levels and stroke severity in patients with acute ischemic stroke. A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the medical records of 1103 patients with acute ischemic stroke from January 2020 to January 2024 was conducted. Patients were divided into seven groups on the basis of their HbA1c levels. Stroke severity within these groups was assessed via the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), with the aim of identifying correlations between stroke severity and glycemic status. This study examined the impact of various HbA1c levels on a range of demographic and clinical characteristics in stroke patients. The patients were grouped into seven categories on the basis of their HbA1c levels, and characteristics such as age; body mass index (BMI); LDL, HDL, and creatinine levels; and NIHSS scores at hospital admission were compared across these groups. Significant differences were observed in age, LDL levels (F = 3.999, P < 0.001), and creatinine levels (F = 1.303, P = 0.253) among the HbA1c categories. However, there were no significant differences in BMI, HDL levels, or length of hospital stay. A positive correlation was found between HbA1c levels and NIHSS scores, indicating that higher HbA1c levels are associated with greater stroke severity. This study revealed that the risk of severe stroke increases significantly when HbA1c levels exceed 6.5%. In contrast, maintaining HbA1c levels below 6.5% is linked to a reduced risk of severe stroke and lower mortality. Additionally, older adults are at greater risk and tend to experience more severe strokes.
40204796	Spatial mechanisms of quality control during chaperone-mediated assembly of the proteasome.	Cellular protein degradation requires a complex molecular machine, the proteasome. To mitigate the fundamental challenge of assembling the 66-subunit proteasome, cells utilize dedicated chaperones to order subunit addition. However, recent evidence suggests that proteasome assembly is not simply a series of subunit additions, but each step may be scrutinized so that only correct assembly events advance to proteasomes. Here, we find an unexpected mechanism of quality control (QC) during proteasome assembly-via the proteasomal nuclear localization signal (NLS). This mechanism specifically sequesters defective assembly intermediates to the nucleus, away from ongoing assembly in the cytoplasm, thereby antagonizing defective proteasome formation. This NLS, a bona fide proteasomal component, provides continuous surveillance throughout proteasome assembly. Even a single incorrect event activates spatial QC. Our findings illuminate a two-decade-old mystery in proteasome regulation; proteasomal NLSs, dispensable for proteasome localization, instead provide QC by compartmentalizing assembly defects to ensure that only correct proteasomes form.
40204795	Genome editing in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 cells improves Golgi apparatus structure.	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by repeat expansion of the CAG trinucleotide within exon 10 of the ATXN3 gene. This mutation results in the production of an abnormal ataxin-3 protein containing an extended polyglutamine tract, referred to as mutant ataxin-3. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing for SCA3. First, we designed a specific single-guide RNA targeting the ATXN3 gene and constructed the corresponding targeting vector. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a SCA3 patient were then electroporated with the CRISPR/Cas9 components. Positive clones were screened and validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing to obtain genome-editing iPSCs (GE-iPSCs). Subsequently, the pluripotency of GE-iPSCs was confirmed, and the effects of genome editing on mutant ataxin-3 protein expression and Golgi apparatus morphology were assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses. Our results demonstrated that targeted insertion of polyadenylation signals (PAS) upstream of the abnormal CAG repeats effectively suppressed the production of mutant ataxin-3. This intervention also reduced the formation of neuronal nuclear inclusions in differentiated neurons, restored the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus (which exhibited a loose and enlarged morphology in SCA3 cells), and increased the expression levels of Golgi structural proteins (GM130 and GORASP2). In conclusion, our findings indicate that the targeted insertion of PAS upstream of the abnormal CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene represents a promising therapeutic strategy for SCA3 through genome editing.
40204794	Eliminating nanometer-scale asperities on metallic thin films through plasma modification processes studied by molecular dynamics and AFM.	We report the effects of reducing surface asperity size at the nanometer scale on metallic surfaces by plasma-assisted surface modification processes using simulations and experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted by irradiating various inert gas ions (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) onto a cobalt slab with nanoscale asperities on the surface. The MD simulations showed that as the atomic number of the inert gas increased the surface asperity size was reduced more efficiently, while the etching rate decreased. The dependencies of the scattering behaviors on the inert gas ions originated from the mass exchange between the working gas ions and the slab atoms. Atomic force microscopy and X-ray fluorescence measurements were performed on hard disk media subjected to the surface modification processes. These measurements experimentally demonstrated that the density of nanoscale asperities was reduced with a lower etching rate as the atomic number of the inert gas increased, consistent with the simulation results. Through this study, we clarified that heavier working gases were more effective in reducing surface asperity size without significantly reducing the thickness of the material, which can contribute to better control of surface morphologies at the nanometer scale.
40204793	SwinLightGAN a study of low-light image enhancement algorithms using depth residuals and transformer techniques.	Contemporary algorithms for enhancing images in low-light conditions prioritize improving brightness and contrast but often neglect improving image details. This study introduces the Swin Transformer-based Light-enhancing Generative Adversarial Network (SwinLightGAN), a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that effectively enhances image details under low-light conditions. The network integrates a generator model based on a Residual Jumping U-shaped Network (U-Net) architecture for precise local detail extraction with an illumination network enhanced by Shifted Window Transformer (Swin Transformer) technology that captures multi-scale spatial features and global contexts. This combination produces high-quality images that resemble those taken in normal lighting conditions, retaining intricate details. Through adversarial training that employs discriminators operating at multiple scales and a blend of loss functions, SwinLightGAN ensures a seamless distinction between generated and authentic images, ensuring superior enhancement quality. Extensive experimental analysis on multiple unpaired datasets demonstrates SwinLightGAN's outstanding performance. The system achieves Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) scores ranging from 5.193 to 5.397, Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) scores from 28.879 to 32.040, and Patch-based Image Quality Evaluator (PIQE) scores from 38.280 to 44.479, highlighting its efficacy in delivering high-quality enhancements across diverse metrics.
40204792	Tri-band vehicle and vessel dataset for artificial intelligence research.	The advancement of artificial intelligence has spurred progress across diverse scientific fields, with deep learning techniques enhancing autonomous driving and vessel detection applications. The training of deep learning models relies on the construction of datasets. We present a tri-band (visible, short-wave infrared, long-wave infrared) vehicle and vessel dataset for object detection applications and multi-band image fusion. The dataset consists of thousands of images with JPG and PNG formats, and information including acquisition dates, locations, among others. The features of the dataset are time synchronization and field-of-view consistency. About 60% of the dataset has been manually labeled with object instances to train and evaluate well-established object detection algorithms. After training with YOLOv8 and SSD object detection algorithms, all models have mAP values above 0.6 at an IoU threshold of 0.5, which indicates good recognition performance for this dataset. In addition, a preliminary validation of wavelet-based multi-band image fusion was performed. As far as we know, the dataset is the first publicly available tri-band optical image dataset.
40204790	Long-term physical exercise facilitates putative glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic vessel flow in humans.	Regular voluntary exercise has been shown to increase waste transport through the glymphatic system in mice. Here, we investigate the impact of physical exercise on both upstream and downstream brain waste clearance in healthy volunteers via noninvasive MR imaging. Putative glymphatic influx, evaluated using intravenous contrast-enhanced dynamic T1 mapping, increases significantly at the putamen after 12 weeks of long-term exercise using a cycle ergometer. The putative meningeal lymphatic vessel size and flow, measured by intravenous contrast-enhanced black-blood imaging and IR-ALADDIN technique, increase significantly after long-term exercise. Plasma proteomics reveals significant changes in inflammation-related and immune-related proteins (down-regulated: S100A8, S100A9, PSMA3, and DEFA1A3; up-regulated: J chain) after long-term exercise, which correlate with putative glymphatic influx or mLV flow. Our results suggest that increased glymphatic and mLV flow may be the potential mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of exercise on cognition, highlighting the importance of long-term, regular exercise.
40204789	Integrative analysis of ceRNA networks and immune cell infiltration in thyroid cancer for enhanced diagnostic and prognostic insights.	Thyroid cancer, the most common endocrine malignancy, has seen a significant rise in incidence, necessitating improved diagnostic and prognostic methods. Despite advancements in fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and molecular mutation detection, these techniques have limitations, particularly in large nodules. This study aims to identify molecular markers and construct a comprehensive ceRNA regulatory network to enhance thyroid cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Using transcriptomic data from TCGA, GTEx, and GEO datasets, we performed differential expression analysis and WGCNA to identify key lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs involved in thyroid cancer. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses elucidated the biological functions and pathways of these genes. A ceRNA network was constructed, highlighting the interactions between 32 lncRNAs, 18 miRNAs, and 56 mRNAs. Survival analysis and the Cibersort algorithm further revealed the relationship between ceRNA regulatory networks and immune cell infiltration. A prognostic risk model was developed, incorporating key prognostic genes (PRR15, HCP5, and DUXAP8) and immune cells (resting NK cells, monocytes, M0 macrophages, and activated mast cells). DUXAP8 was positively correlated with activated mast cells and monocytes, while HCP5 was negatively correlated with resting NK cells. This study provides new insights into thyroid cancer pathogenesis, suggesting potential molecular markers for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. Integrating ceRNA regulatory mechanisms with immune cell analysis offers a novel perspective on the tumor microenvironment's role in thyroid cancer progression.
40204788	Longwall panel width design with prediction of the corresponding maximum induced ground surface subsidence.	Longwall mining is one of the most commonly used methods in underground coal mining. With advancing the coalface, the created flexural cracks at panel roof gradually transmit upwards, towards the ground surface that may induce ground surface subsidence. Since the resulting subsidence depends upon the bulking factor of the goaf materials, a new equation to estimate the initial fractured bulking factor has been first proposed. Then, the paper continues to present two more new analytical methods for a suitable longwall panel width design and subsequently to predict the corresponding maximum induced ground surface subsidence. To investigate the impact of the parameters incorporated into the new developed methods, a sensitivity analysis was carried out. The effects of parameters including; extracted coal seam thickness, depth of cover, angle of draw, initial and ultimate bulking factors have also been examined and evaluated. The present proposed methods have been compared with the current comparable methods and then verified with the results of in-situ measurements for both subcritical and critical/ supercritical panel widths. Finally, it has been concluded that the present proposed analytical methods can reliably be used to design a longwall panel width and to predict the corresponding maximum induced ground surface subsidence.
40204787	Bifurcation analysis and dynamical behavior of novel optical soliton solution of chiral (2 + 1) dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation in telecommunication system.	This study explores in detail the bifurcation and optical solitons of the third-order nonlinear chiral (2 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation (M-fCNLSE) with the M-fractional derivative in nonlinear media. We also discuss the properties of fractional derivatives in this context. Initially, bifurcation theory is utilized to analyze critical points and phase portraits, identifying transitions that give rise to new dynamical behaviors, such as stability shifts or the onset of chaotic motion. The first figure depicts the dynamics of soliton solutions undergoing a saddle-node bifurcation. There are two techniques, namely the polynomial expansion (PE) and the unified solver (US) techniques, that are applied to explore wave propagation in telecommunication systems, nonlinear optics, plasma physics, and quantum mechanics. These methods enable the creation of new optical soliton solutions using hyperbolic, rational, and trigonometric functions. Numerical results, presented in 2D and 3D diagrams, demonstrate the behavior of the solutions. The polynomial expansion technique generates diverse periodic optical soliton solutions, including double-periodic and lump wave solitons. The unified solver technique produces periodic breather waves, double-periodic waves, and other complex wave structures. Additionally, two-dimensional graphs display the effects of the truncated M-fractional parameters for [Formula: see text]. Overall, this investigation and the proposed techniques provide valuable tools for generating precise optical soliton solutions, which have significant applications in optical communications, nonlinear optics, and engineering.
40204786	Phenotypic variability of plant architecture, easy destemming, and yield for accelerated selection for mechanical harvestability in chile pepper.	In recent years, chile pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) production in the US has shown a decline due to higher costs associated with manual harvesting and unavailability of skilled labor. Chile pepper breeding programs have incorporated mechanization as a long-term breeding objective alongside historically significant traits such as yield, disease resistance, and fruit quality. Nevertheless, information on the genetic landscape of traits crucial for chile pepper mechanization and their relationships with other agronomic traits remain limited. This study employed multivariate approaches, phenotypic and genetic correlations, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate the genetic architecture of mechanical harvestability traits using a diverse C. annuum L. population evaluated in field conditions in New Mexico, USA. Fruit morphology and fruit destemming force were the most discriminating traits that accounted for most of the observed phenotypic variation in the population. Medium to high narrow-sense heritability estimates (0.53-1.0) indicated the predominance of additive genetic effects for traits relevant for mechanical harvesting. Negative genetic correlations (r<sub>g</sub>; -0.28 to -0.67) were observed between fruit destemming force and plant architecture traits demonstrating the challenge in breeding New Mexican pod type chile peppers suitable for mechanical harvesting. Ten genotypes identified through HCA were further validated for mechanization potential using PCA. These genotypes could be used as potential parental lines in breeding programs aimed at developing chile pepper varieties amenable to mechanical harvest. The findings of the study provide valuable insights to breeders on the genetic architecture of traits critical for mechanization, thereby aiding informed decision-making and improving breeding and selection accuracy for the development of new mechanically harvestable chile pepper cultivars.
40204785	Trend analysis of antidepressant consumption in Italy from 2008 to 2022 in a public health perspective.	Depression is an important public health issue. Over the years, the consumption of antidepressants has increased in the population, which on one hand may mean increased diagnostic accuracy, but on the other could mean a problem of inappropriate consumption and prescribing. The aim of the study is to analyze trends in antidepressant consumption and major drug classes in Italy in the last 15 years to provide useful public health insights for policymakers. Data were collected from Osservasalute and OsMed reports from 2008 to 2022. We included the overall consumption of antidepressants and the three subclasses of the most widely used antidepressant drugs: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Data were expressed as the daily defined dose (DDD) per 1,000 inhabitants. A joinpoint analysis was conducted for each data point in order to describe the trend and identify the Annual Percentage Change (APC) and the Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC). In Italy, there was an increase in antidepressant consumption of 36.7% over the period. Overall, Joinpoint analysis shows a significant AAPC of + 2.31%. Analyzing the subclasses also showed a significant increase in the consumption of SSRIs (AAPC = 1.46%) and SNRIs (AAPC = + 2.14%). In contrast, there was a significant decrease in the consumption of TCAs (AAPC = - 1.46%). The trend of antidepressant use has been increasing steadily over the considered period. Public Health plays a key role in proposing solutions to improve the mental health of the population. Targeted interventions must be carried out to raise awareness among policy makers, clinicians and the population.
40204784	Antibacterial property of hydroxyapatite extracted from biological sources and doped with Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Ag<sup>+</sup> by Sol-gels method.	Hydroxyapatite is used in dental materials such as fillings, veneers, and implants due to its biocompatibility and similarity to the natural tooth structure. Goat teeth contain a high amount of hydroxyapatite, the primary mineral component of tooth enamel. Hydroxyapatite in goat tooth enamel ranges from 70 to 90%, sheep teeth from 75 to 85%, and cow teeth from 60 to 75% by weight. Sheep and Cow teeth have slightly lower hydroxyapatite content compared to goats, which is due to slight differences in their species. Hydroxyapatite can be modified or combined with other compounds (metals) to become a compound with high antibacterial properties, which have various applications in dentistry and medicine. This study aims to extract HA particles from the teeth of domestic animals (goats, sheep, and cows), especially goats (higher hydroxyapatite) in a shorter period, purer and with a simpler and more economical method and without adding chemical compounds containing Phosphate was compared to other methods and HA extracted from goat teeth ash was doped with copper and silver metal ions (HA-Doped Cu<sup>2+</sup>-Ag<sup>+</sup>) and showed high antibacterial properties. The ideal temperature for calcining HA is 1150 °C for 2 h. The physical properties of extracted HA and HA-Doped Cu<sup>2+</sup>-Ag<sup>+</sup> were investigated using X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). It was observed in SEM that the distribution of diameter and size is different depending on the molar ratio of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Ag<sup>+</sup>. According to the XRD report, copper metals entered the network and silver metal was placed around the hydroxyapatite. Antibacterial activity was effective using agar and tube diffusion methods. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum antibacterial concentration (MBC) were determined. HA doped with copper and silver is an effective antibacterial agent. It proves to be the most effective antibacterial agent in biomedical applications and is compatible with all bacterial strains.
40204783	Genetic susceptibility to recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in an African population from Nairobi, Kenya.	Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) affects 75% of women worldwide at least once in their lifetime, with up to 9% of women experiencing recurrent episodes (RVVC). Genetic differences may play a role in women developing recurrent VVC infections. Thus, we investigated genetic host factors that may increase the risk of RVVC in women from an African population. We conducted a case-control study in women in Nairobi Kenya, to identify genetic risk factors for RVVC. Our genome-wide association study compared women with RVVC (n = 174) to those with acute VVC (n = 157), and with controls (n = 347). The control group included both symptomatic but uninfected women (n = 246) and asymptomatic/healthy women (n = 101). We identified several genomic variants linked to increased RVVC susceptibility (P < 10<sup>-5</sup>), with the key ones being SNP rs8181503 found near the MS4A12 gene (P = 9.28 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, odds ratio (OR) = 0.46), and SNP rs58936172 located near the TMEM39A gene (P = 8.96 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, OR = 2.42). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of genetic variants linked to increased risk of RVVC in genes involved in metabolic, disease signalling, and cell adhesion pathways. These included pathways related to gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, pentose phosphate, chemotaxis, and fibroblast growth factor signalling pathways. The genes and pathways identified in our study may help to understand the susceptibility to RVVC in African populations, to improve patient care.
40204782	Multiple cAMP/PKA complexes at the STIM1 ER/PM junction specified by E-Syt1 and E-Syt2 reciprocally gates ANO1 (TMEM16A) via Ca<sup>2</sup>.	ANO1 plays a crucial role in determining numerous physiological functions, including epithelial secretion, yet its regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we describe a fundamental dynamic regulation of ANO1 surface expression and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating via the cAMP/PKA pathway at the STIM1 ER/PM junctions. At these junctions, STIM1 assembles AC-AKAP-PKA complexes, while E-Syt1 mediates formation of ANO1-VAPA-IRBIT-E-Syt1-AC8-AKAP5-PKA complex, that phosphorylates ANO1 S673, increasing ANO1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity. Within these complexes, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP pathways act synergistically to enhance ANO1 function. By contrast, E-Syt2 dissociates the ANO1-VAPA interaction, forming ANO1-IRBIT-E-Syt2-AC6-AKAP11-PKA complex that phosphorylates ANO1 S221, which markedly reduces ANO1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity. The effects of the E-Syts are primarily mediated by their reciprocal regulation of junctional PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdSer. Accordingly, IRBIT deletion in mice impairs receptor-stimulated activation of ANO1 and fluid secretion. These findings should have broad implications for ANO1 roles and functions across various tissues.
40204781	Comparison of marker-less 2D image-based methods for infant pose estimation.	In this study we compare the performance of available generic- and specialized infant-pose estimators for a video-based automated general movement assessment (GMA), and the choice of viewing angle for optimal recordings, i.e., conventional diagonal view used in GMA vs. top-down view. We used 4500 annotated video-frames from 75 recordings of infant spontaneous motor functions from 4 to 16 weeks. To determine which pose estimation method and camera angle yield the best pose estimation accuracy on infants in a GMA related setting, the error with respect to human annotations and the percentage of correct key-points (PCK) were computed and compared. The results show that the best performing generic model trained on adults, ViTPose, also performs best on infants. We see no improvement from using specific infant-pose estimators over the generic pose estimators on our infant dataset. However, when retraining a generic model on our data, there is a significant improvement in pose estimation accuracy. This indicates limited generalization capabilities of infant-pose estimators to other infant datasets, meaning that one should be careful when choosing infant pose estimators and using them on infant datasets which they were not trained on. The pose estimation accuracy obtained from the top-down view is significantly better than that obtained from the diagonal view (the standard view for GMA). This suggests that a top-down view should be included in recording setups for automated GMA research.
40204779	Activation of notch signaling pathway is a potential mechanism for mucin2 reduction and intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction in high-altitude hypoxia.	High-altitude hypoxia can cause gastrointestinal issues and damage the intestinal mucosal barrier, which is crucial for digestion and nutrient absorption. The Notch signaling pathway affects this barrier's integrity. This study explores the Notch pathway's role in hypoxia-induced intestinal injury. C57BL/6 mice were used to model intestinal mucosal barrier injury through dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and hypobaric hypoxia (simulating 5000 m altitude for 7 days). Mice were treated with Notch inhibitor Dibenzazepine (DBZ) and Mucin2 (MUC2) activator Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>). We evaluated weight, colon length, histology, Zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and Claudin-1 levels, MUC2 and Notch1 staining, serum diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactate (D-La), inflammatory markers, and Notch pathway proteins. DSS and hypoxia caused weight loss, colon shortening, ulcers, and inflammation, with fewer goblet cells and lower MUC2 levels. Elevated serum DAO, D-La, and inflammatory markers indicated severe intestinal damage. DBZ treatment post-DSS and hypoxia significantly reduced these symptoms. PGE<sub>2</sub> activation of MUC2 also alleviated symptoms and mitigated intestinal damage. Hypoxia worsens DSS-induced mucosal barrier disruption by activating the Notch pathway, shifting stem cell differentiation towards absorptive cells instead of goblet cells, reducing MUC2 secretion, and intensifying damage. Targeting the Notch pathway and enhancing MUC2 expression could effectively treat hypoxia-induced intestinal injury.
40204778	Bireociclib plus fulvestrant for HR+/HER2- advanced female breast cancer progressed on or after endocrine therapy: phase 3 BRIGHT-2 study interim analysis.	The BRIGHT-2 study (NCT05077449) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bireociclib plus fulvestrant (BF) vs. placebo plus fulvestrant (F) in Chinese female patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) who had progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy (ET). Interim results were analyzed after 70% of progression-free survival (PFS) events across 64 centers in China between December 8, 2021, and March 28, 2023. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive BF or F, with stratification based on visceral involvement (yes/no) and resistance to prior primary or secondary ET. As the primary outcome, PFS was significantly prolonged in the BF group (n = 204) (12.94 months; 95% CI: 11.07-not reached) compared to 7.29 months (95% CI: 5.45-11.04) in the F group (n = 101) (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39-0.80; p = 0.001). The objective response rate in the BF group was 39.7% in the intention-to-treat population. Grade ≥3 adverse events were more frequent in the BF group (64.7%) than in the F group (18.8%), with neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia being the most common. These findings suggest that BF is a promising therapeutic option for patients with HR+/HER2- ABC following ET failure.
40204777	Long-term expansion of basal cells and the novel differentiation methods identify mechanisms for switching Claudin expression in normal epithelia.	Epithelia are tightly connected cellular sheets, that shield our body from the external environment. They are continuously maintained by a pooled population of undifferentiated cells through differentiation. However, the maintenance mechanisms remain incompletely understood due to the difficulty of experimentally observing the differentiation process. To address this issue, we developed a culture method for long-term expansion of primary mammary basal cells with a set of compounds, that includes undifferentiated cells. An effective differentiation method regarding Claudin expression was also developed by simply removing compounds. To verify this differentiation-switching technique, we obtained microarray data comparing each differentiation state. Subsequent cellular analysis confirmed key transcription factors in each state: (1) EGR1 in undifferentiated basal cells is important for suppressing Claudin expression through maintaining the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor TWIST1, (2) ELF3 in differentiated cells is important for actin organization and subsequent Claudin localization at the cell-cell border, that corresponds to the amount of GRHL3, an actin organizer. Their relevance was also observed in tissues and organoids. In summary, we present an effective tool for verifying molecular mechanisms that determine Claudin status in normal basal cell differentiation, that would be beneficial in epithelial cell biology, cancer biology, physiology, and regeneration research.
40204776	Integrating bioinformatics with experimental validation unveils immunological and prognostic significance of PVRIG in pan-cancer.	The poliovirus receptor-related immunoglobulin domain-containing protein (PVRIG) is a recently identified immune checkpoint receptor predominantly expressed on natural killer and CD8 + T cells. This study investigated the role of PVRIG in the tumor immune microenvironment and its prognostic significance across various cancers. Using bioinformatics analyses, the study revealed that PVRIG expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, immune modulator gene expression, clinical outcomes, CD8 + T cell functionality, and responses to immunotherapies and targeted treatments. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that PVRIG plays a critical role in regulating CD8 + T cell functionality. These findings suggest that PVRIG could serve as a biomarker for prognosis and immune infiltration, as well as a promising target for novel cancer immunotherapies.
40204775	Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles green synthesized with Bunium persicum essential oil.	This study evaluated the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles containing Bunium persicum (Boiss.) B. Fedtsch. essential oil synthesized using a green method. The analyses were conducted with three replications using a completely randomized methodology. The means were compared using Duncan's multiple range test at a significance level of 5% using SPSS version 22 statistical software. In the microbial test, the antimicrobial property of zinc oxide nanoparticles with cumin essential oil was significantly higher than that of B. persicum (Boiss.) B. Fedtsch. essential oil in both disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods (p < 0.05). In addition, zinc oxide nanoparticles with B. persicum (Boiss.) B. Fedtsch. essential oil had the most significant effect on Candida Albicans yeast, then on the gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, and finally on the gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria. Zinc oxide nanoparticles combined with B. persicum (Boiss.) B. Fedtsch. essential oil showed a better result than B. persicum (Boiss.) B. Fedtsch. essential oil in measuring the amount of total phenolic compounds (p < 0.05). In the test of particle size and dispersion index, there was a significant difference in the samples (p < 0.05). The lowest particle size and particle size dispersion index were related to the sample of zinc oxide nanoparticles with B. persicum (Boiss.) B. Fedtsch. essential oil.
40204774	Differences in the insulin counterregulatory hormones between obese and nonobese male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Obesity is associated with both high and low levels of hypoglycemia, and impairment of counterregulatory hormones may predispose individuals to hypoglycemia. This study aimed to explore differences in the responsiveness of insulin counterregulatory hormones to hypoglycemia between men with or without obesity who have been newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study enrolled 25 men newly diagnosed with T2DM who were hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism between January 2022 and December 2022. All participants were treated with intensive insulin pump therapy to achieve glycemic control within one week, then a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp was used to evaluate insulin counter-regulatory hormones for hypoglycemia. Based on the body mass index, 10 and 15 patients were included in the obese and nonobese groups, respectively. During the hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp test, the obese group showed a significant lower multiple of adrenocorticotropic hormone elevation than the nonobese group (P = 0.040). Regarding the proportion of hormone response multiples reaching the target, those who reached the reaction multiple were lower in the obese group than those in the non-obese group, although the differences were not statistically significant (all P > 0.05). The responses of insulin counterregulatory hormones to hypoglycemia in men with obesity and newly diagnosed T2DM were significantly lower than those in men with T2DM but without obesity.
40204772	Association between clonal hematopoiesis and periodontitis: a two-sample mendelian randomization study.	Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an age-associated phenomenon characterized by the proliferation of blood cells carrying somatic mutations. Recent studies suggest a potential link between CH and periodontitis, but the causal relationship remains unclear. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was implemented, examining whether CH phenotypes are causally associated with periodontitis. CH phenotypes included overall clonal hematopoiesis (CH-overall), CH with a DNMT3A mutation (CH-DNMT3A), CH with a TET2 mutation (CH-TET2), large clones (CH-large), and small clones (CH-small). Genetic instruments were derived from genome-wide association studies, and the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was the primary analytical approach. Sensitivity analyses and reverse MR were also performed to ensure robustness. MR analysis demonstrated a significant association between CH-DNMT3A and periodontitis (odds ratio: 0.084, 95% CI: 0.007-0.972, P = 0.047), suggesting a protective role. No significant associations were found for other CH phenotypes. Reverse MR analyses showed no statistical evidence of a bidirectional relationship between periodontitis and any CH phenotype. Additionally, the analyses showed no signs of pleiotropy or heterogeneity that could confound the results. Our findings suggest a novel protective role for DNMT3A-mutated CH in periodontitis. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying this association.
40204771	Isotopic data reveal a localist Roman population in late Roman Albintimilium, Liguria.	This study investigates human diet and mobility to understand the socio-economic organisation of a Late Roman community in Liguria, a transitional region between Italy and Gaul, during the 3rd-5th century CE. By combining archaeological, historical, osteological, and isotopic data with novel Bayesian modelling of multi-isotope data (collagen δ<sup>13</sup>C, δ<sup>15</sup>N, bioapatite <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr) from human and animal skeletal remains, as well as modern plant samples, we provide new insights into this hitherto under-researched region. Our findings suggest the community followed a C<sub>3</sub>-based diet, heavily reliant on plant resources and carbohydrates, supplemented by animal protein, likely from omnivorous pigs. This characteristically Roman diet contrasts with ancient written sources that claimed Ligurians had a "barbarian" diet and lifestyle. We also identified significant sex-based dietary differences, with men consuming more animal-derived protein than women, reflecting traditional Graeco-Roman societal ideals. Although the overall dietary pattern aligns with Roman norms, there is no isotopic evidence of long-distance migration or consumption of significant amounts of imported food. This indicates that the community may have been more localist, prioritising locally available resources over long-distance imports, which is unexpected given the prevalent idea of a large-scale interconnected food network within the Roman Empire.

40204769	Comprehensive evaluation of U-Net based transcranial magnetic stimulation electric field estimations.	Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method to modulate neural activity by inducing an electric field in the human brain. Computational models are an important tool for informing TMS targeting and dosing. State-of-the-art modeling techniques use numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), to produce highly accurate simulation results. However, these methods operate at a high computational cost, limiting real-time integration and high throughput applications. Deep learning (DL) methods, particularly U-Nets, are being investigated for TMS electric field estimations. However, their performance across large datasets and whole-head stimulation conditions has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we develop a DL framework to estimate TMS-induced electric fields directly from an anatomical magnetic resonance image (MRI) and TMS coil parameters. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of our U-Net approach compared to the FEM gold standard. We selected a dataset of 100 MRI scans from a diverse population demographic (ethnic, gender, age) made available by the Human Connectome Project. For each MRI, we generated a FEM head model and simulated the electric fields for 13 TMS coil orientations and 1206 positions (a total of 15,678 coil configurations per participant). We trained a modified U-Net architecture to predict individual TMS-induced electric fields in the brain based on an input T1-weighted MRI scan and stimulation parameters. We characterized the model's performance according to computational efficiency and simulation accuracy compared to FEM using an independent testing dataset. The U-Net results demonstrated an accelerated electric field modeling speed at 0.8 s per simulation (×97,000 times acceleration over the FEM-based approach). Sampling stimulation conditions across the whole brain yielded an average DICE coefficient of 0.71 ± 0.06 mm and an average center of gravity deviation of 7.52 ± 4.06 mm from the FEM-based approach. Our findings indicate that while deep learning has the potential to significantly accelerate electric field predictions, the precision it achieves needs to be evaluated for the specific TMS application.
40204767	A fragment of Calpain-1 cleaved α-Synuclein quantified in serum is upregulated in patients with Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition. One of the unmet medical needs in PD, are tools for better diagnosis, prognosis, and efficacy of treatment, which reflects the disease course of the individual patient. Alpha-Synuclein (α-Synuclein) is a hallmark of synucleinopathies such as PD, where α-Synuclein aggregates are deposited. Calpain-1 is an enzyme, located in the presynaptic terminal, and shown to be active as an early event related to aggregation of α-Synuclein. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a competitive ELISA, targeting a Calpain-1 specific cleavage site of α-Synuclein, named α-Syn-C, and evaluate it in serum from patients diagnosed with PD and comparing to healthy matched donors. A monoclonal antibody was raised against the α-Synuclein fragment generated by cleavage of Calpain-1 and employed in an ELISA assay. The assay was developed, technically evaluated, and quantified in two independent cohorts of patients diagnosed with PD and compared to the healthy donors. The discovery cohort showed α-Syn-C was significantly upregulated in patients with PD compared to healthy donors (p =0.0007), with a diagnostic value of AUC = 0.83. The evaluation cohort showed similar results with an ability to differentiate PD patients from healthy donors (p < 0.0001) with an AUC = 0.85. These findings are exploratory and hypothesis generating, indicating the α-Syn-C biomarker may be useful in managing PD patients, and needs to be validated in larger cohorts and longitudinal studies.
40204766	Lateral flow immunoassay using plasmonic scattering.	The lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is one of the most successful sensing platforms for real-world point-of-care (POC) testing. However, achieving PCR-level sensitivity without compromising the inherent advantages of LFIA, such as rapid and robust operation, affordability, and naked-eye detection, has remained a primary challenge. In this study, a plasmonic scattering-utilising LFIA was proposed, created by transparentising a nitrocellulose membrane and placing a light-absorbing backing card under the membrane. This LFIA minimised the background signal from its matrix, leading to substantially enhanced sensitivity and enabling naked-eye detection of the plasmonic scattering signal from gold nanoparticles without optics. Our plasmonic scattering-utilising LFIA showed an approximately 2600-4400 times higher detection limit compared with that of commercial LFIAs in influenza A assays. In addition, it exhibited 90% sensitivity in clinical validation, approaching PCR-level sensitivity, while commercial LFIAs showed 23-30% sensitivity. The plasmonic scattering-utilising LFIA plays a ground-breaking role in POC diagnostics and significantly boosts follow-up research.
40204765	Vulnerability of Gubernatrix cristata to climate change, anthropogenic pressures, and hybridization threats.	Estimating extinction risk is challenging due to insufficient data on current and future threats. This study develops a framework incorporating the impacts of climate change, anthropogenic pressures, and biotic interactions for assessing extinction risks using the endangered Yellow Cardinal (Gubernatrix cristata) as a case study. Using ecological niche modeling (ENM) with occurrences, climate, and land use data, we projected current and future distributions of G. cristata, identifying key constraints for its occurrence. Field validation through a citizen science initiative contributed new presence records, supporting our model's predictions. Currently, 4.50% of cardinal's suitable areas overlap with areas of high anthropic pressures, while 27.04% are in contact with the hybridizing species Diuca diuca. Future projections predict a 60% shift in the cardinal's distribution, exacerbating its vulnerability due to greater overlap with areas of high anthropic pressures and reduced presence in protected areas. We identified key risk areas on the distribution's periphery, vulnerable to geographic range loss and increased interaction with D. diuca due to climate change. Targeted management actions are recommended to mitigate further degradation. This study illustrates the potential of integrating citizen science, ENM, and anthropogenic and biotic pressures to develop conservation strategies, offering a versatile, universally applicable framework crucial for global biodiversity and conservation efforts.
40204764	Cross-talks between Metabolic and Translational Controls during Beige Adipocyte Differentiation.	Whether and how regulatory events at the translation stage shape the cellular and metabolic features of thermogenic adipocytes is hardly understood. In this study, we report two hitherto unidentified cross-talk pathways between metabolic and translational regulation in beige adipocytes. By analysing temporal profiles of translation activity and protein level changes during precursor-to-beige differentiation, we found selective translational down-regulation of OXPHOS component-coding mRNAs. The down-regulation restricted to Complexes I, III, IV, and V, is coordinated with enhanced translation of TCA cycle genes, engendering distinct stoichiometry of OXPHOS and TCA cycle components and altering the related metabolic activities in mitochondria of thermogenic adipocytes. Our high-resolution description of ribosome positioning unveiled potentiated ribosome pausing at glutamate codons. The increased stalling is attributable to remodelled glutamate metabolism that decreases glutamates for tRNA charging during pan-adipocyte differentiation. The ribosome pauses decrease protein synthesis and mRNA stability of glutamate codon-rich genes, such as actin cytoskeleton-associated genes.
40204763	Comparative diagnostic efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic biopsy and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy for gallbladder tumors.	The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder biopsy (PTGB) with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in the assessment of gallbladder tumors. We conducted a retrospective, single-center study involving 101 patients diagnosed with gallbladder cancer who underwent either PTGB or EUS-FNA between January 2019 and December 2022. The study cohort was divided into two groups: 52 patients underwent PTGB, and 49 underwent EUS-FNA. Clinical data, diagnostic outcomes, patient demographics, and complications were systematically documented. The sensitivity, accuracy, and incidence of complications were evaluated for both groups. The sensitivity and accuracy rates were 94.23% and 94.23% for PTGB compared to 97.82% and 97.96% for EUS-FNA, with no significant difference between the two techniques. However, EUS-FNA was associated with significantly lower rate of adverse reactions (2.04%) compared to PTGB (15.38%). Both PTGB and EUS-FNA exhibited high diagnostic efficacy for gallbladder tumors. However, EUS-FNA demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of complications, making it a compelling alternative to PTGB, especially when percutaneous biopsy is unsuccessful or not feasible. High-quality prospective, multicenter trials are recommended to further validate these findings and to refine biopsy guidelines for gallbladder tumors.
40204762	Multiplexed subspaces route neural activity across brain-wide networks.	Cognition is flexible, allowing behavior to change on a moment-by-moment basis. Such flexibility relies on the brain's ability to route information through different networks of brain regions to perform different cognitive computations. However, the mechanisms that determine which network of regions is active are not well understood. Here, we combined cortex-wide calcium imaging with high-density electrophysiological recordings in eight cortical and subcortical regions of mice to understand the interactions between regions. We found different dimensions within the population activity of each region were functionally connected with different cortex-wide 'subspace networks' of regions. These subspace networks were multiplexed; each region was functionally connected with multiple independent, yet overlapping, subspace networks. The subspace network that was active changed from moment-to-moment. These changes were associated with changes in the geometric relationship between the neural response within a region and the subspace dimensions: when neural responses were aligned with (i.e., projected along) a subspace dimension, neural activity was increased in the associated regions. Together, our results suggest that changing the geometry of neural representations within a brain region may allow the brain to flexibly engage different brain-wide networks, thereby supporting cognitive flexibility.
40204761	Progression of gut microbiome in preterm infants during the first three months.	The colonization and evolution of gut microbiota early in life play a vital role in shaping a healthy, robust immune system for infant health, whether in combating short-term illness or improving long-term health outcomes. Early-life clinical practices may interrupt or disrupt the normal colonization process of the infant gut microbiota, thereby increasing disease susceptibility. In this prospective cohort study, we analyzed the gut microbiota of 46 term and 23 preterm infants using 16S rRNA gene metagenomic sequencing. Fecal samples were collected at six timepoints during the first three months of life. Notably, gestational age was the main factor contributing to differences in the meconium microbial composition. Intriguingly, our study unveiled a more homogeneous microbial composition in preterm infants with more abundant Bifidobacterium from the postnatal age (PNA) of one month. Concurrently, the beneficial bacteria Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus gradually increased, and the potentially pathogenic bacteria Clostridium, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas gradually decreased. Furthermore, our study underscored a link between decreased microbial diversity of preterm infants and exclusive breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure. Moreover, preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) exhibited reduced microbial diversity but higher abundances of Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus mitis.
40204760	An unsupervised map of excitatory neuron dendritic morphology in the mouse visual cortex.	Neurons in the neocortex exhibit astonishing morphological diversity, which is critical for properly wiring neural circuits and giving neurons their functional properties. However, the organizational principles underlying this morphological diversity remain an open question. Here, we took a data-driven approach using graph-based machine learning methods to obtain a low-dimensional morphological "bar code" describing more than 30,000 excitatory neurons in mouse visual areas V1, AL, and RL that were reconstructed from the millimeter scale MICrONS serial-section electron microscopy volume. Contrary to previous classifications into discrete morphological types (m-types), our data-driven approach suggests that the morphological landscape of cortical excitatory neurons is better described as a continuum, with a few notable exceptions in layers 5 and 6. Dendritic morphologies in layers 2-3 exhibited a trend towards a decreasing width of the dendritic arbor and a smaller tuft with increasing cortical depth. Inter-area differences were most evident in layer 4, where V1 contained more atufted neurons than higher visual areas. Moreover, we discovered neurons in V1 on the border to layer 5, which avoided deeper layers with their dendrites. In summary, we suggest that excitatory neurons' morphological diversity is better understood by considering axes of variation than using distinct m-types.
40204759	Hybrid convolutional neural network and bi-LSTM model with EfficientNet-B0 for high-accuracy breast cancer detection and classification.	Breast cancer detection remains one of the most challenging problems in medical imaging. We propose a novel hybrid model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, and EfficientNet-B0, a pre-trained model. By leveraging EfficientNet-B0, which has been trained on the large and diverse ImageNet dataset, our approach benefits from transfer learning, enabling more efficient feature extraction from mammographic images compared to traditional methods that require CNNs to be trained from scratch. The model further enhances performance by incorporating Bi-LSTM, which allows for processing temporal dependencies in the data, which is crucial for accurately detecting complex patterns in breast cancer images. We fine-tuned the model using the Adam optimizer to optimize performance, significantly improving accuracy and processing speed. Extensive evaluation of well-established datasets such as CBIS-DDSM and MIAS resulted in an outstanding 99.2% accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. We also compared our hybrid model to other well-known architectures, including VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet169, using three optimizers: Adam, RMSProp, and SGD. The Adam optimizer consistently achieved the highest accuracy and lowest loss across the training and validation phases. Additionally, feature visualization techniques were applied to enhance the model's interpretability, providing deeper insight into the decision-making process. The Proposed hybrid model sets a new standard in breast cancer detection, offering exceptional accuracy and improved transparency, making it a valuable tool for clinicians in the fight against breast cancer.
40204758	On some counting polynomials and energy properties of superphenalene and supertriphenylene.	In order to generate a wide range of meaningful topological indices, counting polynomials can be utilised in a number of different ways, including explicitly, after calculating derivatives. Certain polynomials, particularly Theta, Omega, Padmakar-Ivan, and Sadhana polynomials, are subservient to the equidistant and non-equidistant edges of graphs. Such polynomials have a wide range of applications, including the computation of the topological indices that correspond to them. Counting polynomials and corresponding indices in the context of super-polycyclic aromatic compounds with hexabenzocoronene as a base molecule, including superphenalene and supertriphenylene, refer to mathematical representations that encode structural information about the molecules. In addition, we have been able to acquire the spectral and energetic characteristics of these structures, which include the HOMO-LUMO gaps, bond delocalisation energies, and 13C NMR patterns.
40204757	An in vivo microscopy dataset for the characterization of leukocyte death.	Recent advancements in intravital microscopy have enabled the study of cell death in vivo under various experimental conditions, such as infection and cancer. However, the limited throughput of this technology, together with a lack of openly accessible datasets, affects the development of algorithms for the automatic detection and characterization of cell death, which in turn require the integration of extensive and curated datasets. To address these needs, we present a curated dataset of microscopy videos depicting the death of neutrophils, eosinophils, and dendritic cells, acquired in the spleen and in the lymph node of mice under inflammatory conditions. The dataset provides time-lapse imaging data, along with coordinates in space and time of cell death events displaying apoptotic-like morphodynamics, and 3D reconstruction of the cell morphology at each time point. Altogether, these data will be pivotal for developing computer vision and bioimage analysis methods to advance cell death research.
40204756	Insights into catalytic activity and selectivity of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation on gold single-crystal electrodes.	The selective electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) holds transformative potential for advancing sustainable, bio-based polymer production. In this study, we unveil the pivotal role of gold single-crystal electrode surface orientation in directing HMF oxidation pathways under alkaline conditions. Using cyclic voltammetry, we systematically evaluate the oxidation behavior on Au(111), Au(100), Au(110), Au(311), Au(331), and Au(210) surfaces. Our findings reveal that Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces exhibit superior catalytic activity for the complete oxidation to FDCA, while Au(110) promotes the selective formation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA). These differences in activity are closely linked to the crystallographic structure, influencing adsorption energies and reaction intermediates. In situ infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy provide direct molecular insights, identifying distinct vibrational signatures of intermediates and products. This study highlights the critical role of electrode surface structure in tuning reaction efficiency and selectivity, contributing to the development of more efficient catalytic processes in green chemistry.
40204755	Presence of antibiotics in children's urine: a silent risk beyond drinking water.	This study investigated the presence of 32 antibiotic residues in drinking water, their potential association with antibiotic concentrations in children's urine samples, and anthropometric indicators. Water samples were collected from the primary water sources supplying Ilo, Peru (Pacocha and Pampa), and urine samples were analysed from children aged 2 to 10 years using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with triple quadrupole. Five antibiotics were detected in drinking water, with three of these representing a health risk due to high concentrations and risk quotients (RQ): Doxycycline (2.30), Sulfamethoxazole (1.04), and Metronidazole (25.68). Furthermore, there was no correlation between the antibiotics found in drinking water and those detected in urine samples, as the types and quantities of antibiotics differed. In urine samples, 21 antibiotics were detected in children from Pacocha and 19 from Pampa. The antibiotics and anthropometric variables did not show any significant correlation. Principal component analysis revealed that antibiotic profiles were highly similar across both areas, suggesting a shared source of contamination independent of drinking water. It is concerning that 100% of the children have at least three antibiotics in their urine, which could affect their health now and later in life.
40204754	Regulation of FOXL2 gene in ovarian granulosa cell tumor by JNK inhibitor.	To explore the regulatory effect of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125) on forkhead box protein L2 (FOXL2) gene in human ovarian granulosa cell tumor cells (KGN cells). The main pathogenic gene FOXL2 of ovarian cancer was screened by bioinformatics method. KGN cells were randomly divided into control group and experimental group. Different concentrations of SP600125 (0.1, 1, 5, 10, 50 µM) were added to the experimental group, and an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the control group. The cells were incubated for 48 h. Cell RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA. The mRNA expression level of FOXL2 was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Proteins were extracted, and the expression level of FOXL2 protein was detected by Western blot. The proliferation ability of KGN cells treated with SP600125 was detected by MTT assay. Cell scratch assay was used to detect its migration ability. Different concentrations of JNK inhibitor reduced the expression of FOXL2 in ovarian granulosa cells KGN, and 1 µM had the best inhibitory effect. JNK inhibitor reduces the expression of FOXL2 in ovarian granulosa cell tumor KGN.
40204753	Assessment of liver involvement in Wilson's disease with different liver echo patterns based on liver stiffness evaluated on Transient elastography and Sound Touch Viscoelastography.	Wilson's disease (WD) liver damage is caused by abnormal copper deposition in the liver. Whether the degree of hepatic impairment correlates with the severity of liver involvement on ultrasound imaging remains unclear. This study aimed to categorize the liver echo patterns of WD according to the B-ultrasound and correlated the degree of hepatic injury with different liver echo patterns based on Transient elastography (TE) and Sound Touch Viscoelastography (STVi). A retrospective study was conducted on 106 WD patients. A consistency analysis was performed on liver stiffness measurement (LSM) through TE and STVi. The liver echo characteristics of all patients were categorized through B-ultrasound, and the differences in LSM<sub>TE</sub>, LSM<sub>STVi</sub>, demographic and anthropometric data, and serological indicators among different patterns were compared. Both TE and STVi measurements exhibited high consistency in intra-observer and inter-observer differences. There were 6 echo patterns in the liver parenchyma of WD, among which "block-like" fatty liver and nodule patterns were more characteristic. The 6 types of liver echo patterns were classified into three groups: fatty liver pattern, coarse pattern, and nodule pattern. There was no significant difference in age, gender, and body mass index among the three groups. The comparison results of LSM<sub>TE</sub> and LSM<sub>STVi</sub> among the three groups showed that the coarse pattern was higher than the fatty liver pattern, and there was no significant difference between the nodule pattern and the coarse pattern or the fatty liver pattern. The P III N-P of fatty liver and coarse patterns was higher than that of the nodule pattern. Characteristic ultrasound features of liver parenchyma help us diagnose WD. The degree of liver involvement on imaging may not correspond consistently with the actual level of liver damage. STVi can be used as a reliability method to evaluate the degree of WD liver damage quantitatively, and its other application values in WD are worth further exploration.
40204752	MiR-556-3p mediated repression of klotho under oxidative stress promotes fibrosis of renal tubular epithelial cells.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health issue characterized by renal fibrosis, which leads to irreversible tissue damage. Oxidative stress plays a key role in driving the fibrotic processes associated with CKD. This study investigates the roles of oxidative stress, miR-556-3p, and klotho in renal tubular epithelial cells, focusing on their influence on fibrotic pathways. Using human renal tubular epithelial cells HK-2, we conducted various in vitro assays to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, cell death, viability, and proliferation. Oxidative stress, induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, was found to suppress klotho expression while increasing the expression of fibrotic markers. Overexpression of klotho mitigated these effects, highlighting its protective role against oxidative stress-induced fibrosis. Moreover, miR-556-3p was upregulated in response to oxidative stress activated transcription factor Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2), contributing to the suppression of klotho. Inhibition of Nrf2, a key regulator of oxidative stress responses, attenuated the expression of miR-556-3p and fibrotic markers. Targeting the Nrf2-miR-556-3p-klotho axis may offer novel therapeutic avenues to restore klotho levels and attenuate renal fibrosis. Our study contributes significantly to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving CKD progression and highlights potential targets for future pharmacological intervention.
40204751	Visual integration deficits associated with psychosis are independent of diagnosis.	Evidence of altered visual processing is well-established in schizophrenia. Visual integration deficits have been highlighted as a potential diagnostic biomarker to distinguish schizophrenia from other psychiatric disorders. Motivated by the current lack of cross-diagnostic assessments of visual integration performance, the current study used the Jittered Orientation Visual Integration (JOVI) task to assess contour integration performance in 85 psychiatric inpatients split into "schizophrenia spectrum" (n = 40) and "other psychiatric disorders" (n = 45), and healthy controls (n = 43). The study also examined attentional and working memory ability using the Digit Span Task. JOVI accuracy scores were found to be significantly impaired relative to healthy controls for both the schizophrenia (p < 0.001) and other psychiatric (p < 0001) patient groups. In line with a transdiagnostic deficit, no differences in JOVI accuracy were seen between the patient groups (p = 0.97) with reduced JOVI accuracy correlating with worsening psychosis regardless of diagnosis (r = -0.32, p < 0.05). Schizophrenia spectrum patients also showed reduced Digit Span Forward (p < 0.001) and Backward scores (p < 0.001). The other psychiatric (p = 0.024) group were similarly found to be impaired in the Digit Span Backward relative to healthy controls, however no differences were seen between the patient groups. The findings indicate that contour integration deficits are not specific to schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and instead the neurobiological underpinnings of visual integration impairment may share commonality with psychosis more generally. The findings are also consistent with cognitive factors playing a potential role in JOVI performance and highlight the difficulty in teasing apart altered perceptual and cognitive function in psychiatric patient groups.
40204750	Study on the fracture behavior and critical slowing down characteristics of saturated sandstone based on acoustic emission and resistivity.	Water significantly affects the fracture behavior and acoustic emission (AE) characteristics of sandstone, which is crucial for assessing the stability of underground engineering. This study investigates the fracture behavior of four types of saturated sandstone (green, white, brown, and red) using AE and resistivity monitoring techniques during uniaxial compression tests. AE energy, resistivity, and RA-AF parameters were analyzed to comprehensively assess the fracture behavior. Additionally, precursor information of sandstone failure was examined using the critical slowing down theory. The results revealed a decrease in uniaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus in saturated sandstone, with water softening effects ranked as brown, red, white, and green sandstone. Resistivity variation was highly sensitive to fracture development and demonstrated strong complementarity with AE signals. Crack classification based on the RA-AF parameter aligned with macroscopic failure patterns. Water presence accelerated the initiation of tensile cracks, with growth rates of 13.66%, 13.69%, 14.86%, and 17.53%, correlating with porosity and pore water pressure. The sharp increase in the autocorrelation coefficient and variance of AE parameters (amplitude, RA value, rise time, AE energy) before critical failure indicated a critical slowing down phenomenon, serving as a potential precursor to sandstone failure. Moreover, the sensitivity and reliability of critical slowing down theory in early warning applications were affected by water and porosity, which should be considered in practice.
40204749	Elucidating Interfacial Carrier Transfer Dynamics for Circularly Polarized Emission in Self-Assembled Perovskite Heterostructures.	By integrating carrier transfer with spin-selectivity in mixed-dimensional perovskites heterostructures (HSs), exceptional chiroptical behaviors can be activated, offering avenues for advanced applications in spintronics and quantum information technologies. However, the critical role of interface effects in this photophysical process remains insufficiently explored. We demonstrate the fabrication of self-assembled chiral 2D/achiral nanocrystal (NC) HSs with different morphologies and chiroptical activities. Using femtosecond transient reflection spectroscopy, the underlying interface-dependent carrier transfer was unraveled. Spin-polarized holes generated in the chiral 2D component can transfer within an ultrafast time scale of ∼362 fs across the coherent heterointerface, inducing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the intrinsically achiral NCs with a high <i>P</i><sub>c</sub> of ∼10.3%. Furthermore, interfacial halide exchange can be utilized to extend the CPL wavelength from green to near-infrared. Our findings reveal the correlation between interfacial properties, charge transfer, and CPL activity, providing insights for the development of high-quality HSs with optimized optical properties.
40204747	One-class support vector machines for detecting population drift in deployed machine learning medical diagnostics.	Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being applied to diagnose and predict disease, but face technical challenges such as population drift, where the training and real-world deployed data distributions differ. This phenomenon can degrade model performance, risking incorrect diagnoses. Current detection methods are limited: not directly measuring population drift and often requiring ground truth labels for new patient data. Here, we propose using a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) to detect population drift. We trained a OCSVM on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and tested its ability to detect population drift on simulated data. Simulated data was offset at 0.4 standard deviations of the minimum and maximum values of the radius_mean variable, at three noise levels: 5%, 10% and 30% of the standard deviation; 10,000 records per noise level. We hypothesised that increased noise would correlate with more OCSVM-detected inliers, indicating a sensitivity to population drift. As noise increased, more inliers were detected: 5% (27 inliers), 10% (486), and 30% (851). Therefore, this approach could effectively alert to population drift, supporting safe ML diagnostics adoption. Future research should explore OCSVM monitoring on real-world data, enhance model transparency, investigate complementary statistical and ML methods, and extend applications to other data types.
40204746	Unraveling overestimated exposure risks through hourly ozone retrievals from next-generation geostationary satellites.	Accurate ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) estimation is crucial for assessing health impacts and designing control strategies. Traditional polar-orbit satellites provide limited, one-time measurements, missing O<sub>3</sub>'s diurnal variability. Here, we utilize a next-generation geostationary satellite with ultraviolet capabilities to retrieve hourly O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, achieving high accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94) and improving daily maximum 8-hour estimates, particularly in semi-urban areas (R<sup>2</sup> + 0.10, error reduction >7 μg/m³). Our analysis reveals a 30% drop in O<sub>3</sub>-related health risks compared to traditional polar-orbit estimates, with the greatest impact in semi-urban and rural areas where satellite data plays an important role due to the lack of ground measurements. This suggests prior estimates may have overestimated total mortality and urban-rural spillover effects. Our findings underscore the importance of geostationary satellites in capturing O<sub>3</sub> diurnal variability through refined hourly data on photochemical precursors and radiation, providing a scientific basis for health assessments and informing O<sub>3</sub> pollution regulations in China.

40204744	DNA supercoiling-mediated G4/R-loop formation tunes transcription by controlling the access of RNA polymerase.	RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a processive motor that modulates DNA supercoiling and reshapes DNA structures. The feedback loop between the DNA topology and transcription remains elusive. Here, we investigate the impact of potential G-quadruplex forming sequences (PQS) on transcription in response to DNA supercoiling. We find that supercoiled DNA increases transcription frequency 10-fold higher than relaxed DNA, which lead to an abrupt formation of G-quadruplex (G4) and R-loop structures. Moreover, the stable R-loop relieves topological strain, facilitated by G4 formation. The cooperative formation of G4/R-loop effectively alters the DNA topology around the promoter and suppresses transcriptional activity by impeding RNAP loading. These findings highlight negative supercoiling as a built-in spring that triggers a transcriptional burst followed by a rapid suppression upon G4/R-loop formation. This study sheds light on the intricate interplay between DNA topology and structural change in transcriptional regulation, with implications for understanding gene expression dynamics.
40204742	Metagenomic analysis of human, animal, and environmental samples identifies potential emerging pathogens, profiles antibiotic resistance genes, and reveals horizontal gene transfer dynamics.	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global health. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics has accelerated the emergence and spread of drug-resistant bacteria, compromising our ability to treat infectious diseases. A One Health approach is essential to address this urgent issue, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. This study investigated the prevalence and transmission of AMR in a temporary settlement in Kathmandu, Nepal. By employing shotgun metagenomics, we analyzed a diverse range of samples, including human fecal samples, avian fecal samples, and environmental samples. Our analysis revealed a complex interplay of pathogenic bacteria, virulence factors (VF), and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) across these different domains. We identified a diverse range of bacterial species, including potential pathogens, in both human and animal samples. Notably, Prevotella spp. was the dominant gut bacterium in human samples. Additionally, we detected a wide range of phages and viruses, including Stx-2 converting phages, which can contribute to the virulence of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains. Our analysis revealed the presence of 72 virulence factor genes and 53 ARG subtypes across the studied samples. Poultry samples exhibited the highest number of ARG subtypes, suggesting that the intensive use of antibiotics in poultry production may contribute to the dissemination of AMR. Furthermore, we observed frequent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events, with gut microbiomes serving as key reservoirs for ARGs. This study underscores the critical role of a One Health approach in addressing AMR. By integrating human, animal, and environmental health perspectives, we can better understand the complex dynamics of AMR and develop effective strategies for prevention and control. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust surveillance systems, judicious antibiotic use, and improved hygiene practices to mitigate the impact of AMR on public health.
40204741	SnO<sub>2</sub>NPs as a Nontoxic Antiviral Agent for Designing Protective Masks against Human Coronavirus Infection.	The COVID-19 pandemic has created a need to develop protective textiles that reduce the infection of SARS-CoV-2, mainly via face masks. The key issue in designing protective textiles is the functionalization with antiviral agents. This report presents tin oxide nanoparticles (SnO<sub>2</sub>NPs) as a novel, efficient antiviral agent against human coronavirus HCoV 229E due to blocking virus entry, attachment, and penetration into MRC-5 cells and nontoxicity. SnO<sub>2</sub>NPs were obtained by sodium stannate hydrolysis and have a 3 nm diameter, a cubic structure, and a zeta potential of -28.8. SnO<sub>2</sub>NPs were applied to functionalize a protective face mask made of silk fibroin. Polydopamine was applied to immobilize the particles. SnO<sub>2</sub>NPs have a negative potential and enhance silk fabric hydrophobicity, which is crucial for antiviral properties. The mask functionalized with SnO<sub>2</sub>NPs reveals very good antiviral properties and antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Silk fabric functionalized with SnO<sub>2</sub>NPs retains the silk fibroin β-sheet structure, is nontoxic, noncorrosive to human skin, and reveals high thermophysiological wear comfort.The highest filtration efficiency is obtained for the 3-layered mask (60%), while breathing resistance, sufficient for the FFP3 mask, was achieved for the 1-layered mask (maximum allowable breathing of 100 and 300 Pa, respectively, for 30 L/min and 95 L/min inhale and 300 Pa for an exhale flow rate of 160 L/min). SnO<sub>2</sub>NPs can be useful in developing advanced antiviral textile materials to control virus spread and future pandemics.
40204740	Self-disassembling nanoparticles as oral nanotherapeutics targeting intestinal microenvironment.	Inspired by the survival strategies of pyomelanin-producing microbes, we synthesize pyomelanin nanoparticles (PMNPs) from homogentisic acid- γ-lactone via auto-oxidation and investigate their biomedical potential. PMNPs possess distinct physicochemical properties, including reactive oxygen species scavenging and microenvironment-responsive self-disassembly. Under intestinal conditions, PMNPs self-disassemble and penetrate the nanoscale pores of the mucin layer. In an inflammatory bowel disease model, orally administered PMNPs withstand gastric acidity and, in their solubilized form, interact with macrophages and epithelial cells. They significantly reduce reactive oxygen species levels, exert anti-inflammatory effects, and restore gut microbiota composition. Compared to conventional nanoparticles and 5-aminosalicylic acid, PMNPs exhibit greater therapeutic efficacy. Clinical symptoms and intestinal inflammation are alleviated, and the gut microbiota is restored to near-normal levels. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of PMNPs for inflammatory bowel disease treatment and suggest broader biomedical applications.
40204738	Synthesis of benzoheterocycles by palladium-catalyzed migratory cyclization through an unexpected reaction cascade.	Migratory functionalization of C-H bonds through metal migration from carbon to carbon under transition metal catalysis is a process of significant academic and industrial interest. Herein, a palladium-catalyzed migratory cyclization of α-bromoalkene derivatives ArXCBr=CH<sub>2</sub>, in which X denotes a phosphorus (P(O)R), silicon (SiR<sub>2</sub>), sulfur (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon (C(O)), nitrogen (NTs), or oxygen-based moiety, affording various benzoheterocyclic compounds has been developed. Mechanistic investigations have demonstrated that the cyclization reaction proceeds through an unexpected cascade, with trans-1,2-palladium migration between sp<sup>2</sup> carbons being a key step of catalytic cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this type of metal migration has not been reported previously.

40204736	Modified pegRNAs mitigate scaffold-derived prime editing by-products.	Prime editors (PEs) employ reverse transcriptase (RT) to install genomic edits using a template within the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). RT creates a 3' genomic flap containing the intended edit. However, reverse transcription can continue beyond the template, incorporating the pegRNA scaffold sequence into the 3' flap. These scaffold-derived by-products can be installed alongside the intended edit, reducing prime editing precision. Here, we develop a method that prevents RT from accessing the scaffold, thereby mitigating such by-products. We demonstrate that an internal abasic spacer or 2'-O-methylation within the pegRNAs terminates RT at the end of the template. This prevents scaffold-derived sequences from being incorporated into the target locus. We benchmark these pegRNAs in different cell types and demonstrate that they can be used with processive PEs such as PE6d or PE**. Our findings provide a simple approach to mitigate a common prime editing by-product and improve prime editing precision.
40204735	2030 conservation targets for European terrestrial mammals using the favourable conservation status concept.	The European Habitats Directive lists species and habitats of conservation priority for member states of the European Union, and prescribes that they achieve a favourable conservation status. The benchmark for assessing whether species achieve this status is provided by favourable reference values of distribution and population size. These values cannot be used directly as conservation targets, because they are incomplete, incomparable as they are identified through different methods, and not necessarily achievable in a specified time frame. We set conservation targets for the year 2030 for 81 European terrestrial mammals listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive, and/or threatened at European level according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, based on the concept of favourable onservation statuts. We used several methods, including models of population growth and range expansion to 2030, and a reference-based approach. These targets can be used to plan conservation actions for priority mammals, such as increasing protected area coverage to 30% of Europe as envisaged in the European Biodiversity Strategy 2030.
40204733	A high-fructose diet leads to osteoporosis by suppressing the expression of Thrb and facilitating the accumulation of cholesterol.	Osteoporosis is classified as a metabolic syndrome, and the consumption of fructose has been linked to various metabolic diseases. However, the specific effects and underlying mechanisms of fructose on bone health remain inadequately understood. In this study, we demonstrate that fructose intake can exacerbate bone loss in murine models by facilitating the accumulation of cholesterol within the bones. We identify Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta (Thrb) and Protein Kinase C Zeta (Prkcz) as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of osteoporosis. Mice subjected to a high-fructose diet exhibited a reduction in bone density and a decrease in the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) compared to those on a standard diet. Fructose treatment was found to decrease Thrb expression while increasing Prkcz expression, leading to cholesterol accumulation and hindering the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the activation of Thrb and the inhibition of Prkcz significantly ameliorate bone loss in mice. This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which fructose influences osteogenesis through the Thrb/Prkcz/cholesterol accumulation pathway in the context of osteoporosis, thereby highlighting the therapeutic potential of Thrb and Prkcz as targets for osteoporosis treatment.
40204732	D-orbital Reconstruction Achieves Low Charge Overpotential in Li-oxygen Batteries.	Charge overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction is a crucial parameter for the energy conversion efficiency of lithium-oxygen (Li-O<sub>2</sub>) batteries. So far, the realization of low charge overpotential via catalyst design is a grand challenge in this field, which usually exceeds 0.25 V. Herein, we report an orbital reconstruction strategy to significantly decrease the charge overpotential to the low 0.11 V by employing PdCo nanosheet catalyst under a low-loading mass (0.3 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) and capacity (0.3 mAh/cm<sup>2</sup>). Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the precise d-d orbital coupling (d<sub>xz</sub>-d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>-d<sub>yz</sub> and d<sub>z</sub><sup>2</sup>-d<sub>z</sub><sup>2</sup>) between the low-electronegativity Co and Pd leads to the reconstruction of Pd 4 d orbitals in PdCo nanosheets, thereby resulting in a downward shift of all the three active Pd 4 d orbitals (d<sub>z</sub><sup>2</sup>, d<sub>xz</sub> and d<sub>yz</sub>) relative to that of Pd nanosheets. Furthermore, the highest energy level of the Pd 4d<sub>z</sub><sup>2</sup> orbital in PdCo is lower than the lowest energy levels of the Pd 4d<sub>xz</sub> and 4d<sub>yz</sub> orbitals in pure Pd, significantly decreasing the charge activation energy and achieving a highest energy conversion efficiency of 91%. This finding provides the orbital-level tuning into rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries.
40204730	Coding schemes in neural networks learning classification tasks.	Neural networks posses the crucial ability to generate meaningful representations of task-dependent features. Indeed, with appropriate scaling, supervised learning in neural networks can result in strong, task-dependent feature learning. However, the nature of the emergent representations is still unclear. To understand the effect of learning on representations, we investigate fully-connected, wide neural networks learning classification tasks using the Bayesian framework where learning shapes the posterior distribution of the network weights. Consistent with previous findings, our analysis of the feature learning regime (also known as 'non-lazy' regime) shows that the networks acquire strong, data-dependent features, denoted as coding schemes, where neuronal responses to each input are dominated by its class membership. Surprisingly, the nature of the coding schemes depends crucially on the neuronal nonlinearity. In linear networks, an analog coding scheme of the task emerges; in nonlinear networks, strong spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to either redundant or sparse coding schemes. Our findings highlight how network properties such as scaling of weights and neuronal nonlinearity can profoundly influence the emergent representations.
40204729	Real-world evaluation of an intravenous iron service for the treatment of iron deficiency with or without anemia.	Intravenous (IV) iron is a guideline-recommended treatment for iron deficiency when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective, or not tolerated, or when rapid iron delivery is necessary. However, evidence suggests that some patients receive less IV iron than needed. This retrospective audit assessed the effectiveness and safety of ferric derisomaltose (FDI), a high-dose IV iron, in 2,468 patients. Efficacy outcomes assessed at 4-12 weeks post-infusion included changes in hemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin, proportion of courses (a course was defined as the treatment episode required to administer one total dose) after which patients were non-anemic (Hb ≥ 130 g/L [men] or ≥ 120 g/L [women]), and response rate (proportion of courses after which patients were non-anemic or Hb increased by ≥ 20 g/L). Safety was assessed through adverse events. Across 2,775 FDI courses, the mean dose was 1,244 mg, but mean estimated iron need was 1,580 mg. At follow-up, mean Hb had increased by 20.9 g/L and mean ferritin by 188.8 µg/L. Patients were non-anemic after 33.4% (n = 494/1,478) of courses and responded after 65.1% (n = 962/1,478) of courses. One patient (n = 1/2,468; 0.04%) had a serious allergic reaction. Patients remained anemic after > 65% of courses, demonstrating the need to optimize dosing based on iron need.
40204728	Spectral dataset of natural objects' reflectance from the Southern cone of South America.	The reflection in natural objects mediates an important fraction of the light reaching animal photoreceptors. Knowledge of the spectral properties of natural objects is increasingly valuable for different research fields. Measured datasets of natural objects' reflectance can offer insights into fundamental and applied research questions, contributing to investigations from coloration and color vision to color analysis and representation. Thus, datasets of natural objects' reflectance across different locations are crucial to assessing the universality and variability of physical visual inputs in diverse environments. However, the Southern Hemisphere is notably underrepresented in publicly available datasets of natural objects. To address this gap, we present a spectral dataset of natural objects' reflectance from the Southern cone of South America, specifically Northwestern Argentina.

40204725	O-GlcNAcylation of glutaminase isoform KGA inhibits ferroptosis through activation of glutaminolysis in hepatoblastoma.	Hepatoblastoma (HB), the most common pediatric hepatic malignancy, exhibits an increasing incidence. Metabolism reprogramming represents a pivotal hallmark in the oncogenic transformation process, with glutamine emerging as a critical energy source for neoplastic cells, rivaling glucose. However, the mechanism by which glutamine is involved in the development of HB remains unclear. Our study identified glutamine metabolism as a crucial factor in the development of HB. The key enzyme of glutamine metabolism, kidney-type glutaminase (GLS1), is activated in HB and regulates cell proliferation. Mechanistically, the GLS1 subtype KGA, utilizing glutamate derived from glutaminolysis, enhances glutathione (GSH) synthesis, which in turn inhibits ferroptosis in HB cells. Importantly, the Thr563 residue of KGA undergoes O-GlcNAcylation, enhancing enzyme activity and stability, accelerating glutaminolysis, and promoting the proliferation of HB. This study demonstrated that enhanced glutaminolysis, driven by GLS1, is crucial for the development of HB by inhibiting ferroptosis. The O-GlcNAcylation of KGA isoform ensures its stability and glutaminase function in HB cells, which can serve as a promising therapeutic target for KGA-mediated glutaminolysis in HB.
40204724	MTCH2 regulates NRF2-mediated RRM1 expression to promote melanoma proliferation and dacarbazine insensitivity.	Melanoma is among the 10 most prevalent malignant tumors, posing a significant threat to human health. A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving its progression is crucial for advancing treatment strategies and outcomes. Based on bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation, this study identified mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2) as a key regulator of melanoma proliferation. Mechanistically, MTCH2 enhanced the expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived-2)-like 2 (NRF2), which up-regulated ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) expression, thereby promoting melanoma cell proliferation. Targeting RRM1 in combination with dacarbazine significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mouse xenograft models. These findings elucidate a mechanistic link between MTCH2 and the NRF2-RRM1 axis in melanoma proliferation and highlight potential therapeutic targets for intervention.
40204723	Dual parallel stream-specific and generalized effects of corticogeniculate feedback on LGN neurons in primate and carnivore.	Sensory circuits are organized in parallel, e.g. parallel streams relay feedforward visual information from retina to cortex. Corticogeniculate (CG) feedback is also organized in parallel; however, stream-specific influences of CG feedback remained unresolved. We utilized optogenetics to manipulate CG feedback in monkeys while recording geniculate responses to a comprehensive set of visual stimuli designed to probe stream-specific responses. Here we show that CG feedback improved the spatial resolution of magnocellular, but not parvocellular neurons. Optogenetically enhancing CG feedback increased extraclassical surround suppression, shrunk classical receptive fields, and increased preferred spatial frequencies among magnocellular neurons. Optogenetically suppressing CG feedback reduced surround suppression. Enhancing CG feedback in female ferrets revealed similar stream-specific effects in geniculate Y, but not X neurons. Furthermore, optogenetically enhancing CG feedback improved temporal response precision across neuronal types. These results support dual functional roles for CG feedback in enhancing spatial resolution in a stream-specific manner and improving temporal precision broadly.
40204722	Exceptionally high brightness and long lifetime of efficient blue OLEDs for programmable active-matrix display.	Blue phosphorescent OLEDs (Ph-OLEDs) have long faced critical challenges in efficiency, stability and brightness, which are crucial for advanced display. Herein, we introduce two novel Ir(III) emitters featuring a 3,6-di(tert-butyl)-9H-carbazolyl (tBuCz) substituted tridentate carbene pincer ligand, significantly improving efficiency and stability. The tBuCz-m-CF3 and tBuCz-p-CF3 complexes are designed to enhance steric encumbrance and minimize exciton accumulation. These innovations lead to exceptional photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of 98% and an impressive decay rate constant of 7.97 × 10<sup>5</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in doped thin films. The Ph-OLEDs emit blue light with a peak wavelength of 485 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.175, 0.446), exhibiting a peak external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 31.62% and brightness up to 214,255 cd m<sup>-2</sup>. Notably, they shown minimal efficiency roll-off, retaining an EQE of 27.76% at 10,000 cd m<sup>-2</sup>, and 20.58% at 100,000 cd m<sup>-2</sup>. These consistent performances across various brightness levels represent a significant milestone for blue Ph-OLED technology. The devices also exhibit impressive stability, with an operational lifetime (LT<sub>50</sub>, the time taken for luminance to decrease by 50%) reaching 1237 h at 1000 cd m<sup>-2</sup>, setting new benchmarks for blue Ph-OLEDs. To enhance the color purity, hyper-OLEDs were developed with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20 nm and the CIEy of 0.233, achieving an EQE<sub>m</sub> of 29.78% and LT<sub>50</sub> of 318 h at 1000 cd m<sup>-2</sup>. We also fabricated the active-matrix (AM) blue Hyper-OLEDs with 400 pixels per inch to demonstrate their application in AM displays.
40204719	Enabling adenosine signaling to promote aged fracture healing.	Bone fractures and related complications are a significant concern for older adults, particularly with the growing aging population. Therapeutic interventions that promote bone tissue regeneration are attractive for geriatric fracture repair. Extracellular adenosine plays a key role in bone homeostasis and regeneration. Herein, we examined the changes in extracellular adenosine with aging and the potential of local delivery of adenosine to promote fracture healing using aged mice. Extracellular adenosine level was found to be significantly lower in aged bone tissue compared to young mice. Concomitantly, the ecto-5'-nucleotidase CD73 expression was also lower in aged bone. Local delivery of adenosine using injectable, in situ curing microgel delivery units yielded a pro-regenerative environment and promoted fracture healing in aged mice. This study offers new insights into age-related physiological changes in adenosine levels and demonstrates the therapeutic potential of adenosine supplementation to circumvent the compromised healing of geriatric fractures.

40204717	Frequency modulation on magnons in synthetic dimensions.	Magnons are promising candidates for next-generation computing architectures, offering the ability to manipulate their amplitude and phase for information encoding. However, the frequency degree of freedom remains largely unexploited due to the complexity of nonlinear process. In this work, we introduce the concept of synthetic frequency dimension into magnonics, treating the eigenfrequency of inherent modes as an additional degree of freedom. This approach enables the effective description of the temporal evolution of a magnon state using an effective tight-binding model, analogous to a charged particle hopping in a modulated lattice. A magnonic ring resonator is investigated as an example, and several intriguing phenomena are predicted, including Bloch oscillations and a leverage effect during unidirectional frequency shifts, all of which are verified through micromagnetic simulations. Notably, our strategy operates in the linear spin-wave regime, excluding the involvement of multi-magnon scattering and high-power generation. This work expands the toolkit for designing magnonic devices based on frequency modulation and paves the way for a new paradigm called magnonics in synthetic dimensions.
40204716	Visual target and task-critical feedback uncertainty impair different stages of reach planning in motor cortex.	Sensory uncertainty jeopardizes accurate movement. During reaching, visual uncertainty can affect the estimation of hand position (feedback) and the desired movement endpoint (target). While impairing motor learning, it is unclear how either form of uncertainty affects cortical reach goal encoding. We show that reach trajectories vary more with higher visual uncertainty of the target, but not the feedback. Accordingly, cortical motor goal activities in male rhesus monkeys are less accurate during planning and movement initiation under target but not feedback uncertainty. Yet, when monkeys critically depend on visual feedback to conduct reaches via a brain-computer interface, then visual feedback uncertainty impairs reach accuracy and neural motor goal encoding around movement initiation. Neural state space analyses reveal a dimension that separates population activity by uncertainty level in all tested conditions. Our findings demonstrate that while both target and feedback uncertainty always reflect in neural activity, uncertain feedback only deteriorates neural reach goal information and behavior when it is task-critical, i.e., when having to rely on the sensory feedback and no other more reliable sensory modalities are available. Further, uncertain target and feedback impair reach goal encoding in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that they are integrated during different stages of reach planning.
40204715	Meta-analysis and review of in silico methods in drug discovery - part 1: technological evolution and trends from big data to chemical space.	This review offers an overview of advanced in silico methods crucial for drug discovery, emphasizing their integration with data science, and investigates the effectiveness of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence via a thorough meta-analysis of existing technologies. This meta-analysis aims to rank these technologies based on their applications and accessibility of knowledge. Initially, a search strategy yielded 900 papers, which were then refined into two subsets: the top 300 most-cited papers since 2000 and papers selected for systematic review based on high impact. From these, 97 articles were identified for discussion, categorized by their influence on society. The focus remains on the qualitative impact of these disciplines rather than solely on metrics like new drug approvals. Ultimately, the review underscores the role of big data in enhancing our comprehension of drug candidate trajectories from development to commercialization, utilizing information stored in publicly available databases to chemical space. Graphical extrapolation of some keywords (Drug Discovery; Big Data; Database; Metadata) discussed in this article and their evolution (in terms of absolute items that are available) by time.

40204713	GRAMD1B is a regulator of lipid homeostasis, autophagic flux and phosphorylated tau.	Lipid dyshomeostasis and tau pathology are present in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationship between lipid dyshomeostasis and tau pathology remains unclear. We report that GRAM Domain Containing 1B (GRAMD1B), a nonvesicular cholesterol transporter, is increased in excitatory neurons of human neural organoids (HNOs) with the MAPT R406W mutation. Human FTLD, AD cases, and PS19 tau mice also have increased GRAMD1B expression. We show that overexpression of GRAMD1B increases levels of free cholesterol, lipid droplets, and impairs autophagy flux. Modulating GRAMD1B in iPSC-derived neurons also alters key autophagy-related components such as PI3K, phospho-AKT, and p62, as well as phosphorylated tau, and CDK5R1. Blocking GRAMD1B function decreases free cholesterol and lipid droplets. Knocking down GRAMD1B additionally reduces phosphorylated tau, and CDK5R1 expression. Our findings elucidate the role of GRAMD1B in the nervous system and highlight its relevance to FTLD and AD.
40204712	Development of a breast cancer invasion score to predict tumor aggressiveness and prognosis via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway analysis.	Invasiveness is a key indicator of tumor malignancy and is often linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer (BC). To explore the diverse characteristics of invasive cells, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from three ductal carcinoma stages were analyzed, classifying samples into invasion and non-invasion groups. Nine genes (MCTS1, PGK1, PCMT1, C8orf76, TMEM242, QPRT, SLC16A2, AFG1L, and SPINK8) were identified as key discriminators between these groups. A breast cancer invasion score (BCIS) model was developed using LASSO Cox regression, revealed that high BCIS correlated with poorer overall survival in TCGA-BRCA patients and was validated across GSE20685 and METABRIC datasets (five-year and ten-year survival). Functional experiments demonstrated that knockdown of PGK1 or PCMT1 inhibited tumor cell proliferation and reduced the phosphorylation levels of mTORC, P70S6K, S6, and AKT, indicating suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. High-BCIS tumors exhibited enrichment in protein secretion and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, associated with aggressiveness and therapy resistance. This study introduced the BCIS score, distinguishing invasion from non-invasion cells, linked to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, offering insights into BRCA prognosis and tumor aggressiveness.

40204710	RNF144A-VRK2-G3BP1 axis regulates stress granule assembly.	Under the cellular stress, stress granules (SGs) help survival and proliferation of the cell. Unfortunately, the same SGs help unwanted cancer cells under stressful environment, including anti-cancer chemotherapy treatment. While SGs elevate the cancer cell's resistance to chemotherapy, the mechanism behind the formation of SGs in cancer cell under chemotherapy treatment is still to be revealed. Here, we identified that the level of VRK2 and the phosphorylation of its novel substrate, G3BP1, are reduced when the cellular stress was increased by sodium arsenite (SA) or cisplatin treatment. We also demonstrated that the level of RNF144A is increased in response to the stress and further downregulates VRK2 through proteasomal degradation in various types of cancer cells. Furthermore, inhibition of SG formation by the overexpression of VRK2 sensitized the cells to the stress and chemotherapy. Together, our study establishes an RNF144A-VRK2-G3BP1 axis that regulates SG formation and suggest its potential usage in anti-cancer therapy.
40204709	ELANE enhances KEAP1 protein stability and reduces NRF2-mediated ferroptosis inhibition in metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease.	Neutrophil elastase (Elane) is upregulated in metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and has the capacity to promote disease progression. However, the mechanism by which Elane promotes MAFLD development remains unclear. Ferroptosis, which is an iron-dependent nonapoptotic form of cell death characterized by the iron-induced accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been recently considered as an important mechanism for the development of MAFLD. In this study, we used mice of Elane-knockout (Elane-KO) and wild-type (WT), and their primary mouse hepatocytes to establish MAFLD models in vivo and vitro for elucidating the role of Elane in ferroptosis of hepatocytes and MAFLD development. Elane-KO in vivo reduced high-fat diet (HFD) induced hepatic lipid peroxidation levels and the proportion of hepatocyte death, upregulated the expression of Nrf2 and Gpx4, and downregulated Keap1 expression. Treatment with recombinant Elane increased the lipid peroxidation level of hepatocytes, increased the ferroptosis rate of hepatocytes, upregulated the expression of Keap1, enhanced the ubiquitination of Nrf2, and downregulated the expression of Nrf2 and Gpx4 in an FFA-induced MAFLD in vitro model. However, primary hepatocytes from Elane-KO mice presented opposite changes. Furthermore, an in vitro experiment revealed that Elane enhanced the protein stability of Keap1 and thus increased Keap1 expression in hepatocytes by inhibiting the lysosomal degradation of the Keap1 protein. Finally, in vitro Co-IP experiments revealed that Elane increased the protein stability of Keap1 by weakening the binding between P62 and Keap1 and ultimately promoted hepatocyte Nrf2 ubiquitination and ferroptosis in MAFLD. In conclusion, our results suggested that Elane promoted hepatocyte ferroptosis in MAFLD through the P62-Keap1-Nrf2-Gpx4 axis. Elane promotes ferroptosis in hepatocytes from fatty livers. Elane reduces the binding of P62 to Keap1, thereby increasing Keap1 protein stability and subsequently inhibiting the Nrf2/Gpx4 pathway, ultimately leading to ferroptosis in hepatocytes.
40204707	Metabolic reprogramming in T cell senescence: a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy.	The complex interplay between cancer progression and immune senescence is critically influenced by metabolic reprogramming in T cells. As T cells age, especially within the tumor microenvironment, they undergo significant metabolic shifts that may hinder their proliferation and functionality. This manuscript reviews how metabolic alterations contribute to T cell senescence in cancer and discusses potential therapeutic strategies aimed at reversing these metabolic changes. We explore interventions such as mitochondrial enhancement, glycolytic inhibition, and lipid metabolism adjustments that could rejuvenate senescent T cells, potentially restoring their efficacy in tumor suppression. This review also focuses on the significance of metabolic interventions in T cells with aging and further explores the future direction of the metabolism-based cancer immunotherapy in senescent T cells.
40204706	Immunotherapy with conventional type-1 dendritic cells induces immune memory and limits tumor relapse.	The potential of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination against cancer is not fully achieved. Little is known about the precise nature of the anti-cancer immune response triggered by different natural DC subsets and their relevance in preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence. Here, we use mouse splenic conventional DC1s (cDC1s) or cDC2s pulsed with tumor cell lysates to generate DC vaccines. cDC1-based vaccination induces a stronger effector and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> anti-tumor T cell response, leading to a better control of tumors treated either therapeutically or prophylactically. Using an experimental model of tumor relapse, we show that adjuvant or neoadjuvant cDC1 vaccination improves anti-tumor immune memory, particularly by increasing the infiltrates of CD4<sup>+</sup> tissue resident memory (Trm) and CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells. This translates into complete prevention of tumor relapses. Moreover, elevated abundance of cDC1s positively correlates with CD4<sup>+</sup> Trm presence, and both associate with enhanced survival in human breast cancer and melanoma. Our findings suggest that cDC1-based vaccination excels at immune memory induction and prevention of cancer recurrence.
40204705	Deciphering N-Glycosylation Dynamics of Serum Monoclonal Immunoglobulins in Multiple Myeloma via EThcD-sceHCD-MS/MS.	Serum glycoprotein glycosylation changes can indicate disease onset and progression. However, the site-specific N-glycosylation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-proteins) in multiple myeloma (MM) and its clinical implications are unclear. In this study, we isolated pathogenic micromonoclonal IgA or IgG (approximately 2 μg) from IgA-MM patients (<i>n</i> = 22) and IgG-MM patients (<i>n</i> = 30), and normal polyclonal IgA and IgG from healthy controls (HCs) (<i>n</i> = 16). Using EThcD-sceHCD-MS/MS, the N-glycosylation dynamics of serum M-proteins in MM were determined. Compared with polyclonal IgA1 from HCs, monoclonal IgA1 from IgA-MM patients had higher fucosylation (58.1% vs 32.1%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), sialylation (68.0% vs 50.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.011), and mannosylation (1.5% vs 0.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). While, monoclonal IgG1 from IgG-MM patients had higher fucosylation (97.8% vs 95.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In addition, specific N-glycan abundances correlated with MM clinical features: for IgA1, HexNAc5Hex5Fuc1NeuAc1 was associated with hypocomplementemia; for IgG1, HexNAc4Hex3Fuc1 was associated with the serum albumin level (<i>r</i> = -0.363, <i>p</i> = 0.049) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (<i>r</i> = -0.433, <i>p</i> = 0.017); and HexNAc4Hex5 was associated with therapeutic prognosis. In conclusion, monoclonal IgA1 and IgG1 in MM patients and their polyclonal isotypes in HCs have distinct N-glycosylation profiles, and specific N-glycans of M-proteins are associated with MM characteristics and therapeutic prognosis.
40204704	Ready for translation: non-invasive auricular vagus nerve stimulation inhibits psychophysiological indices of stimulus-specific fear and facilitates responding to repeated exposure in phobic individuals.	Recent laboratory research showed that vagus nerve stimulation promotes fear extinction, the inhibitory core mechanism of exposure treatment, presumably via activation of the noradrenergic brain system. However, a translation of this stimulation technique to clinical practice is lacking. We therefore investigated the potential of vagal stimulation to inhibit excessive fear responses and facilitate responding to in-vivo and laboratory exposure in individuals with specific phobia. Spider-phobic participants were subjected to three standardized in-vivo exposures towards a living tarantula, complemented by an exposure in vitro (between exposure in vivo I and II). Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) was applied during in-vitro exposure, presenting pictures of the exposed tarantula, other spiders and neutral tools in the laboratory. Fear was assessed by self-reports and behavioral avoidance (in-vivo exposures), and amygdala-mediated autonomic and behavioral fear components (exposure in vitro). Vagal stimulation facilitated the reduction of behavioral avoidance across repeated in-vivo exposures. During laboratory exposure, taVNS inhibited fear tachycardia and corrugator muscle activity specifically in response to pictures of the previously exposed tarantula - an effect that became stronger with increasing stimulation duration. Psychophysiological indices of noradrenergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala were elevated during taVNS and correlated to subsequent attenuation of behavioral avoidance. Our results suggest, that taVNS exerts stimulus-specific and dose-dependent inhibition of multiple automatic response components of excessive fear, highlighting taVNS as a valuable adjunct to exposure-based treatment. A translational mechanism of action is supported, proposing that taVNS exhibits its effects by noradrenergic activation of fear extinction circuitry, particularly targeting the basolateral amygdala.
40204703	Cell type-specific multi-omics analysis of cocaine use disorder in the human caudate nucleus.	Structural and functional alterations in the brain's reward circuitry are present in cocaine use disorder (CocUD), but their molecular underpinnings remain unclear. To investigate these mechanisms, we performed single-nuclei multiome profiling on postmortem caudate nucleus tissue from six individuals with CocUD and eight controls. We profiled 30,030 nuclei, identifying 13 cell types including D1- and D2-medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and glial cells. We observed 1485 differentially regulated genes and 10,342 differentially accessible peaks, with alterations in MSNs and astrocytes related to neurotransmitter activity and synapse organization. Gene regulatory network analysis identified transcription factors including ZEB1 as exhibiting distinct CocUD-specific subclusters, activating downstream expression of ion- and calcium-channels in MSNs. Further, PDE10A emerged as a potential drug target, showing conserved effects in a rat model. This study highlights cell type-specific molecular alterations in CocUD and provides targets for further investigation, demonstrating the value of multi-omics approaches in addiction research.
40204701	Deletion of Fgf14 confers resilience to basal and stress-induced depressive-like behavior and reduces anxiety in mice.	Depression is a mental illness characterized by despair behavior, inability to feel pleasure, and social withdrawal. Causes are not yet clarified, but stress is a condition that induces depression. Neuronal alterations, comprising maladaptive neuronal plasticity and excitability, are present in both responses to stress and depression. Fibroblast growth factor 14 (Fgf14) controls neuronal excitability and proper action potential firing by stabilizing voltage-dependent sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels into the axon. Fgf14-Na<sub>v</sub> channels complex is regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3. Recently, Fgf14 has been genetically associated to depression. However, little is known about its role in controlling stress-induced depression. This study demonstrates that female Fgf14<sup>-/-</sup> mice are resilient to depression, as reported by reduced level of despair behavior, anhedonia, and increased sociability. Also, a reduction of anxious-like behavior was highlighted. Fgf14<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed increased expression of cannabinoid receptor without alterations of dopaminergic system in mPFC, suggesting a link between Fgf14 and endocannabinoid system in the control mechanisms underlying depression. Neuronal activity was assessed by analyzing cFOS expression during basal and following acute stress induced by tail suspension test (TST). The analysis revealed that neuronal activation in mPFC and VTA was correlated to immobility, where ratio of cFOS expression over immobility was significantly higher in Fgf14<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This suggests that higher neuronal activity might be involved in resilience to depression. In resilient Fgf14<sup>-/-</sup> mice, TST-induced acute stress caused activation only in pyramidal neurons. Our findings suggest that Fgf14 is involved in stress-coping mechanisms and could be targeted to improve resilience to depression.
40204700	Non-reciprocal response in silicon photonic resonators integrated with 2D CuCrP<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> at short-wave infrared.	Achieving non-reciprocal optical behavior in integrated photonics with high efficiency has long been a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a non-reciprocal magneto-optic response by integrating multilayer 2D CuCrP<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> (CCPS) onto silicon microring resonators (MRRs). Under an applied magnetic field, the CCPS intralayer ferromagnetic ordering, characterized by easy-plane magneto-crystalline anisotropy, induces asymmetrical modal responses in the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) light propagation directions. The proposed configuration achieves a low insertion loss ranging from 0.15 dB to 1.8 dB and a high isolation ratio of 28 dB at 1550 nm. Notably, it exhibits a significant resonance wavelength splitting of 0.4 nm between the counter propagation directions, supporting a 50 GHz optical bandwidth. Operating directly in the transverse electric (TE) mode, it aligns with the main polarization used in silicon photonics circuits, eliminating the need for additional polarization management. The device is ultra-compact, with a 2D flake interaction length ranging from 22 µm to 55 µm and a thickness between 39 nm and 62 nm. Its operation range covers the entire C-band with a bandwidth of up to 100 nm. These attributes make our hybrid CCPS/Si device ideal for advanced non-reciprocal optical applications in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, crucial for enhancing the resilience of optical systems against back-reflections.
40204699	Mutant huntingtin induces neuronal apoptosis via derepressing the non-canonical poly(A) polymerase PAPD5.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Poly(A) RNA polymerase D5 (PAPD5) catalyzes the addition of adenosine to the 3' end of miRNAs. In this study, we demonstrate that the Yin Yang 1 protein, a transcriptional repressor of PAPD5, is recruited to both RNA foci and protein aggregates, resulting in an upregulation of PAPD5 expression in Huntington's disease (HD). Additionally, we identify a subset of PAPD5-regulated miRNAs with increased adenylation and reduced expression in our disease model. We focus on miR-7-5p and find that its reduction causes the activation of the TAB2-mediated TAK1-MKK4-JNK pro-apoptotic pathway. This pathway is also activated in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived striatal neurons and post-mortem striatal tissues isolated from HD patients. In addition, we discover that a small molecule PAPD5 inhibitor, BCH001, can mitigate cell death and neurodegeneration in our disease models. This study highlights the importance of PAPD5-mediated miRNA dysfunction in HD pathogenesis and suggests a potential therapeutic direction for the disease.
40204698	The regulatory architecture of the primed pluripotent cell state.	Despite extensive research, the gene regulatory architecture governing mammalian cell states remains poorly understood. Here we present an integrative systems biology approach to elucidate the network architecture of primed state pluripotency. Using an unbiased methodology, we identified and experimentally confirmed 132 transcription factors as master regulators (MRs) of mouse epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) pluripotency, many of which were further validated by CRISPR-mediated functional assays. To assemble a comprehensive regulatory network, we silenced each of the 132 MRs to assess their effects on the other MRs and their transcriptional targets, yielding a network of 1273 MR → MR interactions. Network architecture analyses revealed four functionally distinct MR modules (communities), and identified key Speaker and Mediator MRs based on their hierarchical rank and centrality. Our findings elucidate the de-centralized logic of a "communal interaction" model in which the balanced activities of four MR communities maintain primed state pluripotency.
40204697	Alchemically-glazed plasmonic nanocavities using atomic layer metals: controllably synergizing catalysis and plasmonics.	Plasmonic nanocavities offer exceptional confinement of light, making them effective for energy conversion applications. However, limitations with stability, materials, and chemical activity have impeded their practical implementation. Here we integrate ultrathin palladium (Pd) metal films from sub- to few- atomic monolayers inside plasmonic nanocavities using underpotential deposition. Despite the poor plasmonic properties of bulk Pd in the visible region, minimal loss in optical field enhancement is delivered along with Pd chemical enhancement, as confirmed by ab initio calculations. Such synergistic effects significantly enhance photocatalytic activity of the plasmonic nanocavities as well as photostability by suppressing surface atom migration. We show the atomic alchemical-glazing approach is general for a range of catalytic metals that bridge plasmonic and chemical catalysis, yielding broad applications in photocatalysis for optimal chemical transformation.
40204696	Ceftazidime-avibactam use selects multidrug-resistance and prevents designing collateral sensitivity-based therapies against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Ceftazidime-avibactam is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination restricted for the treatment of multidrug-resistant infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa non-susceptible to ceftazidime and resistant to carbapenems. Crucially, it has not been studied if its use could allow the design or application of new or stablished evolution-based strategies that exploit the increased susceptibility that emerges when resistance is acquired (collateral sensitivity, CS). Works in the field have focused on the study of CS in model strains, but to be exploited it must robustly emerge in pre-existing resistant mutants that can coexist in a patient. This is the first analysis of CS robustness on this last-resort drug. We evolved 15 clinical isolates on ceftazidime-avibactam and in absence of inhibitor, and here we show that we found no robust -exploitable- pattern of CS. This, together with the selection of cross-resistance and the impossibility of using previously described CS-based strategies, supports that avibactam should be restricted for the treatment of particular genotypes.
40204695	Energy landscape of a Kv channel revealed by temperature steps while perturbing its electromechanical coupling.	Voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) play a crucial role in membrane repolarization during action potentials. They undergo voltage-dependent structural conformational transitions according to their distribution across their energy landscape. Understanding these transitions helps us comprehend their molecular function. Here, we used sudden and sustained temperature changes (Tstep) combined with different voltage protocols and mutations to dissect the energy landscape of the Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel. We used two mutations, ILT (V369I, I372L, and S376T) and I384N, that affect the coupling between the voltage sensor (VSD) and the pore domain (PD), to obtain the temperature dependence of VSD last transition and the intrinsic temperature dependence of the pore, respectively. Our findings support a loose or tight conformation of the electromechanical coupling. In the loose conformation, the movement of the VSD is necessary but not sufficient to efficiently propagate the electromechanical energy to open the pore. In contrast, this movement is effectively translated into pore opening in the tight conformation. Our results describe the energy landscape of the Shaker channel and how its temperature dependence can be modulated by affecting its electromechanical coupling.
40204694	Impact of perioperative organ injury on morbidity and mortality in 28 million surgical patients.	Perioperative organ injury contributes to morbidity and mortality of surgical patients. This cohort study included all elective and emergent surgeries in Germany over 4 years to address the impact of perioperative organ injuries on outcomes. We analyzed 28,350,953 cases. In-hospital mortality was 1.4% (n = 393,157), and 4.4% of cases (n = 1,245,898) experienced perioperative organ injury. Perioperative organ injury was associated with 9-fold higher odds of death and prolonged hospital stay by 11.2 days. Acute kidney injury had the highest incidence (2.0%) and was associated with 25.0% mortality. While delirium had the second highest incidence (1.5%), it was associated with the lowest mortality (10.8%). This was followed by acute myocardial infarction (incidence 0.6%, mortality 15.6%), stroke (incidence 0.6%, mortality 13.1%), pulmonary embolism (incidence 0.3%, mortality 20.0%), liver injury (incidence 0.1%, mortality 68.7%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (incidence 0.1%, mortality 44.7%). These findings help prioritize interventions for preventing or treating individual types of perioperative organ injury.
40204693	Natural language processing models reveal neural dynamics of human conversation.	Through conversation, humans engage in a complex process of alternating speech production and comprehension to communicate. The neural mechanisms that underlie these complementary processes through which information is precisely conveyed by language, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we used pre-trained deep learning natural language processing models in combination with intracranial neuronal recordings to discover neural signals that reliably reflected speech production, comprehension, and their transitions during natural conversation between individuals. Our findings indicate that the neural activities that reflected speech production and comprehension were broadly distributed throughout frontotemporal areas across multiple frequency bands. We also find that these activities were specific to the words and sentences being conveyed and that they were dependent on the word's specific context and order. Finally, we demonstrate that these neural patterns partially overlapped during language production and comprehension and that listener-speaker transitions were associated with specific, time-aligned changes in neural activity. Collectively, our findings reveal a dynamical organization of neural activities that subserve language production and comprehension during natural conversation and harness the use of deep learning models in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying human language.
40204692	Electrochemical microfluidic biosensor for the detection of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.	Since the onset of the HIV epidemic, assessing CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells has become a routine procedure for evaluating immune deficiency, with flow cytometry established as the gold standard. Over time, various strategies and platforms have been introduced to improve CD4<sup>+</sup> cell enumeration, aiming to enhance the performance of diagnostic devices and bring the service closer to patients. These advancements are particularly critical for low-resource settings and point-of-care applications, where the excellent performance of flow cytometry is hindered by its unsuitability in such environments. This work presents an innovative electrochemical microfluidic device that, with further development, could be applied for HIV management in low resource settings. The setup integrates an electrochemical sensor within a PDMS microfluidic structure, allowing for on-chip electrode functionalization and cell detection. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the biosensor demonstrates a linear detection range from 1.25 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL, with a detection limit of 1.41 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL for CD4<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from blood samples, aligning with clinical ranges for both healthy and HIV<sup>+</sup> patients. The biosensor shows specificity towards CD4<sup>+</sup> cells with negligible response to monocytes, neutrophils, and bovine serum albumin. Its integration with a microfluidic chip for sensor fabrication and cell detection, compact size, minimal manual handling, ease of fabrication, electrochemical detection capability, and potential for multiplexing together with the detection range make the device particularly advantageous for use in low-resource settings, standing out among other devices described in the literature. This study also investigates the integration of a microfluidic Dean Flow Fractionation (DFF) chip for cell separation.
40204691	Berry Curvature-Driven Valley Nernst Effect in Monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub>.	The Berry curvature in a Dirac cone causes anomalous transport phenomena, including anomalous Hall, anomalous Nernst, and Valley Hall effects. Detecting the Berry curvature in a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) layer requires breaking time-reversal symmetry to create a population imbalance between the K<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>-</sup> valleys. Direct observation and control of valley polarization in a 2D TMD layer remain challenging, especially for practical applications. Here, we present the first experimental verification of the Berry curvature-driven valley Nernst effect (VNE) in interlayer TMDs, focusing on the monolayer (ML) WSe<sub>2</sub> in a Pt/YIG bilayer structure. Experiments and calculations show that our VNE signals result from the high Berry curvature of the ML WSe<sub>2</sub> layer. This opens up a new way to generate spin- and valley-current-based thermoelectric devices.
40204690	In situ n-doped nanocrystalline electron-injection-layer for general-lighting quantum-dot LEDs.	Quantum-dot optoelectronics, pivotal for lighting, lasing and photovoltaics, rely on nanocrystalline oxide electron-injection layer. Here, we discover that the prevalent surface magnesium-modified zinc oxide electron-injection layer possesses poor n-type attributes, leading to the suboptimal and encapsulation-resin-sensitive performance of quantum-dot light-emitting diodes. A heavily n-doped nanocrystalline electron-injection layer-exhibiting ohmic transport with 1000 times higher electron conductivity and improved hole blockage-is developed via a simple reductive treatment. The resulting sub-bandgap-driven quantum-dot light-emitting diodes exhibit optimal efficiency and extraordinarily-high brightness, surpassing current benchmarks by at least 2.6-fold, and reaching levels suitable for quantum-dot laser diodes with only modest bias. This breakthrough further empowers white-lighting quantum-dot light-emitting diodes to exceed the 2035 U.S. Department of Energy's targets for general lighting, which currently accounts for ~15% of global electricity consumption. Our work opens a door for understanding and optimizing carrier transport in nanocrystalline semiconductors shared by various types of solution-processed optoelectronic devices.
40204689	Layer-specific input to medial prefrontal cortex is linked to stress susceptibility.	Stress response is essential for adapting to an ever-changing environment. However, the mechanisms that render some individuals susceptible to stress are poorly understood. While chronic stress is known to induce dendritic atrophy and spine loss in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), its impact on synapses made by long-range projections terminating on the mPFC remains unknown. Here, we labeled synapses on male mouse mPFC dendrites formed by ventral hippocampus (VH), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) long-range afferents using different-colored eGRASP constructs. We obtained multispectral 3D-images of the mPFC covering all cortical laminae, and automatically segmented the dendrites and synapses. In layer II/III, the relative abundances and spatial organizations of VH-mPFC and BLA-mPFC synapses changed similarly in stress resilient (SR) and stress susceptible (SS) mice when compared to stress naïve (SN) mice. In layers Vb and VI, on the other hand, the percentage of BLA-mPFC synapses increased and that of VH-mPFC decreased only in SS mice. Moreover, the distances of VH synapses to their corresponding closest BLA synapses decreased and the distances of BLA synapses to their corresponding closest VH synapses increased in the SS group. Consistently, the percentage of single dendritic segments receiving input from multiple brain regions increased in the SS group, suggesting that long-range synaptic inputs to deep layers of mPFC were disorganized in SS mice. Our findings demonstrate afferent- and lamina-specific differential reorganization of synapses between different stress phenotypes, suggesting specific roles for different long-range projections in mediating the stress response.
40204688	Peripheral positioning of lysosomes supports melanoma aggressiveness.	Emerging evidence suggests that the function and position of organelles are pivotal for tumor cell dissemination. Among them, lysosomes stand out as they integrate metabolic sensing with gene regulation and secretion of proteases. Yet, how their function is linked to their position and how this controls metastasis remains elusive. Here, we analyze lysosome subcellular distribution in patient-derived melanoma cells and patient biopsies and show that lysosome spreading scales with melanoma aggressiveness. Peripheral lysosomes promote matrix degradation and cell invasion which is directly linked to the lysosomal and cell transcriptional programs. Using chemo-genetical control of lysosome positioning, we demonstrate that perinuclear clustering impairs lysosome secretion, matrix degradation and invasion. Impairing lysosome spreading significantly reduces invasive outgrowth in two in vivo models, mouse and zebrafish. Our study provides a direct demonstration that lysosome positioning controls cell invasion, illustrating the importance of organelle adaptation in carcinogenesis and suggesting its potential utility for diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.
40204686	Fast Imaging of Mitochondria and Efficient Generation of Singlet Oxygen by Red Fluorescent BODIPY Photosensitizers.	The biomedical applications of BODIPY fluorophores are limited by challenges such as short-wavelength emission, high hydrophobicity, and poor selectivity. To address these issues, two water-soluble red-emitting BODIPY derivatives, namely, PSPyBDP and I-PSPyBDP, were synthesized by conjugating pyridine units to the BODIPY core, followed by the ring-opening reactions with 1,3-propanesulfonate. Notably, PSPyBDP showed fast mitochondrial imaging capability (∼5 min), indicating its potential as an alternative to mitochondria tracker. I-PSPyBDP, with the heavy-atom effect, could effectively produce singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) under irradiation at 660 nm in a short time (∼1 min) with a <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> quantum yield of 0.89. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that the BODIPY derivatives exhibited phototoxicity to HeLa cells while maintaining low dark toxicity. Interestingly, they had low toxicity against normal COS-7 cells. Confocal imaging and flow cytometry confirmed that the BODIPY derivatives could increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, and induce apoptosis upon irradiation. These findings suggest their promising application in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for tumors.
40204685	Modulating the Short-Range Correlation through the Assembly of Anisotropic Colloidal Clusters.	Disordered structures with short-range correlation exhibit unique photonic or thermal properties, often arising from the self-assembly of monodisperse microspheres. Colloidal clusters, aggregates of a defined number of microspheres, have anisotropic shapes and offer a unique approach to tailor the short-range correlation compared to traditional isotropic microspheres. However, this potential remains largely unexplored. To this end, we have prepared triangular and tetrahedral colloidal clusters and coassemble them with polystyrene microspheres into both monolayers and thick films (∼10 μm) over 5 mm × 5 mm areas. Through combining scanning electron microscopy images and laser scattering measurements, we show that increasing cluster concentration from 0% to 40% increases disorder in both thin and thick films. Beyond 40%, the short-range order in thin films plateaus, while it increases with triangular clusters but decreases with tetrahedral clusters in thick films. The distinct roles of triangular and tetrahedral clusters offer new insights into design of correlated disordered materials for novel applications.

40204683	Photothermal catalytic synthesis of sulfonic acid functionalized covalent organic framework achieved by COF-to-COF transformation for photocatalysis.	Although photothermal catalysis is a clean, efficient, and green approach to access organic products, its application in the synthesis and transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), however, is still unprecedented. Herein, we report the photothermal catalytic synthesis of C-C bond linked COF under visible light, which can be a reusable photocatalyst to highly promote oxidation of benzyl amines. Furthermore, we have developed a new postsynthetic modification strategy to construct COFs by photoinduced thermally-driven hydroamination via crystal-to-crystal transformation. The obtained COF containing sulfonic acid group showed an excellent catalytic performance in promoting aerobic oxidation of alkyl arenes under mild reaction conditions. These results not only enrich the COF synthetic methodology but also open a new route to access COFs in a green and sustainable way.
40204682	Water-Involved 1,3-Aminoxylation of Fluoroalkenes: Chemo-, Regio-, and Stereoselective Synthesis of β-Fluoroacyl Vinylamines.	Perfluoroalkyl alkenyl iodides (PFAIs) are emerging as highly reactive, storage-stable, and multifunctional fluoroalkyl-bearing reagents, facilitating the manufacture of value-added organofluorides through multi-halo-functionalization. Herein, we developed a water-involved 1,3-aminoxylation of PFAIs with sulfonamides for the chemo-, regio-, and <i>Z</i>-stereoselective synthesis of valuable β-fluoroacyl vinylamines. This reaction proceeded via a sequential deiodoamination and defluoroxylation process under transition-metal-free conditions, featuring a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Compared to reported methods, some drawbacks, such as multistep manipulation, harsh reaction conditions, the need for expensive catalysts, and the use of toxic/sensitive reagents, could be eliminated. Furthermore, the synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated through scale-up synthesis, postfunctionalization of complex molecules, and ready transformation of the products.
40204681	Stereogenic P(V) Synthesis via Catalytic Continuous Substitutions.	Phosphorus(V) stereocenters that are fully substituted by heteroatoms play important roles in bioactive molecules and organocatalysts. Existing methods to achieve such motifs rely almost entirely on resolution or diastereocontrol, and prefunctionalized substrates are usually required to generate specific P(V) stereocenters. In contrast, related catalytic methods are rare, and no generally applicable method is described. Here, we report a modular strategy to access a broad variety of stereogenic-at-phosphorus skeletons, including ProTide analogs, alkoxylphosphoramidates, phosphates, phosphorothioates, and phosphonamidates, through designed enantioselective continuous substitutions of simple P(V) precursors. The nucleophilic substitution sequence readily determined the stereoconfiguration of the products. Concise synthesis of ProTide analogs and drug molecules demonstrated the practical value of the protocol. Experimental and computational studies unveiled a unique π-π stacking effect and chalcogen bonding interaction between the catalyst and substrate as the origin of stereoselectivity.
40204680	Preparation, Acidity, and Catalytic Activity of Synthetic Montmorillonites in α-Pinene Isomerization.	A series of montmorillonites with different Mg and Al contents (Na<sub>2<i>x</i></sub>(Al<sub>2(1-<i>x</i>)</sub>,Mg<sub>2<i>x</i></sub>)Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>·<i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, where 0 < <i>x</i> ≤ 1) were prepared by the hydrothermal method and characterized by MAS NMR, XRD, N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption, FTIR with pyridine, TPD-NH<sub>3</sub>, SEM, and thermal analysis techniques. The material obtained without aluminum (<i>x</i> = 1), or with a minimum amount of it (<i>x</i> = 0.9) is a trioctahedral saponite becoming a fully dioctahedral montmorillonite at its highest content (<i>x</i> = 0.1). The introduction of aluminum into the montmorillonite structure during its synthesis leads to the appearance of pronounced Brønsted acidity, the highest concentration of which was in montmorillonite with <i>x</i> = 0.1. In contrast, the Al-free sample is practically a Lewis acid (L/B of 71.3). The studied materials possessed catalytic activity in the isomerization of α-pinene, which correlated with the strength of the acid sites. Al-containing montmorillonites yielded camphene with a selectivity of 50-53%, and the presence of medium and strong Brønsted sites favored its formation. In contrast, Mg-montmorillonite with almost exclusively Lewis acidity demonstrated an unusually high selectivity to limonene (44.5%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work describing the catalytic activity of synthetic Al-Mg montmorillonite. However, the ease of varying the nature and strength of acid sites in synthetic materials opens up the prospect of their use in a number of reactions, including those for renewable terpene compounds.
40204678	Analyzing the effect of lake dredged material from the Western Lake Erie Basin on soil properties and corn health.	US lakes and federal navigation channels are dredged yearly to maintain the economic activity of ports and harbors, and about 1.5 million cubic yards (about 1.1 million m<sup>3</sup>) of dredged material (DM) is excavated from the Western Lake Erie Basin in Ohio. After the prohibition of open water disposal of DM, the State of Ohio is recommending finding beneficial uses, including amending farm soils. This research investigated whether the different ratios of DM amending an organic farm soil enhance the soil properties, corn (Zea mays) health, and crop yield. We did a greenhouse experiment for 122 days, and our soil blends consisted of 100% farm soil, 100% DM, 95% farm soil + 5% DM, 90% farm soil + 10% DM, and 80% farm soil + 20% DM. Our results indicated that as the DM ratio increased, the cation exchange capacity (20-37 meq 100 g<sup>-1</sup>), soil calcium (2880-6400 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and soil total phosphorus (710-1060 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) increased, but the soil bulk density value (0.8-0.6 mg cm<sup>-3</sup>) decreased slightly. The above (11-37 g) and below (1-3.7 g) corn biomass weights were higher as the DM ratio increased. The highest corn yield was observed in 100% DM (12.7-46.8 g). These findings demonstrate that DM has the potential to be used as an agricultural farm soil substrate.

40204674	Triplet Sensitization Photon Upconversion Using Near-Infrared Indirect-Bandgap AgBiS<sub>2</sub> Nanocrystals.	Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have recently emerged as ideal triplet sensitizers owing to their diverse material composition and spectral tunability. However, the NCs that can efficiently sensitize near-infrared-to-visible photon upconversion remain largely limited to toxic lead-based NCs. Here, we present a new lead-free, near-infrared, indirect-bandgap sensitizer based on AgBiS<sub>2</sub> NCs, enabling near-infrared-to-yellow upconversion with a quantum yield reaching 10.5% (normalized to 100%). The key to success is the precise stoichiometry control of AgBiS<sub>2</sub> NCs, which provides the essential surface states for both radiative recombination and triplet energy transfer. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy verifies the efficient triplet energy transfer mechanism mediated by surface states. Our work presents a new eco-friendly material system for efficient triplet fusion near-infrared photon upconversion.
40204673	High Partial Molar Volume Polymer Electrolyte for Upgraded Lithium Metal Batteries.	Lithium (Li) metal batteries combined with solid electrolytes represent a highly promising technology for high-energy-density storage systems. However, their cycling performance encounters inferior stability due to the continuous growth of Li-dendrites. The initial motivation for Li-dendrite growth theoretically arises from the high chemical potential difference (∆μ) at the electrolyte/Li metal interface, yet the effectiveness of ∆μ regulation lacks experimental validation. Here, we experimentally present the impact of ∆μ on the growth of Li-dendrites through manipulation of the partial molar volume of Li+ (V_(Li^+ )) in the polymer electrolyte. By weakening Li-O coordination structure, the as-produced high-V_(Li^+ ) polymer electrolyte (108.5 cm3/mol) shows 83% decrease in ∆μ (289 J/mol) compared with conventional counterparts, thereby enabling stable cycling for >10 months in a Li||Li cell and >2000 cycles in a Li||Cu cell with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 96%. To one's delight, a practical cylindrical Li||Li[Ni0.5Co0.3Mn0.2]O2 cell with capacity of 0.62 Ah delivers excellent cycle stability with negligible capacity attenuation over 95 cycles at 0.2 C. The beneficial role of high V_(Li^+ ) is leveraged to introduce a new dimension in polymer electrolyte engineering, highlighting the underexplored design strategy of regulating interfacial ∆μ to rejuvenate practical lithium metal batteries.
40204672	Azadiene-Linked Carbon-Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Efficiency in Organic Synthesis.	Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D-COFs) have garnered huge attentions as a promising platform for solar to chemical energy conversion. In this work, two novel azadiene-linked COFs (COF-JLU236 and COF-JLU237) were designed and successfully synthesized under solvothermal conditions for the first time. And new materials have high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability and broad absorption range, as well as excellent photoelectric properties. Importantly, they can effectively induce selective oxidation of sulfides and phenylboronic acids under visible light, and show wide substrate adaptability and superior reusability.
40204671	Determining Antimicrobial Resistance in the Plastisphere: Lower Risks of Nonbiodegradable vs Higher Risks of Biodegradable Microplastics.	The plastisphere is a potential contributor to global antimicrobial resistance (AMR), posing potential threats to public and environmental health. However, comprehensively quantifying the contribution of microplastics with different biodegradability to AMR is lacking. In this study, we systematically quantified AMR risk mediated by biodegradable and nonbiodegradable microplastics using abundance-based methods and a custom AMR risk ranking framework that includes antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) abundance, mobility, and host pathogenicity. Our results demonstrated that biodegradable microplastics exhibited higher AMR risk compared to that of nonbiodegradable plastics. Key resistance genes, including those for multidrug, bacitracin, and aminoglycoside resistance, were predominant. Machine learning analysis identified cell motility as the most significant signature associated with AMR risk, highlighting its potential role in promoting ARGs dissemination. In addition, biodegradable microplastics promoted oxidative stress and SOS responses, which likely enhanced horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and AMR. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) analysis uncovered the colocalization of microplastic degradation genes, ARGs, and virulence factors (VFs), further supporting the elevated risk in biodegradable plastisphere. The proximity of ARGs to mobile genetic elements (MGEs) suggests that microplastic degradation processes might favor ARGs mobility. These findings would contribute critical insights into AMR dissemination in the plastisphere, emphasizing the need for integrated environmental and public health strategies under the context of One Health.
40204670	Cardiac rhythm devices in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction - role, timing, and optimal use in contemporary practice. European Journal of Heart Failure expert consensus document.	Guidelines for management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) emphasize personalized care, patient engagement, and shared decision-making. Medications and cardiac rhythm management (CRM) devices are recommended with a high level of evidence. However, there are significant disparities: patients who could benefit from devices are frequently referred too late or not at all. Misconceptions about device therapy and the notion that the needs of patients (especially the prevention of sudden cardiac death) can now be met by expanding drug therapies may play a role in these disparities. This state-of-the-art review is produced by members of the DIRECT HF initiative, a patient-centred, expert-led educational programme that aims to advance guideline-directed use of CRM devices in patients with HFrEF. This review discusses the latest evidence on the role of CRM devices in reducing HFrEF mortality and morbidity, and provides practical guidance on patient referral, device selection, implant timing and patient-centred follow-up.
40204669	Iron-Catalyzed Reductive Allylic C-H Amination of Olefin with Nitroarenes via Intermolecular Nitroso Ene Reaction.	Aromatic allylamines are essential in the synthesis of diverse pharmaceutical building blocks. While oxidative allylic C-H amination using anilines has advanced significantly, achieving intermolecular reductive allylic C-H amination of olefins with readily available nitroarenes remains a considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate that replacing silanes with a combination of protons and electrons enables selective reductive allylic C-H amination, avoiding the competing hydroamination pathway. The key to this transformation is the use of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) as the solvent. This process complements previous oxidative allylic C-H amination by eliminating the need for noble metal catalysts while tolerating oxidizable or nucleophilic functional groups. Notably, this method facilitates the functionalization of bioactive compounds, underscoring its potential in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, by leveraging its reactivity with trisubstituted olefins, this approach, when combined with metal hydride atom transfer (MHAT) reactions, offers a unique strategy for regioselective and modular difunctionalization of aliphatic olefins. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies highlight the crucial roles of TFE in stabilizing the nitrosoarene intermediate and promoting the key nitroso-ene step.
40204668	Association of cannabis use with major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events after surgery or interventional procedures.

This study investigated the association of nonmedical cannabis use with MACCE after interventional procedures or surgery.
40204666	Ultrafine Ni-Doped FeOOH Nanoparticles with Rich Oxygen Vacancies to Promote Oxygen Evolution.	Nickel iron hydroxide oxide is one of the efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, current synthesis methods, such as solvothermal and electrodeposition, require stringent experimental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and solvent) and involve complex procedures with high costs. To address this issue, we developed a simple and efficient electrostatic self-assembly strategy to synthesize Ni-doped iron oxyhydroxide (Ni-FeOOH) by combining aminated two-dimensional g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> with trace amounts of Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, forming a tightly integrated heterostructure (Ni-FeOOH@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>). This method is notable for its simplicity and ability to produce ultrasmall Ni-FeOOH nanoparticles (∼1.9 nm), which significantly enhance the active surface area and functional sites. The resulting catalyst exhibits exceptional OER performance, achieving a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA·cm<sup>-2</sup> and demonstrating long-term stability. Remarkably, despite containing only trace amounts of Ni (2.46%) and Fe (3.36%), Ni-FeOOH@g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> delivers a high turnover frequency of 3.96 s<sup>-1</sup>, outperforming many conventional hydroxyl oxides. The improved performance is attributed to the ultrasmall particle size and the presence of excessive oxygen vacancies, which lower the energy barrier for O* formation and accelerate OER kinetics. This work proposes a method for constructing efficient catalysts with trace active metals to improve the OER activity.

40204662	Effect of Electrical Double Layer on Stability Mechanism of the Cluster of Bulk Nanobubbles.	Nanobubbles (NBs) hold significant promise in the fields of water treatment and environmental remediation due to their remarkable stability and longevity. Despite evidence of the stability of bulk nanobubbles (BNBs) in water, the underlying mechanisms of their stability remain elusive, with a notable gap in understanding the role of surface electronegativity in NBs' stability. In this work, an all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been used to investigate the stability characteristics of individual BNBs and the aggregation behavior of double BNB clusters, incorporating the influence of the electrical double layer (EDL). The stability of individual BNBs is evaluated through analysis of the gas-liquid interface's high-density layer, the structure of the EDL, and the hydrogen bond (HB) network. A stabilization mechanism is proposed based on the surface electronegativity of BNBs. Meanwhile, the simultaneous construction of a double BNBs stability model reveals that nanobubble aggregation is the result of a competitive mechanism of van der Waals gravity and electrostatic repulsion. The validity of the proposed model is also verified by comparing the particle size and zeta tests of BNB solutions prepared with two gases with the nanobubble diameters and electrostatic energy obtained from the simulation model. A critical distance of 10 Å is determined, beyond which BNBs are less likely to coalesce. It is observed that the majority of BNBs are influenced by significantly greater electrostatic forces compared to the van der Waals force, which is hypothesized to be the main contributor to their stability.
40204661	Estimates of black carbon emissions from global biomass burning for the period 1997-2023.	Estimating black carbon (BC) emissions from biomass burning is crucial for accurately assessing the climate impact of this pollutant. In this study, we have estimated BC emissions from biomass burning in different geographic regions worldwide at a resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° from 1997 to 2023. These findings are crucial for accurately modeling the impact of BC on global climatic forcing. Over the past 27 years, the emissions of BC from global biomass burning activities have remained stable. The high BC emissions between 2003 and 2008 were associated with increased precipitation. The Southern Hemisphere South America (SHSA) and Southern Hemisphere Africa (SHAF) regions have emerged as the primary contributors, accounting for approximately 40% of total BC emissions originating from global biomass burning sources and high BC emissions in the southern hemisphere's spring. This study also reveals that BC emissions in the SHAF region during 1997-2023 exhibit a granger causal relationship with Antarctic sea ice loss at a 2-year lag, but the impact intensity demonstrates significant temporal heterogeneity. This study enhances our understanding of temporal and spatial variations in global BC release caused by biomass burning while providing fundamental data for international departments responsible for managing such activities.

40204658	TRIM21-NUP98 Interface Accommodates Structurally Diverse Molecular Glue Degraders.	Molecular glue degraders enable targeted protein degradation by bridging interactions between target proteins and E3 ubiquitin ligases. Whereas some target-E3 interfaces exhibit the capacity to accommodate structurally diverse degraders, the extent of this adaptability across molecular glue targets remains unclear. We recently identified (<i>S</i>)-ACE-OH as a molecular glue degrader that recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 to the nuclear pore complex by recognizing NUP98, thereby inducing the degradation of nuclear pore proteins. Here, we analyzed public compound toxicity data across a large collection of cell lines and identified two additional molecular glue degraders, PRLX 93936 and BMS-214662, which engage the TRIM21-NUP98 interface to induce selective degradation of nuclear pore proteins. Additionally, we confirmed that HGC652, another TRIM21-dependent molecular glue degrader, also binds at this interface. Together with our previously characterized degrader (<i>S</i>)-ACE-OH, these findings demonstrate that the TRIM21-NUP98 interface can accommodate structurally diverse molecular glue degraders.
40204657	Nickel-Catalyzed Umpolung Difluoroalkylation of Imines Enables General Access to β-Difluoroalkylated Amines.	Fluoroalkylated amines play a pivotal role in medicinal chemistry, yet the general and efficient synthesis of β-difluoroalkylated amines remains elusive. Here, we developed a nickel-catalyzed umpolung strategy that enables the difluoroalkylation of 2-azaallyl anions generated from aliphatic and aromatic imines, effectively overcoming the previous limitations. By inverting the polarity of imines, this strategy allows for the coupling of a variety of readily accessible difluoroalkyl bromides and iodides. This approach is characterized by its high efficiency, broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and ease of synthesis. The rapid modification of bioactive molecules by the efficient synthesis of difluorinated analogs of key amine moieties present in bioactive molecules, including amphetamine, using the current approach shows the promising potential of this protocol in advancing drug discovery and development.
40204656	One-Step Fabrication of Packaged Glass Microheater Using Selective Laser Welding.	The increasing demand for miniaturized and versatile microdevices has driven advancements in micropatterning technologies; however, packaging considerations are often overlooked or addressed with basic additions. This study introduces a new selective laser welding process facilitated by a silver (Ag) thin film, enabling simultaneous micropatterning and packaging in a single step. In the proposed method, the Ag thin film serves as a laser absorber in the welded area, where it transitions to a fully insulating state, while in the unwelded areas, the remaining Ag thin film serves as an electrode without transitions. Mathematical modeling and heat transfer simulations were conducted to examine the laser energy transfer mechanism and determine the optimal thickness of the Ag thin film. Laser scan paths were designed for the Joule heating microheater and generated for subsequent selective laser welding. The designed microheater was fabricated and hermetically packaged between the glass substrates. Finally, a reusable cell culture tester was fabricated to demonstrate the practical applicability of the packaged glass microheater. The prototype was directly applicable to cell culture without requiring additional packaging. Moreover, it demonstrated consistent heating performance even after washing for reuse, indicating its feasibility for reusable devices. These results indicate that the proposed selective laser welding process, demonstrating the potential for advancing micropatterning and packaging technologies with diverse applications, is a promising approach for manufacturing packaged microdevices.
40204655	Layer-by-Layer Interdigitated CuS/Au<sub>2</sub>S Heteronanoplates by Selectively Blocking the Pathway of Cation Exchange Reaction.	Cation exchange reactions (CERs), recognized as a promising postsynthetic modification strategy, have garnered significant interest for generating thermodynamically unfavorable structural features, such as heterointerfaces. The formation of these heterointerfaces, which exhibit physicochemical properties distinct from those of their individual components, relies on precise control over the diffusion pathways of externally introduced cations as they migrate from the surface into the crystal interior. However, achieving regiospecific modulation of cation diffusion to rationally design heterointerfaces remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we synthesized layer-by-layer interdigitated {CuS/Au<sub>2</sub>S}@IrS<sub>2</sub> heteronanoplates (L-Au<sub>2</sub>S HNPs), in which Au<sub>2</sub>S and CuS are alternately stacked at the atomic scale, using Cu<sub>1.81</sub>S@IrS<sub>2</sub> nanoplates (CSIS NPs) as a starting template. This distinct structural arrangement was realized through a two-step CER with Au cations and a phase transformation process from Cu<sub>2-<i>x</i></sub>S to CuS. Experimental results indicate that S-S bonds within phase-converted CuS crystals act as diffusion barriers during subsequent CER, restricting the migration of Au cations into specific CuS layers. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest that the expansion of the anion sublattice within channels containing diffused Au cations induces compressive strain in adjacent CuS layers, thereby impeding further Au incorporation. Expanding this synthetic strategy to construct atomic-layer-level stacked heteronanostructures across a broader range of materials could unlock new opportunities for developing advanced materials with unprecedented optical and catalytic properties.

40204652	Effects of Chirality and Counter Anions on the Structures and Solid-state Properties of Radical Cation Salts of Benzo[b]phenoxazine-based Double Heterohelicene.	In this study, we prepared stable radical cation salts of racemic and enantiopure double hetero[5]helicene (1), consisting of two benzo[b]phenoxazine (BPO) molecules, using two different counter anions (SbCl6- and NTf2-). The effects of chirality and counter anions on the packing structure and solid-state electronic properties were investigated. X-ray single-crystal analysis revealed that the SbCl6- anion was positioned above the midpoint of 1·+ in both the racemic and enantiopure crystals of 1·+·SbCl6-. This alignment resulted from the matching between the curvature of 1·+ and the spherical shape of the SbCl6- anion, preventing the formation of continuous π-π interactions among 1·+. In contrast, one-dimensional π-stacked columns of 1·+ were present in both the racemic and enantiopure 1·+·NTf2- crystals, as the NTf2- anions encased the π-stacked columns of 1·+. All radical cation salts exhibited distinct melting points, and the enantiopure salts of 1·+·NTf2- had notably low melting points of 393-395 K, which was 142 K lower than that of rac-1·+·NTf2-. ESR and SQUID measurements of the enantiopure 1·+·NTf2- crystals revealed significant changes in their magnetic properties upon crystal melting. In contrast, rac-1·+·NTf2- displayed an unexpected crystal-crystal phase transition near room temperature, accompanied by a thermal hysteresis loop in its magnetic susceptibility.

This study aimed to understand the experiences of older adults who participated in a interorganizational and intergenerational initiative, the Senior to Senior Dinner Dance. Responses to open-ended survey questions from 69 older adult participants were analyzed using a thematic analysis, which elucidated three themes: (a) remaining active; (b) instigating social interactions; and, (c) adjusting to new social roles. Findings suggest opportunities for social workers to partner with others in community-based organizations to facilitate meaningful intergenerational activities for older adults who wish to remain physically and socially active in later life.

40204649	A Hypoxia-Triggered Bioreduction of Hydrophilic Type I Photosensitizer for Switchable In Vivo Photoacoustic Imaging and High-Specificity Cancer Phototherapy.	Considering that hypoxia is strongly connected with tumor proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and drug resistance, it is of significant implication for alleviating the effects of hypoxia in tumor treatment. The negligible oxygen-dependent nature of type I photosensitizers (PSs) has made them appropriate candidates for the treatment of hypoxic tumors. However, the lack of effective molecular design approaches, the phototoxicity of PSs to normal tissue before and after treatment, and the drawbacks of poor hydrophilicity severely hinder the development of PSs in hypoxic tumor therapy. Thus, developing a hydrophilic PS with good hypoxia resistance and minimal side effects is an urgent but challenging problem. Herein, we present a nanotheranostic (NanoPcN8O) based on the self-assembly of a hydrophilic phthalocyanine (PcN8O), a hypoxia-responsive bioreductive photosensitizer suitable for activatable photoacoustic (PA) imaging and tumor therapy. Hypoxic regions in various tumors exhibit strong reductive capability, and only in such condition did NanoPcN8O feature multiple N-oxide groups that could be bioreduced to yield the product NanoPcN8 with abundant electron-rich tertiary amine groups, which switches on the type I photodynamic and photothermal effects. Better still, NanoPcN8O achieved hypoxia-induced selective PA imaging in a preclinical model. Based on these merits, such nanotheranostic demonstrated remarkable phototherapeutic efficiency with high biosafety.
40204648	YOPRO-1: A Cyanine-Based Molecular Rotor Probe for Amyloid Fibril Detection.	The widespread occurrence of amyloidosis in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, highlights the urgent need for early detection methods. Traditional approaches often fall short in sensitivity, specificity, and the ability to operate within complex biological matrices. Fluorescence spectroscopy, which leverages the unique properties of extrinsic fluorescence sensors, has emerged as a promising avenue for amyloid detection. Thioflavin-T (ThT), while extensively utilized, faces several disadvantages such as poor blood-brain barrier penetration, short emission wavelength, and lack of sensitivity to oligomeric protein aggregates. These limitations necessitate the development of improved amyloid probes with enhanced properties for the better detection and understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, YOPRO-1, a cyanine-based molecular rotor probe, has been identified as a potent amyloid fibril sensor characterized by its turn-on fluorescence response and specificity for amyloid fibrils over native protein forms. Utilizing a variety of spectroscopic techniques, including steady-state emission, ground-state absorption, time-resolved fluorescence, and molecular docking, we demonstrate the superior selectivity and sensitivity of YOPRO-1 for amyloid fibrils. The probe exhibits a remarkable 245-fold increase in fluorescence intensity upon binding to insulin fibrils, which is a common amyloid model. This capability facilitates its application in complex biological matrices, such as high-percentage human serum, which has rarely been demonstrated by previous amyloid sensing probes. Furthermore, the commercial availability of YOPRO-1 avoids the challenges associated with the synthesis of specific probes, thereby marking a significant advancement in amyloid detection methodologies. Our findings highlight the potential of YOPRO-1 as a versatile and effective tool for the early diagnosis of amyloid-related diseases, offering a foundation for future therapeutic and diagnostic applications.
40204647	ATP-Assisted Electron and Proton Transfer Boosting Redox Metabolism-Induced Ferroptosis and Apoptosis for Cancer Therapy.	Compared to the intractability of traditional apoptosis, the vulnerability exposed by cancer cell metabolic reprogramming provides an advantage for ferroptosis treatment. Herein, we developed vanadate and aurintricarboxylic acid coordination nanoparticles (VAP NPs) that synergistically trigger dual cell death pathways. This nanoplatform leveraged dual-Russell mechanisms and Fenton reactions to generate singlet oxygen/hydroxyl radicals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) while depleting glutathione via vanadium redox cycling, thereby silencing glutathione peroxidase 4 and modulating the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)/Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) axis. Notably, TME-overexpressed adenosine triphosphate (ATP) acted as a biochemical catalyst, accelerating the transfer of protons and electrons during reactive oxygen species generation to amplify therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, VAP NPs could achieve outstanding efficacy for intrinsically stimulated synergy of ferroptosis and apoptosis in tumor therapy. This study provides reference for revealing the new function of ATP in enhancing the regulation of redox metabolism.
40204646	Positive Correlation Between Acetabular Anteversion and Abduction in Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip: A CT-Based Morphological Study.	Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) exhibits abnormalities in hip anatomy, so changes in the acetabular and femoral angles hold clinical relevance. This study aimed to investigate the correlations between acetabular anteversion (AAV) and acetabular abduction (AAB), as well as between combined anteversion and combined abduction in patients with DDH, attempting to give evidence for synchronous torsion of the proximal femur and acetabulum. This study also aimed to propose a new method for predicting acetabular anteversion and combined anteversion angles, respectively, based on acetabular abduction and combined abduction angles on conventional pelvic radiographs.
40204645	Regiospecific Halogenation Modulates Molecular Dipoles in Self-Assembled Monolayers for High-Performance Organic Solar Cells.	Halogenated carbazole-derived self-assembled monolayers (SAM) are promising hole-extraction materials in conventional organic solar cells (OSC). While halogenation helps optimize the molecular dipole, intermolecular interactions, and energetics of SAM, the highly polarizable carbon-halogen bonds can be reactive and prone to photocleavage depending on their regiochemistry. Herein, we study the regiospecific properties, including the intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential distribution, and changes in molecular dipole of the brominated SAM molecules by brominating a helical 7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazole-based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring stronger dipole. Additionally, a correlation between the intrinsic molecular stability and the derived SAM surface stability is established to determine the performance and stability of the OSCs. Notably, the bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with dense assembly promoted by the synergistically enhanced intermolecular interactions and crystallinity, JJ26 can efficiently modulate the work function of ITO and enhance the stability of SAM under external stress. Consequently, the JJ26 derived OSC shows significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. This work shows that the precise modulation of regio-chemistry of SAM molecules is critical for improving their quality and derived device performance.
40204644	Pterostilbene Potentiates the NGF-TrkA Signaling Pathway, Enhancing Differentiation in PC12 Cells.	Pterostilbene, a stilbenoid found in vegetables and natural products, has therapeutic potential due to its multiple pharmacological actions. In the brain, the nerve growth factor (NGF) is a pivotal neurotrophic factor, serving for neuronal survival and differentiation. The decline in NGF levels in aged individuals contributes to the development of neurodegenerative processes and cognitive impairment. Here, we aim to explore the effect of pterostilbene on promoting neuron-like differentiation in PC12 cells, a well-established model to study neuronal differentiation, by potentiating the functions of NGF. Molecular docking and ultrafiltration assays were performed to examine the direct binding of pterostilbene with NGF. The mechanisms underlying the stimulation of PC12 cell differentiation, characterized by enhanced neurite outgrowth and increased neurofilament expression, were determined through TrkA/Akt/CREB signaling pathways. The combined treatment of pterostilbene with a low dose of NGF significantly potentiated the NGF-induced neurite extension and neurofilament expression. Pterostilbene enhanced the effect of NGF on promoting neuron-like differentiation, which was related to increased activation of the TrkA signaling pathway. This upstream event was associated with increased phosphorylation of Akt and CREB. The selective inhibitors of TrkA (K252a) and PI3K/Akt (LY294002) were applied to validate the NGF/TrkA/Akt signaling pathways leading to diminished neurite outgrowth and reduced expression of neurofilaments in cells treated with pterostilbene and NGF. Taken together, the results indicate that pterostilbene could potentiate NGF/TrkA activity, enhancing neuron-like differentiation in PC12 cells under a low concentration of NGF. These findings suggest that the application of pterostilbene could be a promising alternative therapeutic strategy to improve NGF efficacy.

40204637	The prion-family protein Doppel exerts a protective role during influenza virus infection.	The cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC), known for its involvement as a misfolded isoform in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, has recently been identified to exert a protective effect against viral infections. In this study, we explored the role of 2 other prion family members, Shadoo and Doppel, in protection against influenza A virus infection in mice. Lung expression levels of these genes revealed marked differences, with high expression of PrPC, low expression of Doppel, while Shadoo remained undetectable. Mice genetically knocked out for the genes encoding PrPC, Prnp-/- or Doppel, Prnd-/-, showed increased susceptibility to the virus, resulting in elevated morbidity compared with wild-type mice and mice knocked out for Shadoo, Sprn-/-. Unlike previous results observed in Prnp-/- mice, the absence of Doppel does not show enhancing effect on virus replication levels. Histological analysis of lung tissue from Prnd-/- mice revealed no difference in lesion size and severity compared with wild-type mice. However, transcriptomic analysis on day 7 postinfection revealed distinct signatures in Prnd-/- mice, highlighting the role of specific genes associated with polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells. Bronchoalveolar lavages confirmed a substantial neutrophil influx and increased inflammatory markers in the lungs of Prnd-/- mice. Neutrophil depletion experiments demonstrated a direct link between excessive neutrophil influx and increased susceptibility, mitigating pathology and partially restoring a wild-type phenotype in Prnd-/- mice. These findings underscore the complex role of Doppel in modulating the host immune response to influenza virus infection, particularly in regulating neutrophil recruitment and its implications on disease outcomes.
40204636	Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and MECR regulate CD4+ T cell function and oxidative metabolism.	Imbalanced effector and regulatory CD4+ T cell subsets drive many inflammatory diseases. These T cell subsets rely on distinct metabolic programs, modulation of which differentially affects T cell fate and function. Lipid metabolism is fundamental yet remains poorly understood across CD4+ T cell subsets. Therefore, we performed targeted in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify lipid metabolism genes and pathways essential for T cell functions. These screens established mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis genes Mecr, Mcat, and Oxsm as key metabolic regulators. Of these, the inborn error of metabolism gene Mecr was most dynamically regulated. Mecrfl/fl; Cd4cre mice had normal naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers, demonstrating that MECR is not essential in homeostatic conditions. However, effector and memory T cells were reduced in Mecr knockout and MECR-deficient CD4+ T cells and proliferated, differentiated, and survived less well than control T cells. Interestingly, T cells ultimately showed signs of mitochondrial stress and dysfunction in the absence of MECR. Mecr-deficient T cells also had decreased mitochondrial respiration, reduced tricarboxylic acid intermediates, and accumulated intracellular iron, which appeared to contribute to increased cell death and sensitivity to ferroptosis. Importantly, MECR-deficient T cells exhibited fitness disadvantages and were less effective at driving disease in an in vivo model of inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, MECR-mediated metabolism broadly supports CD4+ T cell proliferation and survival in vivo. These findings may also provide insight to the immunological state of MECR- and other mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis-deficient patients.
40204635	Serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels as a predictive biomarker for cytokine-induced killer cell immunotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer.	Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, as an adoptive immunotherapy, are effective at treating colorectal cancer (CRC). However, whether an individual can benefit from CIK cell therapy remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the long-term effects of CIK cell therapy and specifically the relationship between tumor-associated antigen expression and the survival benefit of CIK cell therapy in patients with CRC. We conducted a retrospective clinical study of 98 patients with CRC who were pathologically diagnosed between 2010 and 2014. Of the patients in the study, 48 received surgery and/or chemotherapy (control group), and 50 received CIK cell infusion with chemotherapy or surgery (CIK group). CIK cells exhibited significant antitumor activity, expressing high levels of CD107 and increasing the apoptosis of CRC cells in vitro. Survival analysis showed that adjuvant CIK cell immunotherapy improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with CRC. Moreover, OS and PFS improved significantly, irrespective of the stage of the disease. Furthermore, CIK cell adjuvant therapy significantly increased OS and PFS in patients with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels lower than 5 ng/ml before surgery, but not in patients with CEA levels above 5 ng/ml. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that CEA expression is an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS in the CIK cell treatment group. Adjuvant CIK cell therapy is an effective strategy for prolonging OS and PFS in patients with CRC, especially in those with serum CEA levels below 5 ng/ml.
40204633	Employing a Highly Potent Fluorescence Probe to Discover a PARP-1/2 Binder and the Complex Structures Analysis.	Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases-1/2(PARP-1/2) has been identified as important anti-tumor drug targets, and the development of PARP-1/2 inhibitors featuring novel structures is still a promising strategy for cancer treatments. In this work, a highly potent PARP-1/2 probe with a quinazolinone scaffold was designed and synthesized, showing dissociation constants (Kd) of 2.07 nM and 1.6 nM towards catPARP-1 and catPARP-2SE. By employing this probe to screen an in-house compound library, compound A bearing a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxamide scaffold was disclosed as a structurally novel PARP-1/2 binder, which had dissociation constants of 5.6 μM and 7.9 μM for catPARP-1 and catPARP-2SE in the Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) assay. Moreover, the crystal structures of compound A in complex with PARP-1 and PARP-2 catalytic domains were solved to reveal the binding modes of this compound, and these two complex structures were analyzed with IGMH method at GFN2-xTB and B3LYP levels. Interestingly, this compound presented significant differences in binding modes within PARP-1 and PARP-2. These results could provide a structural basis for the discovery of novel PARP-1 or PARP-2 selective inhibitors by taking compound A as a template structure.

40204628	Parents facing polygenic embryo scores: the 'best choice of a best life' and psychological counselling.	Advances in reproductive medicine and genetic technologies now offer prospective parents the option to test IVF embryos for genetic predispositions to complex diseases, such as coronary heart disease and psychiatric disorders, through polygenic embryo screening (PES). However, limited clinical data on its real-world use leaves parents facing complex decisions based on probabilistic risk scores, requiring them to weigh uncertain benefits against potential harms. While clinical, ethical, and societal concerns regarding PES have been extensively discussed, the psychological considerations have received less attention. This paper highlights the importance of decision aids as part of psychological interventions, which are crucial for helping parents navigate these choices and make informed decisions based on individual perceptions and experiences. Additionally, determining how and when to disclose genetic risk information to children presents significant challenges for families. Early disclosure may lead to anxiety, while withholding information could undermine trust later in life. Psychological counseling is therefore an essential component in supporting families through these sensitive decisions. While PES offers opportunities to reduce genetic risks, it also introduces significant challenges that require thoughtful consideration and comprehensive support for both parents and children.

40204625	Barriers to healthcare access for irregular immigrants after their arrival in Spain: a systematic review.	Examining the barriers encountered by irregular immigrants in accessing the public health system is crucial for the continuity of healthcare processes. This approach not only heightens patient-centered care but also fosters long-term public health preparedness and social cohesion. The aim of this review was to examine the existing barriers to accessing the Spanish healthcare system for the immigrant population. A systematic review of original articles was conducted based on the PRISMA methodology. Studies registered in PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, and Enfispo were analyzed. A total of 4773 articles were identified, of which 15 were selected for review. Among the selected articles, 10 employed qualitative methodologies, 1 utilized a mixed methodology, and 4 used quantitative methodologies. A variety of access barriers related to communication, administrative issues, and misinformation about legal aspects were identified. It was noted that one in five immigrants has experienced at least one barrier to accessing the Spanish healthcare system. Barriers to access to the health system are clearly shared by both immigrants and healthcare professionals. Barriers to access to the health system are a result of the coalition of organizational factors, cultural experiences, and socioeconomic and educational determinants. Access to healthcare for irregular migrants in Spain is hindered by language barriers, misinformation, and administrative obstacles, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies are needed to ensure equitable care, enhance communication, streamline procedures, and strengthen collaboration with non-governmental organizations and cultural mediators to optimize healthcare responses.

40204561	Increased Mechanical Index Improves Shear Wave Elastography: Pilot Study of Signal Enhancement.	Monitoring liver stiffness is essential for managing chronic liver disease, which poses a major public health challenge. Shear wave elastography (SWE), a non-invasive ultrasound-based technique, is commonly used to quantify liver stiffness. However, its performance can be compromised in individuals with higher body mass indices (BMIs) due to increased ultrasound absorption and distortion. Increasing the intensity of the ultrasound push beam could potentially improve signal quality, but regulatory limits currently restrict this due to safety concerns. This pilot study investigated the efficacy of increasing the push pulse mechanical index (MI) from a conventional value of 1.4 to 2.5 toward improving signal quality, and reducing measurement variability and failure rates.

40204524	Evaluation of psychosocial hazards and their effects on safety culture in mining with structural equation modeling.	<i>Objectives.</i> Psychosocial hazards causing stress in the workplace are one of the sources of danger to be considered in risk assessment. In this study, to determine the exposure of employees to psychosocial hazards, a questionnaire was created with occupational health and safety (OHS) professionals and psychiatrists based on the work created by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) on work stress. <i>Methods.</i> The questionnaire was applied to 306 mining workers and the interaction levels of psychosocial hazards were evaluated using structural equation modeling (SEM). <i>Results.</i> The psychosocial hazard assessment scale (PHAS) was developed and used to investigate the effects of other factors on the safety culture of employees. <i>Conclusion.</i> The study determined that employees who are worried about being unemployed reflect their social problems in work life and have difficulty in following OHS rules. Employees who have a clear role in a company with a developed organizational culture have a better safety culture. The study also determined that employees working in workplaces where the management looks positively toward OHS improvements try to act in accordance with the OHS rules.

40204500	Bilateral ovarian abscesses due to <i>Salmonella</i> Paratyphi A in a patient with endometriosis in Southern India: a diagnostic dilemma.	Enteric fever is a multisystem febrile illness caused by <i>Salmonella enterica</i> subspecies <i>enterica</i> serovar Typhi, Paratyphi A, B and C. It is usually transmitted through contaminated food and water. The disease usually manifests as a febrile illness with bacteraemia after the initial entry through the gastrointestinal tract. However, extraintestinal seeding of this pathogen can occur in rare instances. Here, we report a case of chocolate cysts of the ovaries which was infected with <i>Salmonella</i> Paratyphi A in a sexually active woman with a previous history of enteric fever that was neglected. We review the key features of this case and the last literature on ovarian abscess due to <i>Salmonella</i> sp.
40204497	Finishing efficiencies of additive-manufactured Co-Cr alloy and Ti alloy clasps.	Additive-manufactured (AMed) Co-Cr and Ti alloy clasps were made with five surface treatments. Either one of a conventional freehand finishing or barrel finishing as a medium finishing process or one of a freehand, dry electrolytic, or magnetic polishings was selected as the final polishing process. After each surface treatment, the polishing efficiencies of the AMed clasps were evaluated as to surface roughness, fitness accuracy, and retentive forces. By surface treatments without using magnetic polishing, sufficient surface smoothness was observed for both alloys. Under all five treatment conditions, better fitness accuracies and sufficient retentive forces were obtained in all Co-Cr and Ti alloy clasps for clinically acceptable results. A combination of barrel finishing and dry electro-polishing can be recommended as the automatic finishing technology, replacing the freehand polishing process by dental technicians. The findings of this study will significantly reduce the workload of dental technicians.
40204496	Enhanced infiltration of myoblasts into collagen scaffolds loaded with engineered basic fibroblast growth factor.	Tongue reconstruction after cancer resection often involves the use of free skin flaps. However, this strategy has limitations. To overcome these issues, tissue engineering approaches using basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been investigated to promote tongue muscle regeneration. In this study, a chimeric protein consisting of bFGF and a collagen-binding peptide (CBP-bFGF) was evaluated for its ability to promote myoblast infiltration into collagen-based scaffolds. Results showed that CBP-bFGF promoted the migration of C2C12 myoblasts and their infiltration into collagen sponges. Based on these observations, we propose that the binding of CBP-bFGF with a collagen sponge provides one of the options for accelerating tongue muscle regeneration.
40204495	Novel bioactive glass-based cement with LDN-193189: Insights from dental pulp cell interaction.	Bioceramic materials like bioactive glass (BG) are widely used in endodontics due to their bioactivity and osteoinductive properties. This study characterized fluorescence-labeled porcine immortalized dental pulp cells (DsRed-PPU7 cells) in contact with BG-based cement (BG-C) to advance the development of novel BG-C formulations. BG-C discs were prepared on titanium discs, and DsRed-PPU7 cells were cultured on them. The effects of bone morphogenetic protein-2, transforming growth factor beta-1, and their inhibitors (LDN-193189 and SB-431542) on cell proliferation and mineralization were investigated. Additionally, a new BG-C disc containing LDN-193189 (LDN-BG-C) was developed and tested. The LDN-193189 significantly promoted cell proliferation and mineralization. On LDN-BG-C discs, the formation of petal-like spherical precipitates with hydroxyapatite-like structures was observed, aligning with the cell localization sites. We propose that BG-C discs containing LDN-193189 induces the differentiation of dental pulp cells into odontoblast, and promotes the formation of dentin-like crystals.
40204494	Influence of bonding agents on metal-ceramic bond strengths for Co-Cr alloy.	This study investigated the influence of bonding agents on metal-ceramic bond strengths before porcelain veneering for cobalt-chromium alloy. Three ceramic systems: Initial MC (IMC), Hera Ceram (HC), and ZEO CE LIGHT (ZCL) were tested on wrought substructures. The ZCL system was also tested on cast substructures. Three-point bending test was performed, and fractured surfaces were analyzed using electron-probe microanalysis and X-ray diffraction. The bond strengths of all specimens exceeded the requirements of ISO 9693:2019 (>25 MPa). The ZCL bonding agent significantly improved bond strengths for wrought and cast substructures whereas the IMC and HC bonding agents did not. Wrought-ZCL specimens exhibited significantly higher bond strengths than cast-ZCL specimens. In the specimens exhibiting higher bond strength, silicon and titanium, which originated from the bonding agent, were predominantly detected at the debonded metallic surfaces. Consequently, the bonding agent positively affected the bond strength but depended on the ceramic system and substructure type.

An alkali-treated titanium layer with a porous nanonetwork structure (TNS) promotes cell adhesion and produces a stronger osseointegration effect than that of a non-treated titanium layer. In this study, the osseointegration effect of TNS was enhanced by incorporating an S-PRG eluate solution. The efficiencies of TNS coatings with different S-PRG concentrations were determined by performing surface analysis, cell experiments, and animal experiments. The results revealed that the introduction of the S-PRG eluate solution promoted the osteogenic ability of TNS. The combination of these two materials offers a novel approach to the investigation of oral implant materials.
40204492	Dentin bonding performance of the new self-adhesive resin composite.	This study aimed to evaluate the initial bond strength to dentin with a new self-adhesive resin composite containing a hydrophilic amide monomer using a micro tensile bond strength (μTBS) test. Specimens were ground with #600 SiC. Including a Cleafil Universal Bond Quick ER (UBQ) and resin composite, a new self-adhesive resin composite (SA-100R; SAR), and a commercially self-adhesive resin composite (Constic; CON), were tested. Adhesion procedures were conducted according to each manufacturer's instructions. Specimens were stored for 24 h in water at 37ºC, then cut into a 1.0×1.0 mm beams. μTBS tests were conducted at a cross-head speed of 1.0 mm/min. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction. SAR exhibited values significantly higher than CON (p<0.05), probably due to the improved dentin diffusion by the amide monomer. SAR exhibited stronger adhesion than the CON, shows a high potential for use in various clinical applications, e.g., home-visit dental care.
40204469	Risk factors and prediction for pediatric obesity: current status and future perspectives.	Childhood obesity is a growing global health concern, contributing to numerous non-communicable diseases and long-term health complications. The prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents continues to rise, driven by complex interactions among various factors. The key risk factors include both environmental and genetic influences. Environmental factors include family elements like household conditions and lifestyle, while genetic factors refer to inherited predispositions. More recently, epigenetic factors have gained attention, focusing on chemical modifications such as DNA methylation that are influenced by the prenatal and early-life environment and may contribute to obesity risk. Unlike obesity in adults, the risk factors for obesity in children are largely dependent on their family environments rather than individual behaviors. For effective intervention, it is important to identify at-risk children and their families as early as possible after birth. Despite advances in machine learning, polygenic risk scores, and epigenomic markers-which show promise as being more accurate and comprehensive prediction methods-no risk prediction models are currently in clinical use. Achieving predictions with higher accuracy, external validation, and consideration of population-specific factors (e.g., ethnic variability) while avoiding bias or stigma in targeted interventions is needed for effective childhood obesity prevention. Herein, we summarize environmental, genetic, and epigenetic risk factors for childhood obesity and review the unique situations and regional factors in Japan, which are the focus of our study. Furthermore, we introduce the major advances in risk prediction models for childhood obesity.
40204468	Developing a framework for monitoring the stages towards achieving effective coverage and equity for maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition interventions.	Reaching the Sustainable Development Goal 2030 global mortality and morbidity targets will require increased access to essential health services. Scaling high-impact health interventions within the public sector is complex; delineation of the pathway to scale for each intervention within each distinct geography is important for prioritising actions to advance interventions towards effective coverage. Following a review of 38 theoretical frameworks describing pathways for scaling health system interventions, we developed, tested and refined a new schema-the Stages of Achieving Effective Coverage and Equity Framework-for use to describe the status of policy adoption, implementation and coverage of key maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition (MNCHN) interventions. We propose a framework with six domains (global, national, systems, implementation, availability and coverage) covering 26 critical milestones with identified corresponding, intervention-specific indicators. Our framework was validated by the alignment of over 83 000 data points sourced from document review, interviews and global or country surveys. Visualisations are presented to highlight how the framework is operationalised to assess scale-up progress. We outline our process of conceptualising and developing a new framework and articulate its use case for action-oriented monitoring of progress towards effective coverage through applied examples in key geographies. Our framework offers an easy-to-follow implementation pathway and a set of common policy and implementation indicators to monitor scale-up towards effective coverage that uses existing secondary data sources where available. Achieving prioritised maternal, newborn and child health targets requires scalable implementation strategies for lifesaving interventions, alongside monitoring progress towards achieving scale.
40204467	Estimating the effects of interventions on increasing vaccination: systematic review and meta-analysis.	As global vaccination rates have reached their lowest point in nearly 15 years, effective interventions are being required globally to promote vaccination; however, there is a lack of rigorous evaluation of the effect of various interventions. Through a global synthesis, we analysed data from approximately 6 125 795 participants across 319 studies in 41 countries to reveal the global landscape of four intervention themes and to assess their effectiveness in increasing vaccination rates. We found an overall positive effect of the interventions across four main themes on improving vaccination. Specifically, dialogue-based interventions increased vaccination rates by 43.1% (95% CI: 29.8 to 57.9%, with effect sizes measured as relative risks (RRs)), though they may not always be effective in adolescents or in the sample with a higher percentage of male participants. Incentive-based interventions, whether implemented alone or combined with other intervention themes, failed to demonstrate a significant effect in children. Reminder/recall-based interventions were also effective for promoting vaccination (38.5% increase, 95% CI: 28.9 to 48.9%), particularly for completing vaccine series. Multi-component interventions exhibited excellent effectiveness in vaccination (54.3% increase, 95% CI: 40.5 to 69.6%), with the combination of dialogue, incentive and reminder/recall proving more effective than other multi-component interventions, but showing no significant effects in populations with high initial vaccination rates. However, we found that in most cases combining additional interventions with a single intervention may not significantly improve their effectiveness, especially for incentive-based interventions, but dialogue-based and reminder/recall-based interventions appear to be beneficial in some specific combinations. These findings underscore the importance of governments, public health officials and advocacy groups implementing appropriate vaccine interventions by selecting interventions tailored to specific populations, strategically promoting the completion of vaccine series and effectively combining interventions to promote global vaccination and save more lives.
40204466	Clinical prediction models to diagnose neonatal sepsis in low-income and middle-income countries: a scoping review.	Neonatal sepsis causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide but is difficult to diagnose clinically. Clinical prediction models (CPMs) could improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitating earlier treatment for cases and avoiding antibiotic overuse. Neonates in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected by sepsis, yet no review has comprehensively synthesised evidence for CPMs validated in this setting.

40204464	Is 'gender equality in health' the right goal? Exploring issues of definition and measurement.	Achieving 'gender equality in health' has been advocated by many as a key goal in health globally; however, we observe this goal has been defined differently by different users. In this paper, we explore the question of how progress towards gender equality in health has been defined and measured, and how the selection of indicators and targets can influence perceptions of who in a population is suffering disadvantage. We summarise the common population health measures-such as life expectancy and risk exposure-and illustrate how each of these measures may lead to different conclusions about gender equality in health. We call for more specificity when defining and measuring gender inequality in health, and propose expanding the focus from 'gender inequalities' (comparison between genders) to also addressing 'within-gender inequities' (a focus that incorporates addressing inequities within different gender identity groups).
40204463	Impact of increasing CD4 count threshold eligibility for antiretroviral therapy initiation on advanced HIV disease and tuberculosis prevalence and incidence in South Africa: an interrupted time series analysis.	We investigated the impact of increasing CD4 count eligibility for antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on advanced HIV disease (AHD) and tuberculosis (TB) prevalence and incidence among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in South Africa.
40204462	Intersectional forces of urban inequality and the global HIV pandemic: a retrospective analysis.	To determine how the intersection of increased urban growth and poverty has impacted HIV incidence and prevalence, given growing HIV inequalities globally. Retrospective analysis using combined data from five publicly available, population-level datasets to determine city- and within-urban countrywide estimates of 95-95-95 treatment targets, prevalence and incidence rates from 2015 to 2019. For city-level estimates, we analysed combined data from: Fast-Track City (FTC), SINAN from Brazil and UNAIDS Naomi-Spectrum. Countrywide estimates of HIV prevalence in the urban slum versus non-slum since 2012 were compiled from Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) surveys in 12 countries and Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) in 28 countries. HIV prevalence is generally higher among the urban slum, compared to their non-slum counterparts, thus resulting in national HIV estimates masking nuances in HIV inequalities between the urban slum and non-slum. Specifically, national and city-level HIV estimates mask inequalities within and between cities, with secondary cities often having higher HIV prevalence and incidence rates than capital cities and large urban areas. The urban divide between slum and non-slum populations is a contributor to HIV inequality, often with poorer outcomes in smaller cities than their larger counterparts. Interventions tailored to cities, and particularly those considering local nuances in subpopulations (eg, different genders, ages, roles), are necessary to reduce HIV inequality. Focused HIV programming accounting for structural drivers of inequalities between urban slum and non-slum populations such as inequalities in wealth, education, employment and housing are crucial to closing gaps driving HIV inequalities globally.
40204461	Epidemiology of sepsis in hospitalised neonates in Indonesia: high burden of multidrug-resistant infections reveals poor coverage provided by recommended antibiotic regimens.	Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of child mortality, and this burden is rising secondary to increasing antimicrobial resistance worldwide. There are marked global disparities in the burden of antimicrobial resistance, with Southeast Asia identified as a region of particular concern. Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country, with 4.2 million babies born each year. Despite this, there remains limited published data on the burden of neonatal sepsis and antimicrobial resistance in the country.
40204460	Investigation of bovine leukemia virus seroprevalence and transmission risk classification based on blood proviral load in beef breeding cattle in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan.	This study investigated the seroprevalence of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in beef breeding cattle in Ibaraki, revealing a seroprevalence of 43.0% with a bimodal distribution in farms classified as either BLV-negative or very-highly infected. These results underscore the need to implement appropriate strategies for very-highly infected farms. In particular, determining the culling prioritization of cattle is absolutely necessary. It was revealed that effective control in very-highly infected farms is difficult based on types of operation or herd size. On the other hand, high-transmission-risk cattle were widely distributed across entire Ibaraki and were significantly more prevalent in very-highly infected farms. These findings suggest that the transmission risk classification is a potentially effective strategy for culling prioritization under the current circumstances in Ibaraki.
40204459	Dopamine D2 receptor agonists prevent impairment of maternal care in lipopolysaccharide-induced postpartum depression model mice.	Postpartum depression is a prevalent mental disorder that affects mothers and has adverse effects on families. The decline in parenting quality associated with postpartum depression raises concerns about the adverse impact on children. Therefore, it is desirable to prevent deterioration in parenting quality in depressed mothers. This study aims to investigate whether antidepressive agents can prevent the decline in parenting quality associated with postpartum depression. Maternal care and sucrose palatability were evaluated in postpartum female mice with intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration 24 hr before testing. In the maternal care test, LPS increased the latency to retrieving pups into the nest and to crouching over the pups in the nest and decreased the duration for crouching over the pups. Furthermore, in the sucrose preference test, the ratio of sucrose intake decreased. Next, dopamine D2 receptor agonists (quinpirole and bromocriptine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine), or a tricyclic antidepressant (imipramine) was intraperitoneally administered 30 min before LPS administration. Treatment with quinpirole and bromocriptine, but not fluoxetine and imipramine, decreased the crouching latency and increased the crouching duration in LPS-treated postpartum females. On the other hand, all of the antidepressive agents did not affect the ratio of sucrose intake. Furthermore, the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol disturbed the effects of quinpirole and bromocriptine on maternal care. These results indicate that dopamine D2 receptor agonists can prevent the decline in parenting quality via dopamine D2 receptor in LPS-induced postpartum depression model mice.
40204455	Added Value of Sodium MR Imaging and Proton MR Spectroscopy to Conventional MR Imaging for a Better Characterization of the Ischemic Stroke: A Narrative Review.	Stroke is a major cause of disability and death in adults worldwide. In clinical setting, time efficient MRI protocols including diffusion weighted images, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, fast T2*-weighted images and MR angiography aim to establish ischemic stroke diagnosis, visualize vessel occlusion and determine the extent of ischemia damage distinguishing between the salvageable ischemic penumbra and the infarct core. Thus, MRI plays a pivotal role in diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and prognostic assessment, although prediction based on these elements remains limited and can be improved. We reviewed the added-values of alternative MRI methods such as sodium(<sup>23</sup>Na) MRI and <sup>1</sup>H MR spectroscopic imaging that open new temporal and pathophysiological windows on ionic dys-homeostasis and metabolism alteration in the context of ischemic stroke and reperfusion. Insights on the timeline of the cellular events accessible using these alternative methods and perspectives to improve clinical outcome prediction of ischemic stroke patients are discussed.
40204452	Liver exposure during laparoscopic right-sided hepatectomy via stretching of the ligamentum teres hepatis: A propensity score matching analysis.	One of the challenges of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) is the exposure of the surgical field. We propose a new surgical approach to better expose the right liver, stretching of the ligamentum teres hepatis (SLTH), and we evaluated its clinical feasibility and limitations through a study analyzing relevant cases. Clinicopathologic data on patients who underwent laparoscopic right partial hepatectomy (LRPH) at our center were retrospectively collected, and subjects were 276 patients with liver space-occupying lesions who met the selection criteria and who underwent the new surgical approach (SLTH) or the conventional surgical approach (no stretching of the ligamentum teres hepatis, or NSLTH). After 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), 102 patients in each cohort were selected for further analysis. There were no significant differences in the operating time or the duration of postoperative hospitalization between the SLTH cohort and the NSLTH cohort. The duration of detachment of the hepatic parenchyma and the duration of hepatic portal occlusion were significantly shorter in the SLTH cohort than in the NSLTH cohort. The intraoperative blood loss in the SLTH cohort was significantly less than that in the NSLTH cohort. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were significantly lower in the SLTH cohort than in the NSLTH cohort on day 5 postoperatively. Results confirmed that SLTH is a simple, safe, effective, and highly reproducible technique for the treatment of LRPH. SLTH may help to perform LRPH by increasing the level of laparoscopic exposure of the right liver and reducing bleeding and operating time.

40204440	The administration of ketamine is associated with dose-dependent stabilization of cortical dynamics in humans.	During wakefulness, external stimuli elicit conscious experiences. In contrast, dreams and drug-induced dissociated states, are characterized by vivid internally generated conscious experiences and reduced ability to perceive external stimuli. Understanding the physiological distinctions between normal wakefulness and dissociated states may therefore disambiguate signatures of responsiveness to external stimuli from those that underlie conscious experience. The hypothesis that conscious experiences are associated with brain criticality has received considerable theoretical and experimental support. Consistent with this hypothesis, statistical signatures of criticality are similar in normal wakefulness and dissociative states but are abolished in dreamless sleep and under anesthesia. Thus, while statistical measures of criticality are associated with the ability to have conscious experience, they do not readily distinguish between perception of the external world from internally generated percepts. Here, we investigate distinct, dynamical, signatures of criticality during escalating ketamine doses in high-density EEG in human male volunteers. We show that during normal wakefulness, EEG is found at a critical point between damped and exploding oscillations. With increasing doses of ketamine, as dissociative symptoms intensify, activity is progressively stabilized - most prominently at higher frequencies. We also show that stabilization is a more reliable marker of the effects of ketamine than conventional measures such as power spectra. These findings suggest that stabilization of cortical dynamics correlates with decreased ability to respond to and perceive external stimuli rather than the ability to have conscious experiences per se. Altogether, these results suggest that combining statistical and dynamical criticality measures may distinguish wakefulness, dissociation, and unconsciousness.<b>Significance Statement</b> During wakefulness, external stimuli elicit sensory perceptions while during unconsciousness, perception is absent. Dissociated states of consciousness, including those induced by ketamine, feature internally generated experiences and, concomitantly, reduced responsiveness to stimuli. Both normal wakefulness and dissociated states have been linked to statistical criticality, a regime in which the brain operates at the transition between order and disorder. Here, we study a distinct notion of criticality - transition between stable and unstable oscillations and show that ketamine induces dose-dependent stabilization of normally critical brain dynamics. Thus, departure from dynamical criticality is associated with states of reduced responsiveness rather than unconsciousness. Combining statistical and dynamical criticality measures may better distinguish connected and dissociated states of consciousness.
40204439	Neuronal synchronization and bidirectional activity spread explain efficient swimming in a whole-body model of hydrozoan jellyfish.	Aquatic animals need tightly choreographed movements to efficiently navigate through open waters. Radially symmetric animals, like jellyfish, face the additional challenge of having to respond to regionalized sensory stimuli at the margin of their bell with an orchestrated motor response that initiates predation or escape. The nerve net of hydrozoan jellyfish comprises a condensed ring of electrically coupled neurons, that process sensory input and control the motor output. Here we aim to understand the coupling of neural activity and motor response by developing a biophysical computational model of the swimming-motor-net of a hydrozoan jellyfish and let it control a swimming jellyfish in a fluid simulation. We find that the neuron activity can synchronize while the signal travels around the ring, eventually triggering a bidirectional wave of activation in the muscles. This mechanism explains seemingly contradicting electrophysiological experiments and minimizes muscle contraction time. Hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that this setup enables symmetric movement even if neural input is highly asymmetric. We hypothesize that the development of this ring structure supports the jet propulsion by which hydrozoan jellyfish swim. These findings show the importance of considering whole body anatomy and movement when investigating neural design.<b>Significance Statement</b> Hydrozoan jellyfish use simple nerve nets for muscle activation to swim forward by ejecting water with their bell-shaped body. How a directed swimming stroke is created from spatially-coordinated activation of their nerve and muscle nets is currently not understood. We demonstrate that these jellyfish use an unexpected strategy involving synchronization of electrical pulses in their nerve net, triggering a parallel spread of activity in different sections of the muscle ring and resulting in a significant reduction of the muscle contraction time. Fluid-dynamical simulations of the whole animal in its aquatic environment show that this clever activation mechanism fosters efficient swimming. The study provides a rare example of a complete mechanistic explanation of animal behavior from cellular biophysics to whole-body movement.
40204438	A role for δ subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on parvalbumin positive neurons in maintaining electrocortical signatures of sleep states.	GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing δ subunits have been shown to mediate tonic/slow inhibition in the CNS. These receptors are typically found extrasynaptically and are activated by relatively low levels of ambient GABA in the extracellular space. In the mouse neocortex, δ subunits are expressed by some pyramidal cells as well as on parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons. An important function of PV+ interneurons is the organization of coordinated network activity that can be measured by EEG. However, it remains unclear what role tonic/slow inhibitory control of PV+ neurons may play in shaping oscillatory activity. After validating expected functional loss of δ-associated current in cortex of PV δcKO mice of both sexes, we performed EEG recordings to survey network activity across wake and sleep states. PV δcKO mice showed altered spectral content of EEG during NREM and REM sleep that was a result of increased oscillatory activity in NREM and the emergence of transient high amplitude bursts of theta frequency activity during REM. Viral reintroduction of <i>Gabrd</i> to PV+ interneurons in PV δcKO mice rescued REM EEG phenotypes, supporting an important role for δ subunit mediated inhibition of PV+ interneurons for maintaining normal REM cortical oscillations.<b>Significance statement</b> The impact of the loss of slow ionotropic inhibition in parvalbumin-positive interneurons was evaluated with electroencephalographic recording. We discovered unexpected changes at low frequencies during sleep that were rescued by viral reintroduction.
40204437	Dorsal-caudal and ventral hippocampus target different cell populations in the medial frontal cortex in rodents.	Direct projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) to the medial frontal cortex (MFC) play crucial roles in memory and emotional regulation. Using anterograde transsynaptic tracing and ex vivo electrophysiology in male mice, we document a previously unexplored pathway that parallels the established vHPC-MFC connectivity. This pathway connects the dorsal-caudal hippocampus (dcHPC) to specific subregions of the ventral MFC, in particular the dorsal peduncular cortex. Notably, this pathway exerts a strong inhibitory influence on ventral MFC by targeting a substantial proportion of inhibitory neurons. Retrograde transsynaptic tracing in male rats indicated that ventral MFC subregions project disynaptically back to vHPC. These results, altogether, suggest the existence of a remarkable functional circuit connecting distinct functional areas: the cognition-related dcHPC with the emotion-related ventral MFC and vHPC. These findings further provide valuable insights in the cognitive and emotional abnormalities associated with the HPC-MFC connectivity in neurological and psychiatric disorders.<b>Significance of statement</b> We re-examined the organization of the circuits connecting the hippocampus (HPC) to the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in rodents. We found that dorsal-caudal HPC innervates robustly neurons in ventral subregions of MFC, particularly the dorsal peduncular cortex (DP), including a significant population of inhibitory neurons. Our results show that DP, a subregion critical for emotional and autonomic control, can be modulated by the direct projection from the more cognition-related dorsal-caudal HPC.
40204436	RED LIGHT SENSITIVITY OF NON-IMAGE AND IMAGE FORMING VISUAL SYSTEMS OF LABORATORY RODENTS: CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION AND BEHAVIORAL DETECTION.	The mammalian circadian system regulates all biological processes, thereby ensuring optimal function at the appropriate times of day. Animal studies that examine neurobehavioral processes at different times of day, including during the animal's active phase, may provide important new biomedical insights. A logistical problem for the study of nocturnal laboratory rodents is the potential confounding influence of nighttime light exposure, which may cause circadian disruption and alteration of behavior. The historical solution has been to use red light illumination, which is widely believed to be undetected by the rodent visual system. However, some recent studies have questioned this belief. We, therefore, tested the effects of nighttime exposure to commonly used red light conditions on the circadian non-image forming and the image forming visual systems of female and male laboratory rodents. We found that brief dim red light exposure to a range of red light wavelengths produces strong activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus master clock, rapid suppression of melatonin secretion and a subsequent phase shift in daily activity onsets. We also found in an operant behavioral task that rats are able to detect long wavelengths of red light, but not near-infrared light. Thus, both the non-image and image forming visual systems of laboratory rodents are responsive to red light conditions that are often used in animal research. The use of red light for laboratory rodent research and animal care should be carefully considered in terms of its possible confounding influences on research objectives.<b>Significance statement</b> There is scientific value in studying nocturnal laboratory rodents during the night, when they are normally awake and active. A challenge for these studies is the potential confounding influence of nighttime light exposure, which may cause circadian disruption and alteration of behavior. Often red light illumination is used for these studies, as it is widely believed to be undetected by the rodent visual system. However, we find through a series of neural, physiological and behavioral studies that both the circadian non-image forming and image forming visual systems of laboratory rodents are sensitive to commonly used dim red light conditions. Use of red light for laboratory rodent research should be carefully assessed in terms of possible confounding influences on research objectives.
40204435	Optogenetic mapping of rhythmic phase-dependent excitability in the mouse striatum.	The striatum is thought to switch flexibly between multiple converging inputs to support adaptive behavior. The "communication through coherence" (CTC) hypothesis is a potential mechanism to implement such a flexible switching. For CTC to work in the striatum, striatal excitability must show rhythmic fluctuations, such as those related to the phase of the striatal local field potential (LFP). To test this fundamental requirement, we delivered a constant input stimulus to ChR2-expressing striatal fast-spiking PV+ interneurons (FSIs) in head-fixed awake mice (PV-Cre:Ai-32, n = 18, 9 female), and determined whether the response to this stimulus varied with LFP phase. We found that approximately one-third (41.2%) of FSIs exhibited significant phase-dependent excitability in at least one LFP frequency band. Phase-dependent excitability was most prominent in the delta (2-5 Hz) frequency band, both in terms of prevalence (23.5% of FSIs sampled) and magnitude (phase modulation strength: 22% of average response). The most excitable phase tended to align with endogenous phase-locking, again most clearly in the delta band. These results bolster the functional relevance of the striatal field potential and spike-field relationships, and provide proof-of-principle support for the possibility of CTC in the striatum.<b>Significance Statement</b> The striatum is thought to switch dynamically between multiple converging inputs. A leading idea for how this is accomplished is through communication through coherence (CTC). A fundamental, but previously untested, requirement for CTC to work is that striatum must show changes in excitability that depend on local field potential phase. We find that about one-third of striatal neurons show phase-dependent excitability, providing proof of principle for CTC-like switching in striatum.
40204434	Multimodal Correspondence Between Optogenetic fMRI, Electrophysiology, and Anatomical Maps of the Secondary Somatosensory Cortex in Nonhuman Primates.	Optogenetic neuromodulation combined with fMRI (opto-fMRI) enables noninvasive monitoring of brain-wide activity and probs causal connections. In this study, we focused on the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), a hub for integrating tactile and nociceptive information. By selectively stimulating excitatory neurons in the S2 cortex of monkeys using optogenetics, we observed widespread opto-fMRI activity in regions beyond the somatosensory system, as well as a strong spatial correspondence between opto-fMRI activity map and anatomical connections of the S2 cortex. Locally, optogenetically evoked fMRI BOLD signals from putative excitatory neurons exhibited standard hemodynamic response function. At low laser power, graded opto-fMRI signal changes are closely correlated with increases in LFP signals, but not with spiking activity. This indicates that LFP changes in excitatory neurons more accurately reflect the opto-fMRI signals than spikes. In summary, our optogenetic fMRI and anatomical findings provide causal functional and anatomical evidence supporting the role of the S2 cortex as a critical hub connecting sensory regions to higher-order cortical and subcortical regions involved in cognition and emotion. The electrophysiological basis of the opto-fMRI signals uncovered in this study offers novel insights into interpreting opto-fMRI results. Non-human primates are an invaluable intermediate model for translating optogenetic preclinical findings to humans.<b>Significance statement</b> The neocortex consists of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, each playing distinct roles in cognition and contributing to brain disorders. This study marks the first to use optogenetics to selectively stimulate excitatory neurons of the primate somatosensory S2 cortex, establishing a spatial correspondence between brain-wide opto-fMRI activity and anatomical tracer-based connections in the S2 hand region. The differential relationships between laser power and changes in BOLD, local field potentials, and spiking activity suggest that LFP signals better reflect opto-fMRI signals at the excitatory neuron population level. This work has translational potential for developing targeted neuromodulation therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Success in NHPs, along with advances in noninvasive AAV delivery, paves the way for future clinical applications.
40204433	Optogenetic stimulation of novel TPH2-Cre rats advances insight into serotonin's role in locomotion, reinforcement, and compulsivity.	Serotonin critically modulates the activity of many brain networks, including circuits that control motivation and responses to rewarding and aversive stimuli. Furthermore, the serotonin system is targeted by the first line of pharmacological treatment for several psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, understanding the behavioral function of serotonin is hampered by methodological limitations: the (brainstem) location of serotonergic neuron cell bodies is difficult to access, their innervation of the brain is diffuse, and they release serotonin in relatively low concentrations. Here, we advance this effort by developing a novel Tph2-Cre rat line, which we utilized to study serotonin in the context of motor, compulsive, and reinforced behaviors using optogenetics in both male and female rats. Specificity and sensitivity of Cre-recombinase expression and Cre-dependent processes was validated immunohistochemically, and optogenetic induction of <i>in-vivo</i> serotonin release was validated with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Optogenetic stimulation of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus did not initiate locomotion or alter aversion-induced locomotion, nor did it elicit (real-time) place preference, and had no measurable effect on compulsive behavior in the schedule-induced polydipsia task. In contrast, this optogenetic stimulation moderately sustained ongoing spontaneous locomotion and robustly reinforced operant lever-pressing for self-stimulation of serotonin neurons, which was exacerbated by food restriction. Together, this work both introduces a novel rat Cre-line to study serotonin, and advances our understanding of serotonin's behavioral functions. Complementing previous findings, we find that brain-wide serotonin release has an overall relatively mild effect on behavior, which manifested only in the absence of natural reinforcers and was modulated by physiological state.<b>Significance Statement</b> Although serotonin is produced by only a very small number of neurons, it modulates the activity of almost all brain networks and is implicated in numerous behavioral functions and many psychiatric disorders. However, our comprehension of serotonin function and dysfunction is hampered by methodological limitations, which can be improved by our novel Tph2-Cre rat line. We investigated general behavioral processes to principally understand serotonergic involvement in the many functions it has been implicated in. Complementing and furthering previous findings and consistent with its low concentrations found ubiquitously throughout the brain, we find that brain-wide serotonin release has mild effects on behavior, which are modulated by hunger and manifest only in the absence of food reward in the experimental environment.
40204432	Takeaways from the First Year of Open Peer Review at <i>JNeurosci</i>.	<i>The Journal of Neuroscience</i> launched an open peer review (OPR) initiative in late 2023 to enhance transparency and accountability in scientific publishing. Analysis of 740 manuscripts and 1,490 reviews revealed that 81.4% of authors opted to share rebuttal letters, with increasing participation over time (67.6% in Dec 2023 to 94.4% in Aug 2024). Reviewer participation was lower (66.8%) but stable, with higher opt-in rates for longer, higher-quality reviews. Geographical analysis of author and reviewer institutions showed that authors from North American and European institutions had greater OPR opt-in rates, authors from Asian institutions had lower opt-in rates, and reviewers from North American institutions had lower opt-in rates compared with the average rates across regions. Further, analysis of manuscript subdiscipline showed it to be predictive of OPR opt-in rates, e.g., authors of manuscripts in cellular or molecular neuroscience were less likely to opt-in compared with the average across subdisciplines. Overall, OPR acceptance is growing, reflecting a positive shift toward open science.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for human morbidity and mortality, and the junctional protein paracingulin (CGNL1, JACOP) is required for development of hypertension in a Dahl salt-sensitive rat model and is linked to human hypertension in genome-wide association studies. However, the mechanism through which CGNL1 may regulate hypertension is unknown. Here we address this question using a mouse model, where hypertension is induced by unilateral nephrectomy and angiotensin II infusion (N+A model). Although untreated WT and CGNL1-KO mice showed similar blood pressure, the N+A protocol induced hypertension in WT mice but not in CGNL1-KO mice. We show by immunolocalization and transcriptomic analysis that CGNL1 is expressed throughout the kidney tubules and in endothelium of blood vessels, but not in smooth muscle. The (N+A) protocol induced decreased potassium urinary excretion in wild-type (WT), but not CGNL1-KO mice. Immunoblot analysis shows that the KO of CGNL1 blunted the (N+A)-induced changes in the expression levels and activation of tubular ion transporters, including the Na/H exchanger 3 (NHE3) and the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), and blunted the angiotensin II-dependent changes in the levels and/or activation of AMP38 activated protein kinase (AMPK), ERK and myosin light chain. In contrast, myography showed comparable vascular reactivity in thoracic aortas and mesenteric arteries isolated from WT or CGNL1-KO mice. Together, these results suggest the KO of CGNL1 attenuates hypertension by uncoupling angiotensin II signaling in kidney tubule cells, indicating a novel pathway of regulation of signaling by a junctional protein.

40204361	The FUSION Study: compatibility of antibiotics with commonly used medication infusions in a paediatric intensive care unit.	Beta-lactams and vancomycin often require extended or continuous infusion strategies for antibiotic optimisation in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Simultaneous administration of multiple drugs through a single lumen via a Y-site connector is utilised with uncertainty due to limited intravenous access and the common need for sedative-analgesic infusions in critical illness. The compatibility data supporting antibiotics and sedative-analgesics co-administration is lacking. This study describes the physicochemical compatibility between antibiotics and sedative-analgesics commonly prescribed in the PICU.

40204358	Adequate salt intake is essential for candesartan-treated rats to maintain renal function.	Dietary salt restriction and angiotensin-II receptor-1 blockade (ARB) are commonly recommended for patients with renal and cardiovascular diseases. To explore what salt diet was suitable for the ARB users and what measurements predicted acute kidney injury (AKI), we evaluated the impact of low, (0.02%, LS), normal (0.4%, NS), and high (2%, HS) -salt diets on renal function and urinary exosomal sodium hydrogen exchanger-3 (NHE3), sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter-2 (NKCC2), sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC), and aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in candesartan-treated rats. All rats were given candesartan (1mg/kg/day, IP) except indicated. Relative to NS control, increased serum creatinine (SCr) but decreased creatinine clearance (Ccr) was observed in consecutive LS rats for 7 days with morphological kidney abnormalities. Similar changes at day 3 in the food-switching rats from NS to LS with elevated urine osmolality and creatinine but decreased sodium concentrations. Urinary exosomal NHE3, NKCC2, NCC, and AQP1 were increased in the consecutive LS rats with elevated serum renin, angiotensin-II and aldosterone. They were increased at day 1 in food-switching rats, 2 days earlier than changes in SCr and Ccr but similar as urine kidney-injury-molecule-1. Renal and apical-membranous NHE3, NKCC2 and NCC were increased but AQP1 were decreased with decreased renal angiotensinogen and AT1R. A moderate HS reversed the changes seen in food-switching rats in SCr, Ccr and urinary exosomal measurements and improves the kidney morphological abnormalities. Thus, dietary salt restriction induces a prerenal/reversible kidney injury in candesartan-treated rats; urinary exosomal NHE3, NKCC2, NCC and AQP1 may serve as early biomarkers for the damage.

40204353	Comparison of different revisional surgeries after sleeve gastrectomy: A network meta-analysis.	IntroductionSleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most commonly performed bariatric surgery worldwide. Despite its effectiveness, over 20% of patients require revisional surgery due to weight regain, insufficient weight loss, or complications such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Various revisional bariatric procedures are available. This study aims to systematically compare the efficacy and safety of these revisional procedures following failed SG. MethodsThis systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) adhered to PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted until May 2024. Studies comparing at least two bariatric surgeries for revisions after SG were included. Data on total weight loss percentage (%TWL), excess weight loss percentage (%EWL), and morbidity rates were extracted. Bayesian NMA was performed using the "gemtc" package in R software. Outcomes were assessed using mean differences (MD) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI). ResultsTwenty-three studies involving 3266 participants were included. In %EWL, SADI-S (MD 14.80; 95% CrI: 5.38, 24.40) and OAGB (MD 8.28; 95% CrI: 1.99, 14.30) were significantly more effective. In %TWL, SADI-S (MD 9.27; 95% CrI: 1.06, 17.8) showed superior outcomes. No significant differences in morbidity rates were observed among the revisions. SUCRA analysis ranked SADI-S highest for both %EWL and %TWL, and re-LSG as the best choice in regards to morbidity. ConclusionSingle anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve (SADI-S) is the preferred revisional procedure following sleeve gastrectomy due to superior weight loss outcomes and comparable complication rates. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.
40204352	Middle meningeal artery embolization for non-acute subdural hematoma: a meta-analysis of large randomized controlled trials.	Middle meningeal artery embolization (MMAE) has emerged as a novel treatment for non-acute subdural hematoma (SDH), particularly for reducing the risk of SDH recurrence. Recently, five randomized controlled trials (RCT) of MMAE as an adjunct to conventional management (surgical or observant) have concluded their investigation and reported their outcomes.

Despite the prevalence of these incidents, no systematic review has focused specifically on injuries from bed falls in this specific age.
40204346	Occupational health equity: a call to consider social-structural factors in injury prevention research.	Occupational health equity scholarship has been growing over the past decade, including social-structural determinants of health research that centres the voices and experiences of historically marginalised communities. In our commentary, we focus on the intersection of work-related and non-work-related factors and how they impact the health of workers, their families and their communities through community-engaged research. Case studies include the implementation of mobile clinics that are developed alongside communities, community organising to examine and reduce health disparities among racially segregated workers, the development of research instruments and measures to study racism and discrimination, and a focus on how the distribution of employment opportunity is an important point of intervention to eliminate injury disparities.

40204329	Study protocol: diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in postoperative thoracic surgery using a smartwatch, an open-label randomised controlled study (THOFAWATCH trial).	Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) affects approximately 20% of patients undergoing thoracic surgery and is associated with severe complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and increased mortality. Early diagnosis is critical to mitigate these risks, but conventional monitoring is limited in detecting asymptomatic episodes. Smartwatches equipped with single-lead ECG and atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithms offer a novel approach for early POAF detection. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of smartwatch-based monitoring compared with standard care in identifying POAF following thoracic surgery.
40204328	Efficacy and safety of electrical stimulation for functional impairment and pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCTs.	Several studies have indicated that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and electroacupuncture exhibit certain therapeutic effects in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, definitive proof of the effectiveness of different types of electrical stimulation in relieving the different symptomatic manifestations of RA is required. This study aims to analyse the efficacy (health assessment questionnaire, visual analogue scale, etc), safety (adverse reactions) of electrical stimulation for functional impairment (morning stiffness and decreased muscle strength) and pain (joint tenderness and swelling) of RA, and to explore their comparative advantages and potential benefits for patients.

40204322	Virtual Reality and Sound Intervention under Chemotherapy (ViSu): study protocol for a three-arm randomised-controlled trial.	Patients undergoing chemotherapy often experience side effects during treatment, including psychological distress and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Interventions during chemotherapy that divert attention from potentially aversive environmental factors have been demonstrated to have a beneficial impact on these symptoms. Virtual reality (VR) offers the potential to visually and audibly disengage from the surrounding environment and can create an alternative sense of presence. This could facilitate the implementation of active guided interventions that may prove more effective than receptive interventions, such as listening to music. The present study examines the feasibility, acceptance and effectiveness of a VR intervention and a music intervention during chemotherapy.
40204321	Efficacy of deep brain stimulation in treating monogenic dystonia symptoms: protocol for a systematic review.	Complexity leads to some dystonias being considered as rare diseases with scarce synthesised evidence. Despite the deficit of scientific evidence, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently an effective treatment for dystonias using different brain targets, providing significant improvement of dystonic symptoms regardless of their cause. However, there is considerable variability and non-response rate due to factors such as classification, semiology, duration, aetiology and genetic cause of the disease. This protocol presents the methodology of a planned systematic review to assess the efficacy of DBS as a treatment for monogenic dystonia symptoms, a broad spectrum of pathogenic dystonias due to variants in single genes not yet explored.
40204319	Evaluating musculoskeletal imaging communication interventions using behavioural science: a scoping review using the COM-B model.	Clinicians and patients have been found to attribute musculoskeletal (MSK) pain to normal age-related changes seen on imaging, which can negatively impact patient outcomes and increase healthcare costs. While some studies have tested interventions to improve how MSK imaging findings are communicated, their impact has been limited. Applying a behavioural science framework has the potential to identify the rationale and target of these interventions to inform future intervention design-an analysis that has not yet been conducted. This study aims to identify the Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs), the behavioural targets and the theoretical basis of interventions seeking to affect the communication of MSK imaging.
40204313	A protocol using mixed methods for the impact analysis of the implementation of the EMPOWER project: an eHealth intervention to promote mental health and well-being in European workplaces.	Mental health at the workplace has been identified as a major priority by the World Health Organization (WHO). Despite its significance, international studies examining the influence of digital mental health interventions on workplace implementation and outcomes are lacking. The European Platform to Promote Well-being and Health in the Workplace (EMPOWER) platform is an eHealth intervention consisting of a website and web-based app designed to guide employers and employees on the prevention of common health problems, reduce presenteeism and absenteeism in the workplace. The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale and methods that will be used to conduct a maxi impact analysis of the processes undertaken to develop and implement the EMPOWER platform in European workplaces using the Global Impact Analytics Framework (GIAF) methodology.
40204312	Excess costs of transgender and gender-diverse people with gender incongruence and gender dysphoria compared with people from the general population in Germany: a secondary analysis using data from a randomised controlled trial and a representative telephone survey.	For transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) people, it is known that there is a lack of healthcare professionals with experience in trans healthcare. This may result in either inadequate provision of healthcare or in an increased seeking of adequate trans healthcare. Little is known about healthcare services utilisation and resulting costs in treatment-seeking TGD people with gender incongruence or gender dysphoria (GIC/GD). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the excess costs associated with GIC/GD in Germany.
40204311	Contact radiotherapy for rectal cancer (CORRECT): study protocol for a multicentre randomised phase II trial.	Non-operative management of early-stage rectal cancer is increasingly recognised as a subject of significant clinical and research interest. Contact X-ray brachytherapy (CXB) offers an alternative to surgery in appropriately selected cases. Current clinical evidence suggests the use of CXB in combination with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Although proven effective, no randomised evidence exists for the combination of CXB and short-course radiotherapy (SCRT). In this Swedish national randomised phase II trial, we aim to compare the combination of CXB with either CRT or SCRT in patients with early-to-intermediate rectal cancer.
40204309	Mechanism-based modular psychotherapy versus cognitive behavioural therapy for adolescents and young adults with childhood trauma experiences: study protocol for a feasibility trial within the German Center for Mental Health.	Patients with mental disorders and a history of childhood trauma show an early onset of psychopathology and often a poor response to standard disorder-specific treatments. They represent a patient group which requires more personalised interventions targeting the transdiagnostic mechanisms related to early trauma and its functional consequences. The mechanism-based modular psychotherapy (MeMoPsy) approach is conceptualised as an innovative framework for psychotherapy development. It comprises independent, flexibly applicable interventions from various theoretical backgrounds and evidence-based programmes within a systematic treatment algorithm, thereby tailoring module selection to the specific needs of traumatised adolescents.

40204305	Clinical predictors of flare and drug-free remission in rheumatoid arthritis: preliminary results from the prospective BIO-FLARE experimental medicine study.	Huge advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment mean an increasing number of patients now achieve disease remission. However, long-term treatments can carry side effects and associated financial costs. In addition, some patients still experience painful and debilitating disease flares, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. High rates of flare and a lack of effective prediction tools can limit attempts at treatment withdrawal. The BIOlogical Factors that Limit sustAined Remission in rhEumatoid arthritis (BIO-FLARE) experimental medicine study was designed to study flare and remission immunobiology. Here, we present the clinical outcomes and predictors of drug-free remission and flare, and develop a prediction model to estimate flare risk.
40204304	Effects of exercise therapy with blood flow restriction on shoulder strength: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Blood flow restriction therapy (BFRT) has gained attention for its capacity to induce substantial muscle hypertrophy and strength gains even when employing relatively minimal loads. Strength training is of significant importance in the rehabilitation of patients experiencing shoulder pain, which may arise from a multitude of sources, including rotator cuff injuries, tendinopathies or postsurgical recovery. However, traditional resistance training can be challenging for these individuals due to the presence of pain and functional limitations. In this regard, BFRT in conjunction with low-load strength training may prove an efficacious alternative. The integration of BFRT into rehabilitation protocols for shoulder pain could provide a viable pathway to improving muscle strength and facilitating recovery while minimising the risk of exacerbating pain or injury. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the effects of training with BFRT of the upper limb on shoulder strength.

This study aimed to determine the impact of PIPMs on falls using longitudinal observational data.
40204301	Understanding Infection, Viral Exacerbation and Respiratory Symptoms at Admission-Longitudinal (UNIVERSAL) study: a prospective observational cohort study protocol.	Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and hospital admission worldwide. However, the management of most viral infection-associated diseases remains primarily supportive. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgent need for a deeper understanding of RVIs to improve patient outcomes and develop effective treatment strategies. The Understanding Infection, Viral Exacerbation and Respiratory Symptoms at Admission-Longitudinal Study is an observational study which addresses this need by investigating the heterogeneity of RVIs in hospitalised adults, aiming to identify clinical and biological predictors of adverse outcomes. This study aims to bridge critical knowledge gaps in the clinical course and the economic impact of RVIs by characterising the phenotypic diversity of these infections and their recovery patterns following hospital admission and thus assisting with the optimal design of future interventional studies.

40204291	Chronic Arsenic Exposure Causes Alzheimer's Disease Characteristic Effects and the Intervention of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Rats.	Arsenic exposure and intestinal microbiota disorders may be related with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism has not been elucidated. This study conducted chronic arsenic exposure from rat's maternal body to adult offspring to investigate the mechanisms of the characteristic effects of chronic arsenic exposure on AD, and further explored the intervention effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on arsenic-mediated neurotoxicity. Transmission electron microscopy, HE staining, and related indicators were measured in the control group, the exposed group, and the FMT intervention group. Western blot was used to determine microtubule-associated proteins Tau and p-Tau<sub>396</sub>, intestinal-brain barrier-related proteins Claudin-1 and Occludin, ELISA was used to detect the content of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, and 16S rRNA sequencing was used to detect the intestinal flora of feces. Results showed that chronic arsenic exposure could lead to neurobehavioral defects in rats, increase the expression levels of Tau, p-Tau<sub>396</sub>, and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in hippocampus (p < 0.05), increase the abundance of Clostridium _ UCG-014, decrease the abundance of Roseburia, and decrease the expression levels of Claudin-1 and Occludin in colon and hippocampus (p < 0.05). After FMT intervention, the expression levels of Tau and p-Tau<sub>396</sub> were decreased (p < 0.05), and the abundance of Roseburia was increased. In summary, chronic arsenic exposure caused intestinal flora disorder by changing the abundance of inflammation-related flora, thereby destroying the gut-brain barrier and causing AD characteristic effects in rats. Although the bacterial specific genus was improved and the expression of AD-related proteins was reduced after transplantation, it could not alleviate the neurobehavioral defects and neurotoxicity caused by arsenic exposure.
40204290	Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profile of SKB336, a selective inhibitor of coagulation factor XI/XIa in healthy subjects.	Coagulation factor XI (FXI) plays a crucial role in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, and inhibitors targeting it may mitigate the risk of haemorrhage compared to anticoagulants currently on the market. SKB336, a novel selective inhibitor of FXI/FXIa, has been shown to prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This study aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SKB336 in healthy subjects.
40204289	Exogenous oxidized phytosterol may modulate linoleic acid metabolism through upregulation of fatty acid desaturase in rats.	Previous in vitro studies have indicated that oxidized phytosterol (OPS) exhibits some toxicity; however, the harmful effects of OPS on fatty acid metabolism are not completely understood yet. Therefore, this study examined the effects of exogenous phytosterol (PS) and OPS on growth parameters and lipid metabolism in rats. Rats were provided with AIN-76 basal diet, basal diet +0.5% PS, or basal diet +0.5% OPS. We found that the level of cholesterol and triacylglycerols in the liver was significantly lower in OPS-fed rats than in basal diet-fed rats. The ratio of Δ6 desaturation index (20:3(n-6) + 20:4(n-6))/18:2(n-6) in the plasma was significantly higher in the OPS-fed rats than in the PS-fed rats. Additionally, the proportion of arachidonic acid (20:4) in the liver was significantly higher in the OPS-fed group compared with the control group. The mRNA expression levels of Δ6 and Δ5 desaturases were significantly higher in OPS-fed rats than in basal diet-fed rats, but remained unchanged in PS-fed rats. Moreover, the protein level of Δ6 desaturase was significantly higher in both PS- and OPS-fed rats compared with basal diet-fed rats, while the protein level of Δ5 desaturase tended to be higher only in OPS-fed rats than in basal diet-fed rats. Thus, exogenous OPS, but not PS, altered fatty acid composition through the upregulation of mRNA and protein levels of fatty acid desaturation enzymes in the liver. This indicates that exogenous OPS, unlike PS, may modulate the production of eicosanoids from arachidonic acid, potentially promoting allergic reactions, inflammation, and atherosclerosis.
40204283	Increased cGMP improves microvascular exercise training adaptations in diet induced obesity.	With development of atherosclerosis impaired microvascular function can result in diminished capacity for ambulation and is a risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes. Dynamic changes in vascular tone are determined, in large part, by the eNOS/NO/cGMP axis. We used pharmacologic gain of function of the eNOS/NO/cGMP axis in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and reduced function in lean mice to test the hypothesis that functionality of this vascular control mechanism parallels the benefits of an exercise training regimen. DIO mice have 50% lower exercise capacity (p<0.0001) than lean mice and were used for pharmacological gain of function. The PDE-5a inhibitor - sildenafil - increases cGMP and was administered to DIO mice daily. In sedentary mice, neither acute nor chronic sildenafil improves exercise capacity. In contrast, chronic Sildenafil synergizes with exercise training to improve performance during an incremental exercise test. Improved exercise performance was accompanied by a 40% increase in basal skeletal muscle capillary flow velocity and ~20% increase in plasma-perfused capillary density measured via intravital microscopy. Loss of function was tested in lean mice hemizygous for endothelial cell (EC) specific eNOS creating an EC-eNOS knockdown (KD). EC-eNOS KD decreases capillary density and exercise tolerance in sedentary mice; however, it did not prevent exercise-training induced improvements in endurance capacity. These data show that 1) increasing cGMP with sildenafil enhances microcirculatory function and exercise work tolerance that results from training; 2) eNOS KD does not prevent the microcirculatory or improvements in exercise tolerance with training. PDE-5a inhibitors combined with physical exercise are a potential mechanism for improving ambulation in patients with circulatory limitations.
40204281	Oxygen dynamics and delivery strategies to enhance beta cell replacement therapy.	Beta cell replacement therapy via pancreatic islet transplantation offers a promising treatment for type 1 diabetes as an alternative to insulin injections. However, post-transplantation oxygenation remains a critical challenge; isolated islets from donors lose vascularity and rely on slow oxygen diffusion for survival until revascularization occurs in the host tissue. This often results in significant hypoxia-induced acute graft loss. Overcoming the oxygenation barrier is crucial for advancing islet transplantation. This review is structured in three sections: the first examines oxygen dynamics in islet transplantation, focusing on factors affecting oxygen supply, including vascularity. It highlights oxygen dynamics specific to both transplant sites and islet grafts, with particular attention to extrahepatic sites such as subcutaneous tissue. The second section explores current oxygen delivery strategies, categorized into two main approaches: augmenting oxygen supply and enhancing effective oxygen solubility. The final section addresses key challenges, such as the lack of a clearly defined oxygen threshold for islet survival and the limited precision in measuring oxygen levels within small islet constructs. Recent advancements addressing these challenges are introduced. By deepening the understanding of oxygen dynamics and identifying current obstacles, this review aims to guide the development of innovative strategies for future research and clinical applications. These advancements are anticipated to enhance transplantation outcomes and bring us closer to a cure for type 1 diabetes.
40204280	Comparison of Ground Reaction Forces and Net Joint Moment Predictions: Skeletal Model Versus Artificial Neural Network-Based Approach.	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are becoming a regular tool to support biomechanical methods, while physics-based models are widespread to understand the mechanics of body in motion. Thus, this study aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of recurrent ANN models compared with a physics-based approach in the task of predicting ground reaction forces and net lower limb joint moments during running. An inertial motion capture system and a force plate were used to collect running biomechanics data for training the ANN. Kinematic data from optical motion capture systems, sourced from publicly available databases, were used to evaluate the prediction performance and accuracy of the ANN. The linear and angular momentum theorems were applied to compute ground reaction forces and joint moments in the physics-based approach. The main finding indicates that the recurrent ANN tends to outperform the physics-based approach significantly (P < .05) at similar and higher running velocities for which the ANN was trained, specifically in the anteroposterior, vertical, and mediolateral ground reaction forces, as well as for the knee and ankle flexion moments, and hip abduction and rotation moments. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the trained recurrent ANN can be used to predict running kinetic data from kinematics obtained with different experimental techniques and sources.
40204279	Self-Calibrated Stimulated Raman Scattering Spectroscopy for Rapid Cholangiocarcinoma Diagnosis.	Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive malignancy with poor clinical outcomes. The current "gold standard" diagnostic approach, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-obtained biopsy, has a relatively low sensitivity (i.e., ∼50%). Here, we developed a bile-based diagnostic system using transient stimulated Raman scattering (T-SRS). Except for the tolerance to autofluorescence inherited from traditional SRS spectroscopy, T-SRS features quantum-limit spectral line shapes and is further improved with self-calibration ability in this research. These advantages make the acquired Raman spectra insensitive to the drifting of the excitation parameters, facilitating long-term reliability. Based on the T-SRS spectra in the C-H stretching region from 76 bile samples accumulated over more than 1 year, we demonstrated high accuracy (i.e., 85 ± 3%) and sensitivity (i.e., 87 ± 9%) for classification between CCA and benign diseases. The T-SRS acquisition only requires ∼9-μL bile samples and features a drastically improved time cost. This study suggests that the self-calibrated T-SRS analysis of the bile sample offers a promising approach for rapid CCA diagnosis.
40204278	Is There an Association Between Symptoms of Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, Running Kinetics, and Pelvic Acceleration in Postpartum Women?	The aim of this study was to explore the association between pelvic floor dysfunction and running kinetics and pelvic acceleration in a cohort of postpartum women. The Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire was used to quantify symptom severity (mean [SD]: 6 [ 4] out of 40; range: 1-14) in 25 postpartum women. Participants completed a pelvic floor muscle assessment to measure pelvic muscle strength and endurance, then completed a 7-minute treadmill running protocol at a speed of 10 km·h-1 to evaluate their running kinetics and pelvic acceleration. After the run, participants responded to a modified version of the symptom's component of the PFD-SENTINEL screening tool. Mean pelvic muscle strength and endurance were 3 (1) and 9 (2), respectively. We found no significant association between PFD symptom severity and running kinetic (P = .209-.410) or pelvic acceleration (P = .081-.947) outcome measures. Fifteen participants experienced at least one symptom during the treadmill protocol. Running kinetics and pelvic acceleration may not affect or be affected by symptoms of PFD. Given the relatively low symptom expression among study participants, further research in a cohort of women with higher levels of PFD is recommended.

40203891	Effect of exercise training on apolipoproteins: Meta-analysis and trial sequence analysis.	We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training (ExTr) on common lipid sub-units. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library of Controlled Trials for randomized, controlled trials of ExTr versus sedentary controls that reported lipid sub-units including Apo-AI, Apo-AII, Apo-B, HDL-2, HDL-3 and Lp(a) up until January 31, 2024. Our search identified 2363 potential studies. We included 25 studies with 34 intervention groups, and a total of 1,429 participants, 775 ExTr and 654 control. We found significant favourable anti-atherogenic changes in Apo-AI with MD 8.17 mg/dL and 95%CI (5.80, 10.55); Lp(a) MD -2.52 mg/dL (-4.33, -0.72); Apo-B MD -0.11 mg/dL (-0.19, -0.04); and HDL-2 MD 1.28 mg/dL (0.28, 2.28). Our trial sequence analysis (TSA) showed that futility was achieved for Apo-AI, but not for Lp(a), Apo-B and HDL-2. The minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for Apo-AI, Lp(a), Apo-B and HDL-2 were 0.76 mg/dL, 0.46 mg/dL, 0.02 mg/dL and 0.26 mg/dL, respectively. Analyses of Apo-AII and HDL-3 were not significant and these TSA analyses failed to show futility. ExTr produces significant improvements in Apo-AI, Lp(a), Apo-B and HDL-2, with the MCID achieved. The effect of ExTr on Apo-AII and HDL-3 is unclear.

40203889	Dimerisation of the VIP receptor VIPR2 is essential to its binding VIP and Gα<sub>i</sub> proteins, and to its functions in breast cancer cells.	Several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to homodimerise. Dimeric GPCRs may have different properties from their monomers, but the molecular basis and functional significance of GPCR dimerisation remain largely unknown. We recently found that signalling by the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor, VIPR2, regulates breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. However, it is unclear whether VIPR2 monomers directly interact with each other and what function the dimeric receptor has. Here, we showed that VIPR2 dimerises and investigated their role in breast cancer progression.
40203888	[Effect evaluation of an online training package to strengthen methodological and diagnostic skills in the application of SOPESS: A cluster randomised trial (KOMET-SEU project)].	As part of the KOMET-SEU project, an online training package for the child and youth health service was developed to strengthen the skills regarding the implementation of the social-paediatric screening SOPESS and to increase the quality and utilisation of SOPESS data. Evaluation of the process showed that the target group assessed the training package in positive terms. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the training package on skills and behaviour of employees of the child and youth health service.In a cluster randomised controlled trial, 34 public health departments in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate were assigned to either an intervention or a waiting list control group. Effectiveness of the intervention was assessed using examiner competence (secondary outcome measure) and examiner behaviour (two primary outcome measures). The outcome measures were collected based on 94 items on a 4-point Likert scale using online questionnaires before and after the introduction of the training package. Linear mixed model analyses, adjusted for potential co-predictors, were conducted to examine the intervention effects.The analysis sample comprised 248 employees of the child and youth health service. With already high baseline levels in the outcome measures, there were no significant global intervention effects on examiner competence (B=0.15; SE=0.09; p=0.08) and examiner behaviour (B=- 0.01; SE=0.08; p=0.91 and B=0.06; SE=0.09; p=0.49). Only a tendency towards stronger effects in subgroups of examiners with little SOPESS experience was discernible.Despite good use and positive assessment by the target group, the training package led to a strengthening of skills and changes in the behaviour only of examiners with little experience. Whether this is sufficient to increase the quality and utilisation of the SOPESS data in the long term remains to be seen.
40203887	Clinical Features of Antiphospholipid Syndrome with Intracardiac Mass.	Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, is commonly associated with thrombotic events and pregnancy complications. Although cardiac involvement of APS is very common, intracardiac thrombus is rare and easily misdiagnosed. In order to reduce missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis, we investigated the clinical features of APS with intracardiac mass by summarizing 50 cases (1 newly presented case and 49 additional cases collected from PubMed from 1985 to the present). There were 10 males and 40 females, with ages ranging from 8 to 75 years (median age 35.5). Intracardiac masses were distributed in four cardiac chambers. Mass size ranged from a diameter of 0.5 to 7.1 cm. Clinical manifestations were heterogeneous, including dyspnea, fever, hemiparesis, limb ischemia, and other nonspecific symptoms. In 41 cases with available pathology results, 33 cases were confirmed as thrombus, 2 cases as myxoma, 3 cases as non-bacterial endocarditis, 2 cases as fibrous tissue, and 1 case as inflammatory necrosis. Among 41 cases, 18 cases were suspected of primary cardiac tumors preoperatively, while pathological examination revealed none was tumor. APS patients with intracardiac masses are extremely rare, mostly seen in young or middle-aged people, and they present with a variety of clinical manifestations. Most masses disappear following medical treatment. APS can be accompanied by cardiac myxomas. APS should be promptly investigated in young patients presenting with thrombotic events without any underlying risk factors.
40203886	Prediction of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism and Arterial Cardiovascular Events after Discontinuation of Anticoagulation: The R-VTE-predict and MACE-predict Risk Scores.	Patients who had venous thromboembolism (VTE) are not only at increased risk of recurrent VTE but also of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) than the general population. Therefore, the prediction of the risk of these events is important for a tailored prevention and mitigation strategy. We aimed to develop simple scores to estimate recurrent VTE and MACE risks after the discontinuation of anticoagulation in a large cohort of individuals who suffered VTE (EDITH cohort). The primary endpoints were recurrent symptomatic VTE and MACE (composite of non-fatal acute coronary syndrome, stroke and cardiovascular death). Arterial thrombotic event (ATE) exclusively was also considered. Independent predictors of main outcomes were derived from multivariable Cox regression models. Weighted integer points based on the effect estimate of identified predictors were used to derive the final risk scores. A total of 1,999 participants (mean age: 54.78 years, 46.4% male, 43.6% unprovoked VTE) were included in the derivation cohort and 10,000 in the validation cohort (built using bootstrapping). During a median post-anticoagulation follow-up of 6.9 years, recurrent VTE occurred in 29.5% of participants and MACE in 14.8%. Independent predictors of recurrent VTE were male sex, age >65 years, cancer-associated VTE, and unprovoked VTE (vs. transient risk factor-associated VTE). Independent predictors of MACE were age >65 years, cancer-associated VTE, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and atrial fibrillation. The risk of recurrent VTE (moderate vs. low: hazard ratio [HR]: 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.06-3.34; high vs. low: HR: 3.78, 95% CI: 2.91-4.89), MACE (moderate vs. low: HR: 6.37, 95% CI: 3.19-12.69; high vs. low: HR: 12.32, 95% CI: 6.09-24.89), and ATE (based on MACE-predict risk score) increased gradually from the lowest to highest of the respective prediction risk score groups. These results were confirmed in the validation cohort with overall reasonable models' discrimination performance (recurrent VTE C-statistic: 0.62-0.63, MACE and ATE C-statistic: 0.72-0.77). Contemporary simple risk scores based on readily available clinical characteristics can reasonably predict the risk of recurrent VTE and MACE after the discontinuation of anticoagulation. These findings may influence the choice of anticoagulation strategy after the acute phase of VTE and, therefore, need confirmation by further studies.
40203884	Trpv4-mediated Mechanotransduction Regulates the Differentiation of Valvular Interstitial Cells to Myofibroblasts: Implications for Aortic Valve Stenosis.	As aortic valve stenosis (AVS) progresses, the valve tissue also stiffens. This increase in tissue stiffness causes the valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to transform into myofibroblasts in response. VIC-to-myofibroblast differentiation is critically involved in the development of AVS. Herein, we investigated the role of mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (Trpv4) channels in matrix stiffness- and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)-induced VIC37 myofibroblast activation. We confirmed Trpv4 functionality in primary mouse wild-type VICs compared to Trpv4 null VICs using live Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx detection during application of its selective agonist and antagonist. Using physiologically relevant hydrogels of varying stiffness that respectively mimic healthy or diseased aortic valve tissue stiffness, we found that genetic ablation of Trpv4 blocked matrix stiffness- and TGFβ1-induced VIC-myofibroblast activation as determined by changes in morphology, alterations of expression of α-smooth muscle actin, and modulations of F-actin generation. Our results showed that N-terminal residues 30-130 in Trpv4 were crucial for cellular force generation and VIC-myofibroblast activation, while deletion of residues 1-30 had no noticeable negative effect on these processes. Collectively, these data suggest a differential regulatory role for Trpv4 in stiffness/TGFβ1-induced VIC-myofibroblast activation. Our data further showed that Trpv4 regulates stiffness/TGFβ1-induced PI3K-AKT activity that is required for VIC-myofibroblast differentiation and cellular force generation, suggesting a mechanism by which Trpv4 activity regulates VIC-myofibroblast activation. Altogether, these data identify a novel role for Trpv4 mechanotransduction in regulating VIC51 myofibroblast activation, implicating Trpv4 as a potential therapeutic target to slow and/or reverse AVS development.

40203874	A DRPLA-Affected Family: Clinical Course and Autopsy Findings in a Long-Surviving Case.	A long-surviving older sister and her younger brother, both with a juvenile type of DRPLA, were autopsied. They had 69 and 77 CAG repeats in the atrophin-1 gene (ATN1), respectively. The older sister developed intellectual disability at the age of 10 years, followed by epilepsy, and survived for 40 years supported by tube feeding and tracheostomy with laryngeal closure without signs of anoxia and malnutrition. As the disease progressed, brain CT revealed a progressive skull thickening alongside brain atrophy. The younger brother, who had developmental delay at the age of 3 years, died of status epilepticus aged 24 years. Their father developed cerebellar ataxia at 56 years old when his daughter was 27 years old, and the expanded allele had 63 CAG repeats in ATN1. His clinical course was characterized by the sudden onset of severe psychiatric symptoms and choreatic movement. He died of aspiration pneumonia and suffered from malignant lymphoma aged 72 years. Neuropathological examination of this older sister with extended survival of DRPLA revealed a thickened skull, atrophic brainstem and cerebellum, and a thin spinal cord. We found neuronal loss and gliosis across a wide range of brain regions in addition to severe degeneration of the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems along with regions previously reported to exhibit polyglutamine pathology. In contrast, some regions previously reported to exhibit polyglutamine pathology remained preserved. The cerebellar cortex showed three-layer degeneration, and changes in the cerebral white matter appeared to correspond to lesions in the cerebral cortex.

40203870	Dome-like pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion in NaNiO2.	NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$\,K, which disappears in a broad first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$\,K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to $\sim$5\,GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied \textit{via} variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of $\sim$67\,GPa at 294\,K and 403\,K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed \textit{via} the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at $\sim$18\,GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.
40203869	Curriculum for training in peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in Europe (Part I): European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Position Statement.	Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an advanced endoscopic procedure that has become a first-line treatment for esophageal achalasia and other esophageal spastic disorders. Structured training is essential to optimize the outcomes of this technique. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) has recognized the need to formalize and enhance training in POEM. This Position Statement presents the results of a systematic review of the literature and a formal Delphi process, providing recommendations for an optimal training program in POEM that aims to produce endoscopists competent in this procedure. In a separate document (POEM curriculum Part II), we provide technical guidance on how to perform the POEM procedure based on the best available evidence. 1: POEM trainees should acquire a comprehensive theoretical knowledge of achalasia and other esophageal motility disorders that encompasses pathophysiology, diagnostic tool proficiency, clinical outcome assessment, potential adverse events, and periprocedural management. 2: Experience in advanced endoscopic procedures (endoscopic mucosal resection and/or endoscopic submucosal dissection [ESD]) is encouraged as a beneficial prerequisite for POEM training. 3: ESGE suggests that POEM trainees without ESD experience should perform an indicative minimum number of 20 cases on ex vivo or animal models before advancing to human POEM cases with an experienced trainer. 4: ESGE recommends that the trainee should observe an indicative minimum number of 20 live cases at expert centers before starting to perform POEM in humans. 5: The trainee should undertake an indicative minimum number of 10 cases under expert supervision for the initial human POEM procedures, ensuring that trainees can complete all POEM steps independently. 6: ESGE recommends avoiding complex POEM cases during the early training phase. 7: POEM competence should reflect the technical success rate, both the short- and long-term clinical success rates, and the rate of true adverse events. 8: A POEM center should maintain a prospective registry of all procedures performed, including patient work-up and outcomes, procedural techniques, and adverse events.

40203867	Low-temperature electron-electron interaction correction to the anomalous Hall effect in Fe3GaTe2 single crystals.	The electron-electron interaction (EEI), weak localization and Kondo effect are known to correct low-temperature (low-T) resistivity in metals and semimetals. However, the impact of EEI on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) by EEI remains a subject of debate. In this study, we investigate the EEI corrections to both the low-T longitudinal and anomalous Hall resistivities in van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe3GaTe2 single crystals with a high Curie temperature. Our findings reveal that the longitudinal resistivity is well-described by the EEI theory developed by Altshuler et al., while the anomalous Hall (AH) resistivity deviates from this theory. We found that the AH resistivity follows a T temperature dependence, and its relative rate of change is 2.6 times that of the longitudinal resistivity. These results demonstrate that EEI significantly influences the low-T AH resistivity under intrinsic mechanism in Fe3GaTe2. This observation challenges the conventional understanding that EEI does not contribute to the AHE in systems with mirror symmetry, as suggested by skew scattering and side jump models. This work opens avenues for further exploration of EEI effect in disordered magnetic materials.&#xD.

40203865	An end-to-end neural network for 4D cardiac CT reconstruction using single-beat scans.	Motion artifacts remain a significant challenge in cardiac CT imaging, often impairing the accurate detection and diagnosis of cardiac diseases. These artifacts result from involuntary cardiac motion, and traditional mitigation methods typically rely on retrospective rescans, which increase radiation exposure and are less effective for patients with irregular heart rhythms. In this study, we proposed a deep learning-based end-to-end reconstruction framework for dynamic cardiac imaging using single-beat rapid CT scanning. The method used commom cardiac CT projections and applied a sliding-window approach to divide the projection data into overlapping short-scan intervals centered on specific cardiac phases. Each short-scan interval was first reconstructed and then processed through a denoising network, before being fed into the registration module to compute deformation vector fields (DVFs). These DVFs were then used to perform motion-compensated (MC) reconstruction. The denoising and registration networks were trained end-to-end by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed images and ground truth in a supervised manner. The model was trained using simulated projection data from 30 real patients and validated on simulated datasets from different institutions and XCAT-generated continuous phantoms. Experimental results showed that the proposed method effectively reduced motion artifacts and restored key anatomical structures such as coronary arteries. By relying solely on single-cycle scan data and placing no explicit restrictions on heart rate, the method demonstrated strong potential for generalizability and wider clinical applications.

40203863	Optomechanical evaluation of knot security in Monocryl and Maxon sutures under varying pH conditions.	Knot stability and security are crucial factors in surgical suture performance, ensuring optimal tension distribution and minimizing the risk of wound dehiscence. The mechanical behavior of surgical knots is influenced by suture material properties, knot configuration, and environmental factors such as localized pH deviations, which can accelerate material degradation. This study investigates the impact of pH-induced degradation on the mechanical and optomechanical performance of square and surgeon's knots tied with Maxon and Monocryl sutures under acidic (pH 5) and neutral (pH 7) conditions. Stress-strain analysis and Mach-Zehnder interferometry were employed to assess Young's modulus, mechanical loss percentages, tensile strength, toughness, phase maps, and 3D refractive index profiles over 20 days. Young's modulus results revealed significant reductions in acidic conditions. Maxon's surgeon knot decreased from 516 MPa to 228 MPa, while Monocryl's surgeon knot dropped from 434 MPa to 132 MPa over 20 days. Mechanical loss was notably higher in acidic conditions, with Maxon's surgeon knot exhibiting a 65.30% reduction and Monocryl's surgeon knot showing an 82.3% decrease. Toughness declined similarly, particularly in knotted configurations. Phase maps revealed substantial structural distortion, especially in Monocryl's perpendicular orientation at pH 5, indicating severe degradation. 3D refractive index profiles demonstrated that Maxon maintained greater internal uniformity, while Monocryl showed pronounced structural disruption under acidic conditions. Maxon's stability under different pH conditions makes it suitable for long-term applications, while Monocryl's rapid degradation suggests its suitability for scenarios requiring faster material breakdown. These findings provide valuable insights for suture selection in diverse wound conditions.&#xD.
40203862	Diagnosis assistant for liver cancer utilizing a large language model with three types of knowledge.	Objective &#xD;Liver cancer has a high incidence rate, but experienced doctors are lacking in primary healthcare settings. The development of large models offers new possibilities for diagnosis. However, in liver cancer diagnosis, large models face certain limitations, such as insufficient understanding of specific medical images, inadequate consideration of liver vessel factors, and inaccuracies in reasoning logic. Therefore, this study proposes a diagnostic assistance tool specific to liver cancer to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of primary care doctors.&#xD;&#xD;Approach&#xD;A liver cancer diagnosis framework combining large and small models is proposed. A more accurate model for liver tumor segmentation and a more precise model for liver vessel segmentation are developed. The features extracted from the segmentation results of the small models are combined with the patient's medical records and then provided to the large model. The large model employs Chain of Thought (COT) prompts to simulate expert diagnostic reasoning and uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide reliable answers based on trusted medical knowledge and cases.&#xD;&#xD;Main results&#xD;In the small model part, the proposed liver tumor and liver vessel segmentation methods achieve improved performance. In the large model part, this approach receives higher evaluation scores from doctors when analyzing patient imaging and medical records.&#xD;&#xD;Significance&#xD;First, a diagnostic framework combining small models and large models is proposed to optimize the liver cancer diagnosis process. Second, two segmentation models are introduced to compensate for the large model's shortcomings in extracting semantic information from images. Third, by simulating doctors' reasoning and integrating trusted knowledge, the framework enhances the reliability and interpretability of the large model's responses while reducing hallucination phenomena.
40203861	Value of cerebroplacental ratio in predicting adverse perinatal outcome in uncomplicated twin pregnancies: a retrospective study.	To evaluate the performance of the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) in predicting operative delivery for intrapartum fetal compromise (OD for IFC) and adverse perinatal outcomes in uncomplicated twin pregnancies with attempted vaginal delivery.This was a retrospective cohort study of 72 twin pregnancies in a single tertiary referral center between January 2018 and August 2024. All MCDA and DCDA twin pregnancies with an attempted vaginal delivery after 34+0 weeks were screened for eligibility and those without further risk factors were included in the study. Outcome parameters were OD for IFC and a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes (CAPO) including OD for IFC, 5-minute Apgar score <7, umbilical artery pH <7.10, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The predictive performance of CPR was evaluated using ROC analyses and multivariable logistic regression.16 MCDA and 56 DCDA pregnancies met the inclusion criteria. CAPO of at least one of the twins occurred in 27 (37.5%) of the cases. ROC analyses showed that low CPR MoM of neither the presenting twin nor the second twin predicted CAPO. Similarly, the prediction of the need for OD for IFC of twin 2 was not possible using low CPR MoM as the predicting variable. However, logistic regression analyses showed that nulliparity and twin-to-twin delivery time interval were independently associated with CAPO.Low CPR MoM was not predictive for CAPO or OD for IFC in uncomplicated twin pregnancies after 34 weeks of gestation. However, nulliparity and twin-to-twin delivery time interval were independently associated with CAPO.
40203860	Deep chalcogen donors and electron localization in aluminum nitride.	We show with hybrid density functional theory calculations that chalcogen donors other than oxygen (i.e., S<sub>N</sub>, Se<sub>N</sub>, and Te<sub>N</sub>) give rise to deep donor states in aluminum nitride. These donors trap a localized electron in their neutral charge state, leading to deep (+/0) donor levels that are 0.45 eV or more from the conduction band edge. As such, this behavior is distinct from the DX behavior leads to deep (+/-) levels which affects other donors such as O<sub>N</sub>and Si<sub>Al</sub>. We highlight how these results hint at the formation of small electron polarons in AlN, which are found to be unstable in the bulk, but metastable when bound to donor dopants like Si<sub>Al</sub>and the chalocogens, with activation energies on the order of 0.2-0.3 eV. These results indicate that S, Se, and Te are not shallow donor dopants in aluminum nitride and identify origins of the experimentally observed ∼200-300 meV activation energies for dopant activation in donor-doped samples.
40203859	Multi-view collaborative ensemble classification for EEG signals based on 3D second-order difference plot and CSP.	EEG signal analysis methods based on electrical source imaging (ESI) technique have significantly improved classification accuracy and response time. However, for the refined and informative source signals, the current studies have not fully considered their dynamic variability in feature extraction and lacked an effective integration of their dynamic variability and spatial characteristics. Additionally, the adaptability and complementarity of classifiers have not been considered comprehensively. These two aspects lead to the issue of insufficient decoding of source signals, which still limits the application of brain-computer interface (BCI). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-view collaborative ensemble classification method for EEG signals based on three-dimensional second-order difference plot (3D SODP) and common spatial pattern (CSP).
40203857	NAD Dependent Epimerase/Dehydratase Serves as a Novel Potential Target for Fluoxastrobin in <i>Pestalotiopsis trachicarpicola</i>, the Causal Agent of Tea Foliar Disease.	Tea foliar disease caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Pestalotiopsis trachicarpicola</i> poses a significant threat to tea production and quality in China. The disease, which includes tea leaf spot and gray blight, severely impacts both tea yield and quality, partly due to the lack of effective epidemiological data and control strategies. Fluoxastrobin, a strobilurin fungicide, has shown promise in controlling various fungal diseases. This study evaluated the inhibitory activity of fluoxastrobin against multiple phytopathogenic fungi, revealing a half-maximal effective concentration of 13.64 μg/ml for <i>P. trachicarpicola</i> in vitro and a maximum in vivo curative activity of 81.63% against tea leaf spot caused by <i>P. trachicarpicola</i>. Observations from optical, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy revealed that fluoxastrobin induces severe hyphal deformation, including hyphal swelling, malformation, and rough hyphal surfaces. Integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic, and bioinformatic analyses indicated that fluoxastrobin affects electron transfer process, therefore disturbing the energy metabolism of hyphae. Biochemical assays indicated fluoxastrobin can inhibit ATP production in hyphae and increase the membrane potential of hyphae, with these effects being dose-dependent. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that fluoxastrobin binds stably to NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase, a key enzyme in energy metabolism, with binding energies of -12.9 kcal/mol, suggesting these may be potential target protein in the fungus. Overall, this study demonstrates that fluoxastrobin disrupts electron transfer, reduces ATP production, and inhibits hyphal growth, likely by binding NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase. It shows potential for controlling tea foliar diseases in the future.
40203856	Exploring the effect of oxygen plasma on SnS2-ZnFe2O4 based supercapacitor electrodes.	The present study focuses on the fabricate the SnS2-ZnFe2O4 compound to be employed as electrode materials in pseudocapacitors (SC) and raise its capacitance via direct-current O2 plasma (DCOP) treatment. To maximally increase the capacitance of the constructed electrodes, the best conditions concerning temperature, exposure time, and power, as features of DCOP, were initially determined. Using the three-electrode cyclic voltammetry measurements, the electrodes exhibited the highest specific capacitance (733 F/g) when the exposure time, output power, and temperature were set to 25 minutes, 1700 W, and 25 °C, respectively. The energy and power densities of the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor were estimated to be 43.5 Wh/kg, which is considered substantially high, and 750 W/kg, respectively, at a highest operating voltage of 1.5 V. The functional groups of the created electrodes were also analysed, and it was found that the reason for considerable increases in the capacitance was improvement of the functional groups comprising oxygen such as O-Sn-O, Sn-O-C, and Fe-O on the surface of the SnS2-ZnFe2O4 electrodes.

Vibrotactile stimulation (VS) has been widely used as an appropriate motor imagery (MI) guidance strategy to improve MI performance. However, most vibrotactile stimulation induced by a single vibrator cannot provide spatiotemporal information of tactile sensation associated with the visual guidance of the imagined motion process, not vividly providing MI guidance for subjects.

40203853	Experimental validation of LET in intensity-modulated proton therapy with a miniaturized pixel detector.	Given the increased interest in incorporating linear energy transfer (LET) as an optimization parameter in intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT), a solution for experimental validation of simulations and patient-specific quality assurance in terms of proton LET is needed. Here, we present the methodology and results of LET spectra measurements for spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) and IMPT plans using a miniaturized pixel detector Timepix3.&#xD;Approach: We used a MiniPIX Timepix3 detector that provides single-particle tracking, type-resolving power, and spectral information while allowing measurement in quasi-continuous mode. We performed measurements for SOBP and IMPT plans in homogeneous RW3 and heterogeneous CIRS head phantoms with reduced beam current. An artificial intelligence-based model was applied for proton identification and a GPU-accelerated FRED Monte Carlo (MC) code was applied for corresponding MC simulations. &#xD;Main results: We compared the deposited energy and LET spectra obtained in mixed radiation fields from measurements and MC simulations. The peak positions of deposited energy and LET spectra for the SOBP and IMPT plans agree within the error bars. Discrepancies exceeding the error bars are only visible in the logarithmic scale in high-energy deposition and high-LET tails of the distributions. The mean relative difference of dose-averaged LET values between measurements and MC simulations for individual energy layers is about 5.1%.&#xD;Significance: This study presents a methodology for assessing radiation quality in proton therapy through energy deposition and LET spectra measurements in uniform and clinical IMPT fields. Findings show an agreement between experimental data and MC simulations, validating our approach. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of a commercially available Timepix3 detector to validate LET computations in IMPT fields and perform patient-specific quality assurance in terms of LET. This will support the implementation of LET in treatment planning, which will ultimately increase the effectiveness of the treatment. &#xD.
40203852	A Machine Learning Toolkit Assisted Approach for IMRT Fluence Map Optimization: Feasibility and Advantages.	Purpose&#xD;Traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) applications in treatment planning rely on complex model architectures and large, high-quality training datasets. However, they cannot fully replace the conventional optimization process. This study presents a novel application of ML in treatment planning where established ML/DL toolkits are directly applied to treatment plan optimization.&#xD;Materials and Methods&#xD;A one-layer network was designed based on the dose deposition matrix and implemented in PyTorch's L-BFGS optimizer with GPU acceleration. The classical steepest descent optimizer was selected as a reference for comparison. Both optimizers utilized identical inputs and objective functions to ensure a fair comparison. DVH- and gEUD-based objectives were implemented in standard quadratic forms. Standard uniform and 1,000 random initializations were used to test optimizer's search ability under different starting conditions for prostate and head-and-neck cases. &#xD;Results&#xD;The MLT-assisted framework demonstrated comparable or superior plan quality to classical optimization by achieving lower objective values, improved DVHs and capturing finer modulation details in fluence maps. For gEUD-based optimization, it effectively explored beam weight elevations that classical optimization could only reach with stricter convergence criteria and many more iterations. The quality differences primarily stemmed from convergence speed. The MLT-assisted framework required significantly fewer evaluations and iterations to achieve similar or better results. Optimization on random initial maps further demonstrated that it was more robust and less likely to be trapped. It does not require stricter convergence criteria or extended runs to reach high-quality optima, making it more efficient and reliable.&#xD;Conclusion&#xD;This framework leverages ML toolkits in a novel way, enabling faster convergence, greater robustness and handling of complex constraints. As the first study of its kind, it establishes MLT-assisted optimization as a viable and effective alternative to classical methods.&#xD.
40203847	Evaluating primary tumor position variation for rectal cancer patients treated with long course radiotherapy.	To quantify interfraction shape and positional variations of primary tumor volumes for rectal cancer patients receiving long course radiotherapy (LCRT) by comparing two quantification strategies: a center-of-mass (COM) method and a surface-based metric that captures local deformations.&#xD;&#xD;Approach: This study utilized repeat MRI scans before and during radiotherapy (RT) for rectal cancer to investigate the positional variation of the primary gross tumor volume (GTVp). Sixteen patients underwent six MRI exams, with the initial three before the RT course and the subsequent three at one, two, and four weeks into the RT course. GTVp's were delineated on 3D T2-weighted MRIs, and positional variation analyzed using both COM and point-based surface displacements against the initial scan. Surface displacements were quantified using a bidirectional local distance measure, analyzing 3D displacement vectors. Additionally, the study examined local right-left (RL) and anterior-posterior (AP) surface variations relative to tumor height in the rectum by mapping baseline GTVp volumes onto a reference rectum structure.&#xD;&#xD;Main results: Systematic error for COM measurements were 1.7 mm, 1.3 mm and 2.0 mm for AP, RL, and cranial-caudal (CC) direction, respectively. Random errors were 2.1 mm, 1.2 mm and 2.2 mm, while the GM errors were -0.3, 0.5 mm and -0.3 mm for AP, RL, and CC directions, respectively. An increase in systematic and random errors were observed when comparing 95th percentile surface displacements to the COM measurements, indicating local displacements which the COM did not detect. Additionally, a general tendency for higher-located tumors to experience larger LR and AP surface variations were seen when evaluating the 95th percentile.&#xD;&#xD;Significance: COM-based analysis might underestimate local deformations. Consequently, surface-based methods might provide more robust estimations of systematic, random and group mean errors for PTV-margin calculation. The surface variations tend to increase for tumors located in the upper part of the rectum.&#xD.
40203846	Bald Eagle-Optimized Transformer Networks with Temporal-Spatial Mid-Level Features for Pancreatic Tumor Classification.	The classification and diagnosis of pancreatic tumors present significant challenges due to their inherent complexity and variability. Traditional methods often struggle to capture the dynamic nature of these tumors, highlighting the need for advanced techniques that improve precision and robustness. This study introduces a novel approach that combines temporal-spatial mid-level features (CTSF) with bald eagle search (BES) optimized transformer networks to enhance pancreatic tumor classification. By leveraging temporal-spatial features that encompass both spatial structure and temporal evolution, we employ the BES algorithm to optimize the vision transformer (ViT) and swin transformer (ST) models, significantly enhancing their capacity to process complex datasets. The study underscores the critical role of temporal features in pancreatic tumor classification, enabling the capture of changes over time to improve our understanding of tumor progression and treatment responses. Among the models evaluated-GRU, LSTM, and ViT-the ViTachieved superior performance, with accuracy rates of 94.44%, 89.44%, and 87.22% on the TCIA-Pancreas-CT, Decathlon Pancreas, and NIH-Pancreas-CT datasets, respectively. Spatial features extracted from ResNet50, VGG16, and ST were also essential, with the ST model attaining the highest accuracy of 95.00%, 95.56%, and 93.33% on the same datasets. The integration of temporal and spatial features within the CTSF model resulted in accuracy rates of 96.02%, 97.21%, and 95.06% for the TCIA-Pancreas-CT, Decathlon Pancreas, and NIH-Pancreas-CT datasets, respectively. Furthermore, optimization techniques, particularly hyperparameter tuning, further enhanced performance, with the BES-optimized model achieving the highest accuracy of 98.02%, 98.92%, and 98.89%. The superiority of the CTSF-BES approach was confirmed through the Friedman test and Bonferroni-Dunn test, while execution time analysis demonstrated a favourable balance between performance and efficiency.&#xD.
40203822	Preceding Crop Straw Return Methods Influence the Disease Severity of Wheat Crown Rot.	Straw return has potential benefits for soil fertility, environmental sustainability, and yield. However, its effects on pathogen carryover and disease in subsequent crop cycles remain unclear. Wheat is a crucial food source. This study examined the effects of straw return methods-deep plowing (DP), rotary tillage (RT), and deep loosening (DL)-on wheat crown rot. Trials were conducted in fields with maize straw return, and the wheat crown rot incidence and severity were compared after maize straw return. The wheat root microbial communities were assessed using absolute and relative quantification sequencing techniques (AS and RS), and the relationship between changes in the bacterial community and the abundance of crown rot pathogen <i>Fusarium pseudograminearum</i> was explored. DP reduced the crown rot incidence (22.0) and severity (6.8) in subsequent wheat crops, showing values significantly lower than those under RT (64.0 incidence, 24.0 severity) and DL (49.0 incidence, 18.8 severity). Variations in wheat root fungal diversity and composition were observed among methods and soil depths within the DP regime. The abundance of <i>F. pseudograminearum</i> was significantly lower under DP than under RT and DL (RS: less than 0.1% in DP and more than 0.5% in RT and DL; AS: less than 10,000 reads in DP and more than 50,000 in RT and DL). The reduced pathogen abundance may be associated with shifts in bacterial genera due to straw return practices. This study shows the importance of selecting appropriate straw return methods to manage wheat crown rot.
40203821	Knowledge and Behaviors in Reproductive Health Among Mexican Women With Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases: Cross-sectional Study.	Reproductive health is a critical issue for women with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs), yet significant gaps in knowledge and practices persist. While prior studies have largely focused on populations in high-income countries or specialized clinics, there is limited evidence addressing the reproductive health behaviors and challenges in middle-income settings, where disparities in health care access and counseling are pronounced. This study aims to assess reproductive health knowledge, contraceptive use, and pregnancy planning among Mexican women with ARDs, identifying specific areas for improvement in education and counseling to bridge these gaps.

40203818	In Situ Synthesis of Luminescent CdSe Quantum Dots Embedded in Cd(II) Metallohydrogels: A Hybrid Material for Selective and Naked-Eye Sensing of Hg<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> Ions.	In situ synthesis and stabilization of quantum dots (QDs) with unique features toward environmental remediation is an area of current interest. Our present study has addressed the spontaneous formation of a metallohydrogel of Cd(II) and a mixed ligand system (sodium azide and 4,5-dicyanoimidazole). The gelation was highly selective to all three components and was only achieved when the components were present together. Impact of different pure and mixed solvent systems on metallogelation was also studied. Spontaneous and high-yield growth of fibrous bundled nanostructures, majorly resulting from the metal-ligand coordination in association with solvent-anticipated hydrogen-bonding interactions, are observed. The overall gel integrity and the corresponding nanostructure exhibit stimulus-responsive behavior toward various external stimuli. The pristine Cd(II) metallogel was then explored as a scaffold for in situ fabrication of CdSe QD) which remain fastened with the metallogel fibers. The QD-tethered metallogel was luminescent in nature where the emission behavior could be easily tuned. Finally, this hybrid luminescent gel [i.e., CdSe-tethered Cd(II) metallohydrogel] was successfully employed as a material for selective and naked-eye sensing of toxic heavy metal ion Hg<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> down to the micromolar level. This study thus highlights the potential of such metallo-supramolecular hydrogel systems in photophysics and environmental remediation.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an established treatment for refractory major depressive disorder (MDD), but treatment outcomes vary substantially from person to person. Recent evidence suggests that incorporating neuroimaging-based targeting may help improve clinical outcomes. Here, we report the initial clinical outcomes of our open-label fMRI-personalized treatment protocol from the Queensland Neurostimulation Centre (QNC).
40203816	COVID-19-Related Changes in Adolescents' Daily-Life Social Interactions and Psychopathology Symptoms.	The COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have strongly impacted adolescents' mental health through limiting their day-to-day social lives. However, little is known about the role of (social) risk/protective factors and adolescent mental health. Subclinical psychopathology, and risk and protective factors of n = 173 adolescents (T1 mean age = 16.0; 89% girls) were assessed prepandemic and early-pandemic (T1: 2018/2019; T2: May 2020). Daily-life social interactions were assessed in 6-day experience sampling periods. Correcting for age, multilevel analyses revealed declines in general psychopathology and anxiety symptoms; fewer face-to-face social interactions, more online social interactions; and higher-quality face-to-face interactions during the pandemic than before. Negative associations between psychopathology and the quality of face-to-face peer and family interactions were stronger during the pandemic than prepandemic. The results reflect that, early in the pandemic, the mental health impact on adolescents may have been limited. High-quality face-to-face interactions with family and peers seemed particularly powerful in keeping adolescents resilient.

40203812	Preoperatory Flot Regimen for Gastroesophageal Cancer and Renal Function: A New Onco-Nephrological Perspective.	(1) Background: The FLOT regimen, a combination of fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel, is a standard treatment for gastric and esophagogastric junction cancers, but concerns exist about its potential renal toxicity. The exact prevalence and severity of renal toxicity need to be well-documented, and this knowledge gap could impact the optimal use of the FLOT regimen in clinical practice. We aimed to evaluate the renal toxicity profile of the FLOT regimen with a specific focus on Acute Kidney Disease onset in a real-life setting and explore associated risk factors. (2) Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study involving 96 patients treated with preoperatory FLOT. The incidence of acute kidney disease (AKD) and potential risk factors were identified. (3) Results: AKD occurred in three patients (incidence rate of 0.0122 cases/month of follow-up). Oral antidiabetic agents and prostate hypertrophy emerged as significant predictors of AKD. (4) Conclusion: Acute Kidney Disease is uncommon in patients treated with the preoperatory FLOT regimen. Our findings highlight the importance of diligent renal function monitoring and appropriate preventive strategies in patients undergoing FLOT treatment. These results encourage the conduction of further studies and clinical experiences in larger populations and patients with lower baseline eGFR.
40203811	Dialectical Behaviour Therapy to Treat Emotion Dysregulation in Autistic adults without Intellectual Disability: A Randomised Controlled Trial.	Emotion dysregulation is prevalent in autistic adults without intellectual disability whereby it has been associated with heightened non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal behaviours. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has shown to be feasible and preliminary findings suggest that it might reduce emotion dysregulation in this population. Yet studies evaluating the efficacy of DBT in this context are lacking.
40203810	Association of obesity-related indices with rapid kidney function decline and chronic kidney disease, a study from a large longitudinal cohort in China.	Obesity has been established as a significant risk factor for rapid kidney function decline (RKFD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the comparative prognostic value of various obesity-related indices in predicting RKFD and CKD remains inadequately elucidated. The objective of this study was to explore the correlations between ten obesity-related indices: body mass index (BMI), Chinese visceral adiposity index (CVAI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), visceral adiposity index (VAI), body roundness index (BRI), a body shape index (ABSI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), waist triglyceride index (WTI), relative fat mass (RFM), and conicity index (C-index), and RKFD and CKD.
40203493	Observation of the therapeutic effect of dapagliflozin on atherosclerosis in mice and preliminary exploration of the mechanism of action.	In recent years, the incidence of Atherosclerosis (AS) has been increasing and has gradually become a major disease threatening human health. In this study, we analyzed the effect of dapagliflozin on AS and preliminarily explore the mechanism of action. First, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout C57Bl/6J mice were used to establish an AS model in vitro. An intervention group treated with dapagliflozin and a model group treated with normal saline, both administered by gavage, were set up. The effects of dapagliflozin on macrophage polarization, blood lipids, inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular adhesion of AS mice were observed, we found that compared with the model group, macrophages in the intervention group of mice were polarized from M2 to M1 type, the levels of inflammatory factors in the intervention group decreased, and the oxidative stress reaction and vascular adhesion were inhibited. Subsequently, the aorta tissues of mice were stained with HE and oil red O to observe their histopathological changes. We observed a significant improvement in aortic pathologic damage in the intervention group, converging to normal mice. Finally, autophagy in mouse aortic cells was determined, found the intervention group showed markedly increase Beclin-1 and LC3-II expression in the aorta than the model group. In conclusions, dapagliflozin can ameliorate the progression of AS, and its mechanism is related to the activation of aortic cell autophagy.
40203492	Efficient Blade-Coated Wide-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells via Interface Engineering.	Most high-efficiency all-perovskite tandem solar cells use a "superstrate" configuration, integrating a wide-bandgap (WBG) top subcell and a narrow bandgap (NBG) bottom subcell. However, this structure suffers oxidative degradation due to easily air-exposable bottom NBG subcells. A "substrate" structure offers improved stability for tandems by encapsulating the NBG top subcell with the air-stable WBG bottom subcell. However, conventional WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using water-based NiO<i><sub><i>x</i></sub></i> interlayers hinder their fabrication on top of the NBG subcells in an inert atmosphere. To overcome this, we developed a nonaqueous NiO<i><sub><i>x</i></sub></i> nanoparticle dispersion, enabling interlayer fabrication inside a glove box. The blade-coated NiO<i><sub><i>x</i></sub></i> interlayer facilitated the formation of a densely packed 2PACz (2-(9<i>H</i>-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid) monolayer hole transporting layer (HTL). The energetically aligned 2PACz molecules reduced minority carrier recombination at the NiO<i><sub><i>x</i></sub></i>/perovskite interface. As a result, the fully scalable 1.77 eV WBG PSCs employing a NiO<i><sub><i>x</i></sub></i>/2PACz hybrid HTL delivered a champion power conversion efficiency of 17.4%.
40203459	Nampt as a new therapeutic target for modulating NAD+ levels in metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.	NAD+ is an important cofactor involved in regulating many biochemical processes in cells. An imbalance in NAD+/NADH ratio is linked to many diseases. NAD+ is depleted in diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and in aging, and is increased in tumor cells. NAD+ is generated in cells via the de novo, Preiss-Handler, and salvage pathways. Most of the cellular NAD+ is generated through Nampt activation, a key rate-limiting enzyme that is involved in the salvage pathway. Restoration of NAD+/NADH balance offers therapeutic advantages for improving tissue homeostasis and function. NAD+ is known to benefit and restore the body's physiological mechanisms, including DNA replication, chromatin and epigenetic modifications, and gene expression. Recent studies elucidate the role of NAD+ in cells utilizing transgenic mouse models. Translational new therapeutics are positioned to utilize the NAD+ restoration strategies for overcoming the drawbacks that exist in the pharmacological toolkit. The present review highlights the significance of Nampt-NAD+ axis as a major player in energy metabolism and provides an overview with insights into future strategies, providing pharmacological advantages to address current and future medical needs.

40203457	Amplifying the Reactivity of Anionic Mn(I)-H Catalysts via the Cation Effect: Mechanistic Investigation and Application to the Hydrogenation of α-Trisubstituted Carboxylic Esters.	Despite significant advancements in ester hydrogenation using homogeneous metal catalysts over the past two decades, the catalytic hydrogenation of sterically hindered α-trisubstituted carboxylic esters remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a class of imidazole-based NNP-pincer manganese (Mn) catalysts capable of efficiently hydrogenating α-trisubstituted carboxylic esters to their corresponding β-trisubstituted primary alcohols, which are widely applied in the pharmaceutical and fine-chemical industry. Under catalytic conditions, the imidazole moiety is deprotonated by <sup><i>t</i></sup>BuOK to generate a highly reactive anionic Mn-H species with a potassium countercation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the potassium cation in this anionic Mn-H intermediate interacts synergistically with the substrate's carbonyl group and the alkoxide group during hydrogen activation. This cation effect significantly lowers the energy barriers for both hydride transfer and heterolytic H<sub>2</sub> cleavage, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. Leveraging this potent anionic Mn-H catalyst, we achieved the hydrogenation of a diverse array of α-trisubstituted carboxylates (80 examples) under mild conditions.
40203456	Analysis of apoptosis levels and MMP7 gene expression in ovaries of postpartum female rabbits after long-term use of LHRH-A3.	LHRH-A3, a reproductive hormone analog, is widely used to stimulate ovulation in female rabbits. However, the long-term impact of sustained LHRH-A3 administration on the reproductive system, particularly ovarian health, remains unclear. In this study, we compared apoptosis levels in ovaries and molecular regulation between LHRH-A3-treated (A3 group) and untreated female rabbits (N group) after their 5th litter. Western blotting showed a significantly lower Bcl-2/Bax ratio in the A3 group compared with the N group (P<0.01), indicating higher ovarian apoptosis. Ovarian tissues from 4 rabbits per group were divided into the A3 group and the N group, and RNA-seq technology was then utilized to conduct transcriptome analysis on these two groups. This analysis revealed 220 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), including BMP6, BMP15, CYP1A1 and other reproductive-related genes. KEGG analysis of these DEGs showed their involvement in processes such as the cell cycle, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and ovarian steroidogenesis. Subsequently, we selected the key gene MMP7 for functional analysis using CCK8 and Annexin V-FITC/PI techniques. MMP7 was found to promote the proliferation of granulosa cells (GCs) and inhibit apoptosis (P<0.01). In conclusion, LHRH-A3 treatment can modulate ovarian molecular regulation, with the key gene MMP7 involved in the proliferation and apoptosis of GCs.

40203454	Controlled anti-solvent precipitation for enhanced dissolution rate and antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor.	The goal of our study is to augment ticagrelor (TC)'s dissolution rate and antiplatelet activity via controlled antisolvent precipitation. A saturated ethanolic solution of TC was prepared in the absence and presence of poloxamer 188 or gelucire 44/14. Aerosil 200 was added before controlled precipitation using water or water-containing poloxamer (1% w/v). The resulting precipitate was dried and characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and <i>in vitro</i> dissolution. FTIR showed hydrogen bonding after the processing of TC. DSC and PXRD reflected partial amorphization. A significant enhancement (<i>p < 0.05</i>) in dissolution efficiency and TC amount released after five minutes was also shown. The most effective composition was F6, which comprised TC, poloxamer, and Aerosil (5:5:2.5), or F9, utilizing gelucire instead of poloxamer at a similar ratio. Assessment of tail bleeding time (min) exhibited a significant (<i>p < 0.05</i>) prolongation for rat groups treated with F6 (24.71 ± 5.46) and F9 (30.06 ± 1.63) compared with negative control (3.43 ± 0.46) and unprocessed TC (5.78 ± 2.18). These results suggest an enhancement of TC's pharmacological activity probably due to enhanced bioavailability imparted with an enhanced dissolution rate. The study introduced controlled antisolvent precipitation as a simple tool for hastened TC's dissolution.
40203453	Purification-Free Bortezomib-Drug Conjugates Optimize Drug Economy and Cancer Therapeutic Synergy.	As a promising candidate in overcoming resistance, providing synergy, and developing treatments, conjugated combination drugs mostly prevail over drug cocktails in establishing prodrugs and precisely codelivering multiple drugs for combination chemotherapies. However, current drug-drug conjugation methods (e.g., esterification, amidation, etherification, etc.) do not allow quantitative drug conversion and require necessary purification of crude products, resulting in a limited economy of initial drugs. Meanwhile, practical stimulus concentration in vivo usually fails to efficiently activate parent drug release from drug conjugates in target sites, which diminishes their efficacy. Herein, we report a click conjugation strategy based on boronic acid-cis diol complexation, realizing a fast (<30 min), quantitative, and purification-free conjugation of bortezomib (BTZ) and azacytidine (AZA) or capecitabine or doxifluridine. Notably, the BTZ-AZA conjugate spontaneously self-assembles into nanomedicine and exhibits enhanced synergistic efficacy. Furthermore, BTZ and AZA could be conjugated into a polyprodrug with controlled size and composition, and different organelle uptakes augment the synergy of BTZ-AZA conjugate by approximately 1000-fold versus free BTZ toward A549 adenocarcinoma cells (IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.55 nM versus 536.7 nM). This click strategy would expand the vision for developing smart combination drugs.

40203437	Feasibility of a virtual safety officer in detecting PPE donning and doffing violations.	A safety officer (SO) can assist healthcare workers in minimizing respiratory transmission of communicable diseases through verification of compliance with safety protocols, such as appropriately donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). This project sought to determine if observation of PPE donning and doffing for detection of protocol violations by a virtual safety officer (VSO) was a feasible option to improve the safety of the workplace. Five healthcare workers with experience serving as safety officers were enrolled in a feasibility study in which they observed actors donning and doffing PPE in-person and noted errors using a curated checklist for documentation. One month later, the same participants viewed recordings of the in-person sessions and again recorded errors for seven trials. Five hundred and twenty-three responses recorded from the SOs across the in-person and virtual trials aligned 88.7% of the time. SOs were more accurate in the virtual setting than in the in-person setting (87.6% <i>vs</i>. 82.4%, respectively). However, Cohen's kappa showed lower inter-rater reliability when observing virtually than in-person, especially in the doffing steps of the protocol. A VSO may be a feasible option when assessing whether participants can correctly follow PPE donning and doffing protocols. Future work includes incorporating real-time observation, 360-degree cameras, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) to increase visualization, thereby increasing inter-rater reliability.

40203435	Characteristics and quality assessment of GRADE practice guidelines on maternal-fetal care.	The study aimed to assess the quality and applicability of current maternal-fetal health clinical practice guidelines that countries can adopt or adapt. A systematic search was conducted in the International Database of GRADE Guidelines (BIGG) for practice guidelines developed with the GRADE system (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) and related to maternal-fetal care. The selected guidelines were evaluated with the AGREE-REX (Appraisal of Guidelines REsearch and Evaluation-Recommendations Excellence) tool to assess clinical applicability (domain-1), values and preferences (domain-2) and applicability (domain-3). The variables were presented descriptively, and a statistical analysis was performed on the domains according to institution and country of origin. Of 1,212 clinical practice guidelines, 72 met the inclusion criteria. According to the type of collaborating organization, the World Health Organization predominated with 58.3%, versus specialized medical societies. Domain 1, "Clinical applicability," was the best rated by the reviewers (68.5%) compared to domain 2, "Values and preferences" (60%). According to the type of institution that developed the clinical practice guideline, a significant difference was demonstrated in domains 1 (p= 0.000), 2 (p= 0.006) and 3 (p= 0.000). Only domains 1 (p= 0.000) and 3 (p= 0.018) were statistically significant based on country of origin. This study emphasizes the importance of improving the quality of maternal-fetal clinical practice guidelines developed by organizations and governmental institutions and the need to strengthen the institutionalization of the use of evidence to develop, adapt and implement practice guidelines in countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, Colombia, the United States, among others.

40203433	Beyond Medication: The Dual Benefits of Physical Activity on Psychosis and Sleep Quality Among Male Patients with Schizophrenia.	While antipsychotic medications remain the primary treatment for schizophrenia, they often have limitations in addressing all symptoms and can lead to adverse side effects, prompting researchers to explore complementary approaches such as physical activity to enhance overall patient outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of physical activity on psychosis and sleep quality in patients with schizophrenia. This quasi-experimental study involved 70 male inpatients with schizophrenia, divided into an activity group (structured physical activity program) and a control group (standard care). The intervention group showed significant improvements across multiple symptom domains (positive and depression-anxiety) with large effect sizes (η<sup>2</sup> ranging from 0.553 to 0.705) compared to the control group. These improvements, including reductions in grandiosity, emotional withdrawal, and anxiety, were maintained at the 3-month follow-up. The study group also exhibited significant improvements in several aspects of sleep quality, including subjective sleep quality (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.612), sleep duration (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.877), and sleep disturbances (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.623). The physical activity program demonstrated significant improvements in sleep quality and various symptoms of schizophrenia, notably hallucinations and unusual thought content. Although the changes in negative symptoms were not statistically significant between groups, the overall findings suggest that physical activity can play a beneficial role in symptom management and enhance sleep quality for patients with schizophrenia.
40203432	An Inductive Content Analysis of Collaborative Violence Risk Management Plans in a High-Security Forensic Psychiatric Hospital.	This study explored a new method for nursing staff's work with collaborative violence risk management, to be used in forensic psychiatric inpatient settings. The components of the method, the background to, and the rationale for collaborative risk management in forensic mental health settings were outlined. An inductive content analysis of 50 of these collaborative violence risk management plans was conducted. The focus of the analysis was the types and frequencies of early warning signs for aggression, risk factors/scenarios for aggression, risk management strategies, and responsibilities devised to address that risk as well as goals agreed upon between patients and staff concerning that risk. The results showed that patients and staff could generate collaborative violence risk management plans which displayed a content with a high degree of face validity and content validity when comparing the content of the plans to previous literature on violence risk assessment and management in forensic mental health settings. Although collaborative work on violence risk and violence risk management poses several challenges within forensic psychiatric contexts, the results showed that these approaches hold some promise in such settings - focusing on risk reduction through goal-oriented collaboration between patient and staff - and are worthy of further development and investigation.

40203302	β-Hydroxyl Group in the Sulfonic Biobased Zwitterionic Surfactant Improves Its Thermal Tolerance of Interfacial Activity.	The hydrophilic head structure can significantly influence the interfacial performance of biobased zwitterionic surfactants. Among various hydrophilic groups, the hydroxyl group plays a considerable role in the influence on interfacial activity. However, the relevant mechanism remains to be elucidated. To study this point, in this work two new biobased zwitterionic surfactants, anisole-based oleamide ethyl hydroxypropyl sulfonyl quaternary ammonium salt (AEHSQA) and anisole-based oleamide ethyl sulfonylpropyl quaternary ammonium salt (AESPQA), were synthesized from biomass material methyl oleate, and the interfacial performances of the two surfactants were evaluated. It showed that AEHSQA can lower the interfacial tensions between crude oil and groundwater to the ultralow level (<10<sup>-2</sup> mN/m) at a temperature of up to 120 °C and a concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> of up to 2500 mg/L with one more β-hydroxyl group, while the corresponding tolerances of AESPQA are only 90 °C and 250 mg/L. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) was employed to study the interfacial behaviors of surfactant molecules at the oil-water interface under conditions of different temperatures and salinities. The results of MDS implied that introducing a hydroxyl group could improve the thermal resistance and salt tolerance of zwitterionic surfactants via resisting the hydrophilicity decline and interfacial looseness of surfactant molecules resulting from the increases in temperature and salinity.

40203298	Co-Designing a Web-Based and Tablet App to Evaluate Clinical Outcomes of Early Psychosis Service Users in a Learning Health Care Network: User-Centered Design Workshop and Pilot Study.	The Early Psychosis Intervention Network of California project, a learning health care network of California early psychosis intervention (EPI) programs, prioritized incorporation of community partner feedback while designing its eHealth app, Beehive. Though eHealth apps can support learning health care network data collection aims, low user acceptance or adoption can pose barriers to successful implementation. Adopting user-centered design (UCD) approaches, such as incorporation of user feedback, prototyping, iterative design, and continuous evaluation, can mitigate these potential barriers.
40203297	The circular RNA circANK suppresses rice resistance to bacterial blight by inhibiting microRNA398b-mediated defense.	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are prevalent in eukaryotic cells and have been linked to disease progressions. Their unique circular structure and stability make them potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Compared to animal models, plant circRNA research is still in its infancy. The lack of effective tools to specifically knock down circRNAs without affecting host gene expression has slowed the progress of plant circRNA research. Here, we have developed a CRISPR-Cas13d tool that can specifically knock down circRNAs in plant systems, successfully achieving the targeted knockdown of circRNAs in rice (Oryza sativa). We further focused on Os-circANK (a circRNA derived from Ankyrin repeat-containing protein), a circRNA differentially expressed in rice upon pathogen infection. Physiological and biochemical experiments revealed that Os-circANK functions as a sponge for miR398b, suppressing the cleavage of Cu/Zn-Superoxidase Dismutase (CSD)1/CSD2/Copper Chaperone for Superoxide Dismutase (CCSD)/Superoxidase Dismutase (SODX) through ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA), leading to reduced ROS levels following Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection and a negative regulation of rice resistance to bacterial blight. Our findings indicate Os-circANK inhibits rice resistance to bacterial blight via the microRNA398b(miR398b)/CSD/SOD pathway.
40203296	Registered Nurses' Promotion of Children's Participation During Medication Follow-Up in Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Outpatient Care.	Children treated with psychotropic medication have regular medication follow-ups with registered nurses (RNs) at the child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient care (CAPOC) unit, where RNs are responsible for ensuring that children can actively participate in their care on their own terms. This study explored how RNs in Swedish CAPOC units promote children's participation in medication follow-ups. Five focus group interviews were conducted with in total 32 RNs, and the data obtained were analyzed by qualitative thematic analysis. Three themes demonstrate how RNs adapt the medication follow-ups to promote children's participation: the first concerns balancing the needs and desires of both the child and the parents; the second involves recognizing each child based on their unique circumstances and interests; and the third theme is about how RNs adjust their communication to ensure that the child is given comprehensible information and has the opportunity to express themself. Our findings highlight how RNs promote children's participation in medication follow-ups and the challenges they encounter in accordance with child-centered care. In this three-way relationship with RNs, the child, and parents, RNs need to balance between the child's perspective and the parents' needs and desires.
40203291	Prehospital Gastric Lavage for the Treatment of Critically Ill Overdose or Poisonings: A Case Report.	A 72 year-old female with past medical history that included anxiety, depression, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was found unconscious in her bed at home by family members, surrounded by pill bottles and numerous loose baclofen tablets. Emergency medical service (EMS) was activated and responded quickly, finding an unresponsive patient with snoring respirations, clenched jaw, and foamy, bilious emesis with vital signs including tachycardia and hypoxia. Initial attempts at basic airway management were followed by movement to a waiting ambulance, and the arrival of an EMS physician and advanced paramedic. Despite use of sodium bicarbonate and multiple doses of a vasopressor, the patient developed widening QRS complex on electrocardiogram and refractory hypotension. After rapid sequence intubation, aspiration and low-volume gastric lavage was performed with a 34F Edlich tube, resulting in removal of visible pill fragments. Subsequently, the patient's hypotension resolved, and she was transferred to the care of the emergency department in stable condition. Gastric lavage remains clinically indicated for rare cases of recent, potentially lethal ingestions of poisons without effective antidotes, and is a standard component of emergency medicine residency training. The proliferation of EMS fellowship trained physicians suggests that this procedure should be considered an option in highly select cases, and EMS physician vehicles may consider carrying Edlich lavage tubes or similar prepackaged kits.
40203289	Robustness of ancestral sequence reconstruction to among-site and among-lineage evolutionary heterogeneity.	Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is typically performed using homogeneous evolutionary models, which assume that the same substitution propensities affect all sites and lineages. These assumptions are routinely violated: heterogeneous structural and functional constraints favor different amino acids at different sites, and these constraints often change among lineages as epistatic substitutions accrue at other sites. To evaluate how violations of the homogeneity assumption affect ASR under realistic conditions, we developed site-specific substitution models and parameterized them using data from deep mutational scanning experiments on three protein families; we then used these models to perform ASR on the empirical alignments and on alignments simulated under heterogeneous conditions derived from the experiments. Extensive among-site and -lineage heterogeneity is present in these datasets, but the sequences reconstructed from empirical alignments are almost identical when heterogeneous or homogeneous models are used for ASR. Using models fit to DMS data from distantly related proteins in which mutational effects are very different also has a minimal impact on ASR. The rare differences occur primarily where phylogenetic signal is weak - at fast-evolving sites and nodes connected by long branches. When ASR is performed on simulated data, errors in the reconstructed sequences become more likely as branch lengths increase, but incorporating heterogeneity into the model does not improve accuracy. These data establish that ASR is robust to unincorporated realistic forms of evolutionary heterogeneity, because the primary determinant of ASR is phylogenetic signal, not the substitution model. The best way to improve accuracy is therefore not to develop more elaborate models but to apply ASR to densely sampled alignments that maximize phylogenetic signal at the nodes of interest.
40203288	The Physicochemical Properties and Plausible Implication of Deep Eutectic Solvents in Analytical Techniques.	Volatile organic solvents and fluoride-containing ionic liquids (ILs) have few drawbacks like toxicity, non-biodegradability, and environmental issues. Even though ILs are considered as new safest solvent for their lower volatility. They pose toxicity and sustainability concerns. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have garnered significant attention as substitutes for these solvents, addressing their drawbacks and aligning with specific principles of green chemistry, such as reduced toxicity, biodegradability, and the use of renewable resources. This review thoroughly explains the emergence and inception of DESs through their development. It deals with the physicochemical properties like density, polarity, and viscosity. The factors dealing with variation in density and viscosity of DES have been discussed. The preparation and operation of DESs, encompassing their various variants such as hydrophobic and hydrophilic types are examined to provide a comprehensive grasp of their chemical properties. Beyond basic characteristics, the article delves into a few specific DES applications to demonstrate their flexibility. DESs show promising multifarious utility, ranging from acting as extractant to critical roles in sorbent-based extractions, solvent-based extractions, and their role in various analytical techniques. The article covers the opportunities and difficulties associated with DESs, offering a prospective viewpoint on future advancements and difficulties. The review outlines different facets of DES research, emphasizing the level of knowledge at the moment and their potential influence in the emerging subject of DESs.

40203284	Multiplexed cytokine profiling identifies diagnostic signatures for latent tuberculosis and reactivation risk stratification.	Active tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacteria and is characterized by multiple phases of infection, leading to difficulty in diagnosing and treating infected individuals. Patients with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) can reactivate to the active phase of infection following perturbation of the dynamic bacterial and immunological equilibrium, which can potentially lead to further Mtb transmission. However, current diagnostics often lack specificity for LTBI and do not inform on TB reactivation risk. We hypothesized that immune profiling readily available QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT) plasma supernatant samples could improve LTBI diagnostics and infer risk of TB reactivation. We applied a whispering gallery mode, silicon photonic microring resonator biosensor platform to simultaneously quantify thirteen host proteins in QFT-stimulated plasma samples. Using machine learning algorithms, the biomarker concentrations were used to classify patients into relevant clinical bins for LTBI diagnosis or TB reactivation risk based on clinical evaluation at the time of sample collection. We report accuracies of over 90% for stratifying LTBI + from LTBI- patients and accuracies reaching over 80% for classifying LTBI + patients as being at high or low risk of reactivation. Our results suggest a strong reliance on a subset of biomarkers from the multiplexed assay, specifically IP-10 for LTBI classification and IL-10 and IL-2 for TB reactivation risk assessment. Taken together, this work introduces a 45-minute, multiplexed biomarker assay into the current TB diagnostic workflow and provides a single method capable of classifying patients by LTBI status and TB reactivation risk, which has the potential to improve diagnostic evaluations, personalize treatment and management plans, and optimize targeted preventive strategies in Mtb infections.
40203283	Staged Mastopexy or Mammaplasty Prior to Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy: A Systematic Review of Safety and Nipple-Areola Complex Outcomes.	Patients with large or ptotic breasts undergoing nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) face reconstructive challenges, including higher risks of complications and suboptimal aesthetic outcomes. Pre-shaping procedures, such as mastopexy or reduction mammoplasty, have been proposed to optimize surgical outcomes by improving breast dimensions prior to NSM. This systematic review evaluates the safety and efficacy of these approaches. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane identified studies involving pre-shaping mastopexy or reduction prior to NSM. Data on surgical technique and complications-including nipple-areola complex (NAC) necrosis, mastectomy flap necrosis, infection, hematoma, and seroma-were extracted and pooled. Fourteen studies with 322 patients and 605 breasts met inclusion criteria. The weighted mean interval between pre-shaping and NSM was 167 days. NAC complications occurred in 5.27% of cases, most commonly partial necrosis or superficial epidermolysis. Mastectomy flap complications were reported in 4.90%, and infection occurred in 9.29% of cases, primarily minor infections. Notably, the majority of included mastectomies were prophylactic, which may contribute to lower complication rates, as prophylactic cases generally carry lower risk of nipple and skin flap necrosis than therapeutic ones. Overall, pooled complication rates were comparable to those in stand-alone mastopexy, reduction, or NSM procedures. Findings suggest that pre-shaping is a safe strategy that improves aesthetic and reconstructive outcomes in NSM for large or ptotic breasts. These techniques enhance NAC positioning, reduce flap tension, and improve postoperative symmetry without significantly increasing complications. This evidence supports the use of pre-shaping procedures in surgical planning for NSM.
40203281	Dynamic DNA-Based Nanoadjuvants for TLR9 Clustering and Innate Immune Activation in Dendritic Cells.	The regulation of toll-like receptor (TLR) clustering is a pivotal strategy for enhancing innate immune responses, but the development of methods to precisely control receptor assembly remains challenging. Herein, we present a dynamic, DNA-based nanoadjuvant that triggers TLR9 clustering for potent innate immune activation in dendritic cells (DCs) via in situ assembly in lysosomes. This nanoadjuvant integrates CpG oligonucleotides (TLR9 ligands) and cytosine-rich DNA sequences (acid-responsive sequences) into a polymeric nanoframework via a cascade hybridization chain reaction. Upon lysosomal internalization, the nanoadjuvants form large-sized aggregates through cytosine protonation-induced i-motif formation, a process driven by the acidic lysosomal environment. This assembly consumes lysosomal protons, thus reducing lysosomal acidity and attenuating hydrolase activity, leading to enhanced intralysosomal retention of nanoadjuvants. Moreover, the nanoadjuvant aggregates promote CpG ODN contact with the lysosomal membrane, thereby facilitating prolonged ligand-receptor interactions and efficient TLR9 clustering. Consequently, the nanoadjuvant aggregates induce efficient DC maturation, secretion of cytokines, and T-cell proliferation, culminating in robust antitumor immunity both in vitro and in vivo. Our approach offers a novel strategy to manipulate receptor assembly using an environmentally stimulus-responsive system, holding significant promise for vaccine adjuvants and cancer immunotherapy.
40203280	Ultrasound-Guided Gluteal Fat Grafting: What is the Evidence? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Buttock augmentation has become one of the most sought-after cosmetic procedures, but concerns over fat embolism-related fatalities have raised significant safety issues. Guidelines emphasize that fat grafting should remain in the subcutaneous layer, avoiding intramuscular injection. This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided gluteal fat grafting. A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase was conducted until July 2024, analyzing patient satisfaction, complication rates, mortality, fat embolism, fat necrosis, infection, and seroma. Statistical analyses, including the Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation, were performed using R version 4.1.2. Four studies with a total of 6,235 female patients (mean age 34 years, BMI 30.1 kg/m²) met the inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis showed no reported mortality (0.00 per 100, 95% CI: 0.00-0.00) or fat embolism (0.00 per 100, 95% CI: 0.00-0.00). Minor complications occurred at a rate of 6.32 per 100 (95% CI: 3.23-10.27), with seroma at 2.94 per 100 (95% CI: 0.97-5.75), infection at 0.23 per 100 (95% CI: 0.00-0.96), and fat necrosis at 0.09 per 100 (95% CI: 0.01-0.23; I² = 0). The findings indicate that ultrasound-guided gluteal fat grafting is associated with low complication rates and no reported serious adverse events such as death or fat embolism, reinforcing its role as a safer technique for buttock augmentation.
40203279	Thioflavin T Inspirations: On the Photophysical and Aggregation Properties of Fluorescent Difluoroborates Based on the Benzothiazole Core.	In this work, we investigated a novel series of fluorescent dyes based on benzothiazole core substituted with a palette of donor groups that differ in size, shape, and character (alkyl vs aromatic). These dyes exhibit an intramolecular charge transfer state in their electronic structure. The photophysical properties of the newly synthesized dyes were studied with an eye toward aggregation effects in solvents and mixtures of solvents differing in polarity. Moreover, multiphoton absorption studies were performed to determine the potential of the dyes in two-photon microscopy. The results of spectroscopic measurements were supported by electronic structure calculations using coupled-cluster theory. Overall, the results provide an indication regarding the optimal substituents to achieve bright emission in various media and how these properties are related to aggregation effects.
40203278	Probabilistic classification of gene-by-treatment interactions on molecular count phenotypes.	Genetic variation can modulate response to treatment (G×T) or environmental stimuli (G×E), both of which may be highly consequential in biomedicine. An effective approach to identifying G×T signals and gaining insight into molecular mechanisms is mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) of molecular count phenotypes, such as gene expression and chromatin accessibility, under multiple treatment conditions, which is termed response molecular QTL mapping. Although standard approaches evaluate the interaction between genetics and treatment conditions, they do not distinguish between meaningful interpretations such as whether a genetic effect is only observed in the treated condition or whether a genetic effect is observed but accentuated in the treated condition. To address this gap, we have developed a downstream method for classifying response molecular QTLs into subclasses with meaningful genetic interpretations. Our method uses Bayesian model selection and assigns posterior probabilities to different types of G×T interactions for a given feature-SNP pair. We compare linear and nonlinear regression of log ⁡ -scale counts, noting that the latter accounts for an expected biological relationship between the genotype and the molecular count phenotype. Through simulation and application to existing datasets of molecular response QTLs, we show that our method provides an intuitive and well-powered framework to report and interpret G×T interactions. We provide a software package, ClassifyGxT [1].
40203277	Comparative efficacy of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors in high-risk relapsed/refractory CLL: a network meta-analysis.	Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis) have led to changes in the treatment algorithm for patients with high-risk relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL), defined based on the presence of genetic mutations. Given the lack of head-to-head trials comparing next-generation BTKis used to treat high-risk R/R disease, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to estimate their relative efficacy. High-risk populations were defined based on the pre-specified definitions within each trial, including patients with del(17p) and/or TP53 mutations in ALPINE (n=150), and ASCEND (n=86), and del(17p)/del(11q) in ELEVATE-RR (n=533). Bayesian NMAs found zanubrutinib to be the most efficacious treatment for high-risk patients, with significantly reduced risk of progression or death compared with ibrutinib (hazard ratio [95% credible interval (CrI)]: 0.49 [0.31, 0.78]), acalabrutinib (0.55 [0.32, 0.94]), and bendamustine + rituximab or idelalisib + rituximab (BR/IR) (0.12 [0.05, 0.26]). Differences in overall survival demonstrated a numerical trend favoring zanubrutinib (probability better ≥80%) compared to ibrutinib (hazard ratio [95% credible interval]: 0.59 [0.31, 1.11]), acalabrutinib (0.72 [0.35, 1.50]) and BR/IR (0.65 [0.23, 1.75]). Rates of response also demonstrated trends favoring zanubrutinib compared to acalabrutinib, with significant results compared to ibrutinib. The NMA suggests that the most efficacious BTKi for patients with high-risk R/R CLL is zanubrutinib.
40203276	Spatio-temporal dynamics of urban medical system carrying capacity and their obstacle factors: A case study of Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration.	The frequent occurrence of various urban disasters poses risks to human survival and welfare, and it is of great significance to evaluate the urban medical system carrying capacity (UMSCC), monitor the spatial and temporal patterns of the UMSCC and identify their obstacle factors to improve the public medical system and rationalize medical resource allocation. In this paper, the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA), which includes 27 major cities, is taken as a case study. A UMSCC evaluation model is constructed and the gravity center shift trajectory is analyzed by using the ArcGIS software. The results indicate that the UMSCC of the 27 cities in the YRDUA can be classified into 5 levels: the lowers (0.193-0.335), the lows (0.335-0.425), the mediums (0.425-0.489), the highs (0.489-0.549) and the highers (0.549-0.619). From 2011-2021, the UMSCC level in all the 27 cities from the YRDUA increased annually, and during this period, the gravity center of the UMSCC was concentrated in Xuancheng, and the migration trend was southwest. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between the city type and the level of UMSCC: the larger of the city is, the higher of the UMSCC level is; however, the gap between the levels of UMSCC in different city types in the YRDUA gradually narrows and tends to be consistent, which reflects the development trend of medical system integration in the region. Finally, it is concluded that the key obstacle indicators of the UMSCC in the YRDUA can be attributed to the proportion of medical financial expenditure, the number of beds, the number of registered nurses and the urban digital development level. Correspondingly, the suggestions are proposed.
40203275	Causal mediation analysis for time-to-event outcomes on the Restricted Mean Survival Time scale: A pseudo-value approach.	Causal mediation analysis decomposes the total effect of an exposure on an outcome into: 1. the indirect effect through a mediator and 2. the remaining "direct" effect through all other pathways. When the outcome is a time-to-event/survival time, censoring makes identifying the indirect and direct effects on the expected value scale untenable. We propose a semi-parametric estimator of the indirect and direct effects on the restricted mean survival time (RMST) scale using the pseudo-value approach for estimating conditional RMSTs. The pseudo-value approach is generalizable to various forms of outcome censoring. We demonstrate the use of the pseudo-value based estimator to right and interval censored data. Our estimator applies to any set of identification assumptions that lead to the Mediation Formula, including natural, organic, randomized and separable indirect and direct effects. A simulation study demonstrates the performance of the estimators for right and interval censored outcomes under various scenarios. The methodology is applied to an HIV cure example with the intention of estimating the indirect effect of a putative treatment on time-to-viral rebound mediated through the viral reservoir.

40203245	Optimizing CNN for pavement distress detection via edge-enhanced multi-scale feature fusion.	Traditional crack detection methods initially relied on manual observation, followed by instrument-assisted techniques. Today, road surface inspection leverages deep learning to achieve automated crack detection. However, in the domain of deep learning-based road surface damage classification, the heterogeneous and complex nature of road environments introduces significant background noise and unstructured features. These factors often undermine the robustness and generalization capability of models, thereby adversely affecting classification accuracy. To address this challenge, this research incorporates edge priors by integrating traditional edge detection techniques with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). This paper proposes an innovative mechanism called Edge-Enhanced Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (EE-MSFF), which enhances edge information through multi-scale feature extraction, thereby mitigating the impact of complex backgrounds and improving the model's focus on crack regions. Specifically, the proposed mechanism leverages classical edge detection operators such as Sobel, Prewitt, and Laplacian to perform multi-scale edge information extraction during the feature extraction phase of the model. This process captures both local edge features and global structural information in crack regions, thereby enhancing the model's resistance to interference from complex backgrounds. By employing multi-scale receptive fields, the EE-MSFF mechanism facilitates hierarchical fusion of feature maps, guiding the model to learn edge information that is correlated with crack regions. This effectively strengthens the model's ability to perceive damaged pavement features in complex environments, improving classification accuracy and stability. In this study, the model underwent systematic training and validation on both the complex-background dataset RDD2020 and the simple-background dataset Concrete_Data_Week3. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 88.68% on the RDD2020 dataset and 99.5% on the Concrete_Data_Week3 dataset, where background interference is minimal. Furthermore, ablation studies were conducted to analyze the independent contributions of each module, highlighting the performance improvements associated with the integration of multi-scale edge features.
40203244	The role of miR-150-5p/E2F3/survivin axis in the pathogenesis of plasmablastic lymphoma and its therapeutic potential.	Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an uncommon and aggressive B-cell lymphoma with a poor prognosis. Some studies have described genetic alterations in PBL, but its transcriptome has been scarcely studied and molecular mechanisms driving lymphomagenesis remain poorly understood. Our goal was to delineate transcriptomic profiles to identify potential biomarkers for novel targeted therapy in PBL. RNA sequencing uncovered an enrichment of cell cycle-related genes, including MYC and E2F targets, and genes involved in G2/M checkpoint in PBL. Microarray analyses discovered two microRNA expression signatures depending on the presence of MYC-translocation. Interestingly, miR-150-5p was downregulated, while E2F3 and BIRC5 (survivin), a cell cycle activator and anti-apoptotic regulator respectively, were upregulated. Increasing miR-150-5p in PBL-1 cells induced G1 cell cycle arrest, suppressed proliferation by transcriptionally repressing E2F3, and promoted apoptosis by downregulation of BIRC5. Interestingly, the miR-150-5p tumor suppressor activity was diminished in E2F3-knockdown cells. The combined inhibition of E2F3 and survivin attenuated lymphomagenesis in PBL cells and suppressed tumor growth in a chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)-derived xenograft model of PBL. Overall, our study highlights the pivotal role of the miR-150-5p/E2F3/survivin axis boosting PBL lymphomagenesis and unveils new therapeutic targets for this lymphoma.
40203243	Mathematical modeling unveils the timeline of CAR-T cell therapy and macrophage-mediated cytokine release syndrome.	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy holds significant potential for cancer treatment, although disease relapse and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remain as frequent clinical challenges. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the temporal dynamics of CAR-T cell therapy response and CRS, we developed a novel multi-layer mathematical model incorporating antigen-mediated CAR-T cell expansion, antigen-negative resistance, and macrophage-associated cytokine release. Three key mechanisms of macrophage activation are considered: release of damage-associated molecular patterns, antigen-binding mediated activation, and CD40-CD40L contact. The model accurately describes 25 patient time courses with different responses and IL-6 cytokine kinetics. We successfully link the dynamic shape of the response to interpretable model parameters and investigate the influence of CAR-T cell dose and initial tumor burden on the occurrence of cytokine release and treatment outcome. By disentangling the timeline of macrophage activation, the model identified distinct contributions of each activation mechanism, suggesting the CD40-CD40L axis as a major driver of cytokine release and a clinically feasible target to control the activation process and modulate cytokine peak height. Our multi-layer model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between CAR-T cells, tumor cells, and macrophages during therapy.
40203242	Deep-Learning-Assisted Microfluidic Immunoassay via Smartphone-Based Imaging Transcoding System for On-Site and Multiplexed Biosensing.	Point-of-care testing (POCT) with multiplexed capability, ultrahigh sensitivity, affordable smart devices, and user-friendly operation is critically needed for clinical diagnostics and food safety. This study presents a deep-learning-assisted microfluidic immunoassay platform that uses a smartphone-based imaging transcoding system, polystyrene microsphere-based encoding, and artificial-intelligence-assisted decoding. Microspheres of varying sizes act as multiprobes, with their quantities correlating to target concentrations after an immunoreaction and separation-filtration within the microfluidic chip. A smartphone with intelligent decoding software captures images of multiprobes from the chip and performs classification, counting, and concentration calculations. The "encoding-decoding" strategy and integrated microfluidic chip design allow these processes to be completed in simple steps, eliminating the need for additional immunomagnetic separation. As a proof of concept, this platform successfully detected multiple respiratory viruses and antibiotics in various real samples with high sensitivity within 30 min, demonstrating great potential as a smart, universal toolkit for next-generation POCT applications.
40203241	MAF-Net: A multimodal data fusion approach for human action recognition.	3D skeleton-based human activity recognition has gained significant attention due to its robustness against variations in background, lighting, and viewpoints. However, challenges remain in effectively capturing spatiotemporal dynamics and integrating complementary information from multiple data modalities, such as RGB video and skeletal data. To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal fusion framework that leverages optical flow-based key frame extraction, data augmentation techniques, and an innovative fusion of skeletal and RGB streams using self-attention and skeletal attention modules. The model employs a late fusion strategy to combine skeletal and RGB features, allowing for more effective capture of spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D, SYSU, and UTD-MHAD, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models. This work not only enhances action recognition accuracy but also provides a robust foundation for future multimodal integration and real-time applications in diverse fields such as surveillance and healthcare.
40203240	From Prediction to Prescription: Machine Learning and Causal Inference for the Heterogeneous Treatment Effect.	The increasing accumulation of medical data brings the hope of data-driven medical decision-making, but data's increasing complexity-as text or images in electronic health records-calls for complex models, such as machine learning. Here, we review how machine learning can be used to inform decisions for individualized interventions, a causal question. Going from prediction to causal effects is challenging, as no individual is seen as both treated and not. We detail how some data can support some causal claims and how to build causal estimators with machine learning. Beyond variable selection to adjust for confounding bias, we cover the broader notions of study design that make or break causal inference. As the problems span across diverse scientific communities, we use didactic yet statistically precise formulations to bridge machine learning to epidemiology.
40203239	A knowledge tracing approach with dual graph convolutional networks and positive/negative feature enhancement network.	Knowledge tracing models predict students' mastery of specific knowledge points by analyzing their historical learning performance. However, existing methods struggle with handling a large number of skills, data sparsity, learning differences, and complex skill correlations. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge tracing method based on dual graph convolutional networks and positive/negative feature enhancement. We construct dual graph structures with students and skills as nodes, respectively. The dual graph convolutional networks independently process the student and skill graphs, effectively resolving data sparsity and skill correlation challenges. By integrating positive/negative feature enhancement and spectral embedding clustering optimization modules, the model efficiently combines student and skill features, overcoming variations in learning performance. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches, showcasing significant advantages in handling complex learning data. This method provides new directions for educational data mining and personalized learning through innovative graph learning models and feature enhancement techniques.
40203238	Establishing a High-Yield <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>-Based Cell-Free Protein Synthesis System for In Vitro Prototyping and Natural Product Biosynthesis.	Cell-free systems are emerging as powerful platforms for synthetic biology with widespread applications in both fundamental research, such as artificial cell construction, and practical uses like recombinant protein production. Among these, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) plays a crucial role in gene expression for various downstream applications. However, the development of CFPS systems based on certain chassis, such as <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, still remains limited due to their low in vitro productivity. Here, we report the development of a highly productive CFPS system derived from an engineered <i>B. subtilis</i> 164T7P strain, which contains a genomic integration of the T7 RNA polymerase gene. This modification allows the preparation of cell extracts that inherently contain T7 RNA polymerase, enabling T7 promoter-based transcription without the supplementation of purified T7 RNA polymerase in CFPS reactions. Through systematic optimization of cell extract preparation and key reaction parameters, we achieved the synthesis of 286 ± 16.7 μg/mL of sfGFP in batch reactions, with yields increasing to over 1100 μg/mL in a semicontinuous format that can replenish substrates and remove inhibitory byproducts. We further demonstrated the system's versatility by using it for two synthetic biology applications: prototyping ribosome binding site (RBS) elements and synthesizing pulcherriminic acid─a bioactive cyclodipeptide. The system successfully characterized RBS performance, with in vitro and in vivo rankings correlating with predicted strengths, and expressed two active biosynthetic enzymes (cyclodipeptide synthase─YvmC and cytochrome P450 enzyme─CypX), leading to the production of pulcherriminic acid. Overall, our <i>B. subtilis</i>-based CFPS system offers a robust platform for high-yield protein synthesis, in vitro prototyping of gene regulatory elements, and natural product biosynthesis, highlighting its broad potential for synthetic biology and biotechnology applications.
40203237	Workforce Development in Genomic Data Science for Health: A Worldview.

However, fully realizing these benefits requires a well-trained workforce equipped to handle, analyze, and interpret increasingly complex genomic and linked datasets. The rapid evolution of sequencing technologies, machine learning, and data science tools has heightened the demand for professionals proficient in bioinformatics, high-performance computing, and genomic data governance. This review presents a global perspective on workforce development in genomic data science, detailing key competencies necessary for both research and clinical applications. We discuss some of the existing training programs, competency frameworks, and regional approaches to skills development while identifying gaps in education, infrastructure, and accessibility. Additionally, we explore the integration of genomic data science into healthcare, addressing challenges such as equitable access to training and the need for cross-disciplinary expertise. Tackling these challenges is essential for cultivating a diverse, skilled workforce capable of driving advancements in genomic research, precision medicine, and public health.
40203236	Correlation between basal ganglia nuclei and cortical gray matter volume changes in different motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease.	Explore the correlation between basal ganglia nuclei and cortical gray matter volume changes in tremor-dominant and postural instability-gait difficulty (PIGD) Parkinson's disease subtypes for Parkinson's disease diagnosis and individualized treatment. High-resolution 3D-T1WI MRI data from 35 tremor-dominant and 30 PIGD patientsand 35 healthy controls were analyzed. Voxel-based morphometry identified gray matter volume differences. Automated basal ganglia segmentation quantified subcortical volumes, followed by multivariate analysis of covariance and Spearman correlation analyses. Compared with healthy control, patients with PIGD exhibited severe gray matter loss (P < 0.0001), while tremor-dominant showed nonsignificant reductions. Subcortically, different basal ganglia volumes were atrophied in the tremor-dominant and PIGD groups compared with the healthy control (P < 0.05). PIGD demonstrated greater left putamen atrophy than tremor-dominant (P < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the volume of the right globus pallidus was positively correlated with that of the left medial and lateral cingulate gyrus in patients with tremor-dominant (r = 0.35, P = 0.04); and between the left globus pallidus volume and the right superior temporal gyrus volume in patients with PIGD (r = 0.47, P = 0.01). Compared with the tremor-dominant subtype, the PIGD subtype exhibits more severe GM atrophy, with different basal ganglia volume changes across subtypes. These altered anatomical features and the correlation between degeneration of the basal ganglia region and cortical gray matter changes may provide insights into the differential functional changes in patients with different motor subtypes and help to elucidate the underlying pathologic mechanisms.
40203235	Alterations in static and dynamic functional network connectivity in chronic low back pain: a resting-state network functional connectivity and machine learning study.	Low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent pain condition whose persistence can lead to changes in the brain regions responsible for sensory, cognitive, attentional, and emotional processing. Previous neuroimaging studies have identified various structural and functional abnormalities in patients with LBP; however, how the static and dynamic large-scale functional network connectivity (FNC) of the brain is affected in these patients remains unclear. Forty-one patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) and 42 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional MRI scanning. The independent component analysis method was employed to extract the resting-state networks. Subsequently, we calculate and compare between groups for static intra- and inter-network functional connectivity. In addition, we investigated the differences between dynamic functional network connectivity and dynamic temporal metrics between cLBP patients and healthy controls. Finally, we tried to distinguish cLBP patients from healthy controls by support vector machine method. The results showed that significant reductions in functional connectivity within the network were found within the DMN,DAN, and ECN in cLBP patients. Significant between-group differences were also found in static FNC and in each state of dynamic FNC. In addition, in terms of dynamic temporal metrics, fraction time and mean dwell time were significantly altered in cLBP patients. In conclusion, our study suggests the existence of static and dynamic large-scale brain network alterations in patients with cLBP. The findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying various brain function abnormalities and altered pain experiences in patients with cLBP.
40203234	Code conflict in an event file task is reflected by aperiodic neural activity.	We investigated the relationship between aperiodic electroencephalography (EEG) activity and code conflict, hypothesizing that the former might serve as an indicator of the latter. We analyzed EEG and behavioral outcomes of a sample performing the event file task, which assesses code conflict in co-occurring or temporally overlapping stimulus and response features. To quantify aperiodic activity, we employed the fitting oscillations & one-over-f algorithm. The behavioral results revealed a typical partial-repetition cost effect, indicating that performance is impaired if the stimulus repeats while the response alternates, or vice versa. This suggests that the previously combined shape and response were stored in an event file and retrieved when any one of these components was repeated. Notably, this effect was also evident in the aperiodic exponent, which was lower for partial repetitions than for full repetitions or alternations, implying increased cortical noise, a higher excitatory E/I ratio, and noisier decision-making processes. The scalp distribution of this effect aligns with its sensorimotor characteristics. Thus, we interpret these findings as promising preliminary evidence that the aperiodic exponent may serve as a valuable neural marker of code conflict.
40203233	Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 promotes angiogenesis through the caveolin-1/VEGF pathway after cerebral ischemic injury.	The long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) might protect against cerebral ischemic injury. This study explored MALAT1's function in ischemic stroke and whether it acts through the caveolin-1/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. A mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and a human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) were established. Lentiviral vectors for MALAT1 knockdown, caveolin-1 knockdown, and MALAT1 overexpression were used for gene regulation studies. Neurological deficits, endothelial cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cell viability, in vitro angiogenesis, cell migration, and the expression of related gene and protein were evaluated using the Zea Longa five-point scale, VEGF receptor 2/CD34 double immunofluorescence, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining, cell counting kit-8 assay, tube formation assay, transwell assay, quantitative real time PCR, and western blot. In mouse MCAO/R model and HBMEC OGD/R model, the expression levels of MALAT1, caveolin-1, and VEGF were significantly upregulated compared to the control group. In vivo, downregulation of MALAT1 expression exacerbated cerebral ischemic injury as manifested by severe neurological deficits, larger infarct volume, increased apoptosis, decreased numbers of VEGF receptor 2+/CD34+ endothelial progenitor cells, increased cell apoptosis, and the downregulation of caveolin-1 and VEGF. Conversely, overexpression of MALAT1 partially reversed the inhibition of cell migration and tubule formation by caveolin-1 gene downregulation, and restored in the expression of caveolin-1 and VEGF. MALAT1 promotes angiogenesis after cerebral ischemic injury, likely in part via the caveolin-1/VEGF pathway. Thus, MALAT1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.
40203232	Generative Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Biomedical and Health Professions Education.	Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has had a profound impact on biomedicine and health, both in professional work and in education. Based on large language models (LLMs), generative AI has been found to perform as well as humans in simulated situations taking medical board exams, answering clinical questions, solving clinical cases, applying clinical reasoning, and summarizing information. Generative AI is also being used widely in education, performing well in academic courses and their assessments. This review summarizes the successes of LLMs and highlights some of their challenges in the context of education, most notably aspects that may undermines the acquisition of knowledge and skills for professional work. It then provides recommendations for best practices to overcome the shortcomings of LLM use in education. Although there are challenges for the use of generative AI in education, all students and faculty, in biomedicine and health and beyond, must have understanding and be competent in its use.
40203231	Patient anti-FVIII drug antibodies bind preferentially to a subset of FVIII covalent states.	Haemophilia A is a chronic life-threatening condition caused by deficiency or dysfunction of plasma coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and commonly managed by prophylaxis with regular infusion of FVIII protein. A major obstacle to FVIII replacement therapy is the generation of alloantibodies that diminish efficacy. Disulfide bonds link pairs of cysteine residues in proteins and in several proteins have been found to be only partially formed in the mature proteins. FVIII contains 8 disulfide bonds and their redox state in human blood and recombinant FVIII was determined using differential cysteine alkylation and mass spectrometry. All 8 disulfide bonds were found to be unformed in ~10% to ~70% of molecules of FVIII populations, which suggested a conformational flexibility that could favour binding of certain ligands to subsets of FVIII with more or less formed disulfide bonds. To test this hypothesis, the binding of a panel of five patient-derived anti-FVIII antibodies to the population of FVIII disulfide-bonded states was evaluated. All five antibodies bound preferentially to FVIII states where 2 or 3 of the 8 disulfides are significantly more unformed; C1918-C1922 in the A3 domain, C2040-C2188 in the C1 domain and C2193-C2345 in the C2 domain. Disulfide bond mutagenesis experiments and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this subset of FVIII states have long-range conformational dynamism that favours anti-drug antibody binding. These findings will assist efforts to engineer a FVIII molecule that is less prone to neutralization by anti-drug antibodies and has general implications for autoimmune conditions and antibody drug efficacy.
40203230	Curriculum Design in an Evolving Field: Perspectives on Biomedical Data Science from Stanford.	In recent decades, there has been an explosion of data streams spanning the entire spectrum of biomedicine, opening novel opportunities to tackle biological and medical research questions, increasing our ability to provide effective and efficient health care. In parallel, augmented computational power has allowed the development and deployment of quantitative approaches at unprecedented scales. To effectively take advantage of this progress, it is important to invest in the training of a new generation of biomedical data scientists. Designing a graduate curriculum in the backdrop of a rapidly changing landscape of data, methods, and computing power demands flexibility and openness to adaptation. At the same time, we strive to ensure that the students acquire foundational competencies that might fuel productive and evolving careers, without being constrained to and defined by a niche trendy topic. We offer here a view of graduate training in biomedical data science from the standpoint of our experience at Stanford University. We conclude with a series of open challenges, the answers to which we believe will shape training in biomedical data science.

40203228	What are the factors associated with rural-urban inequality in under-5 deaths in low- and middle-income countries? A Fairlie decomposition analysis.	The retention of under-5 mortality (U5M) in various ramifications has dire policy implications. The varying impacts of this inequality is very important and has been researched in many rural-urban settings. In spite of many studies that have examined rural-urban inequalities, very little has been researched with respect to low middle-income countries. In this study, we utilized an innovative statistical method to examine and explain the socio-economic determinants and rural-urban differences of mortality in some selected low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries.
40203227	The two-stage location model for multi-construction period of material warehouses.	This article proposes a two-stage location model to construct a unified construction plan for multi-construction period material warehouses in the distribution network. Initially, we propose a honeycomb grid partitioning method aimed at managing the time-scale of electric power material demand through effective grid administration. Subsequently, we develop an optimization model for the first stage, which identifies the threshold for the upper limit of material transportation time and establishes the construction objectives for material warehousing during each construction period. To address the challenge posed by the inconsistent locations of material warehouses across different construction periods, we formulate an optimization model for the second stage. Finally, based on the spatial distribution of power demand in Taizhou City's distribution network, we devise a comprehensive construction plan for a material warehouse system that spans four construction periods. By adding nine material warehouse locations, we achieve a reduction of 57.14% in the maximum transportation time for electric power materials. The method proposed in this article provides a general solution for the long-term planning of persistent structures by converting long-term planning into construction goals across multiple stages.

40203224	Amyloid and Tau Pathology in Cognitively Unimpaired Individuals With a Parental History of Alzheimer Disease: Role of Sex and Parent's Sex.	Female sex and a parental history of Alzheimer disease (AD), especially maternal, confer increased risk of AD. Associations between sex, or affected AD parent's sex, and biomarkers of AD are less clear. We examined whether sex or affected AD parent's sex influences (1) β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau burden/accumulation, (2) the association between Aβ and tau burden, and (3) brain and cognitive resilience to Aβ and tau burden.
40203223	How does digital inclusive finance enhance rural economic resilience? - A study based on provincial panel data in China.	This paper explores the role of digital inclusive finance in enhancing rural economic resilience, using panel data from 30 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions from 2013 to 2023. The results show that digital inclusive finance significantly improves rural economic adaptability and transformation capabilities, though its impact on risk resistance is minimal. It strengthens rural economic resilience through two main channels: improving transportation infrastructure and promoting rural technological innovation. This effect is particularly strong in areas with advanced rural digital infrastructure. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that digital inclusive finance positively impacts rural economic resilience in both eastern and western regions, but has no significant effect in central regions. Furthermore, its impact is more pronounced in non-agricultural provinces compared to agricultural ones. The study suggests that the government should continue expanding digital inclusive finance, while tailoring policies to local conditions, to support the sustainable development of the rural economy.
40203222	Protocol: Waiting time and ways of accessing specialized health services in public hospitals in Ecuador.	This study aims to determine the waiting time and the forms of access to specialized health services in public hospitals in Ecuador. A representative sample of 32 hospitals under the Ministry of Public Health was considered, with 26 selected by accessibility convenience. Data will be collected using a structured questionnaire. Patients will be asked about the number of days they waited for their medical appointments and the method used to schedule their appointments. The study distinguishes between standardized access, based on Ecuador's formal referral and counter-referral system, and non-standardized access methods, such as personal connections or hospital staff involvement. The data of this protocol are registered and publicly accessible at: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.261ge5z7wg47/v1. We expect to identify a correlation between waiting times and the type of access to specialized medical services, with non-standardized access potentially leading to shorter waiting times. This research may highlight disparities in the system and suggest areas for improvement in equity and efficiency within the healthcare referral process. To do so, a structured survey will be used. Since a construct is not needed to determine the waiting time or the forms of access, it was not necessary to validate the instrument. However, we did validate the understanding of the questions and the response options in several places in the country. According to the results of the validation of the instrument, pollsters will be instructed to inform users about the meaning of the question on ethnic identification, which was difficult to understand in the country's coastal areas.
40203221	Molecular Ferroelectric [(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>Cl]PbI<sub>3</sub> Showing Two-Step Switching Second-Order Nonlinear Optics.	Molecular ferroelectrics have garnered significant attention owing to their environmental compatibility, facile synthesis, lightweight nature, and structural versatility. In this study, we present a novel one-dimensional (1D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite molecular ferroelectric, [(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>Cl]PbI<sub>3</sub> (<b>1</b>), which undergoes two successive reversible phase transitions. This compound demonstrates distinct spontaneous polarization in ferroelectric domains, along with two-step switching in second-harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric responses. Variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals a symmetry-breaking transition in <b>1</b>, shifting from the centrosymmetric <i>P</i>6<sub>3</sub>/<i>mmc</i> space group to the polar noncentrosymmetric <i>P</i>6<sub>3</sub> ferroelectric phase. This transition is primarily driven by an order-disorder transformation of the [(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>Cl]<sup>+</sup> cation. Furthermore, compound <b>1</b> exhibits promising semiconductor characteristic with a bandgap of 2.70 eV. This material's unique high-low-off SHG-switching behavior and robust polarization switching (<i>P</i><sub>s</sub> = 0.3 μC·cm<sup>-2</sup>) position it as a multifunctional platform for next-generation applications in multistate memory devices, programmable optical modulators, and temperature-responsive sensors, addressing critical limitations of conventional molecular ferroelectrics in stability and functional diversity.
40203220	Sulfone-Modulated Aqueous Polymerization-Induced Self-Assembly: Tailoring Adaptive Nanostructures via Competing Supramolecular Interactions.	The integration of supramolecular chemistry with polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) offers a promising avenue to advance the design and functionality of nanomaterials. Here, we elucidate the role of sulfone bonding in aqueous block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly by evaluating the aqueous PISA behaviors of sulfone-functionalized BCPs and the stimuli-responsive properties of the resulting assemblies. A series of 2-(alkylsulfonyl)ethyl acrylamides were designed for aqueous PISA, in which the sulfone moiety not only enhances monomer water solubility but also stabilizes polymer assemblies through sulfone bonding. Systematic variation of the alkyl tail revealed distinct PISA behaviors, where shorter tails favored sulfone-bond-dominated assembly, while longer tails introduced competitive hydrophobic interactions. This interplay between sulfone bonding and hydrophobicity enabled the fabrication of polymer assemblies with programmable ion-responsive morphology transitions. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the role of supramolecular interactions in PISA and establish a versatile strategy for engineering adaptive nanomaterials.
40203219	Development of anatomically accurate digital organ models for surgical simulation and training.	Advancements in robotics and other technological innovations have accelerated the development of surgical procedures, increasing the demand for training environments that accurately replicate human anatomy. This study developed a system that utilizes the AutoSegmentator extension of 3D Slicer, based on nnU-Net, a state-of-the-art deep learning framework for automatic organ extraction, to import automatically extracted organ surface data into CAD software along with original DICOM-derived images. This system allows medical experts to manually refine the automatically extracted data, making it more accurate and closer to the ideal dataset. First, Python programming is used to automatically generate and save JPEG-format image data from DICOM data for display in Blender. Next, DICOM data imported into 3D Slicer is processed by AutoSegmentator to extract surface data of 104 organs in bulk, which is then exported in STL format. In Blender, a custom-developed Python script aligns the image data and organ surface data within the same 3D space, ensuring accurate spatial coordinates. By using Blender's CAD functionality within this space, the automatically extracted organ boundaries can be manually adjusted based on the image data, resulting in more precise organ surface data. Additionally, organs and blood vessels that cannot be automatically extracted can be newly created and added by referencing the image data. Through this process, a comprehensive anatomical dataset encompassing all required organs and blood vessels can be constructed. The dataset created with this system is easily customizable and can be applied to various surgical simulations, including 3D-printed simulators, hybrid simulators that incorporate animal organs, and surgical simulators utilizing augmented reality (AR). Furthermore, this system is built entirely using open-source, free software, providing high reproducibility, flexibility, and accessibility. By using this system, medical professionals can actively participate in the design and data processing of surgical simulation systems, leading to shorter development times and reduced costs.

40203217	Preparation of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Products for Companion Animals.	Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is increasingly utilized in small animal medicine for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders. Despite proven clinical efficacy, there is no detailed protocol available for the preparation and storage of FMT products for veterinarians in a variety of clinical settings. Herein, the effect of processing technique on the microbial community structure was assessed with amplicon sequence analysis. Microbial viability was assessed with standard culture techniques using selective media. Given the fastidious nature of many intestinal microbes, colony forming units are considered surrogate viable microbes, representing a portion of potentially viable microbes. FMT products from four screened canine fecal donors and six screened feline fecal donors were processed aerobically according to a double centrifugation protocol adapted from the human medical literature. Fresh feces from an additional three screened canine fecal donors were used to evaluate the effect of cryopreservative, centrifugation, and short-term storage on microbial community structure and in vitro surrogate bacterial viability. Finally, fresh feces from a third group of three screened canine and three screened feline fecal donors were used to evaluate the long-term in vitro surrogate bacterial viability of three frozen and lyophilized FMT products. Microbiota analysis revealed that each canine fecal donor has a unique microbial profile. Processing of canine and feline feces for FMT does not significantly alter the overall microbial community structure. The addition of cryopreservatives and lyopreservatives significantly improved long-term viability, up to 6 months, for frozen and lyophilized FMT products compared to unprocessed raw feces with no cryopreservative. These results prove the practicality of this approach for FMT preparation in veterinary medicine and provide a detailed protocol for researchers and companion animal practitioners. Future in vivo research is needed to evaluate how the preparation and microbial viability of FMT impacts the recipient's microbial community and clinical outcomes across multiple disease phenotypes.
40203215	Self-Assembled Glycopeptide as a Biocompatible mRNA Vaccine Platform Elicits Robust Antitumor Immunity.	Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines have garnered significant attention. Delivery systems affect the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, yet there remains a scarcity of vectors that can achieve safe and efficient delivery of mRNA. We took advantage of self-assembled glycopeptides (SAPs) to develop a vector named Man-MPm, which was coupled with mannose and manganese ions to achieve lymph node targeting and STING pathway activation. The Man-MPm-based mRNA vaccine exhibited high biosafety across various administration routes, eliciting robust antigen-specific immune responses within lymph nodes. Due to the elevated antitumor immunity, Man-MPm significantly suppressed tumor growth and extended the survival period of mice in melanoma prevention and treatment models as well as in a colon cancer model. Our findings show that Man-MPm addresses the challenges to safety and effectiveness associated with mRNA delivery by incorporating a lymph node-targeting ligand and a STING pathway agonist onto highly biocompatible SAP, and Man-MPm holds great potential for developing mRNA tumor vaccines.

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) exerts a powerful influence on health. The distribution of cardiovascular risk factors, including CRF, varies across geographic places and is likely influenced by multiple factors at the community, neighborhood, and school levels. In South Carolina, Councils of Government (COGs) serve as regional planning organizations that guide the development and implementation of federal, state, and local initiatives-many of which can influence health-related sectors such as education, parks and recreation, and public health.
40203211	Rhodospermals A-G: an Extension to the Chemical Diversity of Compounds Possessing a Unique Spiroketal with a Fused α,β-Unsaturated δ-Lactone Isolated from the Leaves of <i>Cryptocarya rhodosperma</i> (Lauraceae).	Phytochemical investigation of the Australian rainforest plant <i>Cryptocarya rhodosperma</i> B. Hyland (Lauraceae) led to the isolation and structural elucidation of seven new unique spiroketals fused with an α,β-unsaturated δ-lactone, namely, rhodospermals A-G (<b>1</b> - <b>7</b>), and a new alkylbenzodioxole α,β-<i>unsaturated</i>-δ-lactone rhodopyrone A (<b>8</b>) along with the known compounds EBC-23 (<b>9</b>) and EBC-73 (<b>10</b>). The chemical structures of these compounds were established by NMR spectroscopic data analysis, relative stereochemistry confirmed by distinct <i>J</i> coupling, NOESY correlations, and a close comparison of the NMR data and optical rotation of the previously reported compounds (<b>9</b>, <b>10</b>). X-ray crystallography analysis and Mosher ester analysis of <b>1</b> confirmed the absolute stereochemistry of the fused spiroketal with an α,β-unsaturated δ-lactone. A plausible identical stereochemistry of the common fused spiroketal with an α,β-unsaturated δ-lactone observed in the remaining analogues (<b>2</b>-<b>7</b>) was proposed. The absolute stereochemistry of <b>8</b> was determined by performing a Mosher ester analysis and distinct <i>J</i> coupling. Compounds <b>1-10</b> exhibited cytotoxic activity in several cancer cell lines, highlighting their potential use in the treatment of human tumors.

40203208	Bromo-Heptahelicene-Bis-Thiadiazole: Photophysics, Chiroptics and Excited-State Dynamics.	The synthesis of a [7]helicene bromide derivative with two fused 2,1,3-thiadiazole heterocycles (TD[7]Br) and a comprehensive study of its photophysical and chiroptical characteristics are presented along with a comparison to 9-bromo-carbo[7]helicene ([7]Br) and 3,15-dibromo-carbo[6]helicene ([6]Br). The integration of a bromine heavy atom onto helicene backbone facilitates efficient singlet-to-triplet conversion allowing us to investigate the resulting fluorescence and phosphorescence properties. Steady-state chiroptical features of the systems are demonstrated through electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Interestingly, a fluorescence quantum yield of 14% was obtained, a 17-fold increase compared to the corresponding bromo-heptacarbohelicene, and phosphorescence dissymmetry factors reached ±1.2×10-2 at 580 nm at low temperature. Finally, we delved into the exploration of various excited states generated during the excitation process and their dynamics, by employing non-polarized transient absorption and emission spectroscopies, thus highlighting the fruitful combination of heavy-atom effect and charge transfer. The experimental results were understood through time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) computations.
40203207	Intermolecular Vibrational and Orientational Dynamics of Deep Eutectic Solvents Composed of Lithium Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide and Organic Amides Revealed by Dynamic Kerr Effect Spectroscopy.	In this study, we investigated the intermolecular dynamics, including intermolecular vibration and orientational dynamics, of five deep eutectic solvents (DESs) consisting of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide and organic amides, such as acetamide, propanamide, <i>N</i>-methylacetamide, butyramide, and urea, at a mole ratio of 1:3 using femtosecond Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy (fs-RIKES) and subpicosecond optical Kerr effect spectroscopy (ps-OKES). The fs-RIKES results showed that the line shape of the low-frequency band of the <i>N</i>-methylacetamide was trapezoidal, while that of the other organic amide-based DESs was bimodal. The peak and first moment of the intermolecular vibrational band appearing in the frequency range less than 250 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the acetamide- and urea-based DESs were in a higher-frequency region compared to the other three DESs, indicating stronger intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, analysis of the intramolecular vibrational bands of the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide anion showed that the population of the transoid conformer of the anion was slightly higher in the urea-based DES than in the other organic amide-based DESs, suggesting that urea solvate lithium cations more than the other organic amides. The slow relaxation dynamics of all five DESs were captured for up to 1 ns using ps-OKES. The slow relaxation dynamics also depended on the organic amide species. However, the slow relaxation time constant did not show a clear correlation with the viscosity; therefore, the relaxation dynamics of the DESs did not follow the Stokes-Einstein-Debye hydrodynamic model. The densities, viscosities, surface tensions, and electrical conductivities of the DESs were also measured for comparison with spectroscopic results.

40203205	Electrochemical Benzylic C-H Carboxylation.	Direct benzylic C-H carboxylation stands as a high atom economy, efficient, and convenient route for the synthesis of valuable benzylic carboxylic acids, which are of great significance in many pharmaceuticals and bioactive molecules. However, the inherent inertness of both benzylic C-H bonds and carbon dioxide presents a great challenge for further transformations. Herein, we report our efforts to overcome this obstacle via halide-promoted linear paired electrolysis to generate various benzylic carboxylic acids. Remarkably, this process is transition-metal- and base-free, making it environmentally benign and cost-effective. Besides, it is suitable for constructing a wide range of primary, secondary, and tertiary benzylic carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions, demonstrating broad substrate scopes and good functional group tolerance. Furthermore, our protocol enables the direct synthesis of some drug molecules, including Flurbiprofen, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen, and facilitates the late-stage modification of complex compounds, showcasing the practical application in synthetic chemistry and underscores its potential to advance the synthesis of benzylic carboxylic acids and related compounds.
40203203	Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Atropoisomeric 2-(Quinolin-8-yl)benzylalcohols.	The chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of 2-(quinolin-8-yl)benzylalcohols using a combination of lipases and ruthenium catalysts is described. While CalB lipase performs highly selective enzymatic kinetic resolution, the combination with Shvo's or Bäckvall's catalysts promotes atropisomerization of the substrate via the reversible formation of configurationally labile aldehydes, thereby enabling a dynamic kinetic resolution. This synergistic approach was applied to the synthesis of a variety of heterobiaryl acetates in excellent yields and enantioselectivities.
40203202	Localising enzymes to biomolecular condensates increase their accumulation and benefits engineered metabolic pathway performance in Nicotiana benthamiana.	The establishment of Nicotiana benthamiana as a robust biofactory is complicated by issues such as product toxicity and proteolytic degradation of target proteins/introduced enzymes. Here we investigate whether biomolecular condensates can be used to address these problems. We engineered biomolecular condensates in N. benthamiana leaves using transient expression of synthetic modular scaffolds. The in vivo properties of the condensates that resulted were consistent with them being liquid-like bodies with thermodynamic features typical of multicomponent phase-separating systems. We show that recruitment of enzymes to condensates in vivo led to several-fold yield increases in one- and three-step metabolic pathways (citramalate biosynthesis and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis, respectively). This enhanced yield could be for several reasons including improved enzyme kinetics, metabolite channelling or avoidance of cytotoxicity by retention of the pathway product within the condensate, which was demonstrated for PHB. However, we also observed a several-fold increase in the amount of the enzymes that accumulated when they were targeted to the condensates. This suggests that the enzymes were more stable when localised to the condensate than when freely diffusing in the cytosol. We hypothesise that this stability is likely the main driver for increased pathway product production. Our findings provide a foundation for leveraging biomolecular condensates in plant metabolic engineering and advance N. benthamiana as a versatile biofactory for industrial applications.
40203200	Glycosylation Modification Balances the Aqueous Solubility of Lipidated Peptides and Facilitates Their Biostability.	Protein tyrosine phosphatase N1 (PTPN1) is a key regulator of insulin and leptin signaling pathways, making it an attractive therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have identified fatty acid conjugated BimBH3 analogues as promising PTPN1 inhibitors with antidiabetic potential. Peptide therapeutics have proven successful in the treatment of a wide range of medical conditions, yet challenges such as poor aqueous solubility, proteolytic degradation, and limited bioavailability still hinder their clinical application. In this study, we developed a series of novel BimBH3 peptide analogues through dual modifications involving fatty acid lipidation and glycosylation to address these limitations. These modifications significantly improved the peptides' solubility, proteolytic stability, and plasma half-life while preserving potent PTPN1 inhibitory activity, which is essential for enhancing insulin signaling in type 2 diabetes treatment. Among the analogues, compound <b>L3</b> exhibited the most balanced profile, with an aqueous solubility increase over 10-fold, a half-life extension in rat plasma of 9.92-fold compared to the lead compound, and an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.78 μM against PTPN1. <i>In vivo</i> studies further demonstrated <b>L3</b>'s efficacy in lowering blood glucose levels in mice. This study demonstrates the utility of glycosylation in overcoming the solubility and stability challenges associated with lipidated peptides. The optimized analogue <b>L3</b> could serve as a proof of concept for developing novel long-acting PTPN1 inhibitors.
40203199	Maternal haploid induction in maize via mutation of Gamete Expression protein 1.	Doubled haploid (DH) technology, based on haploid induction (HI), is a crucial tool in enhancing crop-breeding efficiency and has been successfully applied in various plant species. While many HI-related genes have been identified using diverse strategies, the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying HI remain incompletely understood. In this study, we present a novel system for inducing haploid offspring through targeted mutagenesis of the Zea mays Gamete Expression protein 1 (ZmGEX1) gene in maize. Our findings reveal that zmgex1 heterozygous plants (zmgex1<sup>+/-</sup>) induce maternal haploids via self- and cross-pollination as the female parent, with an average rate of 1.34%. This indicates that the haploid progeny is exclusively maternal in origin, carrying the maternal genome. We also demonstrate that ZmGEX1 is expressed in both female spikelets and anthers, localizing to the cytoplasm, nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum. Although the transmission efficiency of the zmgex1 allele is reduced in female gametophytes, ZmGEX1 does not affect embryo sac development but influences fertilization. We propose that defective fusion of the sperm and egg nuclei may lead to haploid formation. Finally, a schematic that illustrates the potential application of the new gene ZmGEX1 in maize breeding programs is proposed. Collectively, this study identifies ZmGEX1 as a novel gene involved in maternal HI and provides a promising strategy for breeding improvements.
40203197	The mechanism of super-enhancer regulation of gene expression and research progress in neurodegenerative diseases.	Super-enhancers (SEs) play a key role in cell fate determination by regulating the transcription of cell-specific target genes and may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Targeted inhibition of the activity of SEs or knockout of SEs fragments may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. This article mainly outlines the discovery, structure, and identification methods of SEs; lists the current SE database platforms; summarizes the main regulatory mechanisms of SEs and strategies to acquire disease-specific SEs; and reviews recent research advances on SEs in neurodegenerative diseases. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms and development of treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.
40203196	Antithrombotic Effect of a Bivalent DNA Aptamer of Thrombin.	Thrombin plays a critical role in both coagulation and platelet activation, and its interaction with thrombin-protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) on platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) leads to a series of pathological processes such as thrombosis, restenosis, and atherosclerosis. This study investigated the antithrombotic properties of a bivalent DNA aptamer (bApt) with phosphorothioate backbone modification designed to inhibit thrombin, with a specific focus on its ability to regulate the thrombin-PAR1 signaling pathway. The results showed that bApt modulated the thrombin-PAR1 pathway, effectively reduced thrombus formation, platelet aggregation, and VSMC proliferation. Key findings from the study highlight that bApt successfully prolonged coagulation reaction time (<i>R</i> value), coagulation time (<i>K</i> value), maximum amplitude (MA) and reduced coagulation angle (α value), and also prolonged thrombin time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, in an arterial injury model, bApt reduced thrombus formation significantly, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent for thrombotic diseases.
40203194	Promising high fidelity genetic markers for sexing Cannabis sativa seedlings.	The uses of Cannabis sativa, a dioecious species with an XY sex chromosome system, are varying from fiber and oil to cannabinoids, among others. In most cases, males are undesirable and the sexual dimorphism at immature plants is too subtle for reliable phenotypic sexing, making genetic approaches promising. In this technical note, we present a multiplex PCR-mix, that includes two markers of Y-specific coding regions and one autosomal control marker. This PCR-mix, tested across 12 hemp-type cultivars, encompassing approximately 200 individuals, achieved a 99.5% true positive rate in identifying the sex of C. sativa seedlings. Despite being tested on a limited number of germplasm, we believe that these markers offer a promising solution for sexing a larger diversity of C. sativa seedlings.

40203192	Bridging Radiotherapy Prior to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells for B-Cell Lymphomas: An ILROG Multicenter Study.	Despite the increasing utilization of bridging radiotherapy (Br-RT), its impact on chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) efficacy and toxicity remains poorly characterized. We retrospectively reviewed patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas (r/r BCL) who received Br-RT followed by CAR-T from 2018-2020 across 10 institutions. Br-RT toxicities were graded per CTCAE v5.0, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) per ASTCT Consensus Guidelines. 172 patients (168 large BCL, 3 mantle cell, 1 Burkitt) received Br-RT prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel (73%), tisagenlecleucel (23%), or brexucabtagene autoleucel (2%). At leukapheresis, most patients (74%) had advanced-stage disease and 39% had bulky disease measuring ≥10cm. Comprehensive Br-RT was administered to 39% (n=67) and bridging systemic therapy to 35% (n=60). Among all patients, grade ≥3 Br-RT toxicity occurred in 2% [one grade 5 toxicity], grade ≥3 CRS in 9%, and grade ≥3 ICANS in 24%. Median follow-up was 31.3 months. Two-year PFS and OS were 38% and 53%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, comprehensive Br-RT was associated with superior PFS (HR 0.38, p<0.001) and OS (HR 0.48, p=0.011). Patients with LDH normalization following Br-RT (high pre-Br-RT LDH, normal post-Br-RT LDH) had superior PFS and OS compared to those with high post-Br-RT LDH, and similar PFS and OS compared to those with normal baseline LDH. In this particularly high-risk cohort, Br-RT prior to CAR-T demonstrates an acceptable toxicity profile with favorable clinical outcomes when compared to historical controls. Comprehensive Br-RT and LDH normalization post-Br-RT may be associated with superior PFS and OS.

40203188	Rhizobium rhizogenes A4-derived strains mediate hyper-efficient transient gene expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and other solanaceous plants.	Agroinfiltration, a method utilizing agrobacteria to transfer DNA into plant cells, is widely used for transient gene expression in plants. Besides the commonly used Agrobacterium strains, Rhizobium rhizogenes can also introduce foreign DNA into host plants for gene expression. While many R. rhizogenes strains have been known for inducing hairy root symptoms, their use for transient expression has not been fully explored. Here, we showed that R. rhizogenes A4 outperformed all other tested agrobacterial strains in agroinfiltration experiments on leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and other solanaceous plants. By conducting an agroinfiltration screening in N. benthamiana leaves using various agrobacterial strains carrying the RUBY reporter gene cassette, we discovered that A4 mediates the strongest and fastest transient expression. Utilizing the genomic information, we developed a collection of disarmed and modified strains derived from A4. By performing vacuum infiltration assays, we demonstrated that these A4-derived strains efficiently transiently transform 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves, showing less sensitivity to the age of plants compared to the laboratory strain GV3101. Furthermore, we performed agroinfiltration using AS109, an A4-derived disarmed strain, on the leaves of tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Remarkably, AS109 mediated transient gene expression on tested solanaceous plants more effectively than all the tested commonly used agrobacterial strains. This discovery paves the way for establishing R. rhizogenes A4-derived strains as a new option for enhancing transient expression in N. benthamiana and facilitating the functional study of plant genes in other solanaceous species.
40203187	Critical Bleeding in Adults and Children with Immune Thrombocytopenia: A Multicenter Cohort Study.	Critical bleeding in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a life-threatening hematological emergency. The objective of this study was to describe the frequency, management, and outcomes of critical bleeds among adults and children with ITP. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with ITP who presented to the emergency room (ER) with a platelet count <20 x109/L across 7 centers in the United States and Canada between 2010 and 2019. Of 1226 patients (n=296 adults; n=930 children), 28 (2.3%) had a critical bleed (n=15 adults, median age 68 years; n=13 children, median age 11 years). Of patients with a critical bleed, 12 adults (80.0%) and 6 children (46.2%) had intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). For adults, the common interventions used to treat critical bleeds were platelet transfusions (n=11; 73.3%), corticosteroids (n=10; 66.7%), and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) (n=8; 53.3%); and for children, common interventions were IVIG (n=10; 76.9%), corticosteroids (n=8; 61.5%), platelet transfusions (n=8; 61.5%), thrombopoietin receptor agonists (n=4; 30.8%), and antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid, n=4; 30.8%). For both adults and children, the most common treatment combination was corticosteroids, IVIG, and platelet transfusion (n=6; 40.0% vs. n=6; 46.2%). The median time from presentation to first treatment was 6.9 hours for adults and 3.5 hours for children. Overall, 9 (32.1%) patients with critical ITP bleeds died, including 7 adults (46.7%) and 2 children (15.4%). Critical bleeding in patients with ITP was rare but frequently fatal, especially among older adults with ICH and when treatments were delayed.
40203186	Genetic and morphological variation in the genus Zygogonium (Zygnematophyceae, Charophyta) from localities in Europe and North America and description of Z. angustum, sp. nov.	The globally distributed genus Zygogonium exhibits a narrow environmental range, with 19 morphologically described species. Its molecular characterization is poor, based on a single accession of the type species Z. ericetorum from Austria. We examined the genetic variability, morphology, and ultrastructure of field-collected Zygogonium material from different sampling sites in Austria, Norway, Ireland, Scotland, and the United States. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences of the psbC gene distinguished three well-supported groups and one subgroup. AtpB gene sequences collected from a subset of samples also support this result, while rbcL gene data provided lower support. Group 1A contained the type species Z. ericetorum from Obergurgl/Austria and samples from Kühtai/Austria, Norway, and Scotland. The morphology was characterized by wide vegetative filaments (15-31 μm) and the occurrence of aplanospores with purple residue. Group 1B contained Z. cf. ericetorum from Ireland and Ellmau/Austria. Filaments were in a similar size range (12-30 μm) as in group 1A. This group had round unusual akinetes with green or purple content, had one or two chloroplasts, and was surrounded by a thick cell wall; no aplanospores were observed. Group 2 collected from Ireland had narrower filaments (8-12 μm), cells up to six times longer than wide, and contained elongated aplanospores. Therefore, we have described a new species Z. angustum sp. nov. Group 3 contained Z. cf. ericetorum from Norway and the United States, represented by vegetative filaments with an intermediate width (13-20 μm), but no other distinct morphological features. The morphological and genetic variability observed in Zygogonium is possibly related to habitat and ecology.

40203183	Coupling Ultrafine Transition Metal and Rare Earth Oxide Nanocrystals toward Highly Active and Stable Catalysts for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries.	Electrocatalysts are extremely important for accelerating the redox reaction kinetics in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. As two kinds of competitive electrocatalysts, however, transition metals (TMs) usually react with sulfur species resulting in passivated surfaces, while stable rare earth oxides (REOs) exhibit low catalytic activity. Therefore, developing promising catalysts with long-term activity and stability is a crucial task. Herein, a TMs-REOs heterojunction catalyst consisting of N-doped carbon shell containing embedded ultrafine Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Co nanocrystals (named as Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Co@NC) is elaborately designed and fabricated. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the strong coupling between Co and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in a large number of heterojunctions endows the catalyst with moderate adsorption and satisfactory durability. Consequently, the cells assembled with a Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Co@NC modified separator exhibit high rate capacity (628.0 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 4C), cycling stability (504.2 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 500 cycles at 2C), and sulfur utilization (4.8 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup> under sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>). This study highlights the invalidation mechanism of TMs in Li-S batteries and will inspire the design of advanced heterojunction catalysts through the coupling of TMs and REOs.
40203182	Decayed fruit waste juice as a sustainable medium for high-yield microbial cellulose production: optimization, characterization and bioactivity studies.	In the present study, microbial cellulose (MC) was produced from decayed fruit waste juice as a fermentation medium using a consortium of microbes grown on vegetable and fruit waste as the inoculum. To optimize the MC yield, the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) was applied. Four factors at five different levels were chosen in the design with a total of 26 experimental runs obtained from the CCD design. The optimal conditions were fruit waste extract (60% v/v), glucose concentration (0.75% w/v), inoculum size (5% v/v), and fermentation time (5 d) which displayed a 2.1-fold increase in MC yield of 21.719 g/L. The MC was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Thermogravimetric; and compared its properties to cellulose produced through other techniques. The produced MC was examined for its antioxidant properties using cyclic voltammetry (CV) displaying an anodic peak at 1.15 V. Lastly, the antimicrobial activity was tested against four different microbial strains. Among them, MC exhibited a clear zone of 7.661 ± 0.256 cm<sup>2</sup> against <i>E. coli</i>. The results of this study concluded that decayed fruit waste juice is a sustainable and economical fermentation medium.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of perioperative nitric oxide (NO) administration in preventing AKI and limiting CKD progression in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
40203153	Design of Novel Furan β-Butenolide Compounds with Low Bee Toxicity Based on the Binding Pharmacophore Model to AChBP.	Developing novel-structured nAChR modulators is urgent due to the high bee toxicity of current neonicotinoids. In this work, a pharmacophore model of an nAChR modulator was generated, and a series of novel furan β-butenolide compounds were designed and synthesized. The bioassay study demonstrated that the insecticidal activity of compound <b>8c</b> was the best (LC<sub>50</sub> = 54.68 μg/mL) against <i>Myzus persicae</i>, possibly due to its binding mode being more similar to that of flupyradifurone, as well as its interactions with specific key residues (ARG55, TRP143, and TYR89) within <i>Ls</i>-AChBP. Notably, compound <b>8c</b> also exhibited low acute contact toxicity to <i>Apis mellifera</i>. An innovative mutated AChBP model simulating bee nAChR was generated first <i>in silico</i>, and the low bee toxicity of compound <b>8c</b> was attributed to the decrease of its binding energy with the mutated bee-like AChBP. This study presents an innovative approach to design and verify β-butenolide compounds as low-bee-toxicity insecticidal candidates.

40203148	Confined Palladium Nanoparticles within a Robust Hierarchical Porous Zr-Based Metal-Organic Framework for Aromatic Alcohol Oxidation.	The development of novel host-guest catalysts with nanoscale active sites provides new opportunities to gain highly efficient catalytic performance for the oxidation of aromatic alcohols into high-value compounds. In this work, we develop a green and facile synthesis method to incorporate Pd nanoparticles (Pd<sub>NP</sub>) into a robust hierarchical porous Zr-metal-organic framework (Zr-IPA) through in situ solvent-free synthesis and wet reduction techniques. The optimized Pd<sub>NP</sub>/Zr-IPA catalyst exhibits exceptional benzyl alcohol oxidation performance, selectively oxidizing 95.3% of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield of 97.7%) at 70 °C within 12 h. Additionally, Pd<sub>NP</sub>/Zr-IPA demonstrates superior catalytic activity for the oxidation of various aromatic alcohols using different oxidants. The turnover frequency of Pd<sub>NP</sub>/Zr-IPA reaches 82.3 h<sup>-1</sup> at 70 °C, which is 4.2 times larger than that of pre-Pd<sub>NP</sub>/Zr-IPA and surpasses most reported MOF-based catalysts in benzyl alcohol oxidation reactions. Quenching and electron paramagnetic resonance tests verified that the exposed (111) faces of the Pd<sub>NP</sub> in the Pd<sub>NP</sub>/Zr-IPA structure can react with oxidants to generate <sup>•</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radicals, which play a dominant role in oxidizing benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Our work provides a solvent-free synthesis and a wet reduction strategy for confining nanoparticles within MOFs to enhance catalytic activity in targeted reactions.

Here, we analyzed 21 samples from a collection of 20th-century penis gourds (koteka) from Papua New Guinea housed at the Musée du quai Branly - Jacques Chirac in Paris. Despite the presence of environmental species, we identified human-associated bacteria and, notably, an Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) genome at high coverage. Phylogenetic analysis placed this strain within a Papua New Guinea-Indonesian cluster. These findings highlight museum collections as valuable reservoirs of genetic data, offering historical insights into the evolution and spread of human pathogens.

We developed a method using rapid sample preparation and multiplex electrospray LC-MS/MS analysis.
40203144	Phytochemicals as Chemical Promoters of the Adaptive Chaos in Health Recovery. A Modelling Investigation.	Adaptive chaos, a concept rooted in chaos theory, describes the dynamic and non-linear behaviour of biological systems that enables adaptability and resilience under fluctuating conditions. This study investigates the potential role of phytochemicals, specifically flavonoids, as chemical promoters of adaptive chaos in biological systems. Using mathematical and bioinformatics modelling, we analyzed 23 representative flavonoids to determine their ability to induce adaptive chaos through receptor-ligand interactions. Ordinary differential equations were employed to simulate binding dynamics and evaluate oscillatory patterns and entropy variations, providing insights into the chaotic properties of these interactions. Key findings highlight that flavonoids such as quercetin, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol, and apigenin, exhibit distinct capacities to modulate chaotic dynamics, enhancing cellular flexibility and stability. Quercetin emerged as the most effective inducer of adaptive chaos, characterized by high entropy, fractal dimensions and Lyapunov exponents, indicating superior responsiveness to perturbations. Catechin and epicatechin demonstrated targeted effects, particularly in stabilizing mitochondrial oscillations and modulating immune system dynamics, while kaempferol and apigenin maintained moderate adaptability. Correlation analysis further linked flavonoid-induced adaptive chaos with their prevalence in scientific literature, supporting the translational relevance of these compounds in therapeutic applications. The results suggest that flavonoids act as hormetic agents that stabilize oscillatory dynamics, promoting homeostasis and resilience in pathological states such as inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. This study introduces a novel approach for integrating chaos theory into biochemical modelling, providing a framework for future investigations into the dynamic regulatory roles of phytochemicals in health recovery and disease management.
40203138	Transfer Printing of Two-Dimensional Molecular Crystals for Low-Voltage, High-Performance, and Degradable Transistors.	Despite the recent progress in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) gated by high-capacitance dielectrics, it remains a great challenge to manufacture low-voltage, high-performance, and degradable transistors. Herein, two-dimensional molecular crystals (2DMCs) are exploited to fabricate high-performance OFETs gated by water-soluble methylcellulose with high capacitance. To overcome the dissolution of methylcellulose during the conventional transfer process, 2DMCs of <i>p</i>-type benzothiophene derivative C8-BTBT and <i>n</i>-type furan-thiophene quinoidal compound TFT-CN are transferred onto methylcellulose films by the transfer printing technique. High mobility and steep subthreshold swing (SS) under low-operating voltage are achieved for the methylcellulose-gated 2DMC OFETs. Remarkably, the TFT-CN OFETs can be operated at an ultralow voltage of 1 V with the highest electron mobility of 2.09 cm<sup>2</sup>/V·s and the lowest SS value of 110 mV/dec. Importantly, the methylcellulose-gated devices can be degraded by a water rinse. Overall, these results present a universal strategy for transfer printing 2DMCs on water-soluble dielectric substrates toward low-voltage, high-performance, and degradable OFETs.
40203137	Optimization of Material Composition for Improving Mechanical Properties of Fly Ash-Slag-Based Geopolymers: A Deep Learning Approach.	Geopolymer is regarded as a novel type of eco-friendly material that may replace cement. To improve the prediction accuracy of mechanical properties of fly ash-slag-based geopolymer (FASGG), as well as optimize material composition and mix design, this study utilizes seven key parameters as variables, and compressive and flexural strengths were as outputs. Deep learning techniques were applied to train and predict 600 sets of experimental data, developing a novel predictive model of MK-CNN-GRU, which integrated Maximal Information Coefficient-K-median algorithm, Convolutional Neural Network, and Gated Recurrent Unit algorithms. Results indicated that the ranking of input parameters which were related with compressive strength was curing age, Ca/Si ratio, fly ash-to-slag ratio, Si/Al ratio, water-to-binder ratio, alkali activator modulus, and alkali equivalent. Three classical models were selected as benchmarks for predicting compressive strength at different curing ages. The MK-CNN-GRU model could fully exploit the internal features of experimental data and learn its variation patterns, resulting in more stable predictive performance. An ablation study of the submodels confirms that MK-CNN-GRU model considers temporal dependencies, long- and short-term features, as well as local dependencies and hierarchical feature representations within the data. Experimental data suggested an exponential relationship between flexural and compressive strengths of FASGG. The predictions for flexural strength indicated that the MK-CNN-GRU model effectively captured variations, demonstrating good generalization ability and applicability. This model enhances the estimation accuracy regarding the mechanical behavior of FASGG, offering a theoretical framework for refining its composition and mix design.
40203136	Effectiveness of Topical Agents in Management of Pain Associated with Myofascial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome-A Systematic Review.	Various invasive and non-invasive treatment modalities have been performed for the treatment of Myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome (MPDS). Topical agents may be effective with minimal disadvantages, and can be the first line of non-invasive treatment option in the management of MPDS. This systematic review was done to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of topical agents and patches in the management of pain associated with MPDS as a non-invasive management option. According to PRISMA guidelines, the PubMed, Embase, Web of science and Cochrane engine databases were searched for clinical trials which were published till July 2023. A total of 5 articles met the study inclusion criteria. Data were extracted from these studies and a qualitative analysis was performed. Topical agents in forms of ointment, gels and patches was found to improve the pain symptoms along with better quality of life and range of motion in patients with MPDS. This systematic review showed that topical interventions provide a non-invasive option for pain management in MPDS, demonstrating efficacy compared to placebo with a favorable safety profile. However, direct comparisons with invasive methods are limited and further studies directly comparing topical and invasive interventions are needed before establishing them as a first-line treatment.

We report a rare case of bilateral septic arthritis of the wrists in a 101-year-old woman who recovered without complications.
40203133	Highly Stable Polymeric Electrooculography Electrodes for Contactless Human-Machine Interactions.	Capturing the electrooculography (EOG) signals is very attractive for assistive devices and user interfaces for virtual reality (VR) systems. However, the current EOG acquisition systems face challenges in ensuring user comfort, particularly in terms of electrode electrical and mechanical performance, long-term usability, thermal effects, and overall system portability. This study presents polymeric dry flexible electrodes, composed of a composite of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), Gallic acid (GA), and D-sorbitol, forming a dynamic cross-linked network that ensures strong adhesion, stretchability, and electrical stability. These electrodes maintain their performance for up to 72 h, and can be restored through heat reactivation if performance degrades after prolonged storage. This electrode exhibits excellent biocompatibility, causing no skin irritation or thermal effects with continuous use. We have also developed a flexible circuit for real-time signal processing and wireless transmission, which operates in coordination with the EOG electrodes. The system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve a 97.1% accuracy in classifying various eye movement patterns. The system enables contactless control of digital interfaces through simple eye movements, offering a solution for long-term, comfortable, and high-fidelity EOG-based human-machine interfaces, particularly for VR integration and assistive technologies for individuals with disabilities.
40203132	DBU-Mediated [3+3] Annulation of Indolin-3/2-ones and Ethenesulfonyl Fluorides: An Approach to Indole-Fused δ-Sultones.	A general and efficient approach to the synthesis of various indole-fused δ-sultones has been developed via DBU-mediated [3+3] cyclizations of indolin-3/2-ones and β-(hetero)arylethenesulfonyl fluorides. Notably, the reaction shows a broad substrate scope, and over 70 examples were exhibited in up to 99% isolated yield. In addition, some of the synthesized compounds showed significant antitumor activity against HepG2 and Caco-2 cells <i>in vitro</i>, which might provide promising insights for the future discovery and rational design of novel antitumor agents.

40203126	A VqMAPK4-VqGT3-VqNSTS6 module regulates powdery mildew resistance via stilbene biosynthesis in Chinese wild grapevine.	Grapes are widely cultivated around the world and valued for their rich nutritional content and versatile use in various industries. However, grape powdery mildew (PM) threatens grape production. This study aimed to identify and characterize PM resistance genes in Chinese wild grapevine (Vitis quinquangularis). Grape powdery mildew resistance is associated with stilbene synthases (STSs). Here, we isolated VqNSTS6 from the Chinese wild grapevine accession 'Danfeng-2' that exhibits high PM resistance. Overexpression of VqNSTS6 in the susceptible 'Thompson Seedless' variety induced PM resistance, whereas its transient knockdown in 'Danfeng-2' diminished this resistance. Furthermore, VqNSTS6 expression was upregulated by VqGT3, resulting in stilbene accumulation and enhanced PM resistance. However, stilbene overaccumulation induced Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 4 (MAPK4) phosphorylation, which in turn triggered VqGT3 phosphorylation and degradation, consequently downregulating VqNSTS6 and mitigating excessive stilbene accumulation. Additionally, VqNSTS6-GFP moved toward and wrapped around pathogen haustoria, forming a barrier preventing Golovinomyces cichoracearum invasion of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The characterization of the STS gene VqNSTS6 conferring PM resistance opens avenues for breeding PM-resistant grapevine genotypes.
40203125	Open Reduction of Hip Dislocation Is Associated with Higher Rates of Proximal Femoral Growth Disturbance in Patients with Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita Than Idiopathic DDH: A Dual-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.	The sequelae of open reduction of developmental and/or syndromic hip dislocations include osteonecrosis/proximal femoral growth disturbance and residual dysplasia. There is limited information comparing the rates of these sequelae in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). We performed a dual-center retrospective cohort study to compare rates of proximal femoral growth disturbance and residual dysplasia between patients with DDH and AMC who had undergone open hip reduction for the treatment of non-traumatic hip dislocations.

40203120	IL-34 promotes the inflammatory role of the IL-1β-producing myeloid cells in pemphigus lesions.	Pemphigus is a life-threatening autoimmune disease mediated by anti-desmoglein(Dsg) autoantibodies. Ectopic lymphoid-like structures (ELSs) are frequently found in chronic skin lesions and are thought to contribute to local autoantibody production. However, the mechanisms driving ELS formation at lesion sites remain unclear.
40203119	Assessing depletion attractions between colloidal nanocrystals.	Adding nonadsorbing polymers to hard microsphere dispersions generates osmotic depletion attractions that can be quantitatively predicted and designed to manipulate colloidal phase behavior. Whether depletion described by classical theories is the mechanism for polymer-mediated nanosphere attractions is less evident. Colloidal hard nanospheres and nonadsorbing polymers are challenging to realize given the diverse interactions typically present in nanoparticle dispersions. Here, we use small-angle x-ray scattering to assess whether the depletion mechanism holds at the nanoscale, leveraging a recent finding that uncharged, oleate-capped indium oxide nanocrystals exhibit near-hard-sphere interactions in toluene. Classical modeling of polystyrene depletant as penetrable spheres predicts depletion-induced phase boundaries, nanocrystal second osmotic virial coefficients, and colloidal structuring in agreement with experiments for polymer radii of gyration up to 80% of the nanocrystal radius. Experimentally observed weakening of depletion interactions for larger polymer-to-nanocrystal size ratios qualitatively follows theoretical predictions that account for how polymer physics influences depletant interactions.
40203118	Silicate-based therapy for inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy by inhibiting the vicious cycle of immune inflammation via FOXO signaling.	Inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (iDCM) represents a severe immune-related condition provoked by the progression of myocarditis. In patients suffering from myocarditis, a vicious cycle of inflammation orchestrated by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, neutrophils, and fibroblasts is the culprit that drives the deterioration of myocarditis into iDCM. This study designed composite microneedles and ion solutions using calcium silicate bioceramics, which deliver SiO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> directly into myocardial tissue or indirectly via systemic circulation. These interventions modulate the cell microenvironment by regulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T/T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cells and their interactions with neutrophils and fibroblasts through the forkhead box O (FOXO) signaling pathway. Specifically, SiO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> inhibits the hyperdifferentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to T<sub>H</sub>17 cells by regulating FOXO1 and neutrophils to neutrophil extracellular traps as well as fibroblasts to myofibroblasts by regulating FOXO3, thereby ultimately disrupting the vicious cycle of myocardial inflammation and subsequent fibrotic lesions in iDCM. This discovery indicates that the biomaterial-based strategy may have great potential for the treatment of iDCM.
40203117	Acute myeloid leukemia mitochondria hydrolyze ATP to support oxidative metabolism and resist chemotherapy.	OxPhos inhibitors have struggled to show a clinical benefit because of their inability to distinguish healthy from cancerous mitochondria. Herein, we describe an actionable bioenergetic mechanism unique to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mitochondria. Unlike healthy cells that couple respiration to ATP synthesis, AML mitochondria support inner-membrane polarization by consuming ATP. Matrix ATP consumption allows cells to survive bioenergetic stress. Thus, we hypothesized AML cells may resist chemotherapy-induced cell death by reversing the ATP synthase reaction. In support, BCL-2 inhibition with venetoclax abolished OxPhos flux without affecting mitochondrial polarization. In surviving AML cells, sustained mitochondrial polarization depended on matrix ATP consumption. Mitochondrial ATP consumption was further enhanced in AML cells made refractory to venetoclax, consequential to down-regulations in the endogenous F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase inhibitor ATP5IF1. Knockdown of ATP5IF1 conferred venetoclax resistance, while ATP5IF1 overexpression impaired F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase activity and heightened sensitivity to venetoclax. These data identify matrix ATP consumption as a cancer cell-intrinsic bioenergetic vulnerability actionable in the context of BCL-2 targeted chemotherapy.
40203116	High-voltage water-scarce hydrogel electrolytes enable mechanically safe stretchable Li-ion batteries.	Soft Li-ion batteries, based on conventional organic electrolytes, face performance degradation challenges due to moisture penetration and safety concerns due to possible leakage of toxic fluorine compounds and flammable solvents under mechanical damage. We design a water-scarce hydrogel electrolyte with fluorine-free lithium salt to achieve wide electrochemical stability window (up to 3.11 volts) in ambient air without hermetic packaging while balancing high stretchability (1348%), ion conductivity (41 millisiemens per centimeter), and self-healing capabilities for mechanically and chemically safe stretchable Li-ion batteries. Molecular synergy between hydrophilicity and lithiophilicity of zwitterionic polymer backbone is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. The battery exhibits capacity retention under harsh mechanical stresses-enduring stretching, twisting, folding, and multiple through-punctures by a needle-while self-healing from repeated through cuts by a razor blade. Stable ambient operation for 1 month over 500 charge-discharge cycles (average coulomb efficiency, 95%) is achieved. A prototype self-healing electronic system with embedded soft batteries demonstrates practical application as a durable embodied energy source.
40203115	Remove the innermost atom of a magnetic multi-shell gold nanoparticle for near-unity conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO.	Few reports on paramagnetic metal nanoparticles with atomic precision and their difficult tailoring retard the insightful investigation of metal nanoparticle paramagnetism. Herein, we introduced a thiol-iodine mixture ligand-protecting strategy to successfully synthesize multi-shell paramagnetic [Au<sub>127</sub>I<sub>4</sub>(TBBT)<sub>48</sub> (I: iodine, TBBT: 4-tert-butylphenylthiolate)]. The innermost Au atom was successfully removed via thiol induction without altering the structure framework to produce diamagnetic Au<sub>126</sub>I<sub>4</sub>(TBBT)<sub>48</sub> with local ligand arrangement changed (butterfly effect), which could be further transformed into paramagnetic [Au<sub>126</sub>I<sub>4</sub>(TBBT)<sub>48</sub>]<sup>+</sup> via hydrogen peroxide oxidation. The spin populations of both paramagnetic nanoparticles are more densely distributed on surface iodine than sulfur. Diamagnetic Au<sub>126</sub>I<sub>4</sub>(TBBT)<sub>48</sub> exhibited a Faradaic efficiency of ~100% at -0.57 volt during the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, while paramagnetic Au<sub>127</sub>I<sub>4</sub>(TBBT)<sub>48</sub> and [Au<sub>126</sub>I<sub>4</sub>(TBBT)<sub>48</sub>]<sup>+</sup> exhibited the maximum Faradaic efficiency of 87% at -0.67 volt and 90% at -0.57 volt, respectively, indicating the spin-catalytic activity correlation.
40203114	Androgen receptor-regulated lncRNA PRCAT71 promotes AR signaling through the interaction with KHSRP in prostate cancer.	Mounting evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in tumorigenesis and progression of cancers. However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) are still largely unknown. In this study, we found an lncRNA, PCa-associated transcript 71 (PRCAT71), highly expressed in metastatic and primary PCa compared to benign prostate tissues. Silencing PRCAT71 inhibited cancerous properties of PCa cells and androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Mechanistically, PRCAT71 acts as a scaffold to recruit K homology (KH)-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) to AR messenger RNA (mRNA) and stabilize AR mRNA, leading to activated AR signaling. KHSRP plays a critical role in PCa progression. PRCAT71 is transcriptionally regulated by AR-driven enhancers, forming a positive regulatory loop between AR and PRCAT71 in PCa. Our study demonstrates a coordinated regulation of AR mRNA by lncRNA PRCAT71 and RNA binding protein KHSRP and provides insight that the PRCAT71-KHSRP-AR axis is a promising therapeutic target for treating PCa.
40203113	Alpha-synuclein regulates nucleolar DNA double-strand break repair in melanoma.	Although an increased risk of the skin cancer melanoma in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) has been shown in multiple studies, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood, but increased expression of the PD-associated protein alpha-synuclein (αSyn) in melanoma cells may be important. Our previous work suggests that αSyn can facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, promoting genomic stability. We now show that αSyn is preferentially enriched within the nucleolus in melanoma, where it colocalizes with DNA damage markers and DSBs. Inducing DSBs specifically within nucleolar ribosomal DNA (rDNA) increases αSyn levels near sites of damage. αSyn knockout increases DNA damage within the nucleolus at baseline, after specific rDNA DSB induction, and prolongs the rate of recovery from this induced damage. αSyn is important downstream of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated signaling to facilitate MDC1-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs, reducing micronuclei formation and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion.
40203112	Invention of an oral medication for cardiac Fabry disease caused by RNA mis-splicing.	Pathogenic RNA splicing variants have emerged as promising therapeutic targets due to their role in disease while preserving coding sequences. In this study, we developed RECTAS-2.0, a small molecule designed to correct RNA mis-splicing caused by the <i>GLA</i> c.639+919G>A mutation, which leads to the inclusion of a 57-nucleotide poison exon, resulting in later-onset Fabry disease, particularly prevalent in East Asia. RECTAS-2.0 restored normal <i>GLA</i> mRNA splicing and α-galactosidase activity in patient-derived B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, oral administration of RECTAS-2.0 effectively corrected splicing in a transgenic mouse model, demonstrating its substantial splice-switching activity and safety for clinical application. RECTAS-2.0 demonstrated potential applicability to other genetic disorders that involve similar exon competition. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of RECTAS-2.0 for Fabry disease and highlight its broader implications for RNA splicing-targeted therapies in genetic disorders.
40203111	Preclinical evaluation of AGT mRNA replacement therapy for primary hyperoxaluria type I disease.	Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare inherited liver disorder caused by alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) dysfunction, leading to accumulation of glyoxylate which is then converted into oxalate. Excessive oxalate results in kidney damage due to deposition of oxalate crystals. We have developed an mRNA-based protein replacement therapy for PH1 to restore normal glyoxylate to glycine metabolism. Sequence optimized human <i>AGT</i> mRNA (<i>hAGT</i> mRNA) was encapsulated in lipopolyplex (LPP) and produced functional AGT enzyme in peroxisomes. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. PK demonstrated that <i>AGT</i> mRNA and AGT protein maintained high expression levels for up to 48 hours. A single 2 mg/kg dose in <i>Agxt</i>Q84<sup>-/-</sup> rats achieved a 70% reduction in urinary oxalate. Toxicological assessment identified the highest nonserious toxic dose (HNSTD) as 2 mg/kg. These findings affirm the efficacy and safety of <i>hAGT</i> mRNA/LPP and support its clinical application in PH1 treatment.
40203110	Computer vision-guided rapid and precise automated cranial microsurgeries in mice.	A common procedure that allows interfacing with the brain is cranial microsurgery, wherein small to large craniotomies are performed on the overlying skull for insertion of neural interfaces or implantation of optically clear windows for long-term cranial observation. Performing craniotomies requires skill, time, and precision to avoid damaging the brain and dura. Here, we present a computer vision-guided craniotomy robot (CV-Craniobot) that uses machine learning to accurately estimate the dorsal skull anatomy from optical coherence tomography images. Instantaneous information of skull morphology is used by a robotic mill to rapidly and precisely remove the skull from a desired craniotomy location. We show that the CV-Craniobot can perform small (2- to 4-millimeter diameter) craniotomies with near 100% success rates within 2 minutes and large craniotomies encompassing most of the dorsal cortex in less than 10 minutes. Thus, the CV-Craniobot enables rapid and precise craniotomies, reducing surgery time compared to human practitioners and eliminating the need for long training.
40203109	Neural mechanisms of resource allocation in working memory.	To mitigate capacity limits of working memory, people allocate resources according to an item's relevance. However, the neural mechanisms supporting such a critical operation remain unknown. Here, we developed computational neuroimaging methods to decode and demix neural responses associated with multiple items in working memory with different priorities. In striate and extrastriate cortex, the gain of neural responses tracked the priority of memoranda. We decoded higher-priority memoranda with smaller error and lower uncertainty. Moreover, these neural differences predicted behavioral differences in memory prioritization between and within participants. Trial-wise variability in the magnitude of delay activity in the frontal cortex predicted differences in decoded precision between low- and high-priority items in visual cortex. These results support a model in which feedback signals broadcast from frontal cortex sculpt the gain of memory representations in the visual cortex according to behavioral relevance, thus identifying a neural mechanism for resource allocation.
40203108	Intratumoral mycobiome heterogeneity influences the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy outcomes in renal cell carcinoma.	The intratumoral mycobiome plays a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment, but its impact on renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. We collected and quantitatively profiled the intratumoral mycobiome data from 1044 patients with RCC across four international cohorts, of which 466 patients received immunotherapy. Patients were stratified into mycobiota ecology-depauperate and mycobiota ecology-flourishing (MEF) groups based on fungal abundance. The MEF group had worse prognosis, higher fungal diversity, down-regulated lipid catabolism, and exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We developed the intratumoral mycobiota signature and intratumoral mycobiota-related genes expression signature, which robustly predicted prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in RCC and other cancers. <i>Aspergillus tanneri</i> was identified as a potential key fungal species influencing RCC prognosis. Our findings suggest that the intratumoral mycobiome suppresses lipid catabolism and induces T cell exhaustion in RCC.
40203107	Revealing the charge transport physics in metallic coordination nanosheets by thermoelectric and magnetotransport measurements.	We have studied the charge transport physics of high-quality conducting coordination nanosheets films based on the benchmark material copper benzenehexathiol (CuBHT) by measuring multiple thermoelectric and magnetotransport coefficients on the same film. The films exhibit a metallic temperature dependence of the conductivity over a wide temperature range, but below 15 kelvin charge transport becomes dominated by weak localization and electron-electron interactions. Temperature-dependent Hall, Seebeck, and Nernst measurements consistently indicate the existence of ambipolar transport characteristics in CuBHT. A two-band analysis has been used to extract transport parameters for electron and hole carriers as a function of temperature. The results show that contributions from electron and hole conduction in CuBHT are of comparable magnitude, revealing the complexity of charge transport and allowing one to identify strategies for enhancing the thermoelectric transport coefficients of such conducting coordination nanosheets.
40203106	Armored polymer-fluid gels with integrated damping and impact protection across broad temperatures.	Unpreferable vibrations and impacts pose substantial risks to sensitive devices, structures, and the human body, demanding materials capable of providing both high energy dissipation and impact protection across a broad temperature range. Traditional damping materials often fail to meet these demands because of a trade-off between damping and mechanical strength. We introduce an innovative strategy to fabricate armored polymer-fluid gels (APFGs) that combine high damping and high modulus for effective damping and impact protection under extreme conditions. By using a controlled surface cross-linking process through diffusion, we greatly enhance the mechanical strength of polymer-fluid gels without sacrificing their damping capabilities. This asymmetric design results in an unprecedented loss factor (tanδ > 0.5 from -45 degrees to 135 degrees Celsius, peaking at tanδ = 2.2) while achieving a tensile modulus of 20 megapascals. This method resolves the long-standing damping-modulus trade-off, positioning APFGs as promising candidates for robust damping and impact protection in electronics and human motion applications.
40203105	Synthesis of <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> capsular oligosaccharides and identification of a potential <i>O</i>-antigen against campylobacteriosis.	The vaccines against campylobacteriosis are urgently needed because of the rising multidrug resistance of pathogenic <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>. The capsular polysaccharides of these bacteria, containing unique 6-deoxy-β-d-<i>ido</i>-heptopyranosyl or l-<i>glycero</i>-β-d-<i>ido</i>-heptopyranosyl residues, have emerged as attractive antigens. Expeditious assembly of the oligosaccharides derived from these glycans is challenging because β-d-idopyranosidic linkages are formidable to directly construct. Furthermore, whether the synthetic <i>C. jejuni</i> oligosaccharides could induce sufficient immunogenicity as the potential antigens remains unexplored. Here, we report a protocol for directly forming β-d-idopyranosidic bonds using α-d-6-deoxy-<i>ido</i>-heptopyranosyl, α-d-idopyranosyl, and d-/l-<i>glycero</i>-α-d-<i>ido</i>-heptopyranosyl <i>ortho</i>-hexynylbenzoates as glycosylating agents under gold(I) catalysis. To demonstrate the versatility of these methods, concise synthesis of conjugatable <i>C. jejuni</i> capsular di-/tetra-/hexa-/octasaccharides, having a backbone of [→3)-6-deoxy-β-d-<i>ido</i>-heptopyranosyl-(1→4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→], has been achieved. The immunogenicity assessment of the glycoconjugates, prepared by conjugating the synthesized oligosaccharides to cross-reactive material 197, reveals the disaccharide as a potential <i>O</i>-antigen for developing vaccines against campylobacteriosis. This work should facilitate development of synthetic vaccines against <i>Campylobacter</i> infections.
40203104	Effective recognition of double-stranded RNA does not require activation of cellular inflammation.	Excess double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is present in the cytoplasm of human cells, usually following viral infections. Recognition of dsRNAs activates innate immune pathways, leading to cellular inflammation and inhibition of cell growth. Here, we show that an effective dsRNA response may occur without the onset of inflammation. Pro-inflammatory [RLR (retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor)-dependent pathway] and cell growth inhibitory mechanisms [oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/ribonuclease L (RNase L)- and dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-dependent pathways] can act independently. We found that the 5' ends of dsRNA direct the onset of cellular inflammation, whereas the RNA duplex activates the OAS/RNase L and PKR pathways. Unexpectedly, three of the most common human RNA epitranscriptomic marks-i.e., <i>N</i>6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, and pseudouridine-had almost no influence on the immunogenicity of dsRNA; however, the presence of <i>N</i>6-methyladenosine inhibited the OAS/RNase L pathway. Our observations demonstrate how precisely innate immunity is fine tuned in cells to take appropriate countermeasures when a specific threat arises.
40203103	Chiral lasing enabled by strong coupling.	Chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum are spin-dependent high-<i>Q</i> resonances in meta-photonic structures that are realized by perturbing symmetry-protected optical states by engineering in-plane and out-of-plane asymmetries, and they support chiral lasing in the vertical direction. Here, we explore the coupling between two resonances in a chiral metasurface and introduce a mechanism for high-purity chiral laser emission. We reveal that two resonances with nearly orthogonal polarizations become strongly coupled in an engineered chiral metasurface. The inherent phase difference of the resonances, associated with the coherent destruction on the decay channel, can endow high-<i>Q</i> factor and maximize chirality to one of the hybrid modes. We verify this approach experimentally by measuring transmission spectra, angle-resolved photoluminescence, and laser emission. We believe that this mechanism allows breaking restrictions on conventional chiral quasi-BIC lasing, enabling the realization of chiral emission at any designed direction.
40203102	ARMC1 partitions between distinct complexes and assembles MIRO with MTFR to control mitochondrial distribution.	Maintaining an optimal mitochondrial distribution is critical to ensure an adequate supply of energy and metabolites to support important cellular functions. How cells balance dynamic mitochondrial processes to achieve homeostasis is incompletely understood. Here, we show that ARMC1 partitioning between distinct mitochondrial protein complexes is a key determinant of mitochondrial distribution. In one complex, the mitochondrial trafficking adaptor MIRO recruits ARMC1, which mediates the assembly of a mitochondrial fission regulator (MTFR). MTFR stability depends on ARMC1, and MIRO-MTFR complexes specifically antagonize retrograde mitochondrial movement. In another complex, DNAJC11 facilitates ARMC1 release from mitochondria. Disrupting MIRO-MTFR assembly fails to rescue aberrant mitochondrial distributions clustered in the perinuclear area observed with ARMC1 deletion, while disrupting ARMC1 interaction with DNAJC11 leads to excessive mitochondrially localized ARMC1 and distinct mitochondrial defects. Thus, the abundance and trafficking impact of MIRO-MTFR complexes require ARMC1, whose mito-cytoplasmic shuttling balanced by DNAJC11 tunes steady-state mitochondrial distributions.
40203101	Unveiling high ductility in boron carbide crystal at room temperature.	Ductility is critical for preventing materials catastrophic fracture. However, achieving tensile ductility in covalent materials remains challenging and unexplored because of the strong, directional covalent bonds. Here, we unveiled the remarkable tensile ductility driven by vacancies in boron carbide (B<sub>4</sub>C). Using advanced electron ptychography techniques, we identified the presence of carbon-vacancy-carbon chains with boron vacancies in B<sub>4</sub>C lattice. The fabricated B<sub>4</sub>C beams exhibit a high ductility (~26.8%) at room temperature, a characteristic previously unattained in covalent materials and comparable to metals. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that the formation of local amorphous regions after B<sub>4</sub>C lattice exceeded its elastic strain limit, causing plastic deformation. Atomistic simulations, using experimentally observed B<sub>4</sub>C models, reveal that the creation of carbon-carbon bonds in chains containing boron vacancies causes localized amorphization and contributes to the plastic deformation. This research highlights the significance of vacancies in facilitating plastic deformation in B<sub>4</sub>C and suggests a potential strategy to improve the ductility of strong covalent materials.

Rigid robot arms face a tradeoff between their overall reach distance and how compactly they can be collapsed. However, the tradeoff between long reach and small storage volume can be resolved using deployable structures such as tape springs. We developed bidirectional tape spring "fingers" that have large buckling strength compared to single tape springs and that can be spooled into a compact state or unspooled to manipulate objects. We integrate fingers into a robot manipulator that allows for object Grasping and Rolling In Planar configurations (called GRIP-tape). The continuum kinematics of the fingers enables a multitude of manipulation capabilities such as translation, rotation, twisting, and multi-object conveyance. Furthermore, the dual mechanical properties of stiffness and softness in the fingers endow the gripper with inherent safety from collisions and enables soft-contact with objects. Deployable structures such as tape springs offer opportunities for manipulation in cluttered or remote environments.
40203099	Hybrid locomotion at the insect scale: Combined flying and jumping for enhanced efficiency and versatility.	Insect-scale robots face two major locomotive challenges: constrained energetics and large obstacles that far exceed their size. Terrestrial locomotion is efficient yet mostly limited to flat surfaces. In contrast, flight is versatile for overcoming obstacles but requires high power to stay aloft. Here, we present a hopping design that combines a subgram flapping-wing robot with a telescopic leg. Our robot can hop continuously while controlling jump height and frequency in the range of 1.5 to 20 centimeters and 2 to 8.4 hertz. The robot can follow positional set points, overcome tall obstacles, and traverse challenging surfaces. It can also hop on a dynamically rotating plane, recover from strong collisions, and perform somersaults. Compared to flight, this design reduces power consumption by 64 percent and increases payload by 10 times. Although the robot relies on offboard power and control, the substantial payload and efficiency improvement open opportunities for future study on autonomous locomotion.
40203098	MyoGestic: EMG interfacing framework for decoding multiple spared motor dimensions in individuals with neural lesions.	Restoring motor function in individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCIs), strokes, or amputations is a crucial challenge. Recent studies show that spared motor neurons can still be voluntarily controlled using surface electromyography (EMG), even without visible movement. To harness these signals, we developed a wireless, high-density EMG bracelet and a software framework, MyoGestic. Our system enables rapid adaptation of machine learning models to users' needs, allowing real-time decoding of spared motor dimensions. In our study, we successfully decoded motor intent from two participants with traumatic SCI, two with spinal stroke, and three with amputations in real time, achieving multiple controllable motor dimensions within minutes. The decoded neural signals could control a digitally rendered hand, an orthosis, a prosthesis, or a two-dimensional cursor. MyoGestic's participant-centered approach allows a collaborative and iterative development of myocontrol algorithms, bridging the gap between researcher and participant, to advance intuitive EMG interfaces for neural lesions.
40203097	Identifying and controlling inactive and active conformations of a serine protease.	Serine proteases have been proposed to dynamically sample inactive and active conformations, but direct evidence at atomic resolution has remained elusive. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we identified a single residue, D164, in exfoliative toxin A (ETA) that acts as a molecular "switch" to regulate global dynamic sampling. Mutations at this site shift the balance between inactive and active states, correlating directly with catalytic activity. Beyond identifying this dynamic switch, we demonstrate how it works in concert with other allosterically coupled sites to rationally control enzyme movements and catalytic function. This study provides a framework for linking conformational dynamics to function and paves the way for engineering enzymes, in particular, proteases, with tailored activities for applications in medicine and biotechnology.
40203096	Preference-based assistance optimization for lifting and lowering with a soft back exosuit.	Wearable robotic devices have become increasingly prevalent in both occupational and rehabilitative settings, yet their widespread adoption remains inhibited by usability barriers related to comfort, restriction, and noticeable functional benefits. Acknowledging the importance of user perception in this context, this study explores preference-based controller optimization for a back exosuit that assists lifting. Considering the high mental and metabolic effort discrete motor tasks impose, we used a forced-choice Bayesian Optimization approach that promotes sampling efficiency by leveraging domain knowledge about just noticeable differences between assistance settings. Optimizing over two control parameters, preferred settings were consistent within and uniquely different between participants. We discovered that overall, participants preferred asymmetric parameter configurations with more lifting than lowering assistance, and that preferences were sensitive to user anthropometrics. These findings highlight the potential of perceptually guided assistance optimization for wearable robotic devices, marking a step toward more pervasive adoption of these systems in the real world.
40203095	Climate mitigation potential for targeted forestation after considering climate change, fires, and albedo.	Afforestation and reforestation, both of which refer to forestation strategies, are widely promoted as key tools to mitigate anthropogenic warming. However, the carbon sequestration potential of these efforts remains uncertain in satellite-based assessments, particularly when accounting for dynamic climate conditions, vegetation-climate feedback, fire-dominated disturbance, and the trade-offs associated with surface albedo changes. Leveraging a coupled Earth system model, we estimated that global forestation mitigates 31.3 to 69.2 Pg C<sub>eq</sub> (carbon equivalent) during 2021-2100 under a sustainable shared socioeconomic pathway. Regionally, the highest carbon mitigation potential of forestation concentrates in tropical areas, while mid-high-latitude regions demonstrate higher heterogeneity, highlighting the need for region-specific strategies and further refinement of nature-based mitigation plans. Our findings underscore the importance of considering disturbances and minimizing adverse albedo changes when estimating the carbon mitigation potential of forestation initiatives. We also advocate for the development of consistent, high-resolution maps of suitable areas for targeted forestation, avoiding environmentally sensitive lands and potential conflicts with other human activities.
40203094	Fully circular shapable transparent paperboard with closed-loop recyclability and marine biodegradability across shallow to deep sea.	To mitigate marine pollution from single-use plastics, it is crucial to transition to next-generation commodity materials that are derived from biomass and are recyclable and marine biodegradable even at abyssal depths in case of the accidental release to the ocean. Here, we develop an optically transparent millimeter-thick paperboard called transparent paperboard (tPB) through dissolution and coagulation of cellulose. The tPB is made entirely of pristine cellulose and compositionally identical to paper. A cup-shaped tPB can hold just-boiled water without an internal film coating because of its high wet tensile properties and anisotropic thermal properties. In addition, the spent tPB is material recyclable in a closed system, where all chemicals and water are also recyclable. Furthermore, the marine biodegradability of tPB across shallow to abyssal depths is confirmed by on-site degradation tests and metagenomic analyses. Hence, tPB is expected to serve as a key fully circular commodity material in sustainable societies of the future.
40203093	Asparagine transporter supports macrophage inflammation via histone phosphorylation.	Solute carrier (SLC) family is essential for immune responses; nevertheless, whether and how SLCs regulate macrophage inflammation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that K636 acetylation mediates high abundance of SLC6A14 in inflammatory macrophages. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition or genetic modulation of SLC6A14 reduces macrophage interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion dependently of lower asparagine uptake and subsequently enhanced nuclear LKB1. Mechanistically, nuclear LKB1 lessens MAPK pathway-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by increased histone 3 S10/28 phosphorylation-dependent cyclin O transcription. Moreover, myeloid <i>Slc6a14</i> deficiency alleviates pulmonary inflammation via suppressing inflammatory macrophage responses. Overall, these results uncover a network by which SLC6A14-mediated asparagine uptake orchestrates macrophage inflammation through histone phosphorylation, providing a crucial target for modulation of inflammatory diseases.
40203092	<i>Vibrio</i> MARTX toxin binding of biantennary N-glycans at host cell surfaces.	Multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxins are a diverse effector delivery platform of many Gram-negative bacteria that infect mammals, insects, and aquatic animal hosts. The mechanisms by which these toxins recognize host cell surfaces have remained elusive. Here, we map a surface interaction domain of a MARTX toxin from the highly lethal foodborne pathogen <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i>. This domain corresponds to a 273-amino acid sequence with predicted symmetrical immunoglobulin-like folds. We demonstrate that this domain binds internal <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine on complex biantennary N-glycans with select preference for L1CAM and other N-glycoproteins with multiple N-glycans on host cell surfaces. This domain is also essential for <i>V. vulnificus</i> pathogenesis during intestinal infection. The identification of a highly conserved motif universally present as part of all N-glycans correlates with the <i>V. vulnificus</i> MARTX toxin having broad specificity and targeting nearly all cell types.
40203091	EIF3D safeguards the homeostasis of key signaling pathways in human primed pluripotency.	Although pluripotent stem cell (PSC) properties, such as differentiation and infinite proliferation, have been well documented within the frameworks of transcription factor networks, epigenomes, and signal transduction, they remain unclear and fragmented. Directing attention toward translational regulation as a bridge between these events can yield additional insights into previously unexplained mechanisms. Our functional CRISPR interference screen-based approach revealed that EIF3D, a translation initiation factor, is crucial for maintaining primed pluripotency. Loss of EIF3D disrupted the balance of pluripotency-associated signaling pathways, thereby compromising primed pluripotency. Moreover, EIF3D ensured robust proliferation by controlling the translation of various p53 regulators, which maintain low p53 activity in the undifferentiated state. In this way, EIF3D-mediated translation contributes to tuning the homeostasis of the primed pluripotency networks, ensuring the maintenance of an undifferentiated state with high proliferative potential. This study provides further insights into the translation network in maintaining pluripotency.
40203090	Discovery of diverse and high-quality mRNA capping enzymes through a language model-enabled platform.	Mining and expanding high-quality genetic parts for synthetic biology and bioengineering are urgent needs in the research and development of next-generation biotechnology. However, gene mining has relied on sequence homology or ample expert knowledge, which fundamentally limits the establishment of a comprehensive genetic part catalog. In this work, we propose SYMPLEX (synthetic biological part mining platform by large language model-enabled knowledge extraction), a universal gene-mining platform based on large language models. We applied SYMPLEX to mine enzymes responsible for messenger RNA (mRNA) capping, a key process in eukaryotic posttranscriptional modification, and obtained thousands of diverse candidates with traceable evidence from biomedical literature and databases. Of the 46 experimentally tested integral capping enzyme candidates, 14 demonstrated in vivo cross-species capping activity, and 2 displayed superior in vitro activity over the commercial vaccinia capping enzymes currently used in mRNA vaccine production. SYMPLEX provides a distinct paradigm for functional gene mining and offers powerful tools to facilitate knowledge discovery in fundamental research.
40203089	Exploring the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in a two-dimensional dipolar bose gas.	Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions induce complex order in quantum systems, particularly interesting in 2D where superfluidity emerges via the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism. We observe a superfluid phase with algebraically decaying correlation in a quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms and further identify the superfluid phase transition by monitoring extended coherence. We also measure equations of state with tunable dipolar interactions. Our findings show a transition point shift due to dipole orientation, aligning with BKT transition with effective short-range interaction. However, we observe that in-plane tilted dipoles show nonlocal effects in the superfluid regime, preventing the effective short-range interaction from revealing universal behavior near the BKT critical point. We also measure anisotropic atom number fluctuations in the superfluid regime, highlighting its dipolar nature. Our results provide a foundation for understanding dipolar bosons in 2D and pave the way for investigating complex orders in dipolar superfluids.
40203088	CD22 TCR-engineered T cells exert antileukemia cytotoxicity without causing inflammatory responses.	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells effectively treat B cell malignancies. However, CAR-T cells cause inflammatory toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is in contrast to T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells against various antigens that historically have rarely been associated with CRS. To study whether and how differences in receptor types affect the propensity for eliciting inflammatory responses in a model system wherein TCR and CAR target equalized sources of clinically relevant antigen, we discovered a CD22-specific TCR and compared it to CD22 CAR. Both CD22 TCR-T and CD22 CAR-T cells eradicated leukemia in xenografts, but only CD22 CAR-T cells induced dose-dependent systemic inflammation. Compared to TCR-T cells, CAR-T cells disproportionately upregulated inflammatory pathways without concordant augmentation in pathways involved in direct cytotoxicity upon antigen engagement. These differences in antileukemia responses comparing TCR-T and CAR-T cells highlight the potential opportunity to improve therapeutic safety by using TCRs.
40203087	MprF from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a promiscuous lipid scramblase with broad substrate specificity.	The multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) is a bifunctional membrane protein found in many bacteria, including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. MprF modifies inner leaflet lipid headgroups through aminoacylation and translocates modified lipid to the outer leaflet. This activity provides increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. MprF presents a promising target in multiresistant pathogens, but structural information is limited and both substrate specificity and energization of MprF-mediated lipid transport are poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of MprF from <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<i>Pa</i>MprF) bound to a synthetic nanobody. <i>Pa</i>MprF adopts an "open" conformation with a wide, lipid-exposed groove on the periplasmic side that induces a local membrane deformation in molecular dynamics simulations. Using an in vitro liposome transport assay, we demonstrate that <i>Pa</i>MprF translocates a wide range of different lipids without an external energy source. This suggests that <i>Pa</i>MprF is the first dedicated lipid scramblase to be characterized in bacteria.

40203085	The response to anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 checkpoint blockade is associated with regulatory T cell reprogramming.	Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment; however, many patients develop therapeutic resistance. We previously identified and validated a pretreatment peripheral blood biomarker, characterized by a high frequency of LAG-3<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, that predicts resistance in patients receiving anti-PD-1 (aPD-1) ICB. To better understand the mechanism of aPD-1 resistance, we identified murine tumor models with a high LAG-3<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte frequency (LAG-3<sup>hi</sup>), which were resistant to aPD-1 therapy, and LAG-3<sup>lo</sup> murine tumor models that were aPD-1 sensitive, recapitulating the predictive biomarker we previously described in patients. LAG-3<sup>hi</sup> tumor-bearing mice were sensitive to aPD-1 + anti-LAG-3 (aLAG-3) therapy, and this benefit was CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell dependent. The efficacy of combination therapy was enhanced in LAG-3<sup>hi</sup> (but not LAG-3<sup>lo</sup>) mice with depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, responses to aPD-1 + aLAG-3 correlated with regulatory T cell (T<sub>reg</sub>) phenotypic plasticity in LAG-3<sup>hi</sup> mice, suggesting a specific role for T<sub>regs</sub> in response to aPD-1 + aLAG-3 treatment. Using T<sub>reg</sub> fate-tracking <i>Foxp3<sup>GFP-Cre-ERT2</sup></i> × ROSA<sup>YFP</sup> reporter mice, we demonstrated that expanded populations of unstable T<sub>regs</sub> correlated with improved response to combination therapy in LAG-3<sup>hi</sup> mice. Complementing these preclinical data, an increased proportion of unstable T<sub>regs</sub> also correlated with higher response rate and improved survival after aPD-1 + aLAG-3 therapy in a cohort of patients with metastatic melanoma (<i>n</i> = 117). These data indicate that T<sub>reg</sub> phenotypic plasticity affects aPD-1 + aLAG-3 responsiveness, which may represent a biomarker to aid patient selection and a rational therapeutic target for a subset of PD-1-refractory patients.
40203084	Collagen V regulates renal function after kidney injury and can be pharmacologically targeted to enhance kidney repair in mice.	Kidney fibrosis determines clinical outcomes in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The stoichiometric ratio of collagens in renal scar differs from that of healthy kidney extracellular matrix (ECM), but the functional importance of altered collagen types in injured kidneys remains unclear. Using human population studies, we show that circulating protein and renal mRNA amounts of collagen V A1 (COL5A1) exhibited associations with kidney disease and incident CKD risk. We show that <i>Col5a1</i> regulates the degree of postinjury fibrosis and renal function. Mice with conditionally knocked out <i>Col5a1</i> (<i>Col5a1</i> CKO) exhibited decreased renal function and greater renal fibrosis after dietary adenine- or ureteric obstruction-mediated kidney injury. Renal fibroblasts in <i>Col5a1</i> CKO animals up-regulated the profibrotic αvβ3 integrin. Inhibition of αvβ3 signaling with a small molecule, cilengitide, rescued postinjury renal function in <i>Col5a1</i> CKO animals. Using the hybrid mouse diversity panel that comprises 100 diverse inbred strains of mice, we observed that gene expression of <i>Col5a1</i> after injury exhibited genetic variation across 100 strains. Strains with low <i>Col5a1</i> expression after injury exhibited worse renal function compared with animals that had higher degrees of expression. We next measured <i>Col5a1</i> expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in mice to identify nonresponder strains that did not have increased <i>Col5a1</i> expression after kidney injury. We observed that administration of cilengitide in nonresponder strains significantly rescued postinjury renal fibrosis and function. These studies point to the feasibility of precision medicine approaches to target <i>Col5a1</i> for enhancing renal repair.
40203083	Rapid tuberculosis diagnosis from respiratory or blood samples by a low cost, portable lab-in-tube assay.	Rapid portable assays are needed to improve diagnosis, treatment, and reduce transmission of tuberculosis (TB), but current tests are not suitable for patients in resource-limited settings with high TB burden. Here we report a low complexity, lab-in-tube system that is read by an integrated handheld device that detects <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) DNA in blood and respiratory samples from a variety of clinical settings. This microprocessor-controlled device uses an LCD user interface to control assay performance, automate assay analysis, and provide results in a simple readout. This point-of-care single-tube assay uses a DNA enrichment membrane and a low-cost cellulose disc containing lyophilized recombinase polymerase amplification and CRISPR-Cas12a reagents to attain single-nucleotide specificity and high sensitivity within 1 hour of sample application, without a conventional DNA isolation procedure. Assay results obtained with serum cell-free DNA isolated from a cohort of children aged 1 to 16 years detected pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB with high sensitivity versus culture and GeneXpert MTB/RIF results (81% versus 55% and 68%) and good specificity (94%), meeting the World Health Organization target product profile criteria for new nonsputum TB diagnostics. Changes in assay results for serum isolated during treatment were also highly predictive of clinical response. Results obtained with noninvasive sputum and saliva specimens from adults with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB were also comparable to those reported for reference methods. This rapid and inexpensive lab-in-tube assay approach thus represents one means to address the need for point-of-care TB diagnostics useable in low-resource settings.
40203082	Spatial genomics: Mapping the landscape of fibrosis.	Organ fibrosis causes major morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatments for fibrosis are limited, with organ transplantation being the only cure. Here, we review how various state-of-the-art spatial genomics approaches are being deployed to interrogate fibrosis across multiple organs, providing exciting insights into fibrotic disease pathogenesis. These include the detailed topographical annotation of pathogenic cell populations and states, detection of transcriptomic perturbations in morphologically normal tissue, characterization of fibrotic and homeostatic niches and their cellular constituents, and in situ interrogation of ligand-receptor interactions within these microenvironments. Together, these powerful readouts enable detailed analysis of fibrosis evolution across time and space.
40203081	Succinate-loaded tumor cell-derived microparticles reprogram tumor-associated macrophage metabolism.	The tumor microenvironment predominantly polarizes tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an M2-like phenotype, thereby inhibiting antitumor immune responses. This process is substantially affected by metabolic reprogramming; however, reeducating TAMs to enhance their antitumor capabilities through metabolic remodeling remains a challenge. Here, we show that tumor-derived microparticles loaded with succinate (SMPs) can remodel the metabolic state of TAMs. SMPs promote classical M1-like polarization of macrophages by enhancing glycolysis and attenuating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in a protein succinylation-dependent manner. Mechanistically, succinate is delivered into the mitochondria and nucleus by SMPs, leading to succinylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and histone H3K122 within the lactate dehydrogenase A (<i>Ldha</i>) promoter region. Our findings provide a distinct approach for TAM polarization using cell membrane-derived microparticles loaded with endogenous metabolites, a platform that may be used more broadly for posttranslational modification-based tumor immunotherapy.
40203080	The mRNA export pathway licenses viral mimicry response and antitumor immunity by actively exporting nuclear retroelement transcripts.	Nuclear retroelement transcripts (RTs), which can be elicited both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally, form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in cytosol to trigger the viral mimicry response (VMR) and antitumor immunity. However, the strength of the induced VMR varies tremendously across tumor types, and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the mRNA export pathway modulates the VMR through actively exporting nuclear RTs for cytosolic dsRNA formation after their induction. Tumor cells hijack this process for immune evasion through aberrant coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) expression. Mechanistically, we show that the cytoplasmic transportation of RTs by the mRNA export pathway is counteracted by the RNA exosome, which cleaves multiple transcripts within this pathway, including those encoding the essential DExD-box helicase 39A (DDX39A) and the adaptor protein ALYREF. CARM1 enhances the RNA exosome activity to attenuate the nuclear export of RTs by the mRNA export pathway through two synergistic mechanisms: (i) transcriptionally activating several RNA exosome components and (ii) posttranslationally methylating arginine 6 of the RNA exosome subunit EXOSC1, which protects it from proteasome-mediated degradation. Collectively, our study highlights the critical active regulatory role of the mRNA export pathway in transporting nuclear RTs into the cytosol for triggering the VMR and tumor immunity. Furthermore, we propose that enhancing the mRNA export pathway activity, either through CARM1 inhibition or RNA exosome modulation, could reinforce the therapeutic agent-induced VMR, thus holding the promise for overcoming tumor immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance.
40203079	Bisphenol S exposure and MASLD: a mechanistic study in mice.	Bisphenol S (BPS) is a substitute for bisphenol A in various commercial products and is increasingly used globally due to restrictions on bisphenol A usage. Consequently, there are increasing public health concerns that substantial effects mediated by synthetic chemicals may impact human health. Recently, epidemiology studies reported associations between bisphenol exposure and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (MASLD). However, the causal relationship and the molecular mechanisms affecting hepatocellular functions are still unknown.

40203077	Finding Antibodies in Cryo-EM maps with CrAI.	Therapeutic antibodies have emerged as a prominent class of new drugs due to their high specificity and their ability to bind to several protein targets. Once an initial antibody has been identified, its design and characteristics are refined using structural information, when it is available. Cryo-EM is currently the most effective method to obtain 3D structures. It relies on well-established methods to process raw data into a 3D map, which may, however, be noisy and contain artifacts. To fully interpret these maps the number, position and structure of antibodies and other proteins present must be determined. Unfortunately, existing automated methods addressing this step have limited accuracy, require additional inputs and high resolution maps, and exhibit long running times.

40203075	Investigating influential factors through crash frequency models considering excess zeros and heterogeneity: New insights into mountain freeway safety.	The use of statistical modeling methods to quantify crash causation on mountain freeways is limited by crash data availability and technical challenges posed by excess zeros and heterogeneity, resulting in a lack of significant targeting of proactive crash prevention measures on mountain freeways. We collected multidimensional crash-related information on mountainous freeways in China, including road design characteristics, traffic conditions, pavement performance, and weather conditions. To overcome the challenges of excess zeros and heterogeneity on modeling techniques, we innovatively developed two new models: the Random Parameter Negative Binomial Lindley (RPNB-L) model and the Random Parameter Negative Binomial Generalized Exponential (RPNB-GE) model. The goodness-of-fit indicates that the RPNB-L and RPNB-GE models stand out among the six competing models, suggesting that the Lindley and GE distributions are conducive to portraying the multi-zero attributes, while the regression coefficients randomization treatment provides a deeper portrayal of heterogeneous effects. Moreover, the analysis reveals a considerable number of causes for crash frequency on mountainous freeways in China. These include several interesting results, such as special segments like tunnels and interchanges, Pavement Damage Condition Index (PCI) and the stormy rainfall (TR), which have not been extensively studied in previous research. The research results provided important reference values for the selection of active safety countermeasures for mountain freeways.
40203073	Chromatin structures from integrated AI and polymer physics model.	The physical organization of the genome in three-dimensional space regulates many biological processes, including gene expression and cell differentiation. Three-dimensional characterization of genome structure is critical to understanding these biological processes. Direct experimental measurements of genome structure are challenging; computational models of chromatin structure are therefore necessary. We develop an approach that combines a particle-based chromatin polymer model, molecular simulation, and machine learning to efficiently and accurately estimate chromatin structure from indirect measures of genome structure. More specifically, we introduce a new approach where the interaction parameters of the polymer model are extracted from experimental Hi-C data using a graph neural network (GNN). We train the GNN on simulated data from the underlying polymer model, avoiding the need for large quantities of experimental data. The resulting approach accurately estimates chromatin structures across all chromosomes and across several experimental cell lines despite being trained almost exclusively on simulated data. The proposed approach can be viewed as a general framework for combining physical modeling with machine learning, and it could be extended to integrate additional biological data modalities. Ultimately, we achieve accurate and high-throughput estimations of chromatin structure from Hi-C data, which will be necessary as experimental methodologies, such as single-cell Hi-C, improve.
40203072	Genome-wide analysis of fitness determinants of Staphylococcus aureus during growth in milk.	Staphylococcus aureus is a major concern in the dairy industry due to its significance as a pathogen causing bovine mastitis as well as a source of food poisoning. The nutrient-rich milk environment supports bacterial growth, but the specific genetic determinants that facilitate S. aureus proliferation and persistence in milk are poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR interference sequencing (CRISPRi-seq) screen with the laboratory strain S. aureus NCTC8325-4, to identify fitness determinants essential for S. aureus growth and survival in milk. We identified 282 milk-essential genes, including those with key roles in DNA replication, protein synthesis, and metabolism. Comparative analysis with brain heart infusion (BHI) as growth medium, revealed 79 genes with differential fitness, highlighting specific adaptations required for growth in milk. Notably, we found that purine biosynthesis, folate cycle pathways, and metal acquisition were particularly important in this environment. Based on this, we further demonstrate that S. aureus is more sensitive to the folate inhibitors trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in milk and identify several genes whose knockdown results in hypersensitivity to TMP-SMX in milk. Additionally, our analysis showed a relatively reduced importance of cell wall components, such as teichoic acids, for S. aureus fitness in milk, which is also reflected in reduced efficiency of antimicrobials targeting teichoic acids. Together, these findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of S. aureus fitness and antibiotic susceptibility in milk, offering directions for novel treatment strategies against bovine mastitis.
40203071	Reconstruction of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network based on competitive endogenous RNA reveals functional miRNAs and lncRNAs in burns and keloids.	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exert their pharmacological functions by serving as sponges for related microRNAs (miRNAs), thereby modulating gene expression. Nevertheless, the regulatory roles of the lncRNA-mediated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism in the interplay between burns and keloids remain largely elusive.
40203070	Fusaric acid-mediated S-glutathionylation of MaAKT1 channel confers the virulence of Foc TR4 to banana.	Our previous studies have demonstrated that the phytotoxin fusaric acid (FSA), secreted by several Fusarium species, acts as a key factor in the development of plant diseases; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we showed that the symptoms of Fusarium wilt in banana seedlings closely resembled those observed in plants grown under potassium (K+) deficiency conditions. Mechanistically, we found that FSA induces the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn inhibits banana K+ in banana roots. This inhibition occurs via S-glutathionylation of the banana AKT1 (MaAKT1) channel, leading to reduced K+ influx and reduced K+ content in banana roots. Through mutagenesis, electrophysiological studies, immunofluorescence staining, and co-immunoprecipitation experiment, we demonstrated that mutation of Cys202, a highly conserved site in the transmembrane segment 5 of MaAKT1, diminished the biochemical interaction of glutathione (GSH) and the channel induced by FSA, and alleviated Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense tropical race 4 (Foc TR4) and FSA-induced yellowing symptom. The evolutionarily conserved function of this site for S-glutathionylation was also observed in Arabidopsis AKT1 (AtAKT1) channel, as mutation of its homologue site in AtAKT1 similarly reduced the GSH-AtAKT1 interaction under FSA stress. Collectively, our results suggest that FSA contributes to disease progression by decreasing K+ absorption through S-glutathionylation of MaAKT1 channel at the conserved Cys202 residue. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role of FSA in regulating K+ homeostasis in bananas, and provide a foundation for future strategies to treat Fusarium wilt and increase banana production by targeting the conserved S-glutathionylation site in MaAKT1 channel.
40203069	Approximating edit distances between complex tandem repeats efficiently.	Extended tandem repeats (TRs) have been associated with 60 or more diseases over the past 30 years. Although most TRs have single repeat units (or motifs), complex TRs with different units have recently been correlated with some brain disorders. Of note, a population-scale analysis shows that complex TRs at one locus can be divergent, and different units are often expanded between individuals. To understand the evolution of high TR diversity, it is informative to visualize a phylogenetic tree. To do this, we need to measure the edit distance between pairs of complex TRs by considering duplication and contraction of units created by replication slippage. However, traditional rigorous algorithms for this purpose are computationally expensive.

40203067	Vascular liver disorders in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome: a national retrospective multicentre study.	Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired autoimmune prothrombotic condition. Vascular liver disorders (VLD), such as portal vein thrombosis (PVT), Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder (PSVD), are rare and related to an underlying hypercoagulable state in most cases. We aimed to describe the clinical and immunological features of APS patients with VLD.
40203066	The splicing factor kinase, SR protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) is essential for late events in the human papillomavirus life cycle.	Human papillomaviruses (HPV) infect epithelia to cause benign lesions or warts. However, the so-called "high risk" HPVs infecting the anogenital region and the oropharynx can cause precancerous lesions that may progress to malignant tumours. Understanding the HPV life cycle is important to the discovery of novel antiviral therapies. HPV uses cellular splicing to produce the full suite of viral mRNAs. Members of the serine/arginine rich (SR) protein family can positively regulate splicing. SR protein activity and cellular location is regulated by phosphorylation of their serine-arginine domains. SR protein kinases (SRPK) can phosphorylate SR proteins. This licenses their nuclear entry and promotes nuclear splicing together with another SR protein kinase, Clk1. SRPIN340 is a specific inhibitor of SRPK1. It has been reported to inhibit replication of HCV, Sindbis virus and HIV. We show here that SRPIN340 inhibits the expression of the viral replication and transcription factor, E2. Loss of HPV E4 and L1 late proteins was also observed. RNA sequencing showed SRPIN340 treatment resulted in gene expression changes opposite to those induced by HPV16 infection. In particular, the loss of the epithelial barrier was restored. SRPIN340 treatment led to changes in alternative splicing of 935 RNAs and pathway analysis showed a predominance of changes to RNAs encoding proteins involved in chromatin conformation, DNA repair and RNA processing. Short term SRPIN340 treatment (two to three days) was not associated with changes in proliferation or differentiation of keratinocytes. Since SRPK1 controls the E2 viral replication and transcription factor, targeting this kinase, or the phosphorylation events it mediates, could be considered as a therapeutic strategy for HPV16 infection.
40203065	Pharmacognostic evaluation and antimicrobial activity of Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn leaves (Onocleaceae) via in vitro and in silico perspectives.	Traditionally, Pteridium aquilinum L. has been utilized as medicine for ages, however, it is not listed in the Nigerian herbal pharmacopeia, and there is no information regarding its standardization and antimicrobial activity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the pharmacognostic parameters and antimicrobial activity of Pteridium aquilinum leaf.
40203064	Risk factors for non-response to initial IVIG plus methylprednisolone therapy in children with Kawasaki disease.	Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) plus corticosteroids is recommended as the initial intensified therapy for high-risk IVIG-resistant Kawasaki disease (kDa) patients. However, some patients still require additional rescue therapy despite this treatment. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with non-response to initial IVIG plus methylprednisolone (mPSL) therapy in high-risk refractory kDa patients.
40203063	Right atrial reservoir strain as an early predictor of pulmonary hypertension development in Systemic Sclerosis: a single center pilot study.	Regular screening for pulmonary hypertension (PH) is recommended in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) for the early detection and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Whether Doppler echocardiography may predict subsequent development of PH is still unknown. In this context, there is growing awareness of the potential importance of right atrial (RA) function in reflecting an initial overload of the right heart due to the hypertensive state in the pulmonary circulation is a matter of considerable interest.
40203062	The impact of social welfare support on mental health in Vietnam.	This study examines the impact of government support on mental health in Vietnam using Vietnam's Households Living Standard Surveys in 2018 and 2020 and a probit estimator. Characteristics of the households and the households' heads are also examined. We find that government support tends to worsen mental health in Vietnam, implying the current Government support is insufficient to improve mental health in households, particularly during stressful times during the COVID-19 pandemic. Female-headed households appear to experience a more significant mental health deterioration compared to their counterparts, whereas households living in urban areas are mentally struggling compared to those living in rural areas. Our results also indicate that mental health deterioration exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship with age, implying mental health appears to be a significant issue for young individuals in Vietnam. Household incomes and assets act as a buffer against mental health deterioration. These findings support the view that mental health deterioration appears to emerge from financial distress. Households suffer mental health deterioration if their financial circumstances are not improved and support from the government is insufficient.
40203061	Sawfish: Improving long-read structural variant discovery and genotyping with local haplotype modeling.	Structural variants (SVs) play an important role in evolutionary and functional genomics but are challenging to characterize. High-accuracy, long-read sequencing can substantially improve SV characterization when coupled with effective calling methods. While state-of-the-art long-read SV callers are highly accurate, further improvements are achievable by systematically modeling local haplotypes during SV discovery and genotyping.
40203060	Transcriptomic landscape around wound bed defines regenerative versus non-regenerative outcomes in mouse digit amputation.	In the mouse distal terminal phalanx (P3), it remains mystery why amputation at less than 33% of the digit results in regeneration, while amputation exceeding 67% leads to non-regeneration. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying this disparity could provide crucial insights for regenerative medicine. In this study, we aim to investigate the tissues within the wound bed to understand the tissue microenvironment associated with regenerative versus non-regenerative outcomes. We employed a P3-specific amputation model in mice, integrated with time-series RNA-seq and a macrophage assay challenged with pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, to explore these mechanisms. Our findings revealed that non-regenerative digits exhibit a greater intense early transcriptional response in the wound bed compared to regenerative ones. Furthermore, early macrophage phenotypes differ distinctly between regenerative and non-regenerative outcomes. Regenerative digits also display unique co-expression modules related to Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (Bmp2). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between regenerative and non-regenerative digits are enriched in targets of several transcription factors, such as HOXA11 and HOXD11 from the HOX gene family, showing a time-dependent pattern of enrichment. These transcription factors, known for their roles in bone regeneration, skeletal patterning, osteoblast activity, fracture healing, angiogenesis, and key signaling pathways, may act as master regulators of the regenerative gene signatures. Additionally, we developed a deep learning AI model capable of predicting post-amputation time and level from RNA-seq data, indicating that the regenerative probability may be "encoded" in the transcriptomic response to amputation.
40203059	The Spectrum of Macular Ischemia in West Nile Virus Chorioretinitis.	This study reports a unique case of West Nile Virus (WNV)-associated multilevel macular ischemia, involving retinal capillary plexuses and choriocapillaris, confirmed through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of aqueous humor and characterized using advanced multimodal imaging.
40203058	Low-Frequency Optical Signal Enhancement Device Combines CRISPR-Based Assay for Portable <i>S. Pneumoniae</i> Detection.	Early detection and treatment of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (SPN) is crucial for patients. However, since nucleic acid testing relies on large-scale equipment and specialized operators, challenges remain for accurate, fast, and low-cost SPN detection. Here, we present a point-of-care testing (POCT) device for rapid and accurate detection of SPN based on low-frequency optical signal enhancement and cluster of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The spotlight tube enables the enhancement of the fluorescence signal, while the combination of an artificial intelligence-assisted autoexposure algorithm and a homomorphic filtering image processing method improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the fluorescence image, thus realizing highly sensitive detection. Nucleic acid identification is performed using CRISPR-based crRNAs, and fluorescent probes were constructed against the IytA gene of SPN. And they showed high specificity and sensitivity for the IytA gene. This device demonstrated excellent sensitivity in detecting the SPN using the developed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection strategy. The detection threshold of SPN reached 0.1 fM, and the single detection time of the device was only 40 min. Specificity was validated using clinical samples, and the test showed 100% agreement with quantitative polymerase chain reaction results from clinical samples. This method provides a highly sensitive optical and signal processing device, which, in combination with a novel DNA probe for SPN, provides a novel indicator option for POCT of SPN.
40203057	Association of helicobacter pylori infection with lipid metabolism and 10-year cardiovascular risk in diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional study.	Previous studies have shown that Helicobacter pylori infection is not only a risk factor for gastrointestinal diseases but also associated with various non-digestive conditions. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Helicobacter pylori infection on the risk of lipid metabolism disorders and cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
40203056	Collaborative management measures of subsurface drainage and bio-organic fertilizer application for coastal sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) based on TOPSIS entropy weight method.	Soil salinization has become a global resource and ecological issue, and sunflower planting has had a good improvement effect on saline-alkali land. The study explores the collaborative management measures of subsurface drainage and bio-organic fertilization with high-yield, high-quality, and environmentally friendly sunflowers through experiments. We designed three subsurface pipe spacings (10, 15, and 20 m) and six methods of combined application of organic fertilizer (organic fertilizer nitrogen 100%, organic fertilizer nitrogen 75% + inorganic fertilizer nitrogen 25%, organic fertilizer nitrogen and inorganic fertilizer nitrogen each 50%, organic fertilizer nitrogen 25% + inorganic fertilizer nitrogen 75%, 100% inorganic fertilizer nitrogen, and no fertilizer treatment). Nine evaluation indexes were selected for the four aspects of yield increase, quality improvement, soil improvement, and emission reduction, and an index system was constructed. In the evaluation model, the TOPSIS entropy weight method was calculated to compare and select the most suitable growth method of subsurface drainage and bio-organic fertilizer application for sunflower growth in saline-alkali land. The results showed that the best treatment was 75% organic fertilizer nitrogen +  25% inorganic fertilizer nitrogen, and the best spacing for the subsurface drainage was 10 m. Under this treatment, the relative application progress reached 0.574, and the yield, oleic acid content, soil organic matter content, soil salt reduction efficiency, and N2O emissions were 2.93 t/ha, 21.73%, 2.21%, 37.62%, and 9.86 kg/ha, respectively.
40203055	Deep learning-based improved side-channel attacks using data denoising and feature fusion.	Deep learning, as a high-performance data analysis method, has demonstrated superior efficiency and accuracy in side-channel attacks compared to traditional methods. However, many existing models enhance accuracy by stacking network layers, leading to increased algorithmic and computational complexity, overfitting, low training efficiency, and limited feature extraction capabilities. Moreover, deep learning methods rely on data correlation, and the presence of noise tends to reduce this correlation, increasing the difficulty of attacks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the application of an InceptionNet-based network structure for side-channel attacks. This network utilizes fewer training parameters. achieves faster convergence and demonstrates improved attack efficiency through parallel processing of input data. Additionally, a LU-Net-based network structure is proposed for denoising side-channel datasets. This network captures the characteristics of input signals through an encoder, reconstructs denoised signals using a decoder, and utilizes LSTM layers and skip connections to preserve the temporal coherence and spatial details of the signals, thereby achi-eving the purpose of denoising. Experimental evaluations were conducted on the ASCAD dataset and the DPA Contest v4 dataset for comparative studies. The results indicate that the deep learning attack model proposed in this paper effectively enhances side-channel attack performance. On the ASCAD dataset, the recovery of keys requires only 30 traces, and on the DPA Contest v4 dataset, only 1 trace is needed for key recovery. Furthermore, the proposed deep learning denoising model significantly reduces the impact of noise on side-channel attack performance, thereby improving efficiency.
40203054	Condensin IDC, DPY-21, and CEC-4 maintain X chromosome repression in C. elegans.	Dosage compensation in Caenorhabditis elegans equalizes X-linked gene expression between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. The process depends on a condensin-containing dosage compensation complex (DCC), which binds the X chromosomes in hermaphrodites to repress gene expression by a factor of 2. Condensin IDC and an additional five DCC components must be present on the X during early embryogenesis in hermaphrodites to establish dosage compensation. However, whether the DCC's continued presence is required to maintain the repressed state once established is unknown. Beyond the role of condensin IDC in X chromosome compaction, additional mechanisms contribute to X-linked gene repression. DPY-21, a non-condensin IDC DCC component, is an H4K20me2/3 demethylase whose activity enriches the repressive histone mark, H4 lysine 20 monomethylation, on the X chromosomes. In addition, CEC-4, a protein that tethers H3K9me3-rich chromosomal regions to the nuclear lamina, also contributes to X-linked gene repression. To investigate the necessity of condensin IDC during the larval and adult stages of hermaphrodites, we used the auxin-inducible degradation system to deplete the condensin IDC subunit DPY-27. While DPY-27 depletion in the embryonic stages resulted in lethality, DPY-27 depleted larvae and adults survive. In these DPY-27 depleted strains, condensin IDC was no longer associated with the X chromosome, the X became decondensed, and the H4K20me1 mark was gradually lost, leading to X-linked gene derepression (about 1.4-fold). These results suggest that the stable maintenance of dosage compensation requires the continued presence of condensin IDC. A loss-of-function mutation in cec-4, in addition to the depletion of DPY-27 or the genetic mutation of dpy-21, led to even more significant increases in X-linked gene expression (about 1.7-fold), suggesting that CEC-4 helps stabilize repression mediated by condensin IDC and H4K20me1.

To examine the factor structure and validity of the 40-item common misconceptions in traumatic brain injury (CM-TBI) scale, and to develop and evaluate additional concussion-focussed items to broaden the instrument's scope.
40203052	Live-cell RNA imaging with the inactivated endonuclease Csy4 enables new insights into plant virus transport through plasmodesmata.	Plant-infecting viruses spread through their hosts by transporting their infectious genomes through intercellular nano-channels called plasmodesmata. This process is mediated by virus-encoded movement proteins. Whilst the sub-cellular localisations of movement proteins have been intensively studied, live-cell RNA imaging systems have so far not been able to detect viral genomes inside the plasmodesmata. Here, we describe a highly sensitive RNA live-cell reporter based on an enzymatically inactive form of the small bacterial endonuclease Csy4, which binds to its cognate stem-loop with picomolar affinity. This system allows imaging of plant viral RNA genomes inside plasmodesmata and shows that potato virus X RNA remains accessible within the channels and is therefore not fully encapsidated during movement. We also combine Csy4-based RNA-imaging with interspecies movement complementation to show that an unrelated movement protein from tobacco mosaic virus can recruit potato virus X replication complexes adjacent to plasmodesmata. Therefore, recruitment of potato virus X replicase is mediated non-specifically, likely by indirect coupling of movement proteins and viral replicase via the viral RNA or co-compartmentalisation, potentially contributing to transport specificity. Lastly, we show that a 'self-tracking' virus can express the Csy4-based reporter during the progress of infection. However, expression of the RNA-binding protein in cis interferes with viral movement by an unidentified mechanism when cognate stem-loops are present in the viral RNA.
40203051	Rapid Isolation and Characterization of Exosomes through a Single-Step, Label-Free Protein Biomarker Analysis.	Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles with compositions reflecting their cell of origin, serve as sensitive and specific biomarkers for disease detection. We herein report a protocol for rapid isolation and characterization of exosomes by a single-step and label-free protein biomarker analysis. Using a simple centrifugation-filtration-concentration (CFC) method, exosomes are isolated and enriched 50-fold from conditioned cell culture media. For protein biomarker analysis, unconjugated antibodies are added directly to the isolated exosome solution. The specific interaction between the antibodies and exosomes leads to aggregation of exosomes, and subsequently, an average particle size increase of the assay solution. This average particle size increase can be detected using dynamic light scattering and correlated to the presence or absence of protein biomarkers on the exosomes. In this study, exosomes from three cell types, human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, genetically modified HEK-GFP cells, and GBM/NSC CD133<sup>+</sup> cells were isolated. The exosomes released from HEK293, HEK-GFP, and GBM/NSC CD133<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited monodispersed size distributions with an average particle size centered around 70, 66, and 249 nm, respectively. Positive antibody binding to exosome surface proteins resulted in a peak shift, increasing particle size by 25, 32, and 148 nm, respectively, for the HEK293, HEK-GFP, and GBM/NSC CD133<sup>+</sup> exosomes, while the size increase upon addition of a negative antibody remained minimum. This protocol provides a convenient platform for the design and development of rapid diagnostic tests targeting disease specific exosomes.
40203049	The dual functions of the GTPase BipA in ribosome assembly and surface structure biogenesis in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.	The bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI)-inducible protein A (BipA) is a highly conserved protein in Gram-negative bacteria that is structurally similar to translational GTPases such as IF2, EF-Tu, and EF-G. Our previous research showed that deleting bipA in Escherichia coli at 20 °C leads to a defect in 50S ribosomal assembly and impaired lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis. This LPS defect activates the Regulator of Capsule Synthesis (Rcs) pathway, resulting in an overproduction of capsular polysaccharides, a reduction in biofilm formation, and decreased flagella-mediated motility. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of BipA in the pathogenicity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We constructed bipA deletion mutants in two pathogenic S. Typhimurium strains, SL1344 and 14028, as well as in the attenuated strain LT2. Our ribosome profiling experiments using the mutant S. Typhimurium strains revealed a defect in ribosome assembly at 20 °C, with the accumulation of abnormal 50S ribosomal subunits. We further demonstrated that the absence of BipA in S. Typhimurium impaired LPS biosynthesis at 20 °C, compromising membrane integrity and presumably activating the Rcs pathway. This activation altered virulence factors, including reduced biofilm formation, particularly in the 14028ΔbipA strain. Furthermore, the SL1344ΔbipA and 14028ΔbipA strains exhibited significantly decreased swimming motility at 20 °C compared to 37 °C, confirmed by microscopic observation showing fewer flagella at 20 °C. Subsequently, both strains exhibited a significant reduction in invasion capability and cytotoxicity toward human intestinal epithelial cells (HCT116). This functional attenuation was corroborated by the decrease in virulence observed in the 14028ΔbipA strain in a mouse model. Our findings suggest that, in S. Typhimurium, BipA functions as a bacterial fitness factor, contributing to ribosome assembly, LPS synthesis, and virulence-related processes, particularly under stress conditions relevant to host environments.

40203046	Roquin exhibits opposing effects on RNA stem-loop stability through its two ROQ domain binding sites.	The interaction of mRNA and regulatory proteins is critical for posttranscriptional control. For proper function, these interactions, as well as the involved protein and RNA structures, are highly dynamic, and thus, mechanistic insights from structural biology are challenging to obtain. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach combining single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) with NMR spectroscopy to analyze the concerted interaction of the two RNA-binding interfaces (A-site and B-site) of the immunoregulatory protein Roquin's ROQ domain with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the <i>Ox40</i> mRNA. This 3'UTR contains two specific hairpin structures termed constitutive and alternative decay elements (CDE, ADE), which mediate mRNA degradation through Roquin binding. Our single-molecule experiments reveal that the CDE folds cooperatively, while ADE folding involves at least three on-pathway and three off-pathway intermediates. Using an integrated microfluidics setup, we extract binding kinetics to Roquin in real time. Supported by NMR data, we find opposing effects of the two Roquin subdomains on distinct regions of the ADE: While the A-site interacts strongly with the folded apical stem-loop, we find that the B-site has a distinct destabilizing effect on the central stem of the ADE owed to single-strand RNA binding. We propose that RNA-motif nature and Roquin A- and B-sites jointly steer mRNA decay with context-encoded specificity, and we suggest plasticity of stem structures as key determinant for Roquin-RNA complex formation. The unique combination of NMR and SMFS uncovers a mechanism of a dual-function RNA-binding domain, offering a model for target RNA recognition by Roquin.
40203045	On the hidden transient interphase in metal anodes: Dynamic precipitation controls electrochemical interfaces in batteries.	The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This structurally complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of metal anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution-the reverse reaction of deposition-in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a transient SEI (T-SEI) that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is "relaxable" upon removal of the enforced dissolution current; that is, the T-SEI dissolves back into the electrolyte when rested. The formation of T-SEI plays an unexpected critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate-discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests that the deposition occurs via growth of the original grains; this is in stark contrast to the isolated, new nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Using 3D profilometry, we observe a 42% reduction in surface roughness due to T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the kinetics at ion-producing electrochemical interfaces, and suggest a new dimension for engineering next generation batteries.
40203044	The importance of playing the long game when it comes to pandemic surveillance.	NA
40203043	Two transcription factors play critical roles in mediating epigenetic regulation of fruit ripening in tomato.	DNA methylation regulates fruit ripening in tomato, and disruption of the DNA demethylase DEMETER-LIKE 2 (DML2) results in genome-wide DNA hypermethylation and impaired ripening. We report here that the transcription factors Ripening Inhibitor (RIN) and FRUITFULL 1 (FUL1) play critical roles in mediating the effect of DNA methylation on tomato fruit ripening. <i>RIN</i> and <i>FUL1</i> are silenced in <i>dml2</i> mutant plants, and the defective ripening phenotype of <i>dml2</i> is mimicked by the <i>rin/ful1</i> double mutant. Restoration of <i>RIN</i> expression in <i>dml2</i> partially rescues its ripening defects. DNA methylation controls ripening not only by regulating the expression of <i>RIN</i> and <i>FUL1</i> but also by interfering with the genomic binding of RIN. In <i>dml2</i> mutant plants, RIN cannot bind to some of its targets in vivo even though DNA methylation does not interfere with RIN binding in vitro; this inhibited binding in vivo is correlated with increased DNA methylation and histone H3 enrichment within 100 bp of the binding site. Our work uncovers the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA methylation control of fruit ripening in tomato.
40203042	FLIP<sub>L</sub> permits apoptotic and inflammatory signaling and inhibits necroptosis in mice without Caspase-8 oligomerization.	Caspase-8 signaling has proapoptotic, antinecroptotic, and proinflammatory signaling roles dependent on interaction with the adapter molecule FADD, oligomerization, and autocleavage. Previously, a Caspase-8 binding partner cFLIP<sub>L</sub> (FLIP, encoded by <i>Cflar</i>) was shown to prevent Caspase-8-dependent apoptosis, but permit Caspase-8-dependent inhibition of necroptosis. We sought to explore the role of FLIP in Caspase-8-dependent apoptosis induction, necroptosis inhibition, and inflammatory signaling inhibition in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence that in mice with a mutation that prevents Caspase-8 oligomerization (<i>Casp8<sup>FGLG/FGLG</sup></i>), FLIP is necessary to inhibit necroptosis, promote apoptosis, regulate inflammation, and control lymphoproliferative disease. Unlike <i>Casp8<sup>FGLG/FGLG</sup> mice, Casp8<sup>FGLG/FGLG</sup>,Cflar<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice do not survive embryogenesis, but ablation of <i>Mlkl</i>, required for necroptosis, allows their survival to adulthood. Further, unlike <i>Casp8<sup>FGLG/FGLG</sup>,Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, <i>Casp8<sup>FGLG/FGLG</sup>,Cflar<sup>-/-</sup>,Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display lymphoproliferative disease. We analyzed apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammatory signaling in <i>Casp8<sup>FGLG/FGLG</sup></i> mice with or without FLIP, gaining insights into the functions of the Caspase-8-FLIP heterodimer in vitro and in vivo.
40203041	Evolutionary divergent kinetoplast genome structure and RNA editing patterns in the trypanosomatid <i>Vickermania</i>.	The trypanosomatid flagellates possess in their single mitochondrion a highly complex kinetoplast (k)DNA, which is composed of interlocked circular molecules of two types. Dozens of maxicircles represent a classical mitochondrial genome, and thousands of minicircles encode guide (g)RNAs, which direct the processive and essential uridine insertion/deletion messenger RNA (mRNA) editing of maxicircle transcripts. While the details of kDNA structure and this type of RNA editing are well established, our knowledge mostly relies on a narrow foray of intensely studied human parasites of the genera <i>Leishmania</i> and <i>Trypanosoma</i>. Here, we analyzed kDNA, its expression, and RNA editing of two members of the poorly characterized genus <i>Vickermania</i> with very different cultivation histories. In both <i>Vickermania</i> species, the gRNA-containing heterogeneous large (HL)-circles are atypically large with multiple gRNAs each. Examination of <i>Vickermania spadyakhi</i> HL-circle loci revealed a massive redundancy of gRNAs relative to the editing needs. In comparison, the HL-circle repertoire of extensively cultivated <i>Vickermania ingenoplastis</i> is greatly reduced. It correlates with <i>V. ingenoplastis</i>-specific loss of productive editing of transcripts encoding subunits of respiratory chain complex I and corresponding lack of complex I activity. This loss in a parasite already lacking genes for subunits of complexes III and IV suggests an apparent requirement for its mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase to work in reverse to maintain membrane potential. In contrast, <i>V. spadyakhi</i> retains a functional complex I that allows ATP synthase to work in its standard direction.
40203040	NAL1 forms a molecular cage to regulate FZP phase separation.	<i>NARROW LEAF 1</i> (<i>NAL1</i>), originally identified for its role in shaping leaf morphology, plant architecture, and various agronomic traits in rice, has remained enigmatic in terms of the molecular mechanisms governing its multifaceted functions. In this study, we present a comprehensive structural analysis of NAL1 proteins, shedding light on how NAL1 regulates the phase separation of its physiological substrate, FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP), a transcription factor. We determined that NAL1 assembles as a hexamer and forms a molecular cage with a wide central channel and three narrower lateral channels, which could discriminate its different substrates into the catalytic sites. Most notably, our investigation unveils that FZP readily forms molecular condensates via phase separation both in vitro and in vivo. NAL1 fine-tunes FZP condensation, maintaining optimal concentrations to enhance transcriptional activity. While phase separation roles include sequestration and suppression of transcriptional or enzymatic activity, our study highlights its context-dependent contribution to transcriptional regulation. NAL1 assumes a pivotal role in regulating the states of these molecular condensates through its proteolytic activity, subsequently enhancing transcriptional cascades. Our findings offer insights into comprehending the molecular mechanisms underpinning NAL1's diverse functions, with far-reaching implications for the field of plant biology. Additionally, these insights provide valuable guidance for the development of rational breeding strategies aimed at enhancing crop productivity.
40203039	Chemically active wetting.	Wetting of liquid droplets on passive surfaces is ubiquitous in our daily lives, and the governing physical laws are well understood. When surfaces become active, however, the governing laws of wetting remain elusive. Here, we propose chemically active wetting as a class of active systems where the surface is active due to a binding process that is maintained away from equilibrium. We derive the corresponding nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory and show that active binding fundamentally changes the wetting behavior, leading to steady, nonequilibrium states with droplet shapes reminiscent of a pancake or a mushroom. The origin of such anomalous shapes can be explained by mapping to electrostatics, where pairs of binding sinks and sources correspond to electrostatic dipoles along the triple line. This is an example of a more general analogy, where localized chemical activity gives rise to a multipole field of the chemical potential. The underlying physics is relevant for cells, where droplet-forming proteins can bind to membranes accompanied by the turnover of biological fuels.
40203038	Exploring RNA destabilization mechanisms in biomolecular condensates through atomistic simulations.	Biomolecular condensates are currently recognized to play a key role in organizing cellular space and in orchestrating biochemical processes. Despite an increasing interest in characterizing their internal organization at the molecular scale, not much is known about how the densely crowded environment within these condensates affects the structural properties of recruited macromolecules. Here, we adopted explicit-solvent all-atom simulations based on a combination of enhanced sampling approaches to investigate how the conformational ensemble of an RNA hairpin is reshaped in a highly concentrated peptide solution that mimics the interior of a biomolecular condensate. Our simulations indicate that RNA structure is greatly perturbed by this distinctive physico-chemical environment, which weakens RNA secondary structure and promotes extended nonnative conformations. The resulting high-resolution picture reveals that RNA unfolding is driven by the effective solvation of nucleobases through hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions with surrounding peptides. This solvent effect can be modulated by the amino acid composition of the model condensate as proven by the differential RNA behavior observed in the case of arginine-rich and lysine-rich peptides.
40203037	Perturbing nuclear glycosylation in the mouse preimplantation embryo slows down embryonic development.	The main form of intracellular protein glycosylation (O-GlcNAc) is reversible and has been mapped on thousands of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, including RNA polymerase II, transcription factors, and chromatin modifiers. The O-GlcNAc modification is catalyzed by a single enzyme known as O-GlcNAc Transferase, that is required for mammalian early development. Yet, neither the regulatory function of protein O-GlcNAcylation in the embryo nor the embryonic O-GlcNAc proteome have been documented. Here, we devised a strategy to enzymatically remove O-GlcNAc from preimplantation embryonic nuclei, where this modification accumulates coincidently with embryonic genome activation (EGA). Unexpectedly, the depletion of nuclear O-GlcNAc to undetectable levels has no impact on EGA, but dampens the transcriptional upregulation of the translational machinery, and triggers a spindle checkpoint response. These molecular alterations were phenotypically associated with a developmental delay starting from early cleavage stages and persisting after embryo implantation, establishing a link between nuclear glycosylation and the pace of embryonic development.
40203036	Substrate stress relaxation regulates monolayer fluidity and leader cell formation for collectively migrating epithelia.	Collective migration of epithelial tissues is a critical feature of developmental morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Coherent motion of cell collectives requires large-scale coordination of motion and force generation and is influenced by mechanical properties of the underlying substrate. While tissue viscoelasticity is a ubiquitous feature of biological tissues, its role in mediating collective cell migration is unclear. Here, we have investigated the impact of substrate stress relaxation on the migration of micropatterned epithelial monolayers. Epithelial monolayers exhibit faster collective migration on viscoelastic alginate substrates with slower relaxation timescales, which are more elastic, relative to substrates with faster stress relaxation, which exhibit more viscous loss. Faster migration on slow-relaxing substrates is associated with reduced substrate deformation, greater monolayer fluidity, and enhanced leader cell formation. In contrast, monolayers on fast-relaxing substrates generate substantial substrate deformations and are more jammed within the bulk, with reduced formation of transient lamellipodial protrusions past the monolayer edge leading to slower overall expansion. This work reveals features of collective epithelial dynamics on soft, viscoelastic materials and adds to our understanding of cell-substrate interactions at the tissue scale.
40203035	Glassy ionogels with high compressibility and strength for impact protection.	Solvents within gels enhance the mobility of polymer chain segments while concurrently diminishing interchain interactions, thereby facilitating the ductility of glassy polymers at the cost of their mechanical strength. Here, we develop a solvent toughening strategy for the preparation of highly compressible and high-strength ionogels in the glassy state. This approach leverages the synergistic effects of the slow dissociation-shift kinetics of solvent ionic liquids and polymer crystallization. Ionogels exhibit an ultimate compressive stress of 2.3 GPa (at 98% compressive strain), toughness of 1219.3 MJ m<sup>-3</sup>, and energy dissipation rate of 81.9% (at 70% compression strain). The highly interacting ionic bonds of solvent and the fast crystallization of polymers under load toughen the ionogels and confer impact hardening and efficient energy dissipation behavior under fast impact. A 500-μm-thick ionogel coating can protect fragile items, such as glass, from impact damage. Ionogels, renowned for their impact resistance, hold promise for various applications across industries including human body implants, equipment, transportation, and aerospace.
40203034	Quality and costs of commissioned vs. researcher-led NIHR research: retrospective cohort study of randomised controlled trials.	The NIHR provides two main funding pathways: 'commissioned' (CP) and 'researcher-led' (RLP) projects. CPs are used to ensure NHS priorities are addressed. However, there is uncertainty regarding which provides the highest quality, best value for money, research. We compared the quality and cost of commissioned and research-led projects. We searched the NIHR Funded Portfolio database for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) funded by programmes offering both CP and RLP funding. The main outcome was journal impact factor for the main results paper. Other outcomes included: Altmetric score, relative citation ratio, total and per participant funding. T-tests were used to compare mean values. 82 eligible RCTs were identified, 30 commissioned and 52 researcher-led. One RLP did not progress beyond pilot; two (one CP and one RLP) did not publish a monograph; and 78 published main study results in a peer-reviewed journal. Among these, RLP projects had higher means scores than CP projects for: journal impact factor (111.2 and 40.8, respectively, p < 0.001); Altmetric score (223.8 and 116.8, p = 0.05); and relative citation ratio (8.0 and 4.4, p = 0.06). Among the full 82 RCTs, RLP mean total study and per participant funding were lower than CP: £1,429,913 vs. £1,353,034, p = 0.59; and £11,271 vs. £4425, p = 0.08. Researcher-led projects are more likely to result in higher impact research compared with commissioned studies. Further research is needed to understand the reasons, which could include: commissioned research addressing harder-to-do questions; commissioning brief quality; and/or research team motivation.
40203033	TMED9 coordinates the clearance of misfolded GPI-anchored proteins out of the ER and into the Golgi.	The p24-family member, TMED9, has recently emerged as a player in secretory pathway protein quality control (PQC) that influences the trafficking and degradation of misfolded proteins. Here, we show that TMED9 plays a central role in the PQC of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). Typically, upon release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone calnexin, misfolded GPI-APs traffic to the Golgi by an ER-export pathway called Rapid ER stress-induced Export (RESET). From the Golgi, they access the plasma membrane where they are rapidly internalized for lysosomal degradation. We used biochemical and imaging approaches in cultured cells to demonstrate that at steady-state, the majority of misfolded GPI-APs reside in the ER in association with calnexin and TMED9. During RESET, they dissociate from calnexin and increase their association with TMED9. Inhibition of TMED9's function through siRNA-induced depletion or chemical inhibitor, BRD4780, blocked ER-export of misfolded GPI-APs. In contrast, TMED9-inhibition did not prevent ER-export of wild-type GPI-APs, indicating a specific role for TMED9 in GPI-AP PQC. Intriguingly, we discovered that acute treatment with BRD4780 induced a shift in TMED9 localization away from the ER to the downstream Golgi cisternae and blocked the RESET pathway. Upon removal of BRD4780 following acute treatment, TMED9 regained access to the ER where TMED9 was able to associate with the RESET substrate and restore the RESET pathway. These results suggest that TMED9 plays a requisite role in RESET by capturing misfolded GPI-APs that are released by calnexin within the ER and conveying them to the Golgi.
40203032	Diversification of an emerging bacterial plant pathogen; insights into the global spread of Xanthomonas euvesicatoria pv. perforans.	Emerging and re-emerging plant diseases continue to present multifarious threats to global food security. Considerable recent efforts are therefore being channeled towards understanding the nature of pathogen emergence, their spread and evolution. Xanthomonas euvesicatoria pv. perforans (Xep), one of the causal agents of bacterial spot of tomato, rapidly emerged and displaced other bacterial spot xanthomonads in many tomato production regions around the world. In less than three decades, it has become a dominant xanthomonad pathogen in tomato production systems across the world and presents a compelling example for understanding diversification of recently emerged bacterial plant pathogens. Although Xep has been continuously monitored in Florida since its discovery, the global population structure and evolution at the genome-scale is yet to be fully explored. The objectives of this work were to determine genetic diversity globally to ascertain if different tomato production regions contain genetically distinct Xep populations, to examine genetic relatedness of strains collected in tomato seed production areas in East Asia and other production regions, and to evaluate variation in type III secretion effectors, which are critical pathogenicity and virulence factors, in relationship to population structure. We used genome data from 270 strains from 13 countries for phylogenetic analysis and characterization of type III effector gene diversity among strains. Our results showed notable genetic diversity in the pathogen. We found genetically similar strains in distant tomato production regions, including seed production regions, and diversification over the past 100 years, which is consistent with intercontinental dissemination of the pathogen in hybrid tomato production chains. Evolution of the Xep pangenome, including the acquisition and loss of type III secreted effectors, is apparent within and among phylogenetic lineages. The apparent long-distance movement of the pathogen, together with variants that may not yet be widely distributed, poses risks of emergence of new variants in tomato production.
40203031	Food insecurity in South Indian households with TB during COVID-19 lockdowns and the impact of nutritional interventions: A qualitative study.	Tuberculosis (TB) mortality rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did food insecurity worldwide. Undernourished individuals are at increased risk for incident TB disease and TB mortality. This study examines the impact of COVID lockdowns on the food security of households with TB in Southern India. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with household contacts enrolled in a nutritional intervention study, conducted in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu (2018-2024), which provided household contacts of persons with TB with a six-month nutritional intervention. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, 78% of households in our study had no income; 67% resorted to distress financing, such as loans, to afford food; and 44% changed their eating habits, such as buying less food or different items. Respondents reported that the provided nutritional intervention improved their food security. Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic can reduce both food access and diversity, leading to macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies that increase the risk of TB incidence and mortality. Undernutrition due to food insecurity may have been a driver for hastened disease progression or disease-related morbidity and increased mortality during the pandemic. Nutritional support interventions should be implemented as a part of pandemic response.
40203030	IL-6 trans-signaling mediates cytokine secretion and barrier dysfunction in hantavirus-infected cells and correlate to severity in HFRS.	Hantavirus causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Strong inflammatory responses and vascular leakage are important hallmarks of these often fatal diseases. The mechanism behind pathogenesis is unknown and no specific treatment is available. IL-6 was recently highlighted as a biomarker for HPS/HFRS severity. IL-6 signaling is complex and context dependent: while classical signaling generally provide protective responses, trans-signaling can cause severe pathogenic responses. Here, we investigated a potential role for IL-6 trans-signaling in hantavirus pathogenesis.
40203029	Partner perceptions during brief online interactions shape partner selection and cooperation.	Evolutionary theory suggests that partner selection - the ability to identify and preferentially interact with individuals willing (warmth) and able (competence) to work towards mutual benefits - is a key driver of cooperative behavior. However, partner selection is complex, requiring the integration of various information, such as impression formation and task affordances. Despite its importance, there is limited research on the effect of these factors on partner selection for cooperative tasks. Thus, this paper investigates how person perceptions (warmth and competence), task affordances, and facial and acoustic nonverbal behavior inform partner selection for cooperative tasks. For this purpose, we asked participants to select partners for a task that either expressed warmth- or competence-related traits. Participants had a 3-minute (online) conversation with up to five individuals, reported their evaluations, selected partners for the task, and then engaged in the task. Results indicate that person perceptions guide partner selection, with each trait being more predictive in relevant tasks. Additionally, we found that the perceptions of warmth, but not competence, can be predicted by facial and acoustic cues during conversations. Lastly, we find that in the context of online social interactions, individuals were more cooperative towards selected participants than unselected. We discuss these implications in the context of the theory of partner selection and offer insights on how these results can be used in future efforts for designing socially intelligent artificial systems that support partner selection decisions.
40203028	Utilizing a deep learning model based on BERT for identifying enhancers and their strength.	An enhancer is a specific DNA sequence typically located within a gene at upstream or downstream position and serves as a pivotal element in the regulation of eukaryotic gene transcription. Therefore, the recognition of enhancers is highly significant for comprehending gene expression regulatory systems. While some useful predictive models have been proposed, there are still deficiencies in these models. To address current limitations, we propose a model, DNABERT2-Enhancer, based on transformer architecture and deep learning, designed for the recognition of enhancers (classified as either enhancer or non-enhancer) and the identification of their activity (strong or weak enhancers). More specifically, DNABERT2-Enhancer is composed of a BERT model for extracting features and a CNN model for enhancers classification. Parameters of the BERT model are initialized by a pre-training DNABERT-2 language model. The enhancer recognition task is then fine-tuned through transfer learning to convert the original sequence into feature vectors. Subsequently, the CNN network is employed to learn the feature vector generated by BERT and produce the prediction results. In comparison with existing predictors utilizing the identical dataset, our approach demonstrates superior performance. This suggests that the model will be a useful instrument for academic research on the enhancer recognition.
40203027	Are intestinal parasites in dogs an infection risk to children in the same household? An investigation in Cuba.	Zoonotic transmission of intestinal parasites from dogs has been documented, but the extent of such transmission is unclear. This is particularly relevant in low- and middle-income countries, where people share living space with their domestic animals. We investigated whether dog ownership was associated with intestinal parasitoses in children in Cuba.
40203026	Energy aware stable path ad hoc on-demand distance vector algorithm for extending network lifetime of mobile ad hoc networks.	Traditional routing protocols in MANETs, such as AODV, do not take energy consumption into account, which leads to inefficient utilization of the limited battery resources. In such networks, nodes depend on non-rechargeable batteries, and once the energy is depleted, the nodes can no longer function, resulting in frequent link failures and reduced network lifetime. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a novel routing protocol, the Energy Aware Stable Path Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (EASP-AODV), which incorporates residual energy of individual nodes and received signal strength to improve routing decisions. By considering these factors, EASP-AODV effectively reduces link breakages, enhances route stability, and prolongs the overall lifetime of the network. The algorithm optimizes energy usage, ensuring that nodes with higher residual energy are preferred for routing, thus minimizing energy depletion and mitigating early node failures. To evaluate the effectiveness of EASP-AODV, we conducted simulations using NS2.35, a widely used network simulator. The performance of EASP-AODV was compared with two well-known routing protocols: Energy Aware Path Selection (EAPS-AODV) and the traditional AODV. Several performance metrics, including normalized energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, normalized routing overhead, average end-to-end delay, and network lifetime, were measured. Simulation results demonstrate that EASP-AODV outperforms EAPS-AODV and AODV in terms of energy efficiency, with a 4.5% and 9.5% reduction in normalized energy consumption, respectively. Moreover, the proposed algorithm significantly extends network lifetime, with a 3.5% and 7.5% improvement over EAPS-AODV and AODV. These results confirm that EASP-AODV provides a more energy-efficient and sustainable solution for routing in MANETs, addressing the critical issues of energy consumption and network stability while extending the operational lifetime of the network.
40203025	Associations between different measures of SARS-CoV-2 infection status and subsequent economic inactivity: A pooled analysis of five longitudinal surveys linked to healthcare records.	Following the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, a record number of people became economically inactive in the UK. We investigated the association between coronavirus infection and subsequent economic inactivity among people employed pre-pandemic, and whether this association varied between self-report versus healthcare recorded infection status.
40203024	Dicyphus cerastii: First data on development, survival, and reproduction.	Dicyphus cerastii Wagner (Hemiptera: Miridae) is an important predator in horticultural crops. This study provides the first data on biological traits like development, survival, and reproduction for this species. We investigated how host (tomato, tobacco, and Cape gooseberry) and temperature (15.0, 20.0, 25.0 ±  1 °C) influenced nymphal development, survival, and adult longevity. In the absence of prey, nymphs failed to complete development on any host. When prey was available, nymphal development, survival and longevity declined as temperature increased across all hosts. Development and longevity of D. cerastii were further examined on tomato, at seven temperatures (15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 27.5, 30.0, 32.5, 35.0 ±  1°C). Reproductive capacity was measured at 20.0, 25.0, 30.0 ±  1°C, on tomato. Egg development ranged from 30.6 days (15.0 °C) to 9.7 days (32.5 °C). Nymph development decreased from 40.0 days (15.0 °C) to 16.4 days (30.0 °C), and no nymphs completed development above 30.0 °C. The optimal temperature for development from egg to adult was estimated at 29.2 °C., while the minimum threshold for immature development was approximately 7.0 °C. The thermal constant for development was 230.4 degree-days for eggs, and 394.0 degree-days for nymphs. Adult longevity ranged from 158.6 days (15.0 °C) to 13.8 days (30.0 °C). The net reproductive rate (R0) and generation time (T) were highest at 20.0 °C, while the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was highest at 25.0 °C.
40203023	Prevalence and factors associated with road traffic crashes among truck drivers in Southeast Iran.	Road traffic injuries are the second leading cause of death in Iran. The study investigated the prevalence and the influencing factors of Road traffic crashes (RTCs) among truck drivers in southeast Iran. In this cross-sectional study, 592 truck drivers were recruited using a multi-stage sampling method from November 2022 to February 2023. Data was collected through a researcher-administered questionnaire that included the crashes, individual characteristics, driving characteristics, work patterns, sleep and fatigue-related factors, workload, driving styles, and personality traits. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used to assess the association between risk factors and crash involvement in the 3 last years. The surveyed drivers had a mean age of 37.4 ± 8.9 years, with an average driving history of 13.7 ±  7.6 years. Among the respondents, 28.4% reported involvement in crashes over the last 3 years, with 12.1% reporting one, 10% reporting two, and 6.3% experiencing three or more crashes. A significant portion of the crashes (42.5%) occurred between midnight and 6:00 a.m. In their lifetime, 24.2% of participants reported at least one sleep-related crash, 40.5% reported at least one fatigue-related crash, and 6.9% reported at least one crash resulting in a fatality. The odds of RTCs were higher among truck drivers who used drugs (OR = 2.03, 95% CI, 1.36-3.04), used mobile devices for texting (OR = 2.88, 95% CI, 1.56-5.30), neglected seat belt usage (OR = 1.81, 95% CI, 1.10-2.99), had accumulated traffic fines in the last year (OR =  8.18, 95% CI, 3.82-17.52, OR =  11.39, 95% CI, 5.42-23.92, OR =  17.78, 95% CI, 7.50-42.17, for 1-2, 3-6, and > 6 traffic fines, respectively), consumed sleeping pills (OR = 2.52, 95% CI, 1.19-5.35), engaged sleep driving (OR = 11.30, 95% CI, 7.18-17.80), extended their driving hours without a break (OR =  3.02, 95% CI, 1.55-5.87, for consecutive driving hours before taking a break ≥ 8), experienced fatigue while driving (OR =  1.98, 95% CI, 1.24-3.17, for sometimes experienced fatigue while driving), faced high visual demands (OR = 1.23, 95% CI, 1.02-1.50), exhibited a careless driving style (OR = 0.95, 95% CI, 0.91- 0.99), and had higher levels of neuroticism (OR = 1.05, 95% CI, 1.01-1.10). The study sheds light on the significant prevalence of road traffic crashes among truck drivers. The findings underscore a constellation of factors amplifying crash risks within this occupational group. These outcomes emphasize the multifaceted nature of road safety issues within the trucking industry, indicating the need for targeted interventions and preventive measures to enhance driver safety and reduce the incidence of road traffic crashes among truck drivers.
40203022	Prevalence, locations and predictors of attitudes accepting both intimate partner violence and additional forms of violence against women and girls in South Sudan: a geospatial analysis.	Most research on violence against women and girls (VAWG) in South Sudan has focused on intimate partner violence (IPV) neglecting other forms of VAWG. This research aims to determine the prevalence of attitudes accepting IPV and whether it overlaps with attitudes accepting additional forms of VAWG (child marriage, raiding villages for women during cattle rustling or other raids or female genital mutilation) in South Sudanese men and women, or are different attitudinal phenomena. We used data from the National Household Survey South Sudan 2020 (n = 1,732 women, n = 1,730 men aged 15-49 years). We estimated attitudinal prevalences and applied spatial analysis (Global Moran's I, Getis and Ord's local Gi*, and Kuldorff's SatScan) and multilevel regression to assess overlapping attitudes accepting IPV and at least one other form of VAWG studied in the 10 states and three administrative areas comprising the country. The prevalence of attitudes accepting IPV overlapping with the prevalence of attitudes accepting at least one other form of VAWG was 34.72% (95% CI = 33.14%-36.34%). Sub-national results were non-randomly correlated (Global Moran's I= 0.23). Higher clusters displaying overlaps were located in the counties Kapoeta East, Kapoeta South, Kapoeta North, Budi, Pibor, and Ikotos. People married, cohabiting or living together (aOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.04-1.90) as well as people widowed, divorced or separated (aOR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.05-2.93) were associated with attitudinal overlaps. Conversely, communities with any formal education were associated with a lower odds of overlapping (aOR = 0.26. 95% CI = 0.09-0.70). In South Sudan overlapping acceptance of IPV and at least one other form of VAWG are spatially clustered. Therefore, strategies to understand and tackle them should be strengthened especially in those locations. Essential elements include increasing schooling for children and promoting women's empowerment, especially among male-female partnerships. These conclusions have national and international policy implications.
40203021	Classification of the trajectory of changes in food intake in special nursing home for oldest-old in the 6 months before death: A secondary analysis.	For the oldest-old residents around their 90s living in facilities, quality end-of-life care is crucial. While an association between reduced food intake and death is known, specific patterns of intake changes before death are not well-documented.
40203020	Building a Bridge Between Ambient MS and LC-MS by Non-Exhaustive Microdesorption.	Ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) offers rapid screening but faces challenges in analyzing complex samples due to high matrix effects and limited selectivity. The absence of a separation step can also lead to false positives due to the isomers or isobars. In this study, a sequential analysis strategy which combines ambient MS and LC-MS was developed for the first time based on the non-exhaustive microdesorption in solid-phase microextraction (SPME). This strategy was demonstrated by combining coated blade spray (CBS)-MS with LC-MS. In the first step, a few microliters of solvent was used for non-exhaustive desorption with high enrichment factor for rapid screening by CBS-MS. For the suspicious samples, the remaining analytes on the SPME coating undergo exhaustive desorption, then followed by LC-MS confirmation. The matrix-compatible coating used in the SPME device significantly reduces matrix effects while enhancing sensitivity through analyte enrichment. This method is environmentally friendly, utilizing only a few microliters of organic solvents for screening. The approach was rigorously validated, both theoretically and experimentally, and successfully applied to anti-doping testing, enabling detection of 53 prohibited substances in urine samples by integrating CBS-MS with LC-MS.
40203019	Enhancing student-centered walking environments on university campuses through street view imagery and machine learning.	Campus walking environments significantly influence college students' daily lives and shape their subjective perceptions. However, previous studies have been constrained by limited sample sizes and inefficient, time-consuming methodologies. To address these limitations, we developed a deep learning framework to evaluate campus walking perceptions across four universities in China's Yangtze River Delta region. Utilizing 15,596 Baidu Street View Images (BSVIs), and perceptual ratings from 100 volunteers across four dimensions-aesthetics, security, depression, and vitality-we employed four machine learning models to predict perceptual scores. Our results demonstrate that the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed others in predicting aesthetics, security, and vitality, while linear regression was most effective for depression. Spatial analysis revealed that perceptions of aesthetics, security, and vitality were concentrated in landmark areas and regions with high pedestrian flow. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that buildings exhibited stronger correlations with depression (β = 0.112) compared to other perceptual aspects. Moreover, vegetation (β = 0.032) and meadows (β = 0.176) elements significantly enhanced aesthetics. This study offers actionable insights for optimizing campus walking environments from a student-centered perspective, emphasizing the importance of spatial design and visual elements in enhancing students' perceptual experiences.
40203018	The potential of evaluating shape drawing using machine learning for predicting high autistic traits.	Children with high autistic traits often exhibit deficits in drawing, an important skill for social adaptability. Machine learning is a powerful technique for learning predictive models from movement data, so drawing processes and product characteristics can be objectively evaluated. This study aimed to assess the potential of evaluating shape drawing using machine learning to predict high autistic traits.
40203017	Point-of-care determination of the frequency of Rhesus(D)-negative blood types and the uptake of anti(D) immunoglobulin among Rh(D)-negative women in Dadu district, Sindh, Pakistan.	Rhesus (Rh) disease remains a serious problem in low- and middle-income countries. Rh disease prevention requires early identification and prophylactic treatment of Rh(D)-negative women. We evaluated the feasibility of point-of-care identification of Rh(D)-negative women and timely administration of two doses of anti(D) immunoglobulin by lady health visitors in Dadu district, Sindh, Pakistan. Pregnant women were enrolled at two hospitals and followed until 29 days postpartum. Rh(D)-antigen status was determined using the EldonCard2521 test and all Rh(D)-negative point-of-care test results were attempted to be verified using the conventional test tube agglutination method. Rh(D)-negative women were offered two injections of anti(D) immunoglobulin, one at 28 weeks' gestation and one within 72 hours of delivery. Knowledge pertaining to Rh disease was assessed among participants at study entry and exit, and in a sample of 30 health care providers. All participants (n=1619) had their blood tested with the EldonCard2521, and 279 (17%) women were found to be Rh(D)-negative; however, the conventional test tube method identified one discordant Rh(D)-antigen result. Among 278 Rh(D)-negative women, 254 (91%) and 268 (96%) received their first and second dose of anti(D) immunoglobulin, respectively. The rates of miscarriage (22.1 per 1,000 pregnancies vs. 4.5 per 1,000 pregnancies), stillbirth (33.8 per 1,000 pregnancies vs. 6.7 per 1,000 pregnancies), and neonatal death (35.0 vs. 16.6 per 1,000 live births) were higher among Rh(D)-negative vs. Rh(D)-positive participants. At study enrolment, there was little knowledge pertaining to Rh disease and its consequences among participants and knowledge also varied greatly among health care providers. The high frequency of maternal Rh(D)-negative blood types, high rates of stillbirth, miscarriage, and neonatal death among Rh(D)-negative women and their newborns, and limited and varied knowledge of Rh disease among pregnant women and health care providers, bolsters the need for a wide-scale Rh disease prevention program in Pakistan.

40203013	Verifying interruption of transmission or elimination of Schistosoma japonicum must consider schistosome infections in wild rodents.	Following the exciting announcement that Anhui Province, one of the historically most heavily Schistosoma japonicum endemic regions in China, has been officially declared to have achieved the goal of province-wide transmission interruption of schistosomiasis, we raise two concerns that merit further consideration. Firstly, S. japonicum is zoonotic, and in China it is known that humans, livestock, and wild animals such as rodents are major reservoirs of infection. While S. japonicum infections both in humans and bovines have recently been reduced to zero prevalence, infection persists at moderate to high levels within rodents with, for example, prevalence's reported of up to 12.81% within Anhui Province over last 5 years. Therefore, surveillance of schistosome infections in wild animals, at least in rodents, must be included in the criteria of verifying transmission interruption or elimination in China. Secondly, regarding how the official procedure of verification of transmission of interruption was assessed, we propose that a more accurate survey design and foci selection would be based, at least in part, upon areas where schistosome infections in either humans, domestic/wild animals and/or snails have recently been documented. This is particularly urgent, not only in terms of the long-term sustainability of disease control in China, but because many other countries are now fully acknowledging the zoonotic potential of schistosomiasis and are/or will soon enter this final elimination phase as officially outlined in the WHO's 2021-2030 Neglected Tropical Diseases Roadmap.
40203012	Protocol for the development of a core outcome set for respectful maternal and newborn care in a low-middle income setting.	Disrespect and abuse have been seen as a real hindrance to achieving universal coverage for skilled delivery. Improving respectful maternal and newborn care and quality of care around the time of birth has been identified as a key strategy in low- and middle-income countries for reducing the rates of stillbirths and maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity rates. Currently, there is no core outcome set on respectful maternal and newborn care, resulting in reporting of various study outcomes from different studies which hinders the improvement of maternal and neonatal health.
40203011	Effectiveness and satisfaction of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for children on anxiety, depression, and internet addiction in adolescents: Study protocol for a randomized control trial.	Adolescents with Internet addiction (IA) frequently encounter elevated levels of anxiety and depression, which subsequently results in the perpetuation of their addiction behaviors. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for children (MBCT-C) is an adapted version of traditional MBCT that targets emotional problems in children. The present study aimed to provide a framework for the implementation of a clinical trial for its effectiveness in reducing anxiety, depression, and IA in adolescents with IA. This study protocol proposes a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms (MBCT-C versus active control). Eighty Iranian adolescents (Persian ethnicity; males and females; 12 to 15 years) diagnosed with IA will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (12 sessions of MBCT-C group therapy) or the control group (12 life skills training sessions). Pre-intervention, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up assessments will be conducted using Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescents (MAAS-A), Mindfulness Program Satisfaction Questioner (MPSQ), Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Children (STAI-C), MBCT-C Adherence Scale (MBCT-C-AS), and Internet Addiction Test (IAT). Data will be analyzed using mixed regression model using STATA-18 to assess the effectiveness of MBCT-C. The current study has the potential to make a significant contribution to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT-C to address IA, anxiety, and depression in adolescents with IA.
40203009	Multiple patterns of persistent inward currents with multiple types of repetitive firings in medullary serotonergic neurons of mice: An experimental and modeling study.	Persistent inward currents (PICs) play a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability. These currents are composed of calcium (CaL) and sodium (NaP) components in vertebrate spinal neurons. Recent studies have reported that PICs are expressed in serotonergic neurons (5-HT) in medulla of mice. Multiple patterns of PICs were identified in 5-HT neurons, corresponding to a range of distinct repetitive firing types. The mechanisms underlying formation of these PIC patterns and firing types remain unknown. Using combined modeling and experimental approaches we explored the ionic mechanisms responsible for the PIC patterns and firing types. The whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed on the medullary 5-HT neurons of postnatal day 3-6 mice. A 5-HT neuron model was built based on the membrane properties of the 5-HT neurons and kinetics of voltage-gated channels. Results from physiological experiments and modeling simulations included: (1) PICs in 5-HT neurons were classified into six patterns based on their current trajectory induced by bi-ramp voltage, while repetitive firings were categorized into three types according to their response to bi-ramp current. Modulation of PICs conductance and kinetics altered the PIC patterns and firing types. (2) NaP conductance contributed to amplitude of PICs, whereas the slow inactivation gate (Sgate) of NaP regulated the PIC patterns and firing types. Increasing Sgate changed trajectory of PICs from counterclockwise to clockwise and firing types from asymmetrical to symmetric types induced by bi-ramp current. (3) CaL conductance dominated the amplitude of PICs, while CaL kinetics (half-activation voltage and slope) determined inactivation of PICs and prolongation of repetitive firing. (4) The novel finding was that distribution of CaL in distal dendrites modulated the PIC patterns and firing types. This study provides insights into the ionic mechanisms underlying generation of multiple PIC patterns and firing types in 5-HT neurons.

Global research identifies the importance of breastfeeding, including the World Health Organisation in developing recommendations and noting over 800,000 child lives would be saved each year if breastfeeding was adopted following the recommendations of WHO/UNICEF. There is limited published data exploring breastfeeding knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices [KAPP] of health care professionals employed in primary care. Recent Irish evidence from one local geographical area identified general practitioners and general practice nurses [GPs and GPNs] received limited formal breastfeeding education within undergraduate or postgraduate education programmes and were interested in undertaking further professional development, education and training.
40203006	Integrating DRN-RF with computer vision for detection of control room operator's mental fatigue.	Control room operators encounter a substantial risk of mental fatigue, which can reduce their human reliability by diminishing concentration and responsiveness, leading to unsafe operations. There is value in detection of individuals' mental fatigue status in the workplace. This study introduces a new method for mental fatigue detection (MFD) that combines computer vision and machine learning. Traditional methods for MFD typically rely on multi-dimensional data for fatigue analysis and detection, which can be challenging to apply in a real situation. The traditional methods such as the use of biological data, e.g., electrocardiograms, require operators to be in constant contact with sensors, while this study utilizes computer vision to collect facial data, and a machine learning model to assess fatigue states. The developed machine learning method consists both Deep Residual Network and Random Forest (DRN-RF). A comparison with existing MFD methods, including K Nearest Neighbors and Gradient Boosting Machine, has been carried out. The results show that the accuracy of the DRN-RF model reaches 94.2% and the deviation is 0.004. Evidently, the DRN-RF model demonstrates high accuracy and stability. Overall, the proposed method has the potential to contribute to improving the safety of process system operations, particularly in the aspect of human factor management.
40203005	Are quality assessments in science affected by anchoring effects? - Empirical results from a survey of authors assessing previously cited papers.	Many studies have investigated anchoring effects. Anchoring occurs when initial values are used by humans as starting points in assessments. We investigated the prevalence of anchoring effects in the quality assessments of scientific papers. This study, which is preregistered, is a follow-up study that is intended to answer open questions from a previous study with the same topic. One open question concerns causal conclusions: it is necessary that randomly selected respondents assess the same paper under different conditions. In a survey, we asked corresponding authors to assess the quality of articles they have cited in previous papers. The respondents were randomly assigned to several experimental groups receiving numerical anchors such as citation counts or numerical access codes to the questionnaire. Although our results reveal scarcely effects of citation counts presented to the respondents as possible anchors, there is a small, but statistically significant effect of the random number (the numerical access code) presented to the respondents. Similar to other studies that have investigated the existence of anchoring effects in assessments in various contexts, our study could demonstrate the existence of an anchoring effect in research evaluation. Researchers seem to be influenced by numbers without any relationship to the quality of the evaluated paper in their assessment of papers.
40203004	Assessing Task-Dependent Neurophysiology During Virtual Reality Treadmill Training in Adults With Traumatic Brain Injury: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Feasibility Study.	Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience residual mobility deficits that can be improved with treadmill and virtual reality interventions. However, previous studies have not measured the underlying neurophysiology during these interventions nor assessed if acquiring such data is feasible in a TBI population. Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure neurophysiology during a treadmill task and a treadmill with virtual reality task.

Bariatric surgery is effective in treating severe obesity. However, surgery alone, without additional behavior change management, may not lead to optimal long-term weight loss and maintenance. This study aimed to evaluate an intervention designed based on the Health Action Process Approach to improve outcomes of obesity surgery in patients who underwent bariatric surgery in Tehran, Iran.

40202999	A narrative review of the pathophysiology of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa: Exploring the potential for corticosteroid therapy.	Sepsis remains a significant global health threat with a disproportionate burden in low-income countries including those in sub-Saharan Africa where case fatality rates are as high as 30% to 50%. Defined as a severe systemic response to infection, sepsis leads to widespread immune dysregulation and organ dysfunction, including adrenal insufficiency. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) arises from dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, altered cortisol metabolism, and tissue resistance to glucocorticoids, all of which can occur during sepsis. Clinical trials of corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with sepsis and septic shock have shown improvements in shock reversal, and in some studies, patient survival; however, their role in the treatment of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. The incidence of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa is compounded by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and co-infections, including tuberculosis (TB), which is the leading cause of sepsis. Both HIV and TB can cause immune dysregulation and adrenal insufficiency, which may exacerbate CIRCI and prolong shock. Existing sepsis research has been predominantly conducted in high-income countries and has largely excluded people living with HIV or TB. Therefore, there is a need to better understand sepsis and CIRCI pathophysiology in the context of specific regional host and pathogen characteristics. In this narrative review, we explored the pathophysiology of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa including the existing literature on the immune response to sepsis and the prevalence of adrenal insufficiency in patients with HIV and TB, with a focus on the implications for corticosteroid management. We found a compelling need to further evaluate corticosteroids for the treatment of sepsis in Africa.

40202997	Overview of International Health in Postwar Japan.	This commentary traces the emergence and evolution of international cooperation in the medical and public health fields in postwar Japan. It examines how trends in the nature of its international cooperation efforts reflected economic and social trends over three time periods between the end of World War II and the end of the twentieth century. In the first period, Japan's approach to international cooperation was both limited and influenced by its own reconstruction. In the second period, Japan sought to reenter the international community by making contributions towards world peace and international health. In the third period, Japan's remarkable economic growth enabled it to become a major source of overseas development assistance around the world. The paper includes short profiles of eight Japanese innovators in international health cooperation (and mentions numerous others who were similarly active in the field). Over the years, these and many other individuals built Japanese international health agencies and shaped the country's changing approaches to international health.

40202995	Global Health and Its Limitations: An Historical Perspective.	Humanitarian themes, such as rights and entitlements to universal well-being, feature prominently in narratives of global health, even as many recent authors have pointed to systematic imbalances of power, unfair governance structures, and unwanted influences as evidence of ongoing colonial interference in the health affairs of many low- and middle-income countries. This article employs an historical perspective to analyze major forces that have shaped the development of global health, and which remain as obstacles to its objectives. These include macroeconomics, geopolitics, and the activism and resources of the HIV/AIDS pandemic that led to global health in its current form. Through an examination of this history and its effects, I argue that the humanitarian goals of global health will not be realized without dramatic changes to the field. Particularly in the failure to engage economic relationships and trade policy, global health limits its attention to downstream consequences of resource inequalities, where its goal of a more egalitarian, more healthy world is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.
40202994	Immunogenicity of a single dose of the 17DD yellow fever vaccine in a cohort of adults and children in a non-endemic area, and its association with dengue and Zika seropositivity.	In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) withdrew the recommendation of booster doses of the yellow fever (YF) vaccine, based on retrospective and cross-sectional studies that showed lifelong protective immunity from a single dose. Currently, yellow fever transmission in Brazil occurs only through the jungle (sylvatic) cycle. However, the high vector density of Aedes aegypti, which transmits other orthoflaviviruses, is a concern for the expansion of YF in other regions of the country. We conducted a cohort study to assess the duration of vaccine-induced immunity in adults and children residing in an area without wild-type YF virus circulation but with a high incidence of other orthoflaviviruses. This phase IV, uncontrolled cohort study was conducted in three municipalities in northeastern Brazil. The 17DD strain vaccine was administered to children aged 9 months to 4 years and adults aged 18 to 50 years. Blood samples for antibody titration were collected before vaccination, 30-45 days after, and one year after vaccination. The following assays were used: µFRNT for yellow fever and dengue; PRNT for Zika; and chemiluminescence for Zika (IgG and IgM) and dengue (IgG). YF seroconversion rates 30-45 days post-vaccination increased with age, reaching 99% in adults, while 10% of infants remained without detectable antibodies. Seropositivity for dengue neutralizing antibodies was inversely associated with YF antibody titers 30-45 days post-vaccination. Previous Zika infection showed no substantial association with YF antibody titers post-vaccination. One year after vaccination, a considerable reduction in YF antibody titers was observed across all age groups, regardless of prior dengue or Zika infections. Our data support the Brazilian National Immunization Program's recommendation for a booster dose of the vaccine at 4 years of age. Current recommendations assuming lifelong protection from a single dose of the YF vaccine do not appear to provide sufficient protection in high-risk areas, particularly where infants are the primary target for vaccination.
40202993	Distinctive Membrane Accommodation Traits Underpinning the Neutralization Activity of HIV-1 Antibody against MPER.	The membrane-proximal external region (MPER), located in the carboxy-terminal section of HIV's envelope glycoprotein (Env) ectodomain, which is essential for viral entry into host cells, has gained considerable attention as a target for HIV vaccine development due to the exceptional neutralization breadth of antibodies against MPER epitopes. A distinctive feature of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting MPER is their requirement to accommodate the viral membrane into the surface of the antigen-binding fragment, or Fab moiety, to optimize antigen recognition. In this study, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism behind this interaction and its relevance to the antiviral function of bnAb 10E8. We conducted all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of three systems: (i) Fab 10E8 positioned on the surface of a viral-like lipid bilayer (VL-LB), (ii) Fab 10E8 in complex with an MPER helix anchored to the VL-LB via the Env glycoprotein transmembrane domain (TMD), and (iii) a Fab/MPER-TMD complex similarly embedded in the VL-LB but with a chemically optimized Fab 10E8 variant showing enhanced potency. Comparing these systems enabled us to derive atomic-scale Fab-membrane accommodation profiles pertinent to 10E8's neutralizing function. Our findings support that Fab adaptation to the viral membrane interface following epitope binding is crucial for developing MPER-targeted neutralizing activity. This analysis also provides insights into pathways for strengthening lipid interactions, which may prove valuable in designing MPER-based biologics and vaccines to prevent or treat HIV infection.

40202991	Improving tuberculosis diagnosis in South Africa's private sector: The results of a pilot public-private mix intervention in eThekwini health district.	While tuberculosis (TB) is primarily addressed in South Africa's public sector, people with TB also present to private sector General Practitioners (GPs), where TB may be missed or treatment delayed. We introduced a pilot project in a high-TB burden health district to connect private GPs to free public sector TB testing. We aimed to gauge GPs' willingness to participate and describe TB patterns in the private sector. GPs practicing in metropolitan eThekwini from May 2021-March 2022 were invited to participate. Recruited GPs were provided sputum specimen jars, specimen transportation, and access to free TB testing through the National Health Laboratory Service for clients with TB-like symptoms. A customised electronic form on an established medical referral application (Vula) was developed to record client information, initiate specimen transport, share real-time test results, and communicate management guidance. Of the 313 eligible GPs, 158 (50.5%) agreed to participate, among whom 61 (38.6%) submitted at least one client specimen (median=6, IQR=2-12). Specimen yield (17.6%) and quality (99.7%) were high. One-hundred-seven clients were diagnosed with TB, 39.3% were female and 48.6% were living with HIV. Three clients (2.9%) were diagnosed with drug-resistant TB. One hundred people with TB (93.4%) were linked to treatment, 96.0% in the public sector, in an average of two days (IQR 1-5), with 88/100 completing treatment in a median 182 days (IQR=170-194). Two people with TB died before diagnosis by culture and six died during treatment, resulting in 7.5% case fatality (8/107). User-prompting to check HIV status significantly improved the frequency with which GPs enquired about HIV compared to a previous study (88.4% versus 25.7%, p<0.0001). One-fifth (19.5%) of GPs submitted specimens without monetary incentives and helped link 100 clients to TB treatment expeditiously, suggesting a successful pilot and a workable model for improving TB management in South Africa's private sector.
40202990	Metabolomics analysis of five cultivars of Sorghum bicolor reveals the contribution of flavonoid pathway to tannin content.	This study aims to utilize metabolomics to elucidate the key metabolites and metabolic pathways contributing to the quality differences among the grains of 'hongyingzi' (hyz) sorghum and four other varieties naming 'jinuoliang' (Jinl), 'jinnuoliang' (Jinnl), 'lunuohong' (lnh) and 'liaoza 19' (lz19). By analyzing the metabolomics data of the five sorghum varieties, we identified a total of 384 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs). Among these, flavonoids, phenolic acids and lipid compounds were the most abundant, exhibiting varying degrees of upregulation and downregulation. Compared to the four cultivars, the hyz sorghum differently exhibited 78, 40, 59 and 63 flavonoids; 29, 54, 30 and 30 phenolic acids; and 9, 27, 26 and 20 lipids, respectively. Multiple comparisons among the five sorghum varieties also identified 38 common DAMs, and the flavonoid pathway is particularly significant in KEGG enrichment. Additionally, as a high tannin content variety, correlation analysis revealed in sorghum that ellagic acid-4-O-glucoside plays a central role in tannin synthesis. These findings would highlight significant differences in the metabolomic profiles between hyz and the control varieties, providing valuable insights for the exploration of key genes involved in flavonoid metabolism and biosynthesis pathways in sorghum seeds.
40202989	Enhancement of Mechanical, Thermal, and Barrier Behavior of Sustainable PECF Copolyester Nanocomposite Films Using Polydopamine-Functionalized MXene Fillers.	The development of high-strength titanium carbide (Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub>) MXene-PDA nanosheet-based sustainable poly(ethylene-<i>co</i>-1,4-cyclohexane dimethylene 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid) (PECF) copolyester nanocomposites with superior tensile, thermal, and barrier properties is a promising avenue for advanced materials. However, achieving Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene-based polyester nanocomposites that exhibit exceptional thermal conductivity, and enhanced mechanical and barrier properties remains a significant challenge. In this study, we employed self-assembly technology through layer-by-layer (LBL) coating to create highly saturated Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene-PDA fillers that are uniformly dispersed and strongly bonded within the PECF matrix. This approach enabled the formation of dense nanocomposites with diverse functional properties. Specifically, MPP2 nanocomposites (0.3 wt %) demonstrated excellent mechanical performance, with a compressive tensile strength of 84 MPa and a modulus of 4.4 GPa, alongside remarkable O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O vapor barrier properties and superior thermal stability. Compared to pure PECF, the addition of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene-PDA at a loading of 0.3 wt % resulted in substantial improvements: a 30% increase in tensile strength, a 109% increase in modulus, and significantly enhanced barrier properties for O<sub>2</sub> (27.3-times), CO<sub>2</sub> (24.7-times), and H<sub>2</sub>O vapor (5.0-times). These findings highlight the potential of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene-PDA-reinforced PECF nanocomposites for high-performance applications, offering valuable insights for future materials development.

The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a major renal disease is increasing rapidly. The progression of CKD may lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Current diagnostic and prognostic methods still have some limitations. This study aims to evaluate the potential and predictive ability of Osteopontin (OPN), Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and Fetuin-A on the incidence of ESRD in CKD patients.
40202987	Socio-structural and direct health challenges related to illness management among patients with type 2 diabetes in Kenya and Tanzania during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative inquiry.	During COVID-19, people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) experienced increased vulnerability, including severe COVID-19 complications, disruptions in diabetes management, and social isolation. These aspects were heightened in many sub-Saharan African countries, such as Kenya and Tanzania, where healthcare systems already face critical challenges in coping with increasing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Little is known about how people with T2D in these countries managed their diabetes or how the different approaches to COVID-19 control (Kenya imposed lockdown and curfew, whereas Tanzania adopted less strict measures) impacted their T2D management. This qualitative study aimed to compare the accounts of T2D patients in both countries to examine similarities and differences in the illness management challenges they faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 52 patients (Kenya, n=22; Tanzania, n=30), and the transcripts were analyzed thematically. Despite different COVID-19 control measures, patients in both countries faced similar direct health challenges, such as difficulties accessing diabetic consultations and treatment, but they also experienced distinct socio-structural challenges. Direct health challenges included difficulties in accessing diabetic consultations and treatment, limited availability of diabetic medicine at health facilities and mental health distress. These were exacerbated by socio-structural challenges, many of which pre-dated COVID-19 but intensified during the pandemic. These included closure of diabetic clinics in Dar es Salaam, business instability, financial difficulties, health insurance challenges, higher food prices impacting patients' adherence to T2D dietary recommendations (in both countries), and price inflation of diabetic medicine and test kits (in Kenya). Together, these challenges led to patients practicing self-medication, missing doses and resulted in poor blood sugar control. People with T2D in Kenya and Tanzania have described similar illness management challenges. In both countries, future contingency planning is essential to ensure adequate routine management of T2D and to improve access to care in emergency situations. Affordable comprehensive health insurance, economic support, and psychosocial services are required to increase patient resilience and support the health and wellbeing of people with T2D.
40202986	Genetic risk for neurodegenerative conditions is linked to disease-specific microglial pathways.	Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of common variants associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the noncoding localization of these variants has made the assignment of target genes for brain cell types challenging. Genomic approaches that infer chromosomal 3D architecture can link noncoding risk variants and distal gene regulatory elements such as enhancers to gene promoters. By using enhancer-to-promoter interactome maps for human microglia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, we identified cell-type-specific enrichment of genetic heritability for brain disorders through stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression. Our analysis suggests that genetic heritability for multiple neurodegenerative disorders is enriched at microglial chromatin contact sites, while schizophrenia heritability is predominantly enriched at chromatin contact sites in neurons followed by oligodendrocytes. Through Hi-C coupled multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (H-MAGMA), we identified disease risk genes for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and schizophrenia. We found that disease-risk genes were overrepresented in microglia compared to other brain cell types across neurodegenerative conditions and within neurons for schizophrenia. Notably, the microglial risk genes and pathways identified were largely specific to each disease. Our findings reinforce microglia as an important, genetically informed cell type for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative conditions and highlight potentially targetable disease-relevant pathways.
40202985	CoHet4Rec: A recommendation for collaborative heterogeneous information networks.	Recommender Systems (RS) aim to predict users' latent interests in items by learning embeddings from user-item graphs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced RS by enabling the embedding of graph-structured data. However, relying solely on user-item interactions has limitations, such as the cold-start problem. Social recommendation has gained attention for its potential to improve outcomes by incorporating social information among users. Yet, existing social-aware models need further exploration of interaction semantics and other collaborative relationships beyond social connections. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing CoHet4Rec, a recommendation model leveraging GNNs and a Collaborative Heterogeneous Information Network (CHIN) with latent collaborative heterogeneous relation factors. CoHet4Rec captures diverse connections between users and items through factorized representations, and has the flexibility to easily incorporate more knowledge beyond social networks to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problem. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CoHet4Rec over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) recommendation techniques. The highest average improvement is 31.88% for HR@5 and 38.39% for NDCG@5.
40202984	Occupational respiratory symptoms and associated factors among street sweepers in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	In low- and middle-income countries, occupational exposure continues to be a serious public health concern. Because of their working conditions, street sweepers are particularly vulnerable to health hazards, with respiratory issues being the most common. The lack of comprehensive and inconsistence evidence on occupational respiratory symptoms among street sweepers, which exacerbates this issue. This study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of occupational respiratory symptoms and associated factors among street sweepers in low- and middle-income countries. A comprehensive search strategy was carried out using various databases, such as PubMed, Scientific Direct, HINARI and Google Scholar, and the grey literature. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used. Microsoft Excel was used to extract the data, which was then transferred to STATA 14/SE software for analysis. The Joanna Briggs Institutes' quality appraisal tool was used to ensure the quality of the included articles. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. In this study, a subgroup analysis was employed to examine the potential sources of heterogeneity, and sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of individual studies on the pooled results. To evaluate publication bias, the funnel plot and Egger's regression tests were employed. The pooled prevalence of occupational respiratory symptoms among street sweepers was estimated to be 47.35% (95% CI: 34.59-60.11). Among each respiratory symptom, cough was found to be the most prevalent at 38.37% (95% CI: 28.54-48.19). In this study, past dust exposure (OR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.06-4.61), not using facemasks (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.54-3.81), having more than five years of work experience (OR = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.66-5.7), and being between the ages of 38 and 47 (OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.07-3.27) were found to be predictor factors with occupational respiratory symptoms among street sweepers. Furthermore, there is no evidence of publication bias for this study. The findings of this study indicated a significant prevalence of occupational respiratory symptoms among street sweepers. Therefore, it is highly recommended to focus on the provision and proper use of personal protective equipment and to enhance occupational health and safety training.

40202982	Study protocol for the EYEdentify project: An examination of gaze behaviour in autistic adults using a virtual reality-based paradigm.	Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) is characterised by difficulties in social communication and interaction, which may pose significant challenges to daily functioning throughout life. While current diagnostic methods for ASC often rely on measures based on subjective reports, there is a growing need for objective, quantifiable measures to support current clinical assessment of ASC. Eye-tracking technology records eye and gaze movements in real time and provides a direct and objective method for assessing social attention. Integrating eye-tracking within virtual reality (VR) environments presents a novel approach for capturing gaze behaviour in dynamic, ecologically valid social scenarios. This study aims to investigate whether VR-based eye information can reveal group differences in gaze behaviour between autistic adults and neurotypical controls in simulated social interactions.

40202979	Gender and medication use in Turkey: Evidence from a general population survey.	Gender differences in health behaviors and outcomes were commonly documented by researchers. The focus of this study was the analysis of gender differences in medication use for a general population in Turkey. It also explored a range of factors associated with medication use at the individual level. A nationally representative cross-sectional data set was obtained from the 2019 wave of the Turkish Health Survey. The sample of this study included 17,083 adults residing in different regions of Turkey. Conditional mixed-process regression models were estimated for the whole sample and subsamples by gender. The rates of prescribed and non-prescribed medication use were 40.7% and 30.2%, respectively, in the adult population of Turkey. There were significant gender differences in medication use in the Turkish case. Females were 19.4% more likely to use prescribed medication, and they were 30.8% more likely to use non-prescribed medication compared to males in Turkey. There were negative associations between prescribed and non-prescribed medication use. On average, females were 9.2% less likely to report higher levels of health status, and they were 18.4% more likely to use healthcare services. Individuals with higher levels of self-rated health status were less likely to use prescribed medication. Both prescribed and non-prescribed medication use were positively related to healthcare service use. Complementing the earlier literature, the results of the present study demonstrated that gender-specific designs should be considered by health policies on the use of medications.

40202977	Quantifying national burdens of foodborne disease-Four imperatives for global impact.	Estimates of national burdens of the foodborne disease (FBD) inform country-level food safety policies, ranking infectious and non-infectious FBD hazards in terms of health and socioeconomic impact to mitigate FBD burdens. Using relevant publications on FBD burdens from scientific literature, this review contends that four major imperatives (health, economic, planetary boundaries, governance) argue for a sustainable programme to quantify national FBD burdens. FBD disproportionately affects children under five years of age, and low- and middle-income countries. The economic costs are significant and include medical care, child development, lost productivity and international trade losses. Climatic changes and environmental contamination cause socio-ecological disruptions, increasing risk factors for FBD. Good governance promotes food safety initiatives, addressing in part under-diagnosis and underreporting. Strengthening national policies on FBD surveillance and burden estimation can promote food safety policies and address the global and national imperatives for FBD control. Evidence-based educational and regulatory interventions for FBD can promote improvements in the health and socioeconomic circumstances of the most vulnerable.
40202976	Changes in postural sway and cortical activities after napping.	Lowered arousal state after napping may lead to poorer standing balance and the need to recalibrate the sensory organization system. This study aimed to examine the changes in postural sway and sensory associated cortical activities immediately after waking from a nap. A convenience sample of young adults (7 males and 5 females, 21.0 ± 2.3 yr.) was recruited. Before and after a 50-min lying-down nap, participants were asked to stand quietly with eyes open/closed on a firm/foam surface, and electroencephalography (EEG) in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands in sensory association areas was recorded. All participants self-reported that they fell asleep during the 50-min period provisioned for nap (Karolinska Napiness Scale before nap 4.2 ± 1.1, after nap 5.7 ± 0.8). The average time taken to finish data collection after waking the participants was 19.0 ± 4.0 minutes. The results showed less postural sway (t11 =  2.726, p =  0.02) and increased frequency of postural sway (t11 =  -3.339, p =  0.007) after nap in the eyes-open firm-surface condition. The EEG results revealed decreased activity in the alpha (F1,9 =  15.540, p =  0.003) and gamma (F1,9 =  6.626, p =  0.030) bands in the right parietal area after nap, and increased beta power in the left occipital area (Z =  -2.241, p =  0.025). In conclusion, after waking from a nap, healthy adults show increased changes in direction of postural sway which is effective in decreasing postural sway in eyes-open firm-surface condition. Even in healthy adults without worsen postural performance after nap, the EEG results suggested a decrease of efficacy in dealing with sensory challenges within twenty minutes post napping. This study contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying changes in balance control after napping, which might help fall prevention programs for the elderly.
40202975	Chronobiologically-informed features from CGM data provide unique information for XGBoost prediction of longer-term glycemic dysregulation in 8,000 individuals with type-2 diabetes.	Type 2 Diabetes causes dysregulation of blood glucose, which leads to long-term, multi-tissue damage. Continuous glucose monitoring devices are commercially available and used to track glucose at high temporal resolution so that individuals can make informed decisions about their metabolic health. Algorithms processing these continuous data have also been developed that can predict glycemic excursion in the near future. These data might also support prediction of glycemic stability over longer time horizons. In this work, we leverage longitudinal Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring data to test the hypothesis that additional information about glycemic stability comes from chronobiologically-informed features. We develop a computationally efficient multi-timescale complexity index, and find that inclusion of time-of-day complexity features increases the performance of an out-of-the-box XGBoost model in predicting the change in glucose across days. These findings support the use of chronobiologically-inspired and explainable features to improve glucose prediction algorithms with relatively long time-horizons.
40202974	Modularization of the type II secretion gene cluster from Xanthomonas euvesicatoria facilitates the identification of a structurally conserved XpsCLM assembly platform complex.	Many bacterial pathogens depend on a type II secretion (T2S) system to secrete virulence factors from the periplasm into the extracellular milieu. T2S systems consist of an outer membrane secretin channel, a periplasmic pseudopilus and an inner membrane-associated assembly platform including a cytoplasmic ATPase. The components of T2S systems are often conserved in different bacterial species, however, the architecture of the assembly platform is largely unknown. Here, we analysed predicted assembly platform components of the Xps-T2S system from the plant-pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas euvesicatoria. To facilitate these studies, we generated a modular xps-T2S gene cluster by Golden Gate assembly of single promoter and gene fragments. The modular design allowed the efficient deletion and replacement of T2S genes and the insertion of reporter fusions. Mutant approaches as well as interaction and crosslinking studies showed that the predicted assembly platform components XpsC, XpsL and XpsM form a trimeric complex which is essential for T2S and associates with the cytoplasmic ATPase XpsE and the secretin XpsD. Structural modeling revealed a similar trimeric architecture of XpsCLM homologs from Pseudomonas, Vibrio and Klebsiella species, despite overall low amino acid sequence similarities. In X. euvesicatoria, crosslinking and fluorescence microscopy studies showed that the formation of the XpsCLM complex is independent of the secretin and vice versa, suggesting that the assembly of the T2S system is a dynamic process which involves the association of preformed subcomplexes.
40202973	Field validation and application of the luminex triplex HIV assay to estimate HIV prevalence and HIV-1 incidence in Nigeria.	HIV cross-sectional surveys require multi-layered testing with several tests to estimate HIV prevalence and HIV-1 incidence. We evaluated the performance and accuracy of the newly developed HIV Triplex assay to diagnose HIV-1 and HIV-2 and detect HIV-1 recent infections using plasma samples from the 2018 Nigeria AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS). Plasma samples from consenting HIV-positive (n=2,773) and a subset of HIV-negative samples (n=7,196), as determined by the national rapid testing algorithm, followed by Bio-Rad Geenius HIV-1/2 Supplemental Assay and Western Blot, aged 18 months - 64 years, were tested using the Luminex-based HIV Triplex assay. The assay classified specimens as HIV-1 positive, HIV-2 positive, dual (HIV-1 & 2) infections, or HIV-seronegative. All HIV-1 and dual infections were further classified as either HIV-1 recent (<6 months) or long-term (LT) based on mean fluorescent intensities and compared with the LAg-Avidity EIA as the reference. Multiplex results were analyzed and compared with the final NAIIS survey data for unweighted HIV prevalence and HIV-1 incidence. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the HIV Triplex assay was 99.71% and 99.37%, respectively, with a kappa of 0.987 when compared to NAIIS survey results. Percent agreement between the HIV Triplex assay and the LAg-Avidity EIA for recent and LT classification was 98.86% with a kappa of 0.80 [CI: 0.71-0.89] and a Spearman-ranked correlation (ρ) of 0.689. A small number (n=45; 0.63%) of the subset of negatives tested were classified by the multiplex assay as either HIV-1 positive (n=35) or HIV-2 positive (n=10). Nevertheless, the HIV Triplex assay agreed with NAIIS HIV-negative survey results (99.37%). Using these results as they were, unweighted estimates of HIV prevalence for both HIV Triplex assay and NAIIS test results were similar (1.62% [95% CI: 1.56-1.68] and 1.60% [95% CI: 1.54-1.66], respectively) with overlapping confidence. After adjusting for viral load and anti-retroviral therapy, HIV-1 unweighted incidence for ages ≥15 years, using HIV Triplex assay data, was 0.70 per 1,000 [95% CI: 0.40-0.90]. This is similar to the unweighted incidence using the LAg-based RITA (recent infection testing algorithm) of 0.80 per 1,000 [95% CI: 0.60-1.10]. The HIV Triplex assay combines several assays in one, providing highly accurate results for estimating HIV prevalence and HIV-1 incidence in surveys. This assay has the potential to simplify cross-sectional surveys making them less expensive, easier, and quicker.
40202972	In vitro and in silico pharmaco-nutritional assessments of some lesser-known Nigerian nuts: Persea americana, Tetracarpidium conophorum, and Terminalia catappa.	Together with their nutritional qualities, the biosafety, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of Tetracarpidium conophorum nuts, Persea americana seeds, and Terminalia cattapa kernels were evaluated in vitro and in silico. RBC membrane stabilisation for anti-inflammatory characteristics, antioxidant activities by ABTS, DPPH, H2O2, and nitric oxide scavenging assays, and α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory assays conducted in vitro were used to evaluate the anti-diabetic activity. With an IC50 value of 208 μg/mL, P. americana showed the maximum amount of inhibition, according to the results, while T. catappa showed a somewhat lower degree of inhibition at 236 μg/mL. P. americana exhibited the highest degree of α-amylase inhibition, with an IC50 value of 312 µg/mL. T. catappa showed the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity, while T. conophorum showed the highest ABTS radical scavenging activity. T. catappa showed the strongest effectiveness in neutralising hydrogen peroxide. In tests using human red blood cells, T. catappa showed the strongest inhibition of RBC hemolysis. While P. americana showed higher concentrations of copper, manganese, potassium, and calcium, T. catappa showed higher magnesium concentrations. T. catappa had considerably higher levels of ash, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates than T. conophorum, which had the highest quantity of crude fibre, according to proximate analysis. Molecular docking experiments have revealed that plant extracts from P. americana, T. conophorum, and T. catappa have substantial binding affinities towards α-glucosidase and amylase. Pseudococaine, M-(1-methylbutyl) phenylmethylcarbamate, o-xylene, and 1-deoxynojirimycin were the four compounds that showed binding affinities that were higher than those of acarbose. Acarbose and nitrate were not as compatible with docking scores as compared to the compounds dimethyl phthalate, pseudococaine, M-(1-Methylbutyl)phenyl methylcarbamate, 2-chloro-3-oxohexanedioic acid, and methyl 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzoate. These results suggest that these plant extracts hold great potential for the creation of therapeutic medications that specifically target oxidative stress-related diseases like diabetes.
40202971	Effects of nitrate supplements on cardiopulmonary fitness at high altitude: A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials.	Nitrate is a dietary intervention commonly used to enhance exercise capacity, including cardiopulmonary fitness, yet its effectiveness has been recently questioned at high altitudes. This meta-analysis systematically evaluates the effects of dietary nitrate supplements on cardiopulmonary fitness at high altitude, as reflected in the biomarker of cardiopulmonary fitness, paving the way for informed dietary strategies.
40202970	An exploratory study of associations between judgement bias, demographic and behavioural characteristics, and detection task performance in medical detection dogs.	Medical detection dogs search for diseases from remote samples (biodetection) and assist patients with chronic conditions (medical alert assistance). There is scarce information on how dogs' decision-making tendencies relate to task performance. This study explored the relationships between medical detection dog demographics, responses in a behavioural test battery, 'optimistic' or 'pessimistic' decisions in a judgement bias task, and their performance in detection tasks. A sample of 58 trainee and trained medical detection dogs were studied in a Go/NoGo spatial judgement bias test. For trainee dogs (n = 39), training outcome (pass/fail) and trainer ratings of behavioural traits; yielding a composite score of ability in detection tasks, were used as markers of task performance. For trained biodetection dogs (n = 27), scent sensitivity and specificity scores derived during training and testing trials were used. Older dogs (p < 0.001), those showing higher 'Confidence' (p = 0.009), 'Food orientation' (p = 0.014) and 'Playfulness' (p = 0.005) in the test battery, and those who made more 'optimistic' decisions in the judgement bias task (p = 0.002), had higher detection task ability scores. For trained dogs, latency to approach ambiguous stimuli was positively correlated with scent specificity levels (n = 25, p = 0.021), suggesting that more 'pessimistic' dogs tended to be more specific. Our findings suggest relationships between behaviour in judgement bias tests and other learning and discrimination tasks, which may reflect underlying individual or personality differences in affective and/or cognitive processes that influence dogs' style of searching and performance ability in medical detection tasks. Future research is needed to explore these associations further and investigate the value of judgement bias tasks in predicting later search performance in medical and other types of search dogs.
40202969	Barriers and limitations to the development of a telemental health service for workers in Peru- A user-centered approach.	Over the past decade, the surge in digital healthcare services has transformed traditional healthcare, requiring multidisciplinary engagement to adapt to the digital realm. The rise of telehealth services, particularly amid COVID-19, has been widely embraced globally, but its implementation in Peru faces unique challenges, including infrastructure issues and economic constraints. Therefore, this research aims to identify the barriers and limitations in developing a telemental health service for screening, evaluation, and timely referral of vulnerable occupational groups.
40202968	High caseload of Scabies amongst Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cases, July 2022 to November 2023.	Scabies is a dermatological parasitic infestation prevalent in many regions worldwide. Classified as a neglected disease by World Health Organization (WHO) since 2017, it is often associated with poor living conditions and overcrowding. Towards the end of 2021, unusual high numbers of scabies cases in outpatient consultations were observed in two Médecins Sans Frontières' (MSF) Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) in Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Here, we aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with scabies consulting the clinics from July 2022-November 2023. A cross-sectional study using routinely collected data from scabies' consultations at two MSF clinics located in camp 14 and 15 (total population 91,241 in 2023) was conducted. We retrospectively analyzed programmatic data of patients of all ages attending outpatient consultations and clinically diagnosed as scabies. Data were extracted from MSF clinical routine monitoring databases and descriptive statistics were reported. During the 16-month period, a total of 178,922 scabies consultations were recorded, amongst whom 57.7% were women and 42.3% men. Children <5 years constituted 20.5% of the cases, age-groups 6-14, 36.6%, and ≥15 years, 42.9%. Camp 15 had the highest number of cases (39.4%), followed by other camps (29.7%), and then camp 14 (24.4%). Most cases were simple scabies (79.5%); one in five were scabies with secondary infection cases. Patients were mainly treated with oral ivermectin (71.2%) and topical permethrin (24.3%); 19.5% of patients also received antibiotics. Our findings indicate that scabies is a significant health concern in the Cox's Bazar refugee camp. This study recorded over 178000 cases in the above period. The scale of this outbreak warrants further actions, including a prevalence survey, quality implementation of mass drug administration, and multidisciplinary interventions related to camps' living conditions such as water and sanitation.
40202967	Optimal waist circumference cut-off points for predicting metabolic syndrome among females of reproductive age in Wakiso district, central Uganda.	Metabolic syndrome (MetS) poses a significant challenge to global public health, due to its strong association with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Waist circumference (WC) is a convenient metric for diagnosing MetS. Our study sought to establish waist circumference cut-off points that predict MetS among females of reproductive age in Wakiso district, central Uganda.The data collected were from a cross-sectional study conducted in Wakiso district, central Uganda, involving 697 randomly selected females aged 15 to 49, between 9th June 2021 and 17th August 2021. Data included MetS components: WC, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose. MetS status was identified based on two or more MetS components excluding WC. ROC analysis established the average optimal WC. The accuracy and performance of the cut-off points were evaluated through sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and the Youden Index. Of the 634 participants who were aged 18-49 years, 51.4% had two or more MetS risk factors. Their average optimal WC threshold was 80.3 cm. Variations in optimal WC thresholds were observed across different age groups: 80.4 cm (18-24 years), 79.9 cm (25-34 years), 85.6 cm (35-44 years), and 91.1 cm (45-49 years) respectively. The area under the ROC curve at the cut point for these age groups ranged from 0.78 to 0.86, indicating good discriminatory capability. The sensitivity ranged from 85% to 97%, specificity from 58% to 88%, and the Youden Index from 0.557 to 0.729. A waist circumference of 80.3 cm was the optimal threshold for identifying metabolic syndrome in females between the ages of 18 and 49 years in the setting. This finding concurs with the guidance set forth by the International Diabetes Federation. Additionally, study participants' WC cut-offs varied, ranging from 79.9 cm to 91.1 cm, depending on their age.
40202966	Deep neural network modeling for brain tumor classification using magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging.	This study is driven by the complex and specialized nature of magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) data processing, particularly within the scope of brain tumor assessments. Traditional methods often involve intricate manual procedures that demand considerable expertise. In response, we investigate the application of deep neural networks directly to raw MRSI data in the time domain. Given the significant health risks associated with brain tumors, the necessity for early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. While conventional MRI techniques encounter limitations in the rapid and precise spatial evaluation of diffuse gliomas, both accuracy and efficiency are often compromised. MRSI presents a promising alternative by providing detailed insights into tissue chemical composition and metabolic changes. Our proposed model, which utilizes deep neural networks, is specifically designed for the analysis and classification of spectral time series data. Trained on a dataset that includes both synthetic and real MRSI data from brain tumor patients, the model aims to distinguish MRSI voxels that indicate pathological conditions from healthy ones. Our findings demonstrate the model's robustness in classifying glioma-related MRSI voxels from those of healthy tissue, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95. Overall, these results highlight the potential of deep learning approaches to harness raw MR data for clinical applications, signaling a transformative impact on diagnostic and prognostic assessments in brain tumor examinations. Ongoing research is focused on validating these approaches across larger datasets, to establish standardized guidelines and enhance their clinical utility.
40202965	Fighting tuberculosis hand in hand: A call to engage communities affected by TB as essential partners in research.	Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease closely intertwined with stigma, discrimination, and the social determinants of health. Communities of people affected by TB are experts in their care pathways, but the TB field continues to fall short of meaningfully engaging communities in TB research. This is a missed opportunity to improve the quality, relevance, person-centeredness, positive impact, and sustainability of TB research outputs. We acknowledge the important progress that has been made to date regarding community engagement in TB, but emphasize persisting barriers to meaningful engagement, and the urgent need for updated and comprehensive TB-specific standards for such engagement in research. We highlight that core components of these standards should include the mobilisation of communities affected by TB, bilateral training in community engagement (for researchers and communities), as well as ensuring appropriate remuneration, representation of priority groups, and the use of non-stigmatising language in the engagement process. In addition, to meaningfully incorporate the experiences and expertise of communities affected by TB, their engagement in the research process should occur as early as possible, ideally before research priorities and directions are set, and the scope of the research should encompass questions and outputs relevant to the community. Further, knowledge-sharing between researchers and the community should be ensured, not only of the research outputs but also regarding the engagement process itself, so that lessons learned can be carried forward. Lastly, the sustainability of community engagement processes (whether within institutions or projects) should be ensured, including through adequate funding for such engagement and the training, community mobilisation and relationship-building that this requires.
40202964	Machine learning approach for the prediction of 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis-associated delirium.	This study aimed to develop models for predicting the 30-day mortality of sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) by multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms. On the whole, a cohort of 3,197 SAD patients were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Among them, a total of 659 (20.61%) patients died following SAD. The patients who died were about 73.00 (62.00, 82.00) years old and mostly male (56.75%). Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to distinguish risk factors. Subsequently, six ML algorithms including artificial neural network (NNET), gradient boosting machine (GBM), adaptive boosting (Ada), random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and logistic regression (LR) were employed to establish models to predict the 30-day mortality of SAD. The performance of models was assessed via both discrimination and calibration by cross-validation with 100 resamples. Overall, 10 independent predictors, including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), anion gap (AG), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), temperature, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), vasopressor, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), base excess (BE), and bicarbonate were identified as independent predictors for the 30-day mortality of SAD. The validation cohort demonstrated that all these six models had relatively favorable differentiation, while among them, the GBM model had the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.845 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.816, 0.874). Furthermore, the calibration curve of these six models was close to the diagonal line in the validation sets. As for decision curve analysis, the predictive models were clinically useful as well. Based on real-world research, we developed ML models to provide personalized predictions of delirium-related mortality in sepsis patients, potentially enabling clinicians to identify high-risk SAD patients more promptly.
40202963	Experiences and perceptions of meals on wheels volunteers in providing nutritional care to older adults: A qualitative evidence synthesis.	In the community, Meals on Wheels (MoW) programmes are instrumental in the delivery of meals to nutritionally vulnerable older adults. This qualitative evidence synthesis aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences among volunteers of MoW services of their role in supporting nutrition care. Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched employing qualitative data collection and analysis methods. Results were synthesized using Thomas and Harden's three step approach for thematic synthesis. Three articles were included and two themes were identified: (1) complexity in coordinating MoW to ensure service delivery, and (2) the MoW volunteers' perception of their role in providing nutrition care was eclipsed by the social element of their role. While MoW is pivotal to support older adults' independence, challenges like staffing, funding constraints, and limited community awareness of the service persist. Volunteers' express positivity but face concerns about time commitment and replacement recruitment. Exploring MoW volunteers' broader roles in food insecurity is imperative to understand and address the complex dynamics of providing nutrition care and support to older adults.
40202962	Assessing the efficacy of frankincense extract as a root canal irrigant against Enterococcus faecalis.	Frankincense resin exhibits antibacterial potential against various microorganisms, but little is available on its effectiveness against dental root canal biofilm. This study aimed to assess its efficacy as a root canal irrigant against Enterococcus faecalis biofilm. A standard E. faecalis strain underwent antibacterial sensitivity testing with frankincense derived from Boswellia sacra Flück and Boswellia frereana Birdw trees. Frankincense, demonstrating inhibition of bacterial growth, was further evaluated as an irrigant. Root canals of 50 single-canalled human teeth were prepared, then contaminated with E. faecalis and placed into three groups: Group A was irrigated with saline (negative control), Group B was irrigated with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), and Group C was irrigated with frankincense. Microbial sampling pre- and post-irrigation was conducted under aseptic conditions. Colony count reduction percentages were calculated, and the data was analyzed using one-way analyses of variance followed by Tukey's post-hoc test (significance level set at 5%). The antibacterial susceptibility test revealed that only Boswellia sacra Flück frankincense was effective against E. faecalis. Both NaClO and frankincense significantly reduced colony counts compared to saline (p <  0.0001), with no difference between frankincense and NaClO irrigation. Therefore, root canal irrigation with B. sacra frankincense proved as effective against E. faecalis biofilm as NaClO. Further exploration of its potential as a root canal irrigant is recommended.
40202961	The impact of civil unrest on child health care: Evidenced by acute medical complications at presentation - A retrospective comparative study.	Civil unrest is a collective term that includes limited political violence, sporadic violent collective action, or nonviolent and mildly violent collective action that causes dissatisfaction over political, economic, or social changes. It had deadly impacts on the lives of children and adolescents. It often results in difficulties for civilian to access basic services including healthcare.
40202960	When all is unequal, the rich get dominant: Inequality leads to expectations of dominant leadership among those high in SES.	People of higher SES have been found to behave more dominantly than people of lower SES. We tested the hypothesis that this difference is exacerbated under conditions of high economic inequality, when the income/wealth difference between those of low and high SES becomes greater. Across four studies (N =  2,739), using both experiments that manipulate perceived inequality (Studies 1a, 1b, and 3) and a correlational study that measures perceived inequality (Study 2), we find evidence that people expect others and themselves to become more dominant if they are of high as opposed to low SES, and this difference is most extreme when economic inequality is perceived to be high.
40202959	Psychometric validation of the Hospital Stress Questionnaire.	Psychological stress experienced by inpatients has been shown to be associated with poorer post-hospital outcomes. Research that explores and intervenes to address in-hospital stress and ameliorate negative patient outcomes requires a valid measurement tool. The Hospital Stress Questionnaire (HSQ) was developed for this purpose. The aims of the current study were to psychometrically validate the HSQ, identify latent factors, reduce the number of items within the HSQ, and explore the psychometric properties of longer and shorter versions of the scale.
40202958	Comprehensive characterization of respiratory genes based on a computational framework in pan-cancer to develop stratified treatment strategies.	Abnormal cellular respiration plays a critical role in carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulation of respiratory gene expression across different cancer types remain unclear. Here, we developed a computational framework that provides an analytical approach for exploring the molecular alterations and clinical relevance of respiratory genes in pan-cancer. We identified a total of 53 gene signatures in the three stages of respiration (including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation) through this framework and found that they were broadly differentially expressed and genetically altered across 33 cancer types. Pathway analysis manifested that the expression levels of almost all respiratory gene signatures were remarkably associated with the activation or inhibition of numerous oncogenic pathways, such as metabolism, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Survival analysis highlighted the oncogenic or tumor suppressor potential of the respiratory gene signatures. In particular, VCAN has shown significant oncogenic features in multiple cancer types. Finally, we identified a number of respiratory gene signatures that could be potential therapeutic targets, including VCAN. We also predicted small-molecule compounds targeting respiratory gene signatures or components of pathways regulated by them. Overall, our comprehensive analysis has greatly enhanced the understanding of molecular alterations of respiratory genes in tumorigenesis and progression, and provided insights into developing new therapeutic strategies.
40202957	Helper NLR immune protein NRC3 evolved to evade inhibition by a cyst nematode virulence effector.	Parasites can counteract host immunity by suppressing nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins that function as immune receptors. We previously showed that a cyst nematode virulence effector SPRYSEC15 (SS15) binds and inhibits oligomerisation of helper NLR proteins in the expanded NRC1/2/3 clade by preventing intramolecular rearrangements required for NRC oligomerisation into an activated resistosome. Here we examined the degree to which NRC proteins from multiple Solanaceae species are sensitive to suppression by SS15 and tested hypotheses about adaptive evolution of the binding interface between the SS15 inhibitor and NRC proteins. Whereas all tested orthologs of NRC2 were inhibited by SS15, some natural variants of NRC1 and NRC3 are insensitive to SS15 suppression. Ancestral sequence reconstruction combined with functional assays revealed that NRC3 transitioned from an ancestral suppressed form to an insensitive one over 19 million years ago. Our analyses revealed the evolutionary trajectory of an NLR immune receptor against a parasite inhibitor, identifying key evolutionary transitions in helper NLRs that counteract this inhibition. This work reveals a distinct type of gene-for-gene interaction between parasite or pathogen immunosuppressors and host immune receptors that contrasts with the coevolution between AVR effectors and immune receptors.
40202956	Modeling the impacts of natural and human factors on the hatching success of the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta along the coasts of Italy.	Coastal biodiversity is globally threatened by climate change and human pressures, including habitat destruction, overfishing, eutrophication, and pollution, which alter natural coastal ecosystem processes. Caretta caretta, hereafter referred to as loggerhead sea turtle, is listed as "Vulnerable" at global level and "Least Concern" in the Mediterranean Sea by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This species is the only sea turtle nesting along Italian coasts, making it crucial to understand the factors affecting its reproductive success for effective conservation strategies. However, key aspects of the ecology and life cycle in Italian waters, such as spatial distribution, reproductive site selection, and factors influencing reproductive outcomes and migratory movements, remain unknown. This study aimed to identify factors influencing the reproductive success of the loggerhead sea turtle. Data from 237 nests between 2019 and 2023 across 14 Italian regions were recovered, quality-checked, and analyzed. A statistical model predicting reproductive success, represented by hatching success, was developed, incorporating various environmental variables from marine and terrestrial spheres, along with local pressures from urbanization and anthropization. These predictors were related to hatching success using a generalized linear model (GLM) accounting for zero-inflated data. The best models identified both environmental variables, such as temperature and extreme wave events, and human-controlled factors, including the presence of dunes and coastal urbanization, as key predictors of hatching success. Coastal anthropization and beachfront disturbances were particularly important. While human activities can pose notable challenges to the loggerhead sea turtle, their identification also offers opportunities for enhancing its reproductive success through targeted management actions focused on mitigating pressures. Our findings highlight the urgent need for targeted conservation efforts to address both local and global challenges to protect and enhance the reproductive success of the loggerhead sea turtle and possibly other coastal species. Effective management can and should focus on mitigating human-induced pressures. Policymakers and conservationists need to work together to implement strategies that consider both the immediate human impacts and the long-term effects of climate change, ensuring the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and the protection of endangered species like the loggerhead sea turtle.
40202955	Trends and disparities in ischemic stroke mortality and location of death in the United States: A comprehensive analysis from 1999-2020.	Stroke remains the fifth leading cause of mortality in the United States, with significant geographical and racial disparities in outcomes. Understanding trends in location of death for ischemic stroke patients is crucial for improving end-of-life care and addressing healthcare inequities.

40202953	Study protocol for a randomized clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of autologous adipose-derived stem cell therapy for ulcers in patients with critical limb ischemia.	Peripheral artery disease (PAD) can develop into critical limb ischemia (CLI), which is characterized by resting pain at rest, ulcerations, or gangrene, with a high risk of amputation. The optimum course of treatment at this point is arterial revascularization, although this has a significant financial cost and is not always feasible or successful in reducing pain, healing ulcers, or preventing amputations. In situations where traditional alternatives for treating PAD have been exhausted, recent developments in cell therapy may offer a viable substitute.
40202952	Can you hear me? Playback experiment highlights detection range differences between commonly used PAM devices: C-POD, F-POD and SoundTrap.	Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a valuable tool for monitoring acoustically active small cetaceans such as the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), with a range of devices commonly used across studies. However, to ensure comparability of findings, there is a need to compare the ability of devices to detect acoustic signals. Using a playback approach, we determined the detection probability and effective detection radius/area (EDR/EDA) for co-deployed C-POD (Cetacean POrpoise Detectors), F-POD (Full waveform capture POD) and SoundTrap acoustic monitoring devices. We conducted playbacks of harbour porpoise recordings across two transects at a range of distances from moored devices, while accounting for a range of variables likely to influence the detection probability of playbacks. Distance from the devices influenced the detection probability across all devices, and a significant difference between transects was also found for the C-POD, possibly due to different ambient noise conditions. The maximum detection distance of the playbacks for the SoundTrap and the F-POD was between 400 - 500m, and EDR was estimated at 297m (EDA 0.276 km2) and 241m (EDA 0.181 km2), respectively. The maximum detection distance for the C-POD was lower, at 300 - 400m, and an EDR of 220m (EDA 0.153 km2). A lower EDR was calculated for harbour porpoise buzzes compared to clicks across devices, due to lower source level of buzzes, suggesting that time spent foraging may be underestimated in PAM studies. The results highlight how detection ranges may differ across commonly used PAM devices, affecting comparability of detection rates across studies. EDR/EDA is an important prerequisite for PAM-derived density and abundance estimates. As such, understanding how devices differ is essential for comparing studies and appropriate planning of long-term acoustic monitoring projects, particularly where estimates of abundance are a key goal.
40202951	Demography, commonly recorded disorders and mortality in chelonia under UK primary veterinary care: A VetCompass study.	Little information has been published on the recorded disorders of pet chelonia. This cohort study aimed to report on demography, commonly recorded disorders and mortality recorded in chelonia under UK primary veterinary care in 2019. Electronic health records on a random sample of chelonia in VetCompass during 2019 were reviewed to extract species, recorded disorder and mortality data. Of 2,040 chelonia reviewed, 1,923 (94.26%) were recorded as tortoises, 74 (3.63%) terrapins and 43 (2.11%) turtles. Of the 811 (42.17%) tortoises with species information recorded, the most common species were Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) (311, 38.35%), Horsfield's tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) (259, 31.94%) and Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoises (154, 18.99%). The most commonly recorded disorders were beak abnormalities (16.72%), overgrown nails (11.47%) and shell abnormalities (9.80%). The most common recorded causes of death were "disorder undiagnosed" (44.55%), dog bite (5.45%) and anorexia (3.96%). Of 178 deaths with age recorded, the median age at death was 7.32 years (IQR 2.50-15.14). Short temporal windows within the clinical records and often limited clinical workups were a frequent limitation to the precision of the recorded disorder terms. This is the largest study of chelonia to date. It has highlighted the most commonly recorded disorders of chelonia of which many are often linked to husbandry.
40202950	Watching sports and happiness among older adults in Japan: The JAGES cohort study.	While watching sports may enhance older adults' happiness, the relationship between sports spectatorship and happiness may vary depending on on-site or TV/Internet. This study examined associations between different forms of sports spectatorship (on-site and TV/Internet) and happiness among older adults in Japan.
40202949	Tuning the Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer in Carbon Dots via Coordination with Metal Ion.	Although carbon dots (CDs) are widely used in the detection of heavy metal ions, rationally designing high-performance CDs for metal ion detection remains a significant challenge due to the limited understanding of their interaction mechanism. Here, we reveal the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) in CDs and provide an effective strategy for switching the ESIPT by coordinating with metal ions. This work demonstrates that Zn<sup>2+</sup> has strong coordination capacity toward CDs, while Mn<sup>2+</sup> has the mildest coordination mode that can effectively sense other metal ions. Reasonable design of CDs with unique responses to heavy metal ions is achieved by doping Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> to regulate the ESIPT process. Therefore, a fluorescent sensor array for the sensitive identification of 10 kinds of heavy metal ions in real samples is constructed, which shows consistent detection results with ICP-OES. This work deepens the understanding of the fundamental fluorescence mechanism of CDs, opens new avenues for the rational tuning the emissive process, and provides a simple yet reliable platform to design nanoprobes for heavy metal ions as well as other molecules.

Coal burst liability is a key influencing factor for the occurrence of impact rock burst disaster. Uniaxial compression tests were conducted on coal bodies with various coal burst liabilities to analyze the dynamic failure characteristics of typical coal bodies, dimension (fractal dimension is a measure to describe the irregular shape of complex body), and acoustic emission (AE) energy characteristics after the coal and rock failure under loading and to investigate the failure characteristics of coal bodies with various coal burst liabilities and their AE response laws. The results show that (1) the stronger the coal burst liability, the more transient and intense the failure, the faster the kinetic energy of the crushed particles, and the more apparent the brittle failure characteristics, (2) the fractal dimension values of the crushed particles of the coal specimens have a positive correlation with coal burst liability; the stronger the coal burst liability of the coal body, the higher the degree of specimen fragmentation, and the larger the fractal dimension value, and (3)the cumulative AE energy of coal bodies with various coal burst liabilities increases significantly and evolves in a "step" pattern before the stress approaches its peak. As the coal burst liability of the coal body changes from zero to strong, the cumulative AE energy experiences a longer calm period, the width of the "step" becomes narrower, and the stored energy of the coal body gradually shifts from phase dissipation to instantaneous release. The correlation between AE parameters and coal burst liability was investigated to provide an experimental basis for AE monitoring and early warning of coal or rock fracture and rock burst.
40202943	Near-source wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, norovirus, influenza virus and RSV across five different sites in the UK.	By tracking infectious diseases through sewage, municipal-scale wastewater surveillance has provided early warnings of future COVID-19 hospitalisations, identified biases in diagnostic testing, and is rapidly expanding to a broader array of pathogens. Despite applications in the targeted delivery of local interventions, near-source wastewater surveillance has received less attention and we know little about the near-source time series dynamics of contrasting pathogens. To address this, we conducted wastewater surveillance at five sites for SARS-CoV-2 and two sites for norovirus GI, norovirus GII, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV A and RSV B). Sites were selected for contrasting functions: an office, charity centre, museum, university, and care home. The key findings are (1) near-source wastewater detections were linked to local events (staff sickness, enhanced cleaning, changing populations); (2) wastewater detections decreased in the order norovirus GII > norovirus GI > SARS-CoV-2 ≈ influenza A ≈ RSV A > influenza B ≈ RSV B; (3) correlation between near-source wastewater data and national surveillance data increases as a function of catchment size and viral prevalence (examples include the SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/BA.5 variant peak at a museum and wastewater tracking the winter norovirus season); (4) strong weekday periodicity in near-source wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detections, with the correlation against COVID-19 case numbers increasing when modelling variable lag times between faecal shedding onset and clinical diagnosis (R2 = 0.45 increases to 0.84-0.86); (5) a log-linear relationship between the frequency of wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detection and log(catchment size⋅viral prevalence) (R2 = 0.6914-0.9066). Finally, we propose two use cases. Firstly, for rare or high-risk pathogens, near-source wastewater sentinel systems provide early warning of outbreaks, achieving high frequency community coverage without behaviour change and at low cost versus diagnostic testing. Secondly, for endemic pathogens, near-source wastewater reveals long-term patterns and trends, the effectiveness of local policies, and community vulnerabilities.
40202942	Trends in malaria prevalence among school-age children in Mainland Tanzania, 2015-2023: A multilevel survey analysis.	In high-transmission areas, school-aged children have higher malaria prevalence and contribute significantly to the transmission reservoir. Malaria infections can be asymptomatic or present with symptoms which may contribute to anaemia, severe illness and fatal malaria. This analysis provides trends of malaria prevalence and associated risk factors among school-aged children in mainland Tanzania. Data for this analysis were obtained from nationwide school malaria surveillance conducted every other year from 2015 to 2023. A total of 307,999 school children aged 5-16 years old from 850 public primary schools were tested for malaria infection using rapid diagnostic tests, assessed for malaria control intervention coverage and other malaria-related parameters. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to assess associated risk factors. Overall malaria prevalence was 21.6% (95%CI: 21.3-22.0) in 2015 which progressively decreased to 11.8% (95%CI: 11.5-12.0 p <0.001) in 2021 with no significant change in the overall malaria risk between 2021 and 2023 (AOR 1.32, CI: 0.92-1.81, p=0.08). School children aged between 9-12 years and 13-16 years had 20% higher risk of malaria (95% CI: 1.15-1.25) and 21% higher risk of malaria (95% CI: 1.16-1.27), respectively, compared to those aged between 5-8 years. Geographically, children from the Lake zone had the highest odds of prevalence (AOR: 18.75; 95% CI: 12.91-27.23) compared to the Central zone, and sleeping under an insecticide-treated net demonstrated a protective effect (AOR=0.68, 95%CI: 0.64-0.72, p < 0.001). There was a significant decline in the prevalence of malaria infection across the study period. We presented a countrywide active surveillance data, collected over time and in different settings which are unique and seldom presented. We believe various stakeholders will use our findings and join force to combat malaria not just in Tanzania but, in all malaria endemic countries.
40202941	Using machine learning and single nucleotide polymorphisms for improving rheumatoid arthritis risk Prediction in postmenopausal women.	Genetic factors contribute to 60-70% of the variability in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, few studies have used genetic variants to predict RA risk. This study aimed to enhance RA risk prediction by leveraging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) through machine-learning algorithms, utilizing Women's Health Initiative data. We developed four predictive models: 1) based on common RA risk factors, 2) model 1 incorporating polygenic risk scores (PRS) with principal components, 3) model 1 and SNPs after feature reduction, and 4) model 1 and SNPs with kernel principal component analysis. Each model was assessed using logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM). Performance metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), and F1-score. The fourth model, integrating SNPs with XGBoost, outperformed all other models. In addition, the XGBoost model that combines genomic data with conventional phenotypic predictors significantly enhanced predictive accuracy, achieving the highest AUC of 0.90 and an F1 score of 0.83. The DeLong test confirmed significant differences in AUC between this model and the others (p-values < 0.0001), particularly highlighting its efficacy in utilizing complex genetic information. These findings emphasize the advantage of combining in-depth genomic data with advanced machine learning for RA risk prediction. The most robust performance of the XGBoost model, which integrated both conventional risk factors and individual SNPs, demonstrates its potential as a tool in personalized medicine for complex diseases like RA. This approach offers a more nuanced and effective RA risk assessment strategy, underscoring the need for further studies to extend broader applications.
40202940	Extracellular vesicle release in an experimental ventilator-induced lung injury porcine model.	Harmful effects of mechanical ventilation with large tidal volumes, volutrauma, may contribute much to diffuse acute lung injury. Extracellular vesicles have been noted in the context of vital organ injury. We hypothesized that extracellular vesicles from acutely injured lung can be found in both lung and blood. In a two-hit experimental porcine model, we tested if extracellular vesicles could be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in plasma over a six-hour period of large tidal volume ventilation after surfactant depletion. After 2 hours of volutrauma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed increased levels of extracellular vesicles containing nucleic acids (stained by SYTO 13) and those positive for both SYTO 13 and HMGB1. No such increase was detected in plasma at any timepoint during the six-hour experiments. This shows that nucleic acid-containing extracellular vesicles appear to be involved in progression of lung injury, possibly indicating cellular damage, but their potential to serve as diagnostic biomarkers of acute lung injury progression, based on plasma sampling, and in the very early phase, is not confirmed by these findings.

40202932	Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) beehives have no impact on honey bee (Apis mellifera) overwintering colony survival or detoxification enzyme expression.	In North America, wooden honey bee hives are most often constructed from pine, but some companies also produce and sell boxes made of western red cedar (Thuja plicata) as a result of its local availability and desirable properties. However, there is debate within the beekeeping community about whether cedar is a safe hive material for bees, since resins within the wood are known to be insecticidal or insect deterrents. There is very little empirical evidence to support or refute these arguments. Here, we recorded health metrics of honey bee nucleus colonies hived in western red cedar and pine boxes (n = 10 each) to determine if the type of wood affects colony outcomes. Colonies were produced and introduced into these boxes in late July, with monitoring continued until the following spring. We found no significant differences in adult bee populations, brood areas, or Varroa mite prevalence among colonies hived in cedar versus pine boxes at either the end of summer (September 1st) or spring (April 1st) assessments. Overwintering survival was identical in the two groups at 90%. Hemolymph detoxification enzyme expression differed strongly between callow (day-old) workers and foragers but did not differ with hive material. Overall, we did not find evidence that hiving honey bee colonies in boxes constructed of western red cedar had any negative or positive effect on bee physiology or colony outcomes.

40202927	Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in an Elderly Patient: A Rare Presentation of Toxic Nodular Goiter.	BACKGROUND Toxic nodular goiter is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in older adults, but its association with acute heart failure is rare. CASE REPORT We present the case of an 87-year-old woman with a history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and multinodular goiter, who experienced worsening heart failure symptoms, including dyspnea and significant bilateral lower limb edema. Initial evaluation revealed elevated NT-proBNP levels, pulmonary edema, and atrial fibrillation, suggestive of acute decompensated heart failure. Thyroid function tests unexpectedly showed elevated free T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, consistent with hyperthyroidism. A Tc-99m thyroid scan confirmed toxic multinodular goiter. Notably, ultrasound evaluation showed that the largest nodule (4 cm) remained stable in size over 6 months and fine needle aspiration indicated a benign lesion, ruling out malignancy. The patient's hyperthyroidism was likely due to the transition of previously non-functioning thyroid nodules into autonomously functioning nodules, possibly influenced by her advanced age and longstanding goiter. Her acute heart failure was exacerbated by hyperthyroidism and pre-existing atrial fibrillation. Treatment included optimized heart failure therapy and carbimazole for hyperthyroidism, resulting in significant clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of considering thyroid dysfunction, including toxic nodular goiter, as a potential cause of acute heart failure exacerbation in elderly patients. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial to improving outcomes in such complex clinical presentations.

40202920	Reduced IgG1 Antibody Left-Twisted Antiparallel β-Sheet Structure Stability Occurs under Metal-Catalyzed Oxidation Conditions in the Presence of Polysorbates.	Polysorbates are common surfactants in monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug products. While polysorbates assist in stabilizing and refolding proteins, oxidative stress conditions can reduce protein stability wherein polysorbate binds to the oxidized and unfolded protein. We investigated the effects of polysorbates on the higher-order structural stability of mAbs under oxidative conditions that may occur during manufacturing, storage, and use. Secondary and tertiary structures of trastuzumab and rituximab products were investigated under two oxidative conditions: metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO; CuSO<sub>4</sub> and ascorbic acid) and 2,2'-azobis (2-aminidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) using either polysorbate-containing formulations or after polysorbate depletion. Higher-order structures were predicted from the collected circular dichroism spectra with an algorithm optimized for β-sheet structural predictions. Secondary structure analyses using circular dichroism at increasing temperatures demonstrated that MCO and AAPH triggered differing β-sheet structure degradation patterns. Rituximab products were more sensitive to MCO compared with trastuzumab products as shown by left-twisted antiparallel β-sheet structure loss and increase in unstructured elements at lower temperatures. AAPH-exposed drugs tended to have distinct unfolding states compared with the MCO-treated drugs as shown by the increase in parallel β-sheet structures for AAPH and decreased parallel β-sheet structures with MCO. Polysorbate depletion transiently improved the stability of MCO-treated material as shown by delayed circular dichroism (CD) signal degradation at 202 nm and improved peak area of the antibody monomer by nonreducing capillary electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate (nrCE-SDS) and peak intensity of intact antibody in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis. The improved stability of detergent-depleted material is traced to improved stability in the predicted left-twisted β-sheet structural elements. Our data further highlights the need for formulation studies that consider the impact of polysorbate binding and/or degradation for specific drug products under stress conditions such as metal-catalyzed oxidation.

40202911	Chemical composition, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities in vitro of the essential oil and crude extracts of the aerial parts of Thymus ciliatus.	This study explores the potential of Thymus ciliatus as a natural source of bioactive compounds by investigating its chemical composition and in vitro biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and anti-Alzheimer properties. The analysis of the essential oil was performed using GC-MS revealing α-terpinenyl acetate (18.74%) and camphor (10.62%) as the major components. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using six methods. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using the disc diffusion and well diffusion techniques. Antidiabetic activity was measured through a colorimetric assay, while anti-Alzheimer activity was evaluated against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The results demonstrated that extracts from polar and medium-polar solvents exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, followed by low-polar solvent extracts. The essential oil of T. ciliatus displayed significant antimicrobial activity particularly against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. Crude extracts also showed antimicrobial activity across all tested strains. The aqueous extract exhibited the strongest antidiabetic activity against α-glucosidase (IC50 = 2.56 ± 0.06 µg/mL), followed by the essential oil (IC50 = 57.11 ± 4.39 µg/mL). Furthermore, the dichloromethane extract demonstrated the highest anti-Alzheimer activity with an IC50 of 0.26 ± 0.20 µg/mL. Based on these results, T. ciliatus represents a promising source of bioactive substances with potential therapeutic applications.

40202909	Core-Shell UCNP@MOF Nanoplatforms for Dual Stimuli-Responsive Doxorubicin Release.	Nanocarrier systems with multifunctional capabilities hold great potential for targeted cancer therapy, particularly for breast cancer treatment. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are notable for their high porosity and, in some cases, biocompatibility, with ZIF-8 being particularly advantageous due to its pH-sensitive degradability, enabling selective drug release in tumor environments. Additionally, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) offer unique optical properties that enhance both imaging and therapeutic applications. In this study, NaYF<sub>4</sub>/Yb<sup>3+</sup>Er<sup>3+</sup> UCNPs were synthesized via a hydrothermal method, subsequently coated with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and encapsulated within a ZIF-8 shell, forming of UCNP@ZIF-8 core-shell nanocomposites. This system was designed to leverage stimulation by a 980 nm laser and acidic pH to facilitate drug release. When exposed to this specific laser wavelength, the nanocomposites demonstrated significantly enhanced drug release, achieving up to 90% release of the incorporated antitumor drug, doxorubicin (DOX), in acidic environments. In vitro studies indicated selective cytotoxicity, with MCF-7 tumor cell viability decreasing from 85.7% to 20% following laser activation, while showing minimal toxicity toward healthy cells. These findings underscore the potential of the UCNP@ZIF-8 nanocarrier system as a pH and laser-responsive platform for improved cancer therapy, enabling precise control over drug delivery while minimizing side effects on surrounding healthy tissues.

Here we demonstrate that an acylaminooxadiazole, MBX-4132, specifically inhibits the <i>trans</i>-translation ribosome rescue pathway to kill <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. Our data demonstrate that MBX-4132 is bactericidal against multiple pathogenic mycobacterial species and kills <i>M. tuberculosis</i> in macrophages. We also show that acylaminooxadiazole activity is antagonized by iron but is potentiated by zinc. Our transcriptomic data reveal dysregulation of multiple metal homeostasis pathways after exposure to MBX-4132. Furthermore, we see differential expression of genes related to zinc sensing and efflux when <i>trans</i>-translation is inhibited. Taken together, these data suggest that there is a link between disturbing intracellular metal levels and acylaminooxadiazole-mediated inhibition of <i>trans</i>-translation. These findings provide an important proof-of-concept that <i>trans</i>-translation is a promising antitubercular drug target.

High-performance polymers are pivotal for a wide range of applications due to their excellent mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. This work introduces, for the first time, a block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly method to modify the surfaces of different high-performance polymers. Using highly ordered poly(styrene-<i>b</i>-ethylene oxide) (PS-<i>b</i>-PEO) thin films as templates, metallic oxide nanopillars (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ag<sub>2</sub>O, MgO, CaO, and TiO<sub>2</sub>) with a 20 nm average diameter were fabricated. These were created on high-performance polymer substrates, specifically, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFPEEK), and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene. This method addresses the low chemical activity of these polymeric substrates, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution to produce their surface functionalization. Characterization via atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy validate the structure and composition of the nanostructured surfaces. The significance of BCP self-assembly is emphasized as an effective and versatile approach for the nanoscale tailoring of surface properties in high-performance polymers. This process offers a straightforward method with low technological and energetic costs, paving the way for the extensive surface modification of large areas. The implications of this work extend to various sectors, including biomedical devices, sensors, and electronics, showcasing the broad applicability of this nanoscale tailoring technique.
40202903	In Vitro Psilocybin Synthesis by Co-Immobilized Enzymes.	Advanced clinical trials investigate the Psilocybe magic mushroom natural product psilocybin as a treatment against major depressive disorder. Currently, synthetic material is used to meet the demand for legitimate pharmaceutical purposes. Here, we report an in vitro approach to biocatalytically produce psilocybin on a solid-phase matrix charged with five covalently bound biosynthetic enzymes. These enzymes include three Psilocybe enzymes: IasA*, an engineered l-tryptophan decarboxylase/aromatic aldehyde synthase, the 4-hydroxytryptamine kinase PsiK and the norbaeocystin methyltransferase PsiM, along with Escherichia coli nucleosidase MtnN and adenine deaminase Ade. In a proof-of-principle experiment, this enzyme-charged resin allowed for quantitative turnover of 4-hydroxy-l-tryptophan into psilocybin. This facile process i) represents a sustainable approach with reusable enzymes, ii) circumvents the drawbacks of in vivo processes while harnessing the selectivity of enzymatic catalysis and iii) helps access an urgently needed drug candidate.
40202902	Exploring the Impact of Chelating Agents on Copper Oxide Layer Formation and Morphology.	The morphological evolution of copper oxide surfaces during anodization was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chronoamperometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as a Cu<sup>2+</sup> chelating agent near the anode slows key mechanistic steps, providing insight into the factors driving the formation of crystalline Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanoneedles. The correlation of chronoamperometric data with SEM images revealed a four-stage process, beginning with the formation of an initial passive oxide layer, followed by nucleation. The comprehensive analysis of experimental results demonstrates that while electrochemical processes are necessary to initiate nanoneedle growth, the subsequent growth mechanism is not driven by direct electrochemical oxidation. Instead, supersaturation of the dissolved copper species near the electrode surface leads to nucleation and growth of Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> nanoneedles. The interaction with EDTA at different concentrations results in various morphologies of copper oxide surfaces, ranging from nanoneedles to disordered porous structures. This unique mechanism of copper oxide formation during anodization enables precise control of the surface properties, offering potential applications in catalysis and various energy technologies, including both production and storage.

40202899	Photocrosslinked gelatin methacryloyl/hyaluronic acid methacryloyl composite hydrogels loaded with bone morphogenetic protein 2-black phosphorus nanosheets for bone regeneration.	Black phosphorus nanosheets (BP) have been widely used in bone tissue engineering due to their superior properties and good biocompatibility, as well as the fact that they are composed of only a single element of phosphorus, which is highly homologous to the inorganic components of natural bone. Hydrogels based on gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)/hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA) composites were prepared by photocrosslinking. The physicochemical properties of the prepared GelMA/HAMA, GelMA/HAMA/BP, GelMA/HAMA/BMP<sub>2</sub> and GelMA/HAMA/BP@BMP<sub>2</sub> hydrogels were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the mechanical properties, swelling rate and degradation rate of the hydrogels were investigated, and the results showed that GelMA/HAMA/BP@BMP<sub>2</sub> possessed good physicochemical and mechanical properties, which were suitable for cell adhesion growth and proliferation. BP as a carrier could ensure the stable and sustained release of the bioactive factor: bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP<sub>2</sub>), which could promote the recruitment and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and its degradation and binding to surrounding calcium ions can promote biomineralization. Therefore, this BMP<sub>2</sub>-modified black phosphorus hydrogel system provides a new strategy for bone regeneration.

Phage-derived depolymerases offer a promising adjunct to conventional antibiotics. However, studies on A. baumannii phage depolymerases have been limited to non-mammalian models. This study investigates the therapeutic efficacy, safety, and potential mechanisms of action of DPO-HL, both as a monotherapy and in combination with polymyxin B, in a murine model of A. baumannii bacteremia.
40202897	Unsupervised 3D Point Cloud Completion via Multi-view Adversarial Learning.	In real-world scenarios, scanned point clouds are often incomplete due to occlusion issues. The tasks of self-supervised and weakly-supervised point cloud completion involve reconstructing missing regions of these incomplete objects without the supervision of complete ground truth. Current methods either rely on multiple views of partial observations for supervision or overlook the intrinsic geometric similarity that can be identified and utilized from the given partial point clouds. In this paper, we propose MAL-UPC, a framework that effectively leverages both region-level and category-specific geometric similarities to complete missing structures. Our MAL-UPC does not require any 3D complete supervision and only necessitates single-view partial observations in the training set. Specifically, we first introduce a Pattern Retrieval Network to retrieve similar position and curvature patterns between the partial input and the predicted shape, then leverage these similarities to densify and refine the reconstructed results. Additionally, we render the reconstructed complete shape into multi-view depth maps and design an adversarial learning module to learn the geometry of the target shape from category-specific single-view depth images of the partial point clouds in the training set. To achieve anisotropic rendering, we design a density-aware radius estimation algorithm to improve the quality of the rendered images. Our MAL-UPC outperforms current state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and even some unpaired approaches. We will make the source code publicly available at https://github.com/ltwu6/malspc.

40202892	Defending Against Neural Network Model Inversion Attacks via Data Poisoning.	Model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat to machine learning models by reconstructing sensitive data from their outputs. While various defenses have been proposed to counteract these attacks, they often come at the cost of the classifier's utility, thus creating a challenging trade-off between privacy protection and model utility. Moreover, most existing defenses require retraining the classifier for enhanced robustness, which is impractical for large-scale, well-established models. This article introduces a novel defense mechanism to better balance privacy and utility, particularly against adversaries who employ a machine learning model (i.e., inversion model) to reconstruct private data. Drawing inspiration from data poisoning attacks, which can compromise the performance of machine learning models, we propose a strategy that leverages data poisoning to contaminate the training data of inversion models, thereby preventing model inversion attacks. Two defense methods are presented. The first, termed label-preserving poisoning attacks for all output vectors (LPA), involves subtle perturbations to all output vectors while preserving their labels. Our findings demonstrate that these minor perturbations, introduced through a data poisoning approach, significantly increase the difficulty of data reconstruction without compromising the utility of the classifier. Subsequently, we introduce a second method, label-flipping poisoning for partial output vectors (LFP), which selectively perturbs a small subset of output vectors and alters their labels during the process. Empirical results indicate that LPA is notably effective, outperforming the current state-of-the-art defenses. Our data poisoning-based defense provides a new retraining-free defense paradigm that preserves the victim classifier's utility.
40202891	Universal Approximation Theorem and Error Bounds for Quantum Neural Networks and Quantum Reservoirs.	Universal approximation theorems are the foundations of classical neural networks, providing theoretical guarantees that the latter are able to approximate maps of interest. Recent results have shown that this can also be achieved in a quantum setting, whereby classical functions can be approximated by parameterized quantum circuits. We provide here precise error bounds for specific classes of functions and extend these results to the interesting new setup of randomized quantum circuits, mimicking classical reservoir neural networks. Our results show in particular that a quantum neural network with ${\mathcal {O}}(\varepsilon ^{-2})$ weights and ${\mathcal {O}} (\lceil \log _{2}(\varepsilon ^{-1})\rceil)$ qubits suffices to achieve approximation error $\varepsilon \gt 0$ when approximating functions with integrable Fourier transforms.
40202890	RBFleX-NAS: Training-Free Neural Architecture Search Using Radial Basis Function Kernel and Hyperparameter Detection.	Neural architecture search (NAS) is an automated technique to design optimal neural network architectures for a specific workload. Conventionally, evaluating candidate networks in NAS involves extensive training, which requires significant time and computational resources. To address this, training-free NAS has been proposed to expedite network evaluation with minimal search time. However, state-of-the-art training-free NAS algorithms struggle to precisely distinguish well-performing networks from poorly performing networks, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions and consequently suboptimal top-one network accuracy. Moreover, they are less effective in activation function exploration. To tackle the challenges, this article proposes RBFleX-NAS, a novel training-free NAS framework that accounts for both activation outputs and input features of the last layer with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. We also present a detection algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters using the obtained activation outputs and input feature maps. We verify the efficacy of RBFleX-NAS over a variety of NAS benchmarks. RBFleX-NAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art training-free NAS methods in terms of top-one accuracy, achieving this with short search time in NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-SSS. In addition, it demonstrates a higher Kendall correlation compared to layer-based training-free NAS algorithms. Furthermore, we propose the neural network activation function benchmark (NAFBee), a new activation design space that extends the activation type to encompass various commonly used functions. In this extended design space, RBFleX-NAS demonstrates its superiority by accurately identifying the best-performing network during activation function search, providing a significant advantage over other NAS algorithms.
40202889	Postoperative Recovery Assessment for Parkinson's Patients via Light-weighted Topological Pose Estimation.	The UPDRS III scale plays a critical role in diagnosing the progression of Parkinson's disease. Current methods often involve doctors guiding patients through specific actions on the scale, recording their performance, and assigning scores. However, this approach has several drawbacks, including the lengthy time required for doctorpatient communication, the high costs of patients traveling to hospitals for follow-up visits, and the reliance on subjective judgments from doctors, which lack standardized criteria. With advancements in artificial intelligence, many traditional processes have been partially automated. To help patients reduce diagnosis time, lower medical costs, and provide more accurate and objective evaluation results, this paper proposes a Transformer-based pose estimation model for assessing UPDRS III scale actions. By integrating skeleton-based evaluations from the network with a series of post-processing operations, the model enables patients to perform self-assessments of their post-treatment recovery at home, saving doctors significant time. This work introduces a cascaded graph self-attention module, SGAM (Spatial-Graphical Attention Module), to enhance the network's understanding of human topology. Additionally, it proposes a lightweight convolutional block, Chi-block, which employs a novel approach leveraging the attribute invariance of filters to interpret model performance and guide compression. This approach reduces computational costs and model parameters while preserving accuracy. The proposed method demonstrates robust performance on human pose estimation (HPE) datasets and showcases impressive lightweight performance on benchmark datasets such as ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-10. These results demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence in enabling automated remote diagnosis and treatment for Parkinson's patients.
40202888	Single-slice Semi-supervised 3D Medical Image Segmentation via Correlation Information Enhancement and Hybrid Pseudo Mask Generation.	Three-dimensional (3D) medical image segmentation typically demands extensive labeled training samples, which is prohibitively time-consuming and requires significant expertise. Although this demand can be mitigated by special learning paradigms such as semi-supervised learning, the cost is still high due to the reader-unfriendly 3D data structure. In this paper, we seek a solution of robust 3D segmentation using extremely simplified annotation that delineates only a single slice per each volume for only a subset of the 3D samples. To this end, we propose two innovative modules: a correlation-enhanced 3D segmentation model (CE-Seg) and a hybrid 3D pseudo mask generator (Hy-Gen). CE-Seg aims to comprehensively understand the 3D targets under super-sparse single-slice supervision by maximizing its ability to mine correlations across slices, spaces and scales. Specifically, CE-Seg mimics the radiologist's interpretation by 'seeing' a dynamically scrolling 3D image to enrich the slice-correlated context. It also introduces a drop-then-restoration self-played task to enhance the spatial correlations of features, and uses a bidirectional cascaded attention to interactively fuse features across different scales. To train CS-Seg, Hy-Gen combines learning-based and learning-free strategies to generate reliable pseudo 3D masks as supervisions. Concretely, Hy-Gen first employs a level-set evolution to 'spread' the single annotation to its neighboring slices as initialization. It then builds a teacher-student framework to progressively refine the initialized 3D mask by dynamically merging the predictions of the CS-Seg's teacher-copy. Extensive experiments on three public and one in-house datasets indicate that our method exceeds eight state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods by at least 3% in dice, and is even on par with the full-supervised counterpart.
40202887	Topological GCN Guided Improved Conformer for Detection of Hip Landmarks from Ultrasound Images.	The B-mode ultrasound based computeraided diagnosis (CAD) has shown its effectiveness for diagnosis of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) in infants within 6 months. Hip landmark detection is a feasible way for the CAD of DDH according to the Graf's method. However, existing landmark detection algorithms mainly focus on designing special models to capture the features from hip ultrasound images, but generally ignore the important spatial relations among different landmarks. To this end, a novel weakly supervised learning-based algorithm, the Topological Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) guided Improved Conformer (TGCN-ICF), is proposed for detecting landmarks from hip ultrasound images. The TGCN-ICF includes two subnetworks: an Improved Conformer (ICF) subnetwork to generate heatmaps and constraint vectors from ultrasound images, and a TGCN subnetwork to additionally explore topological relations among hip landmarks with the guidance of class labels for further refining and improving the detection accuracy. Moreover, a new Mutual Modulation Fusion (MMF) module is developed to fully exchange and fuse the extracted feature information from the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer branches in ICF. Meanwhile, a novel Mutual Supervision Constraint (MSC) strategy is designed to provide a constraint for detection of each hip landmark. The experimental results on two realworld DDH datasets demonstrate that the TGCN-ICF outperforms all the compared algorithms, suggesting its potential applications. The source code is publicly available on https://github.com/Tianxiang-Huang/TGCN-ICF.
40202886	Enhancing Ultrasound Scanning Skills in a Leader-Follower Robotic System through Expert Hand Impedance Regulation.	Traditional breast cancer surgeries require collaboration between ultrasound (US) doctors and surgeons, making the procedure complex and treating physicians prone to fatigue. In leader-follower robotic surgery, a surgeon controls an US robotic arm and an instrument robotic arm with their left and right hands, enabling independent surgical performance. However, the lack of US scanning skills among surgeons, as well as the physical separation in leader-follower operations, can negatively impact both the scanning and surgical outcomes. This paper proposes a robot-assisted scheme based on dynamic arm impedance compensation (IC) that references expert arm stiffness to compensate for novice arm stiffness. The impedance compensator adjusts the compensation strategy according to the scanning area and scanning stage. The impedance force generator estimates the scanning direction via Kalman filtering and applies stiffness and damping forces in the vertical direction to suppress tremors and other involuntary movements. The experimental results revealed that during the coarse and fine scanning phases, the probe position variance decreased by 57.9% and 73.6%, the contact force variance decreased by 55.2% and 42.5%, and the US image confidence increased by 22.0% and 23.8%, respectively. Compared with traditional filtering compensation (FC) schemes, this approach reduces the average position variance and contact force variance by 32.0% and 25.3%, respectively, and increases confidence by 7.3%. In a no-compensation test, the IC training group outperformed the FC group. This scheme can assist leader-follower US scanning and rapidly improve surgical skills.
40202885	Adaptive color Doppler for axial velocity imaging of microvessel networks.	Directional filtering has been applied to distinguish between the ascending and descending flows in functional ultrasound imaging, however, it can lead to incorrect measurement of the flow speed and direction when using the directional filtering-based color Doppler ultrasound velocimetry (iCD_US). Specifically, in cases where the frequency spectrum bandwidth of a unidirectional flow extends into both negative and positive frequency domains, directional filtering may erroneously produce bidirectional velocities. Here, we propose an adaptive color Doppler ultrasound technique (aCD_US), which addresses this issue by analyzing the envelope of the Doppler spectrum and then adaptively using the whole spectrum integration or directional filtering-based approach to estimate the flow velocity. The proposed aCD_US was validated through numerical simulations and phantom experiments under various flow conditions, demonstrating superior performance in estimating axial velocities of unidirectional, bidirectional, and horizontal flows. Notably, numerical simulations showed that aCD_US achieved over 90% directional accuracy and less than 15% velocity deviation at signal-to-noise ratios larger than -1 dB. In vivo experiments on mouse cerebral blood flow further highlighted its advantages, with aCD_US surpassing conventional color Doppler velocimetry and iCD_US in reconstructing axial flow velocity maps. The quantitative comparison between aCD_US and vULM shows a strong overall correlation in their axial velocity measurements, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.760 (p = 0.000). These results demonstrate the advantage of aCD_US in precise microvessel networks velocity quantification and its potential to advance microvascular imaging accuracy in both research and clinical applications.
40202884	Respiratory motion effects and mitigation strategies on boiling histotripsy in porcine liver and kidney.	Boiling histotripsy (BH) is a pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-based method of extracorporeal non-thermal tissue disintegration under real-time ultrasound (US) guidance. Respiratory motion in abdominal targets can affect BH precision and completeness. This study compares two motion mitigation strategies based on pulse/echo US motion tracking: robotic arm-based unidirectional motion compensation by HIFU transducer manipulation and BH pulse gating during expiratory pause. BH ablations were generated in liver and kidney of anesthetized pigs with 2-10ms pulses using 256-element 1.5-MHz HIFU array. A coaxial US imaging probe was used for targeting, tracking skin surface and monitoring real-time bubble activity. The axial (anterior-posterior, AP) displacement of the skin surface was found to be synchronous with liver and kidney motion in both cranio-caudal (CC) and AP directions. BH lesions were produced either with no motion mitigation, or with pulse gating, or with 1D motion compensation. Dimensions of completely fractionated and affected tissue areas were measured histologically. In liver, gating and motion compensation improved fractionation completeness within targeted volumes and reduced off-target tissue damage in AP direction vs no motion mitigation; only gating reduced off-target damage in CC direction. In kidney, gating improved BH completeness in both directions vs no mitigation, but did not affect off-target damage due to lower displacement amplitudes in kidney comparable with gating tolerance limits. In both liver and kidney, gating increased treatment time by 24%. These results suggest that BH pulse gating using US-based AP skin surface tracking is an adequate approach for treating organs with pronounced 3D respiratory motion.
40202883	Large-Scale linguistic Z-Number Belief Rule Base Methodology for Multidimensional and Unreliable Knowledge Representation and Learning.	With excellent interpretability, the fuzzy rule-based method stands as a formidable instrument for knowledge representation and learning. Nowadays, the knowledge representation problem with multidimensional input information is widespread, leading to a large rule base and making it difficult to embed expert knowledge. In addition, human knowledge is not entirely reliable, causing inaccurate reasoning results. In this article, a novel large-scale linguistic Z-number belief rule base (LSLZ-BRB) method is proposed for the above multidimensional and unreliable knowledge representation and learning. Specifically, a multidimensional knowledge mapping representation method under the probabilistic framework is proposed to generate an LSLZ-BRB. It allows experts to embed knowledge via conditional probability and prior probability. To reduce the modeling error caused by uncertainty of knowledge, an online interactive learning mechanism of uncertain knowledge is developed. This mechanism ensures that LSLZ-BRB has high real-time performance and improves the accuracy of knowledge representation. A performance evaluation case for the laser inertial measurement unit (LIMU) and experiments on some public datasets illustrate the implementation process of the proposed method and further verify its effectiveness.
40202882	Consensus of Nonlinear Uncertain Delayed Multiagent Systems Modeled by PDEs via Adaptive Boundary Control.	Under the influence of nonlinearity, time-varying delay, and uncertainty, the consensus problem is concerned in this study for multiagent systems modeled by partial differential equations, which means that both the time and space variables are included in the dynamic behavior of each agent. First, with a directed graph, an adaptive boundary controller is developed under boundary measurements, which can effectively reduce the control cost with dynamic control gains and a few actuators and sensors installed at the boundary of the spatial domain. Then, through the designed adaptive boundary controller, the linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based consensus conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability of the consensus error systems derived by utilizing the inequality techniques and Lyapunov direct approach. Lastly, two numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented adaptive boundary control protocols.
40202881	Dynamic Output Feedback Linear Quadratic Control for CPSs Under Sparse Attacks.	In this article, a linear quadratic (LQ) control based on dynamic output feedback (DOF) strategy is proposed for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) under sparse actuator and sensor attacks. The control scheme is divided into three steps. First, the studied system is transformed into a set of hybrid systems based on all possible attack sets. Second, the DOF LQ (dLQ) control scheme is studied for the case of the correct attack set, including analyzing the impact of the similarity transformation on the cost of the dLQ, determining the optimal explicit form of the similarity transformation, and giving the computational expression for the unique observable saddle point of the dLQ. Finally, two online attack detection mechanisms are proposed: 1) adaptive switching mechanism (ASM) and 2) improved ASM (IASM). The difference between the two mechanisms is that IASM detects attacks faster. The hybrid control scheme combining dLQ control method with each of the two mechanisms ensures the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Distinguishing from the classical data-based optimal control method which calculates the system states online from time to time, the hybrid control scheme proposed in this article only needs to solve for the system states during a time period when the control mode is switched, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are illustrated by two simulation examples, respectively.
40202880	Lung Cancer Screening Classification by Sequential Multi-Instance Learning (SMILE) Framework with Multiple CT Scans.	Lung cancer screening with computed tomography (CT) scans can effectively improve the survival rate through the early detection of lung cancer, which typically identified in the form of pulmonary nodules. Multiple sequential CT images are helpful to determine nodule malignancy and play a significant role to detect lung cancers. It is crucial to develop effective lung cancer classification algorithms to achieve accurate results from multiple images without nodule location annotations, which can free radiologists from the burden of labeling nodule locations before predicting malignancy. In this study, we proposed the sequential multi-instance learning (SMILE) framework to predict high-risk lung cancer patients with multiple CT scans. SMILE included two steps. The first step was nodule instance generation. We employed the nodule detection algorithm with image category transformation to identify nodule instance locations within the entire lung images. The second step was nodule malignancy prediction. Models were supervised by patient-level annotations, without the exact locations of nodules.We embedded multi-instance learning with temporal feature extraction into a fusion framework, which effectively promoted the classification performance. SMILE was evaluated by five-fold cross-validation on a 925-patient dataset (182 malignant, 743 benign). Every patient had three CT scans, of which the interval period was about one year. Experimental results showed the potential of SMILE to free radiologists from labeling nodule locations. The source code will be available at https://github.com/wyzhao27/SMILE.
40202879	Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Visual Foundation Models.	Foundation models have attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, they are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in considerable performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy for both 2D images and 3D volumes, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with embedding consistency learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin-Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volumes. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific foundation models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in dice score for retina vessel segmentation and a +8% increase in IoU for lung tumor detection. Further experiment quantitatively reveals that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.
40202878	The Footropter: A Passive Prosthetic Prescription Tool with Adjustable Forefoot and Hindfoot Stiffness.	Commercially available prosthetic feet are fabricated to have a fixed forefoot and hindfoot stiffness that cannot be changed in a clinical setting. This does not allow for patients to quickly compare multiple prosthetic foot stiffnesses to choose the stiffness they like the most while walking. In this paper, we present the Footropter, a passive prosthetic foot prescription tool that allows Certified Prosthetists (CPs) to rapidly change both the forefoot and hindfoot stiffnesses. The forefoot stiffness is changed by repositioning a spring clamp along a length of unbonded fiberglass layers and the hindfoot stiffness is changed by repositioning a single heel spring support. We introduce the design and working principles, characterize the ranges of available forefoot and hindfoot stiffnesses, and demonstrate the utility of the Footropter through two preference and perception studies with two unilateral transtibial prosthesis users. The Footropter, when paired with a preference optimization algorithm, can enable CPs to integrate patients' experiential input into the clinical prescription process.
40202877	Pluralistic Salient Object Detection.	We introduce pluralistic salient object detection (PSOD), a novel task aimed at generating multiple plausible salient segmentation results for a given input image. Unlike conventional SOD methods that produce a single segmentation mask for salient objects, this new setting recognizes the inherent complexity of real-world images, comprising multiple objects, and the ambiguity in defining salient objects due to different user intentions. To study this task, we present two new SOD datasets "DUTS-MM" and "DUTS-MQ", along with newly designed evaluation metrics. DUTS-MM builds upon the DUTS dataset but enriches the ground-truth mask annotations from three aspects which 1) improves the mask quality especially for boundary and fine-grained structures; 2) alleviates the annotation inconsistency issue; and 3) provides multiple ground-truth masks for images with saliency ambiguity. DUTS-MQ consists of approximately 100K image-mask pairs with human-annotated preference scores, enabling the learning of real human preferences in measuring mask quality. Building upon these two datasets, we propose a simple yet effective pluralistic SOD baseline based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) design. Equipped with two prediction heads, it simultaneously predicts multiple masks using different query prompts and predicts human preference scores for each mask candidate. Extensive experiments and analyses underscore the significance of our proposed datasets and affirm the effectiveness of our PSOD framework.
40202876	Uncertainty Guided Refinement for Fine-Grained Salient Object Detection.	Recently, salient object detection (SOD) methods have achieved impressive performance. However, salient regions predicted by existing methods usually contain unsaturated regions and shadows, which limits the model for reliable fine-grained predictions. To address this, we introduce the uncertainty guidance learning approach to SOD, intended to enhance the model's perception of uncertain regions. Specifically, we design a novel Uncertainty Guided Refinement Attention Network (UGRAN), which incorporates three important components, i.e., the Multilevel Interaction Attention (MIA) module, the Scale Spatial-Consistent Attention (SSCA) module, and the Uncertainty Refinement Attention (URA) module. Unlike conventional methods dedicated to enhancing features, the proposed MIA facilitates the interaction and perception of multilevel features, leveraging the complementary characteristics among multilevel features. Then, through the proposed SSCA, the salient information across diverse scales within the aggregated features can be integrated more comprehensively and integrally. In the subsequent steps, we utilize the uncertainty map generated from the saliency prediction map to enhance the model's perception capability of uncertain regions, generating a highly-saturated fine-grained saliency prediction map. Additionally, we devise an adaptive dynamic partition (ADP) mechanism to minimize the computational overhead of the URA module and improve the utilization of uncertainty guidance. Experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed UGRAN over the state-of-the-art methodologies. Codes will be released at https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/UGRAN.
40202875	Bootstrap Masked Visual Modeling Via Hard Patch Mining.	Masked visual modeling has attracted much attention due to its promising potential in learning generalizable representations. Typical approaches urge models to predict specific contents of masked tokens, which can be intuitively considered as teaching a student (the model) to solve given problems (predicting masked contents). Under such settings, the performance is highly correlated with mask strategies (the difficulty of provided problems). We argue that it is equally important for the model to stand in the shoes of a teacher to produce challenging problems by itself. Intuitively, patches with high values of reconstruction loss can be regarded as hard samples, and masking those hard patches naturally becomes a demanding reconstruction task. To empower the model as a teacher, we propose Hard Patch Mining (U $^{2}$ PL+), predicting patch- wise losses and subsequently determining where to mask. Technically, we introduce an auxiliary loss predictor, which is trained with a relative objective to prevent overfitting to exact loss values. To gradually guide the training procedure, we propose an easy-to-hard mask strategy. Empirically, U $^{2}$ PL+ brings significant improvements under both image and video benchmarks. Interestingly, solely incorporating the extra loss prediction objective leads to better representations, verifying the efficacy of determining where is hard to reconstruct. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/HPM.

This condition is often associated with a high prevalence of pressure ulcers and skin breakdown at the interface between the prosthetic socket and the residual limb. The purpose of this study was to describe a monofilament test method for identifying areas that lack protective sensation in individuals with transtibial amputation (TTA).

40202865	Rehabilitation Following Penetrating Ocular Trauma From Hand Grenade Fragments.	This case study describes the rehabilitation efforts of a 25-year-old male reserve officer who sustained a penetrating intraocular metallic foreign body (IOFB) injury to his right eye during a military conflict. Penetrating ocular trauma can lead to severe tissue deformities, scarring, permanent visual impairment, and long-term complications like intraocular infection and ocular hypotension. The patient's initial presentation revealed vision loss, pain, irritation, a foreign body sensation, and discomfort in the right eye. Diagnostic imaging confirmed a severe globe rupture, including the presence of metallic IOFB in the retina, retinal incarceration, and detachment with severe macular damage, necessitating surgical intervention, including repair of globe rupture, lensectomy, pars plana vitrectomy, IOFB removal, and filling of the vitreous cavity with silicone oil. Despite these surgical measures, visual acuity in the right eye remained hand motion at 15 cm with maintained peripheral vision and traumatic ptosis. A specialized scleral contact lens was fitted. This improved acuity to 6/60 additionally provided a magnifying effect, clinically improving near vision acuity to 6/30. The scleral lens improved the patient's dry eye indices, evidenced by decreased corneal staining and increased margin-to-reflex distance, improving esthetics. This case highlights the potential benefits of a scleral contact lens after severe penetrating eye injuries where even advanced surgical interventions may not fully restore vision. It significantly improved visual function and comfort by alleviating dry eye symptoms and simultaneously provided psychosocial benefits by masking cosmetic imperfections.

40202863	Gas-Phase Ozone Reaction Kinetics of a Series of <i>cis</i>-3-Hexenyl Esters under Simulated Atmospheric Conditions.	This relative kinetic study presents the experimental results obtained from the investigation of the gas-phase ozonolysis of seven biogenic unsaturated hexenyl esters under atmospheric relevant conditions at a temperature of (298 ± 2) K and a total air pressure of (1000 ± 10) mbar. Various <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl esters were selected for the present study since these are ubiquitous biogenic atmospheric constituents emitted by green leaf plants. The series consists of <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl formate (<i>Z</i>3HF), <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl acetate (<i>Z</i>3HAc), <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl isobutyrate (<i>Z</i>3HiB), <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl 3-methylbutanoate (<i>Z</i>3H3MeB), <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl hexanoate (<i>Z</i>3HH), <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl <i>cis</i>-3-hexenoate (<i>Z</i>3HZ3H), and <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl benzoate (<i>Z</i>3HBz). The obtained experimental gas-phase reaction rate coefficients are as follows (in 10<sup>-17</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>): (4.5 ± 0.5) for <i>Z</i>3HF, (5.5 ± 0.6) for <i>Z</i>3HAc, (7.9 ± 0.9) for <i>Z</i>3HiB, (11.9 ± 1.3) for <i>Z</i>3H3MeB, (15.3 ± 1.7) for <i>Z</i>3HH, (22.5 ± 2.5) for <i>Z</i>3HZ3H, and (29.1 ± 3.2) for <i>Z</i>3HBz, respectively. This study provides the first determination of the gas-phase rate coefficients of ozone with <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl isobutyrate, <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl 3-methylbutanoate, <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl hexanoate, <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl <i>cis</i>-3-hexenoate, and <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl benzoate. A comparison of the results with available literature data and structure-activity relationship estimates was performed with emphasis placed on the structural features. The reactivity trend is discussed within this series, and estimates for the photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) index are provided. Also, the atmospheric average lifetime of the investigated <i>cis</i>-3-hexenyl esters, with respect to O<sub>3</sub> reaction, and for comparison purposes also to the OH, NO<sub>3</sub>, and Cl driven processes, were evaluated and provided within this study.
40202862	Massive Transfer and Assembly of Microscale Superlubric Materials.	Structural superlubricity (SSL) offers a revolutionary solution to the challenges of friction and wear. However, current transfer methods for superlubric materials rely on probe-based techniques that are limited to individual, one-by-one transfers. Moreover, the maximum achievable scale of SSL is constrained by the single-crystal size and defect distribution of the material. To enable the mass production of devices and the scaling of SSL contact areas, scalable transfer and assembly techniques are critically needed. Here, we introduce a batch "slide-and-lift" dry transfer technique that leverages the sliding motion of polydimethylsiloxane stamps to modulate adhesion at van der Waals interfaces, enabling the simultaneous transfer of hundreds of sliders. This technique accommodates sliders of various sizes and shapes while ensuring their surfaces remain ultraclean and defect-free. Transferred slider arrays are successfully released onto various substrates, maintaining their superlubric properties. Furthermore, these transferred sliders are assembled to achieve larger-scale SSL through multiphoton polymerization printing, where connected microscale sliders form a basic unit that can theoretically be scaled to any size and shape for SSL applications. Our approach facilitates the development of SSL-based devices and the realization of macroscale SSL. Additionally, it may inspire novel sliding-based transfer methods for two-dimensional materials by leveraging their inherent sliding characteristics.
40202861	Novel Cellobiose 2-Epimerase from Thermal Aquatic Metagenome for the Production of Epilactose.	Epilactose is a prebiotic molecule that exerts a bifidogenic effect and increases calcium and iron absorption in the small intestine. This study identifies a novel cellobiose 2-epimerase gene (<i>ceM</i>) by investigating metagenomic data generated from a thermal aquatic habitat. The computation of secondary and tertiary structure analysis, molecular docking, and MD simulation analysis indicated the protein CE<sub>M</sub> to be a novel cellobiose 2-epimerase. The gene was expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, followed by biochemical characterization of the purified protein. CE<sub>M</sub> is capable of transforming lactose into the high-value rare sugar, epilactose, in a wide range of temperatures (4-70 °C) and pH (6.0-10.0). The enzyme was exposed to 50 °C, and hardly a 10% loss in activity was recorded after 32 h of heat treatment, suggesting that CE<sub>M</sub> is a thermostable protein. CE<sub>M</sub> is a kinetically highly efficient enzyme, with a turnover number of 9832 ± 490 s<sup>-1</sup> for lactose to epilactose epimerization. The maximum conversion yield of 26% epilactose was obtained in 15 min of catalytic reaction. Further, the enzyme was successfully tested to transform lactose in milk and whey samples.

This article responds to inquiries into Gilead's access efforts for low- and lower-middle-income countries and reviews the science behind lenacapavir and its investigational use for HIV prevention, the current state of Gilead's planning for equitable access, and the necessity for partnership to end the HIV epidemic. Clinical trial results are a culmination of years of dedicated science, and they are just the beginning; we look forward to sharing updates as milestones are reached. Gilead is committed to working with scientists, clinicians, communities, advocates, governments, and other stakeholders to achieve broad, sustainable global access to lenacapavir for HIV prevention, if approved. Lenacapavir holds potential for helping to end new HIV infections around the world, a potential that reflects the vision we have at Gilead: to end the HIV epidemic for everyone, everywhere.
40202859	<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> β-hemolysin impairs oxygen transport without causing hemolysis.	<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) infection can lead to the occurrence of hypoxia, however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. β-hemolysin (Hlb) induced hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs) requires a temperature transition from "hot" to "cold," a phenomenon not observed under physiological conditions. In this study, we discovered that RBCs treated with Hlb exhibited a high level of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and underwent a shape transformation from biconcave discoid to spherical, which was contingent upon the degradation of sphingomyelin of the cell membrane and led to impaired oxygen transport. The increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels induced by Hlb was dependent on the activation of the ion channel N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Furthermore, we found that Hlb-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx increased the cytoplasmic pH and subsequently attenuated the oxygen release from RBCs, which were also observed in both <i>hlb</i> transgenic mice and a murine model with <i>S. aureus</i> challenge. Our findings reveal a novel role for Hlb as sphingomyelinase in impairing RBC function under non-lytic conditions, shedding light on the mechanism behind hypoxia associated with <i>S. aureus</i> infection.
40202858	Switchable and Stereospecific <i>C-</i>Glycosylation Strategy via Formal Functional Group Deletion.	Carbohydrates constitute an important class of biologically relevant natural products. Among the synthetic glycomimetics, <i>C-</i>glycosides are particularly interesting due to their chemical and metabolic stability toward acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis at the anomeric position. The stereochemical outcomes of traditional methodologies to access <i>C-</i>glycosides rely heavily on substrate control. Herein, we report a novel synthetic strategy to access diverse <i>C-</i>glycosides with precise stereochemical control at the anomeric position via formal functional group deletion, where both α- and β-anomers of furanoses and pyranoses can be obtained as single stereoisomers. Additionally, the broad scope of heterocyclic <i>C</i>-glycosides obtained via this strategy further illustrates its potential for empowering future application in both chemical biology research and drug discovery.
40202857	Management of Levonorgestrel and Etonogestrel Adsorption to Polypropylene During in Vitro Release from Long-Acting Release Dosage Forms.	Adsorption of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to various surfaces of labware can skew data during drug development. We observed substantial loss of two clinically significant hydrophobic contraceptive steroids, levonorgestrel (LNG) and etonogestrel (ENG), during in vitro release evaluation from poly(lactic-<i>co</i>-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres and microneedles, leading to incomplete drug recovery. Our investigation identified the adsorption of these APIs to polypropylene (PP) as a key factor adversely affecting both the drug loss and sensitivity/linearity of ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-ultraviolet (UV) assays during in vitro release tests. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS plasma assays showed improved accuracy and reduced variability when calibration curves were prepared in glass vials instead of in PP vials. Adsorption was also observed in simple PP pipet tips in standard aqueous solutions. To address the adsorption and mass loss, we found that adding acetonitrile to samples after they were collected from glass in vitro release vessels effectively mitigated mass loss. The presence of plasticizers, such as diisononyl adipate found in common porous nylon bags used to contain PLGA dosage forms, was shown to reduce LNG/ENG adsorption to PP. In addition, atomic force microscopy provided experimental characterization of the drug solution-PP/glass interface, showing a higher surface area of the PP surface from nanostructures and an increase in adhesion force with LNG molecules. A thorough understanding and mitigation of API adsorption, including selection of appropriate apparatus materials and considering the possible role of contamination from plasticizers and other leachables, are important for the accurate development of analytical assays supporting pharmaceutical development of long-acting contraceptives.

40202855	AI in Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: Review.	Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality worldwide. Early detection and risk stratification are critical for timely intervention to prevent severe complications such as eclampsia, stroke, and preterm delivery. However, traditional clinical methods often lack the precision needed to identify high-risk individuals effectively. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool, leveraging complex data to enhance prediction, diagnosis, and clinical decision-making in HDP. This review aims to systematically evaluate ML applications in HDP, highlighting trends, methodologies, and gaps to guide future research and improve maternal and fetal outcomes.
40202854	Smoking Cessation Screening and Treatment Among Veterans With Multiple Sclerosis.	Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States and disproportionately affects veterans. While smoking cessation is the goal for all veterans, it is especially critical for veterans with multiple sclerosis (MS; VwMS), for whom smoking is more detrimental to health and function. Smoking is associated with more MS relapses/flares, greater disability, faster disease progression, and earlier MS-related death. This quality improvement project aims to describe current practice pathways for screening and treating smoking cessation in VwMS and explore whether these differ by sociodemographic factors.

Sexual and/or gender minoritized (SGM) people are more likely to smoke if they live where SGM stigma is high, and existing SGM-tailored cessation interventions do not address unique challenges of these environments. This paper reports outcomes from a single-arm pilot trial of an Empowerment Theory-based smoking cessation intervention for SGM people living in high-stigma environments.

A dolutegravir plus darunavir/cobicistat regimen has been used as a simplified option in heavily treatment-experienced people with HIV (PWH). We report on long-term results of this regimen as assessed by treatment discontinuation (TD) for any reason.
40202850	The Need for Lenacapavir Compulsory Licences in Ending the HIV Epidemic.	In total, 1.3 million people acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 2023, well behind the UNAIDS goal of <370 000 infections by 2025. Novel 6-monthly injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication lenacapavir is highly efficacious and could be epidemic-changing. However, without equitable access infection rates will continue. Gilead Sciences, the originator, currently charges over $40 000 per person-year for lenacapavir as HIV treatment, far exceeding PrEP cost-effectiveness thresholds, even in the richest countries. Yet the projected cost of production at scale is <$100 per person-year. Gilead's new voluntary license for lenacapavir prevention and treatment undermines access. Middle-income countries with fast-growing HIV epidemics have been excluded; 23% of new HIV infections occur in these countries. A coordinated response from governments, donors, civil society, and the private sector including Gilead is urgently required to ensure lenacapavir access is wide enough to eliminate HIV transmission worldwide. Unless crucial changes to the current license are made, compulsory licences may be required.

40202836	Hsp70 chaperones, Ssa1 and Ssa2, limit poly(A) binding protein aggregation.	Molecular chaperones play a central role in maintaining protein homeostasis. The highly conserved Hsp70 family of chaperones have major functions in folding of nascent peptides, protein refolding, and protein aggregate disassembly. In yeast, loss of two Hsp70 proteins, Ssa1 and Ssa2, is associated with decreased cellular growth and shortened lifespan. While heterologous or mutant temperature sensitive proteins form anomalous large cytoplasmic inclusions in <i>ssa1Δssa2Δ</i> strains, it is unclear how endogenous wildtype proteins behave and are regulated in the presence of limiting Hsp70s. Using the wildtype yeast Poly A binding protein (Pab1), which is involved in mRNA binding and forms stress granules (SGs) upon heat shock, Pab1 forms large inclusions in approximately half of <i>ssa1Δssa2Δ</i> cells in the absence of stress. Overexpression of Ssa1, Hsp104, and Sis1 almost completely limits the formation of these large inclusions in <i>ssa1Δssa2Δ</i>, suggesting that excess Ssa1, Hsp104 and Sis1 can each compensate for the lower levels of Ssa proteins. Upon heat shock, SGs also form in cells whether large Pab1 inclusions are present or not. Surprisingly, cells containing only SGs disassemble faster than wildtype, whereas cells with both large inclusions disassemble slower albeit completely. We suspect that disassembly of these large inclusions is linked to the elevated heat shock response and elevated Hsp104 and Sis1 levels in <i>ssa1Δssa2Δ</i> strains. We also observed that wildtype cultures grown to saturation also form large Pab1-GFP inclusions. These inclusions can be partially rescued by overexpression of Ssa1. Taken together, our data suggests that Hsp70 not only plays a role in limiting unwanted protein aggregation in normal cells, but as cells age, the depletion of active Hsp70 possibly underlies the age-related aggregation of endogenous proteins.

40202833	Cell Confluency Affects p53 Dynamics in Response to DNA Damage.	The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a key role in the cellular response to DNA damage. In response to DNA double strand breaks (DSB), cultured cells exhibit oscillations of p53 levels, which impact gene expression and cell fate. The dynamics of p53 <i>in-vivo</i> have only been studied in fixed tissues or using reporters for p53's transcriptional activity. Here we established breast tumors expressing a fluorescent reporter for p53 levels and employed intravital imaging to quantify its dynamics in response to DSB <i>in-vivo</i>. Our findings revealed large heterogeneity among individual cells, with most cells exhibiting a single prolonged pulse. We then tested how p53 dynamics might change under high cell confluency, one factor that differs between cell culture and tissues. We revealed that highly confluent cultured breast cancer cells also show one broad p53 pulse instead of oscillations. Through mathematical modeling, sensitivity analysis and live cell imaging we identified low levels of the phosphatase Wip1, a transcriptional target and negative regulator of p53, as a key contributor to these dynamics. Since high cell confluency better reflects the microenvironment of tissues, the impact of cell confluency on p53 dynamics may have important consequences for cancerous tissues responding to DNA damage inducing therapies.
40202832	A morphology and secretome map of pyroptosis.	Pyroptosis represents one type of Programmed Cell Death (PCD). It is a form of inflammatory cell death that is canonically defined by caspase-1 cleavage and Gasdermin-mediated membrane pore formation. Caspase-1 initiates the inflammatory response (through IL-1β processing), and the N-terminal cleaved fragment of Gasdermin D polymerizes at the cell periphery forming pores to secrete pro-inflammatory markers. Cell morphology also changes in pyroptosis, with nuclear condensation and membrane rupture. However, recent research challenges canon, revealing a more complex secretome and morphological response in pyroptosis, including overlapping molecular characterization with other forms of cell death, such as apoptosis. Here, we take a multimodal, systems biology approach to characterize pyroptosis. We treated human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) with 36 different combinations of stimuli to induce pyroptosis or apoptosis. We applied both secretome profiling (nELISA) and high-content fluorescence microscopy (Cell Painting). To differentiate apoptotic, pyroptotic and control cells, we used canonical secretome markers and modified our Cell Painting assay to mark the N-terminus of Gasdermin-D. We trained hundreds of machine learning (ML) models to reveal intricate morphology signatures of pyroptosis that implicate changes across many different organelles and predict levels of many pro-inflammatory markers. Overall, our analysis provides a detailed map of pyroptosis which includes overlapping and distinct connections with apoptosis revealed through a mechanistic link between cell morphology and cell secretome.

Consequently, it shows promise as a model system for investigating mechanisms of cell adaptation to different environments and the regulation of cell shape. Here, we build upon the current toolkit for working with <i>A. pullulans</i> and design and test 25 vectors with seven different codon-optimized fluorophores and three selection cassettes. This includes vectors that allow for dual expression of GFP and mCherry tagged proteins at the <i>URA3</i> locus and vectors that enable homology-based deletion or C-terminal tagging of endogenous genes without the need for cloning. This versatile vector series for working with <i>A. pullulans</i> will enable a broad range of experiments in this emerging model system.
40202828	Intensification of Ethylene Carbonate synthesis via Microwave-Induced Phase Change Cycles (PCCs).	This study reports for the first time on the application of microwave (MW) heating under ambient pressure reflux conditions to intensify the transesterification reaction of ethylene glycol (EG) with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) for the synthesis of ethylene carbonate (EC), a relevant industrial compound for polycarbonate products, lubricants and li-ion batteries. Conventional heating (CH) methods often require high-temperature autoclave systems to achieve elevated temperatures and suppress vaporization of the reactant DMC (bp ~90°C). However, these systems usually entail extended reaction times and significant process cost. We demonstrate that application of the MW-assisted reflux technique to the aforementioned transesterification reaction intensified the energy transfer rate to the reactor by leveraging on the polarity of the reactive mixture, and enhanced phase transition of the lowest boiling point by-product (MeOH), thereby achieving 81% EC yield in half the time required under CH reflux conditions to reach only 52% EC yield. Further, compared to CH, MW heating enables 20-fold lower catalyst loading for comparable EC yields, 9-fold decrease in energy consumption per mole EC and 92% reduction in energy consumption during the mixture preheating stage.
40202827	Hotspots of escape: Oxidative niches prime tumor cell dissemination.	The balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses plays a critical role in tumor development, progression, and response to therapy. However, the detection of ROS in vivo remains technically challenging. In a recent Nature Cell Biology publication, Ueda and colleagues developed a tool to help address this: T-AP1, a tumor-targeted probe that tracks extracellular H2O2 and allows for detection of ROS in vivo. The authors used T-AP1 to identify H2O2-rich zones within tumors, offering new insights into the spatial dynamics of oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. The authors show that tumor budding acts as a defense mechanism against oxidative stress in H2O2-rich regions established by neutrophils. Cancer cells exposed to H2O2 activate p38-MYC and contribute to a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition that facilitates their physical escape from H2O2-rich regions. This defense mechanism is absent in tumors with NRF2 hyperactivation and in normal epithelial cells. This work further emphasizes the need for additional studies to clarify how ROS affects each stage of metastasis across different cancer types, and points to the potential of T-AP1 to be used as a novel tool to reveal distinct redox dynamics at each step.
40202826	"There's a lot that's different, but it's still me": exploring podcast narratives of emotional adjustment after encephalitis.	Encephalitis can lead to acquired brain injury (ABI) with neuropsychiatric consequences. Emotional adjustment is important for ensuring positive, long-term outcomes. The transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (T-CBT) model offers a way of understanding adjustment post-encephalitis but has not yet been tested. We qualitatively assessed whether the T-CBT model accurately captured recovery experiences post-encephalitis and whether experiences differed between infectious and autoimmune encephalitis.
40202825	From Fat Providers to Cancer Therapy: Adipocytes as Unexpected Allies.	Adipocytes from white adipose tissue support cancer progression by supplying fatty acids to tumor cells while cold-activated brown adipose tissue has been shown to inhibit tumor growth by disrupting cancer cell metabolism. In a groundbreaking study published in Nature Biotechnology, Nguyen and colleagues developed Adipose-Modified Therapy (AMT), a strategy that genetically reprograms white adipocytes to outcompete tumors for key nutrients. Using CRISPR activation technology, researchers enhanced adipocyte glucose and fatty acid consumption, by inducing a stable browning phenotype. In vitro, browned adipocytes reduced glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in cancer cells, inhibiting their proliferation. Implantation of engineered adipose organoids adjacent to tumors suppressed tumor growth, reduced angiogenesis, and altered metabolic gene expression in xenograft models. AMT also prevented tumor development in genetic mouse models of cancer, suggesting a role in cancer prevention. Finally, modified human mammary adipocytes inhibited the growth of patient-derived breast cancer organoids. This therapy, based on autologous fat transplantation, could offer a reversible and patient-specific approach. Challenges remain, including metabolic plasticity in cancer cells and the fragility of mature adipocytes in cell culture. AMT represents a paradigm shift in cancer therapy, leveraging adipocytes as metabolic competitors rather than tumor facilitators, opening new avenues for metabolism-targeted cancer treatments.
40202824	The influence of knee varus deformity on the kinetic and kinematic characteristics of musculoskeletal models during gait.	An inherent shortcoming of generic musculoskeletal models is their inability to accurately model deformed musculoskeletal system, while generating fully personalized models are time and money consuming. To address this, we created a MATLAB tool that modifies OpenSim generic models, producing semi-personalized models. A subject with varus deformity participated in our study and her associated semi-personalized model was created. The semi-personalized model significantly decreased marker error during Inverse Kinematics (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Notably, hip abduction/adduction ROM increased by 4.87 degrees on average, muscle activation in TFL rose by 53%, and Gracilis activation dropped by 4% in the semi-personalized model. Overall, semi-personalized models enhance accuracy for higher musculoskeletal analyses.
40202822	The Influence of a Rat Model of Depression and Gastric Ulcer on the Pharmacokinetics of Encorafenib.	Encorafenib is used to treat melanoma and colorectal tumors. Depression and gastric ulcer conditions can impact various physiological processes, including drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. This study investigated the effect of a rat model of depression and gastric ulcers on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of encorafenib using the developed LC-QqQ-MS method. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression and the indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer model were utilized to investigate the effect of depression and gastric ulcers on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered encorafenib. The focus was on parameters such as maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), mean residence time (MRT), volume of distribution (V<sub>d</sub>), area under the curve (AUC), and apparent clearance (CL/F). Rats with depression exhibited a significant increase in maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>). In contrast, depression led to decreased t<sub>1/2</sub> and MRT, implying alterations in the drug's absorption and clearance. On the one hand, rats with gastric ulcers displayed a significant decrease in C<sub>max</sub>, coupled with an extended time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>), prolonged t<sub>1/2</sub>, MRT, and increased volume of distribution (Vd) of encorafenib. This preclinical study demonstrates that depression and gastric ulcers significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib. These findings emphasize the importance of considering these disease conditions when designing encorafenib dosing regimens for optimal therapeutic outcomes in cancer patients.
40202821	Inducible FAK Loss but not FAK Inhibition in Endothelial Cells of PYK2-null Mice Activates p53 Tumor Suppressor to Prevent Tumor Growth.	Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the related tyrosine kinase PYK2 are signaling and scaffolding proteins in co-expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) that regulate blood vessel function and tumor growth. As FAK-PYK2 share overlapping cellular roles, we generated PYK2<sup>-/-</sup> FAK<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with tamoxifen-inducible EC-specific Cre expression. EC-specific FAK inactivation in PYK2<sup>-/-</sup> but not PYK2<sup>+/+</sup> mice led to increased heart and lung mass, vascular leakage, and created a tumor microenvironment that was repressive to syngeneic melanoma, breast, and lung carcinoma implanted tumor growth. Tumor suppression was associated with defective vessel sprouting, enhanced p53 tumor suppressor and p21CIP1 protein expression in ECs, elevated markers of DNA damage, and altered blood cytokine levels in tumor-bearing mice. However, EC-specific hemizygous kinase-defective (KD) FAK expression in EC FAK<sup>-/KD</sup> PYK2<sup>-/-</sup> mice was not associated with elevated p53 levels. Instead, EC FAK<sup>-/KD</sup> PYK2<sup>-/-</sup> mice supported primary tumor growth but prevented metastasis, implicating EC FAK activity in tumor spread. <i>In vitro</i>, combined genetic or small molecule FAK-PYK2 knockdown in ECs or tumor cells elevated p21CIP1 and prevented cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner, highlighting a linkage between EC FAK-PYK2 loss and p53 activation in tumor regulation.
40202820	Highlighting Charge Redistribution Phenomenon in Mn-Based Prussian Blue Analogues for Enhancing Redox Stability.	The development of sodium-ion batteries is increasingly critical due to the limited availability and rising cost of lithium resources, positioning a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Conventional Mn-based cathode materials often suffer from the strong Jahn-Teller effect of Mn<sup>III</sup>, leading to structural instability and capacity fading. Herein, it is demonstrated that activating charge redistribution between adjacent transition metals in Mn-based Prussian blue analogues, driven by tuning electronic conductivity, plays a crucial role in mitigating the Jahn-Teller effect. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the electronic interaction between Mn and Fe under charge redistribution by demonstrating their complementary redox behavior. Computational analysis attributes this charge redistribution to the structural framework of Prussian blue analogues, where the energy barrier for charge transfer across FeCNMn bonds is modulated by electrode-level conductivity. This strategy demonstrates the enhanced cycle stability by mitigating Jahn-Teller effect while effectively maintains Mn redox activity beyond the trivalent state. Consequently, this presents a distinct advantage in terms of energy density, and these findings suggest that with optimized electronic conductivity, Mn-based Prussian blue analogues can be positioned as promising cathode materials for next-generation sodium-ion batteries with high energy density and enhanced cycling performance.
40202819	Genetic epilepsies with myoclonic seizures: Mechanisms and syndromes.	Genetic epilepsy with myoclonic seizures encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of conditions, ranging from benign and self-limiting forms to severe, progressive disorders. While their causes are diverse, a significant proportion stems from genetic abnormalities. Advances in genetic research over the past decade have uncovered novel mechanisms underlying these disorders, including single-gene mutations, copy number variations (CNVs), and non-coding repeat expansions. These findings not only deepen our understanding of their pathophysiology but also highlight potential avenues for precision medicine. This review provides a comprehensive overview of myoclonic epilepsies linked to pathogenic gene variants, exploring genetic mechanisms and discussing their clinical implications. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In this work, we describe genetic epilepsies mainly characterized by myoclonic seizures, their genetic defects and disease mechanisms, and considerations of precision medicine treatment.
40202818	Chronic Stress Stimulates Protumor Macrophage Polarization to Propel Lung Cancer Progression.	Chronic psychological stress is often associated with manifestations of malignant diseases. Identification of modulators regulating the interaction between stress and tumorigenesis could provide potential strategies to ameliorate cancer progression. Here, we observed that chronic stress markedly promoted lung cancer progression. Analysis of the landscape of lncRNA expression indicated that lncRNA HIF1A-AS3 was upregulated in the stressed group and in lung cancer specimens compared to normal tissues. HIF1A-AS3 promoted proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HIF1A-AS3 translationally activated HIF-1α via direct interaction with YBX1, stimulating downstream signaling cascades. HIF-1α inversely stimulated HIF1A-AS3 transcription by directly binding to its promoter region. Investigation of the immune microenvironment revealed that macrophage depletion could efficiently abolish the tumor promoting effects of chronic stress. Both chronic stress and HIF1A-AS3 overexpression induced M2-like macrophage polarization in tumor tissues in mice. Conditioned medium from HIF1A-AS3 overexpressing lung cancer cells enhanced the mobility and phagocytic activity of human and murine macrophages. Targeting HIF1A-AS3/HIF-1α signaling, which was aberrantly upregulated in human lung cancer specimens and predictive of poor prognosis, counteracted chronic stress-induced lung cancer progression in vivo. In conclusion, the HIF1A-AS3/HIF-1α positive feedback loop mediates chronic stress-induced lung cancer growth through functional reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages, suggesting that this axis may serve as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target for patients with lung cancer suffering from psychological stress.
40202817	Sociocultural determinants of mental health among male sexual trauma survivors.	Male sexual trauma survivors are understudied compared to their female counterparts despite having a high risk for mental health difficulties. This study aimed to use structural equation modeling to examine the unique influences of sociocultural factors, specifically masculinity facets and negative social reactions upon disclosing sexual trauma, on internalizing symptoms among male sexual trauma survivors. We hypothesized that self-reliance, emotional control, and negative social reactions would directly predict internalizing symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and generalized anxiety and that indirect effects through self-blame would also be significant. We also performed exploratory analyses to examine other facets of masculinity and their associations with internalizing symptoms. Prolific was used to recruit a final sample of 205 cisgender men who experienced sexual trauma. Results indicated that, as predicted, self-blame, negative social reactions to trauma disclosure, and self-reliance were significantly associated with worse internalizing symptoms, βs = .23-.41, p < .001-p = .002; however, contrary to our hypotheses, no direct effects were observed for emotional control. As hypothesized, indirect effects were found such that self-blame partially explained associations between internalizing symptoms and both self-reliance and negative social reactions to sexual trauma disclosure, βs = .05-.06; ps = .021-035. Exploratory analyses of other facets of masculinity revealed that power over women, β = -.31, p = .016, was associated with lower internalizing symptoms, and winning was associated with higher internalizing symptoms, β = .21, p = .015. The findings from this study can be used to inform therapeutic interventions for this vulnerable, understudied population.
40202816	Acute effects of a physically constraining tool on different phases of tennis serve technique.	The purpose of this study was to compare upper-body kinematics of tennis players when modifying their grip position using a physically constraining tool during the tennis serve. Thirty right-handed tennis players performed serves using two grip position variations (preferred [Continental], grip-constrained [Precision-continental]) across two directions (Deuce, Advantage). Upper limb and racket trajectory data were captured with 60 reflective skin-attached markers using a 22-camera Vicon motion capture system (240 hz). Shot accuracy and racket kinematics were similar; however, the peak horizontal racket velocity was greater in the deuce condition. Significant main effects were observed at the dominant shoulder across grip type and shot direction, while grip-constrained serves featured increased elbow pronation and wrist ulnar deviation during the preparation and propulsion-acceleration phases. During the preparation phase, significant interactions between grip type and shot direction occurred for grip angle (17-40% of the phase) and elbow pronation/supination (0-5%, 65-77%), where the grip-constrained condition featured increased counterclockwise rotation (grip angle) and supination of ~ 3°. Using a physically constraining tool for acute grip modification appears to influence upper limb kinematics, with the magnitude possibly being serving direction-dependent.
40202815	Boron cluster leveraged polymeric building blocks.	Boron cluster compounds (BCCs) are inorganic molecules characterized by their unique physical and chemical properties. Polymeric materials incorporating BCCs exhibit significant chemical and thermal stability, making them valuable for applications in biomedical fields, energy storage, ultrahigh stability materials, and π-conjugated luminochromic polymers. This review article aims to explore the primary methods for integrating these distinctive clusters into traditional carbon-based polymers. Both boron and carbon atoms possess catenation abilities, enabling the formation of extensive macromolecular structures. While carbon forms long linear chains, boron typically leads to three-dimensional polyhedral clusters. We first examine hybrid nanostructures, focusing on weak non-covalent interactions such as dihydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and chaotropic effects between boron clusters and polymer chains. We then discuss classical chemical bonding approaches. Despite their inorganic nature, boron clusters can undergo exoskeletal substitution akin to organic counterparts, allowing their attachment as side groups to polymer repeating units. Additionally, polyhedral boron clusters can be incorporated into polymer backbones primarily through polycondensation reactions, resulting in hybrid macromolecules with exceptional physical and chemical attributes. Finally, we summarize the applications of BCC-containing polymeric materials, including their use in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for metal ion batteries, and as electron acceptor groups in stimuli-responsive luminescent materials. In summary, BCC-containing polymeric materials are increasingly considered viable alternatives to traditional hydrocarbon-based polymers for biomedical applications, ion-conducting materials, luminescent materials, and temperature-resistant materials.
40202814	Effect of different solvents on bioactive phenolics and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and <i>α</i>-glucosidase inhibition activities of <i>Barringtonia acutangula</i> Gaertn. flower extracts.	<i>Barringtonia acutangula</i> Gaertn. is a well-known vegetable and medicinal plant. This study assessed solvents' effect on phytochemical contents and bioactivities of flower extracts. High-polar extracts (ethanol, aqueous) demonstrated much higher phenolic contents (132.21, 240.83 mg gallic acid equivalent per gram of extract, respectively) than non-/medium-polar extracts, with more impressive flavonoid/saponin contents. Aqueous extract was highlighted for antioxidant activity and <i>α</i>-glucosidase inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> = 35.01, 5.63 μg/mL, respectively) on which HPLC analysis revealed gallic acid (<b>1</b>), pyrogallol (<b>2</b>), ilexsaponin A1 (<b>3</b>) as major compounds for 1.83, 1.26, 0.15%, respectively. Phenolics <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> displayed strong <i>α</i>-glucosidase inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> 6.6 - 18.7 μM), consolidated by molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations, based on their stable complexes with <i>α</i>-glucosidase protein (MAL32) <i>via</i> H-bonds of hydroxy phenol moieties, which was more effective in <b>2</b>. The study suggested the potency of <i>B. acutangula</i> flower water extract and its phenolics, displaying the need for in-depth investigation.
40202813	Antibody-Recruiting Surfaces Using Adaptive Multicomponent Supramolecular Copolymers.	Multicomponent structures that mediate the clustering of antibodies on cancer cell surfaces are an attractive strategy to unleash innate immune killing mechanisms. However, covalent multifunctional scaffolds that combine cell surface anchoring and antibody binding can be challenging to synthesize and lack adaptability. Here, we present a dynamic multicomponent supramolecular system displaying both antibody- and cell surface-binding motifs, without covalent linkage between them. Supramolecular monomers based on benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (<b>BTA-(OH)</b><sub>3</sub>) were functionalized with benzoxaborole (Ba) for surface anchoring (<b>BTA-Ba</b>) or dinitrophenyl (DNP) for antibody binding (<b>BTA-DNP</b><sub><b>1/3</b></sub>). The multicomponent fibers comprising <b>BTA-(OH)</b><sub><b>3</b></sub>, <b>BTA</b>-<b>Ba</b>, and <b>BTA-DNP</b><sub><b>1/3</b></sub> recruited anti-DNP antibodies to sialic acid-functionalized supported lipid bilayers, indicating that both Ba and DNP remained accessible for binding. Dynamic exchange was demonstrated in a cell-mimicking environment, highlighting the adaptivity of these supramolecular polymers. Despite the complexity of a ternary system, the adaptivity of supramolecular polymers gives the individual components the possibility to act in concert, mimicking natural systems.
40202812	Association of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential with Cardiovascular Events in Patients with CKD.	Patients with CKD are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been associated with cardiovascular disease in the general population, with a causal role observed in animal models. In the general population, the effect of CHIP is greater for somatic mutations in pre-defined CHIP driver genes other than DNMT3A (referred to as non-DNMT3A CHIP). We sought to assess the prospective association between CHIP and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD.

Surgical resection of the seizure onset zone can be an effective treatment for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Clinical, electrophysiological, and imaging data are all gathered prior to surgery to localize the seizure onset zone. However, only ~62% of patients become seizure-free after surgery, highlighting the need for improved methods to prospectively predict seizure recurrence after resection. <sup>18</sup>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is routinely acquired to guide epilepsy surgery; however, these scans are often assessed qualitatively in the clinic. Here, we quantified the surgical targeting of lateralized FDG-PET hypometabolism and assessed its relationship to surgical outcomes.
40202810	Case Report: Neuropsychological Profile of a Patient With Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma Following Infection and Vaccination.	Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare and aggressive lymphoma that can have heterogeneous central nervous system involvement and cerebrovascular complications. The development of IVLBCL can be fatal. Although relatively rare, the development of specific clinical syndromes, such as IVLBCL, has been implicated following infection and vaccination. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation assessing neurocognitive and psychological status after IVLBCL diagnosis.
40202809	A Randomized Controlled Trial of Video-Assisted Electronic Consent Versus Standard Consent for Percutaneous Kidney Biopsy.	Informed consent is crucial in healthcare, as it respects and honors patient autonomy. However, the process of consenting a patient to a procedure or intervention is often unstandardized, leading to gaps in comprehension, which in turn affects decision-making. This study aimed to assess the patient-reported benefits of video-assisted electronic consent (eConsent) compared with the usual consent practices for percutaneous kidney biopsies (PKB).
40202808	EEG signal dimension is an index of seizure propensity and antiseizure medication effects in a mouse model of acquired epilepsy.	Variability in the frequency, timing, and pattern of seizures may influence the assessment of the effect of antiseizure medications (ASMs) when measuring seizure frequency, especially in patients with infrequent seizures. A low seizure rate is an exclusion criterion for enrollment of patients with epilepsy in clinical trials and requires prolonged periods of seizure monitoring, thus delaying appropriate treatment interventions. We investigated whether an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based complexity measure of seizure susceptibility of epileptic mice provides a reliable alternative to seizure frequency for evaluating the efficacy of ASMs.
40202807	Impaired sexual delay discounting as a potential mechanism in women's compulsive sexual behavior: Evidence from a mixed-gender experiment.	Scientific evidence for underpinning mechanisms of Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder (CSBD) is still scarce. This study explores impaired sexual delay discounting in compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) and its relationship with sexual sensation seeking (SSS) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) features in a general population sample.
40202806	Predicting Postoperative Cardiac Events and Mortality for People with Kidney Failure Having Non-Cardiac Surgery: An External Validation Study.	Patients with kidney failure undergoing non-cardiac surgery are at high risk of adverse cardiac events and mortality, however existing perioperative risk prediction tools for these outcomes are not valid in these patients. Recently, three models were developed from a kidney failure cohort in Alberta, Canada. In this study, we evaluated these Alberta models in a kidney failure cohort that had surgery in Manitoba, Canada.
40202805	Sleep-Related Disorders in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease and Kidney Transplant Recipients.	Sleep disorders such as insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and sleep apnea are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These conditions tend to become more prevalent and more severe as kidney function deteriorates and when a patient reaches end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The prevalence of insomnia in the general population ranges from 4-29% compared to i) 30-67%, ii) 39-54%, iii) 41-79%, and iv) 9-49% in patients with CKD, on hemodialysis, on peritoneal dialysis (PD), or in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) respectively. RLS occurs in about 1-15% of the general population compared to i) 5-18%, ii) 24-33%, iii) 23-64%, and iv) 6-8% in patients with CKD, on hemodialysis, on PD, or in KTRs respectively. Obstructive sleep apnea has been reported in i) 40-69%, ii) 25-47%, iii) 9-52%, and iv) 25-30% in patients with CKD, on hemodialysis, on PD, or in KTRs respectively. Fatigue is a complex symptom that has been reported in patients with CKD, ESKD, and in KTRs and can be associated with sleep disorders. Fatigue and sleep disorders have been associated with negative outcomes such as progression of CKD, increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and lower health-related quality of life. In this Review, we highlight non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic options for treatment of these sleep disorders. Specifically, the diagnosis and evaluation, epidemiology, risk factors and associations, outcomes (such as CKD progression, morbidity, and mortality), treatment, and post-transplant outcomes for sleep disorders (insomnia, RLS, sleep apnea) and fatigue will be discussed.
40202804	Safety and Effectiveness of Apixaban versus Warfarin by Kidney Function in Atrial Fibrillation: A Binational Population-Based Study.	Evidence to guide use of apixaban in people with atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in routine clinical practice has been limited. We assessed comparative safety (major bleeding) and effectiveness (ischemic stroke and death) of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with AF across the spectrum of non-dialysis-dependent CKD using large, routinely collected data.
40202803	Rhodium-Catalyzed 1,5-Sigma Migratory Ring Expansion of gem-Difluorodienyl-Cyclopropanes and Cyclobutanes.	Rhodium-catalyzed 1,5-sigma migratory ring expansion (SMRE) of common dieneylcyclopropanes (DECPs) and dieneylcyclobutanes (DECPs) fails. But replacing the terminal CH2 group with CF2 group for both DECPs and DECBs, the resulting substrates of gem-difluorodienylcyclopropanes (df-DECPs) and gem-difluorodienylcyclobutanes (df-DECBs) can achieve this reaction, which has broad reaction scope and high efficiency to give seven- and eight-membered carbocycles with a carbonyl group. The keys to the success of this reaction are: oxidative cyclization becomes easier with the help of two F atoms; the metallacycle intermediate can detour the sluggish reductive elimination by defluorination to generate Rh carbene intermediate (defluorocarbenation process), which can undergo easier carbene migratory insertion and β-H elimination, giving rise to the final products. Mechanistic studies via experiments and quantum chemistry calculations support the proposed mechanism. The gem-difluoro ene in the substrates of df-DECPs and df-DECBs of the present SMRE reaction can be regarded as a ketene surrogate, and this strategy can be exploited in many transition-metal-catalyzed reactions in the future.
40202802	Synthesis and Electrochemistry of Copper(I) Complexes with Weakly Basic, Fluorinated and Multicyclic Arenes.	The dinitrogen complex [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF = C(CF3)3) acts as the precursor for the synthesis of homoleptic, weakly bound Cu(I)-arene complexes with benzene, fluorinated and multicyclic arenes. Upon dissolution of [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] in benzene or the fluorinated arenes xFB (x = number of fluorine atoms, x = 1-4), the complexes [Cu(C6H6)2-3]+[Al(ORF)4]-, [Cu(xFB)2-3]+[Al(ORF)4]- (x = 1-3) or the ion pair [(xFB)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (x = 4) form. Both, the benzene and fluorobenzene complexes are also available in larger scales by oxidation of elemental copper in the respective solvents using [NO]+[Al(ORF)4]- as oxidant. A higher degree of fluorination of the arene ligand leads to a weaker coordination of the Cu(I) atom and thus to higher Cu+/Cu redox potentials in solution that reach an unprecedentedly high value of +1.5 V (!) vs. the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple in pentafluorobenzene. The versatile applicability of [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] as a 'naked' Cu(I) source is demonstrated by complexation reactions with the multicyclic arenes anthracene and hexaphenyl-benzene that yielded multiply charged cations. All com-plexes presented in this work were characterized by their single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures.
40202801	Quantifying the health burden of COVID-19 using individual estimates of years of life lost based on population-wide administrative level data.	The COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial health losses but not much is known about how these are distributed across the population. We aimed to estimate the distribution of years of life lost (YLL) due to COVID-19 and investigate its variation across the Dutch population, taking into account pre-existing differences in health.

40202798	Porphyrinic metal-organic frameworks as separation membranes: from synthesis to advanced applications.	Tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a distinctive class of flexible, highly porous, crystalline, and compatible nanomaterials that have garnered substantial attention for the fabrication of high-performance advanced separation membranes. The TCPP ligand, when coordinated with various metal ions and nodes, such as Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Zr<sup>4+</sup>, synthesize different M-TCPP MOFs with diverse porous nanostructures, exhibiting different nano-morphologies, including ultrathin nano-sheets, -fibers, -particles, and -rods. These nanostructures act as fundamental building blocks for the preparation of both porous and dense membranes. The accessible side functionalities (dangling carboxyl groups) of the TCPP MOFs significantly enhance the hydrophilicity and facilitate the formation of compatible interfaces with various polymers. This enhanced hydrophilicity, coupled with membrane stability in water and under acidic conditions, the presence of surface nanopores and the creation of continuous selective micro-/nano-transport channels (upon the assembly of nanostructures), substantially improves the membrane permeance and selectivity. These attributes make TCPP MOFs membranes suitable for a wide range of separation applications. This review comprehensively summarizes the synthesis strategies of TCPP MOFs, their nano-morphologies, properties, and their integration into state-of-the-art separation membranes, such as mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), thin-film composite (TFC) membranes, and thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes. It examines their performance, discusses challenges, and explores potential solutions. Furthermore, the versatile separation capabilities of TCPP MOFs membranes, including gaseous, liquid, and ionic separation, as well as proton and metal ion conductivity are thoroughly analyzed in the light of mass transport theories and reported mechanisms. This review also delves into the photo-activity and photothermal effects of TCPP MOFs membranes, highlighting their implications for photocatalysis and membrane percolation. Finally, it outlines future directions and identifies potential opportunities for advancing TCPP MOFs membranes, aiming to elevate state-of-the-art separation technologies.
40202797	Sensitive detection of small extracellular vesicles using a gold nanostar-based SERS assay.	Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are lipid bilayer-bound vesicles that carry critical biomarkers for disease detection. However, the inherent heterogeneity and complexity of sEV molecular characteristics pose significant challenges for accurate and comprehensive molecular profiling. Traditional analytical methods, including immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry, exhibit several limitations, such as being time-consuming, requiring large sample volumes, and demonstrating relatively low sensitivity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a highly sensitive and specific assay for the reliable detection of sEVs. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) assays have emerged as a promising approach for sEV detection, offering advantages including high sensitivity and specificity. In the proposed SERS assay, SERS nanotags - comprising nanoparticles coated with Raman-active molecules and conjugated with antibodies - are employed to label surface-bound molecules on sEVs. This approach facilitates the generation of a high-intensity signal from molecules present in low abundance. Recently, anisotropic nanoparticles, such as star-shaped nanostructures, have garnered interest due to their ability to significantly amplify generated SERS signals for ultra-sensitive biomarker detection. In this study, we explore the application of gold nanostars (AuNSs) as SERS nanotags for the detection of sEVs. In principle, AuNS-based SERS nanotags were used to label the EpCAM protein, which can be found on the surface of cancer cell derived sEVs, and then sEV labelled SERS nanotags were captured by CD9-conjugated magnetic beads to form an immunocomplex, which exhibits a SERS signal. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SERS assay utilizing AuNSs provides high specificity and sensitivity, with a detection limit as low as 2.47 × 10<sup>3</sup> particles per μL. Furthermore, the assay was tested with spiked plasma samples (cancer cell-derived sEVs spiked into healthy plasma), showing that its specificity remains unaffected by the presence of plasma. These findings suggest that the SERS assay incorporating AuNSs holds significant promise as an effective and reliable detection method for potential clinical applications.
40202796	How Do Neurocognitive Tests Relate to Reported Child Difficulties at 6 Years of Age in Benin?	The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between children's difficulties perceived by parents in the Ten Questions questionnaire (TQ) and children's assessments by the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II) and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2).
40202795	Indirect fitness benefits can reinforce the direct fitness benefits of male mate choice.	Mating preferences frequently evolve because they confer fitness benefits to the chooser. While there is strong evidence for both direct and indirect fitness benefits in the context of female mate choice, the potential for males to receive indirect benefits from mate choice remains understudied. Male mate choice for larger female body size is widespread among ectotherms and is generally attributed to the direct fitness benefits larger females provide due to their higher fecundity. However, when female size is heritable or condition-dependent, males could also receive indirect benefits from mating with larger females in the form of increased offspring fitness. We tested this possibility in Drosophila melanogaster by first confirming the direct fitness benefits associated with large females and then comparing the fitness of offspring produced by large versus small females. Although female body size did not influence offspring juvenile viability, large females produced daughters with higher reproductive success than the daughters of small females. Males only received these indirect benefits through their daughters, however, as reproductive success did not differ significantly between the sons of large and small females. Our findings demonstrate that indirect fitness benefits can serve to reinforce the direct benefits of male mate choice, suggesting that indirect effects may play an underappreciated role in the evolution of male preferences.
40202794	Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential and Progression of CKD.	Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common inflammatory condition of aging that causes myriad end-organ damage. CHIP has been associated with incident AKI and kidney function decline in the general population, particularly mutations in CHIP genes other than DNMT3A (termed non-DNMT3A CHIP). Prior studies of CHIP in individuals with CKD had limited sample sizes and conflicting findings.
40202793	Marine Natural Products in Inflammation-Related Diseases: Opportunities and Challenges.	In recent decades, the potentiality of marine natural products (MNPs) in the medical field has been increasingly recognized. Natural compounds derived from marine microorganisms, algae, and invertebrates have shown significant promise for treating inflammation-related diseases. In this review, we cover the three primary sources of MNPs and their diverse and unique chemical structures and bioactivities. This review aims to summarize the progress of MNPs in combating inflammation-related diseases. Moreover, we cover the functions and mechanisms of MNPs in diseases, highlighting their functions in regulating inflammatory signaling pathways, cellular stress responses, and gut microbiota, among others. Meanwhile, we focus on key technologies and scientific methods to address the current limitations and challenges in MNPs.
40202791	Health Coaching and Its Impact in the Remote Management of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Scoping Review of the Literature.	Health coaching refers to the practice of health education and promotion to drive goal-directed behavioral changes and improve an individual's well-being. Remote patient monitoring systems, which employ health coaching interventions, have been gaining interest and may aid in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
40202790	Solvent-Assisted CO<sub>2</sub> Foaming Induced Ultralarge Pore Span Hierarchically Porous Polyimide.	Inspired by natural materials, constructing hierarchically porous composite materials can better meet the increasingly demanding needs of engineering materials. Currently, lightweight polyimide components commonly used in aerospace and deep-sea applications are difficult to combine with cross-scale pores due to limitations in performance stability and porogenic strategies. Finding an efficient, environmentally friendly, convenient, and highly controllable method to prepare hierarchically porous polyimide (HPPI) to utilize structural advantages for functional suitability remains a huge challenge. Here, we propose a solvent-assisted supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> foaming strategy to develop ultralarge pore span polyimide (ODA-ODPA). This strategy can not only realize the construction of HPPIs, but also regulate the porosities span from 15 to 75%. The HPPI mechanical parts prepared by controlling the foaming conditions can improve the oil storage and supply capacity and reduce the material quality while maintaining excellent dimensional stability thanks to the combination of micro- and nanopore. The prepared lightweight HPPI foam also shows excellent high-temperature-resistant mechanical properties. Additionally, the versatility of this strategy has been successfully demonstrated in other thermoplastic polyimide systems. This work not only provides a new method for preparing hierarchically porous materials, but also provides more possibilities for further expanding the application areas of special engineering polymers, for example, maintenance-free components for human deep space exploration and high-temperature-resistant fall buffers.
40202789	A New Mobile App to Train Attention Processes in People With Traumatic Brain Injury: Logical and Ecological Content Validation Study.	Attention is at the base of more complex cognitive processes, and its deficits can significantly impact safety and health. Attention can be impaired by neurodevelopmental and acquired disorders. One validated theoretical model to explain attention processes and their deficits is the hierarchical model of Sohlberg and Mateer. This model guides intervention development to improve attention following an acquired disorder. Another way to stimulate attention functions is to engage in the daily practice of mindfulness, a multicomponent concept that can be explained by the theoretical model of Baer and colleagues. Mobile apps offer great potential for practicing mindfulness daily as they can easily be used during daily routines, thus facilitating transfer. Laverdière and colleagues have developed such a mobile app called Focusing, which is aimed at attention training using mindfulness-inspired attentional exercises. However, this app has not been scientifically validated.
40202785	Advances on Electrochemiluminescent Biosensors for TB Biomarkers.	Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious bacterial infection that remains a leading cause of death and persistent threat to global health. The spread of TB is exacerbated by the major limitations of conventional diagnostic approaches, such as complex technicalities, high cost, and low sensitivity. To address these challenges, recent research has focused on using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) as an alternative detection strategy coupled to biosensors. ECL biosensors leverage electrochemically generated chemiluminescence, converting electrical energy to light, as a novel transduction mechanism for TB biosensors. This unique approach offers several advantages, namely, wide linear dynamic ranges, improved device sensitivities, and prompt response times for sensitive early detection. This Review offers a comprehensive overview of advancements in ECL biosensor configurations, including detection and amplification strategies, substrates, and the development of luminophores and coreactants tailored for TB biomarker detection. The focus is on ECL biosensor designs, including biorecognition elements like immunosensors, DNA sensors, and aptasensors, along with various immobilization strategies tailored to target specific TB biomarkers. A comprehensive discussion spans biomarker detection trends over the past decade, clinical relevance, sensitivity thresholds, and detection limits. Furthermore, widely recognized TB biomarkers commonly detected in commercial diagnostic tests are discussed alongside novel markers that, while not exclusive to TB, have demonstrated clinical importance. This Review aims to highlight the potential of ECL-based biosensors as an effective means to advance an early, reliable, and accessible TB detection approach.
40202784	Preclinical development of ozuriftamab vedotin (BA3021), a novel ROR2-specific conditionally active biologic antibody-drug conjugate.	Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor (ROR2) has been identified as a highly relevant tumor-associated antigen in a variety of cancer indications of high unmet medical need, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, colorectal cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. Overexpression of ROR2 often correlates with advanced disease or poor prognosis, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. We developed a novel, conditionally active biologic (CAB) antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), ozuriftamab vedotin (BA3021), which binds to ROR2 only in the acidic tumor microenvironment. In healthy tissue, binding to ROR2 is greatly reduced by a novel selection mechanism using physiological chemicals as protein-associated chemical switches (PaCS). The CAB anti-ROR2 ADC displays the anticipated binding properties and mediates potent lysis of ROR2-positive cancer cell lines. <i>In vivo</i>, BA3021 has potent and durable antitumor activity in human cancer xenograft mouse models, including patient-derived xenograft models. In non-human primates, BA3021 was well tolerated at doses of up to 10 mg/kg and showed excellent stability <i>in vivo</i>. These preclinical results indicate that CAB anti-ROR2 ADC is efficacious and well tolerated and may be a promising treatment for cancer patients with ROR2-expressing tumors.
40202783	A versatile approach toward enantiospecific synthesis of sugar-linked oxapolyquinanes <i>via</i> IPKR.	An efficient and enantiospecific synthetic strategy for the construction of [6/5/5/5] and [5/5/5/5] fused oxatetraquinanes using a D-glucose-derived enyne has been described. The approach integrates oxidative cleavage, organoaluminium-mediated propargylation, and IPKR (Intramolecular Pauson-Khand Reaction) to deliver the tetracyclic core with high stereoselectivity. These tetracyclic cores serve as versatile synthons for the synthesis of more complex [6/5/5/5/5] fused polyquinanes. This methodology not only highlights the strategic use of carbohydrate-derived enynes but also provides a robust platform for the asymmetric synthesis of structurally intricate polyquinanes, paving the way for the development of biologically relevant molecular frameworks.
40202782	Cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum chaperones inhibit wt-p53 to increase cancer cells' survival by refluxing ER-proteins to the cytosol.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential sensing organelle responsible for the folding and secretion of almost one-third of eukaryotic cells' total proteins. However, environmental, chemical, and genetic insults often lead to protein misfolding in the ER, accumulating misfolded proteins, and causing ER stress. To solve this, several mechanisms were reported to relieve ER stress by decreasing the ER protein load. Recently, we reported a novel ER surveillance mechanism by which proteins from the secretory pathway are refluxed to the cytosol to relieve the ER of its content. The refluxed proteins gain new prosurvival functions in cancer cells, thereby increasing cancer cell fitness. We termed this phenomenon <u>ER</u> to <u>CY</u>tosol <u>S</u>ignaling (or '<b>ERCYS'</b>). Here, we found that in mammalian cells, ERCYS is regulated by DNAJB12, DNAJB14, and the HSC70 cochaperone SGTA. Mechanistically, DNAJB12 and DNAJB14 bind HSC70 and SGTA - through their cytosolically localized J-domains to facilitate ER-protein reflux. DNAJB12 is necessary and sufficient to drive this phenomenon to increase AGR2 reflux and inhibit wt-p53 during ER stress. Mutations in DNAJB12/14 J-domain prevent the inhibitory interaction between AGR2-wt-p53. Thus, targeting the DNAJB12/14-HSC70/SGTA axis is a promising strategy to inhibit ERCYS and impair cancer cell fitness.
40202781	Adolescent Self-Reflection Process Through Self-Recording on Multiple Health Metrics: Qualitative Study.	Self-recording is an effective behavior change technology that has long been used in diverse health contexts. Recent technological advancements have broadened its applications. While previous studies have explored its role and benefits in enhancing self-awareness and informed decision-making, relatively little attention has been given to its potential to address the multidimensional nature of health with various health metrics.
40202780	Integration of High-Performance FETs and Sensitive Gas Sensors Using Janus WSiGeP<sub>4</sub> for Trace Toxic Gas Detection.	Integrating a field-effect transistor (FET) and FET-type gas sensor within a single two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting material is essential for achieving on-chip detection of trace concentrations of toxic gas. This technology allows the output signal of the gas sensor to be amplified directly by the FET on an integrated circuit, enabling complex analyses to be performed in a compact and efficient manner. However, achieving this integration is currently challenging. In this study, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a Janus WSiGeP<sub>4</sub> monolayer with out-of-plane polarization can be utilized to create both a high-performance top-gate FET and an ultrasensitive bottom-gate FET-type gas sensor, thereby facilitating the integration of these two devices. The key performance metrics of the designed FET align with the standards set by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) for high-performance applications, while the gas sensor exhibits high response to both NO and NH<sub>3</sub> gases in the low oxygen air and humid environment with ultrahigh responses of 301.2 and 99.4 toward NO and NH<sub>3</sub> gas, respectively. Our work provides a promising strategy for integrating these two devices within a single 2D material.

40202778	Oxide Support Inert in Its Interaction with Metal but Active in Its Interaction with Oxide and Vice Versa.	Supported metal or oxide nanostructures catalyze many industrial reactions, where the interaction of metal or oxide overlayer with its support can have a substantial influence on catalytic performance. In this work, we show that small Pt species can be well stabilized on CeO<sub>2</sub> under both H<sub>2</sub>-containing and O<sub>2</sub>-containing atmospheres but sintering happens on SiO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that CeO<sub>2</sub> is active whereas SiO<sub>2</sub> is inert in Pt-support interaction. On the other hand, Co oxide (CoO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) supported on SiO<sub>2</sub> can maintain a low-valence Co<sup>2+</sup> state both in air and during CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation to CO, indicating a strong interaction of CoO<i><sub>x</sub></i> with SiO<sub>2</sub>. However, the CoO<i><sub>x</sub></i> overlayer has a weak interaction with CeO<sub>2</sub> and is easily reduced to metallic Co during the CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation reaction producing CH<sub>4</sub>. Thus, SiO<sub>2</sub> is active, but CeO<sub>2</sub> is inert for CoO<i><sub>x</sub></i>-support interaction, which is counter to the common sense from the Pt/oxide systems. Systematic studies in stability behaviors of Pt and CoO<i><sub>x</sub></i> nanocatalysts supported on various oxides show that the reducibility of the oxide supports can be used to describe the catalyst-support interaction. Oxide supports with high reducibility or low metal-oxygen bond strength interact strongly with Pt and other metals, showing high metalphilicity. Conversely, oxide supports with low reducibility or high metal-oxygen bond strength have strong interaction with CoO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and other oxides, having high oxidephilicity.
40202777	Factors Influencing Information Distortion in Electronic Nursing Records: Qualitative Study.	Information distortion in nursing records poses significant risks to patient safety and impedes the enhancement of care quality. The introduction of information technologies, such as decision support systems and predictive models, expands the possibilities for using health data but also complicates the landscape of information distortion. Only by identifying influencing factors about information distortion can care quality and patient safety be ensured.
40202775	An Indole Dearomatization Strategy for the Synthesis of Pseudo-Natural Products.	The indole moiety is a privileged fragment that frequently populates existing bioactive compound collections. We describe the development of an indole-dearomatization sequence and its application for library expansion of a collection of indole-containing pseudo-NPs. The resulting compounds are topologically distinct from the original compound class. Phenotyping by means of the cell painting assay initially indicated that the dearomatized compounds are morphologically different than the original pseudo-NP compound class and guiding NPs. However, analysis by means of a new sub-profile analysis of the same cell painting assay data indicated that similar morphologies persisted throughout the compound classes. Further biological studies supported the findings of the sub-profile analysis and highlights its potential to more effectively characterize novel compounds. The biological findings suggest that a plethora of indole-dearomatization reactions could be applied to existing indole-containing compound collections to rapidly access new biologically relevant scaffolds.
40202774	A Metal-Organic Framework with Tailored Shape-matched Interactions towards Ambient-temperature Argon Removal for Oxygen Purification.	High-purity oxygen (O2) is essential for high-value-added applications in the medical, aerospace, and electronics sectors. The production of high-purity O2 via non-thermal-driven pressure-swing adsorption has the advantages of portable operation and low energy consumption. However, effectively removing trace amounts of argon (Ar) impurities in this process is indispensable and it is a fundamental challenge to achieve the preferential adsorption of inert Ar atoms over polar O2 molecules instead of traditional thermodynamic or molecule sieving strategies. Herein, we have demonstrated this problem was addressed by integrating spheroidal shape-matched interactions to fit the spheroid Ar atoms, while repulsing the linear O2 molecules. Using this strategy, customized TYUT-20 enables the exceptional recognition of Ar atoms over O2 molecules, demonstrating an unprecedented Ar adsorption capacity of up to 14.5 cm3/g and a top-performing Ar/O2 (1.54) selectivity at 298 K and 1 bar. The Ar atom recognition mechanism on this adsorbent has been investigated using Ar-loaded single crystal diffraction analysis and molecular simulation studies. The productivity of high-purity O2 (>99.99%) from a 5/95 Ar/O2 mixture breakthrough experiment reached 6.6 L/kg under ambient conditions, which highlighted TYUT-20 as a very promising adsorbent in ready-to-use high-purity O2 production.
40202773	Osteosarcoma Cell and Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Potent Immunogenic Bi-nuclear Gallium(III) Complexes.	We report the synthesis, characterisation, anti-osteosarcoma and anti-osteosarcoma stem cells (OSC) properties (cytotoxic and immunogenic) of a series of bi-nuclear gallium(III) complexes with tridentate Schiff base ligands and 8-hydroxyquinoline (1-4). According to monolayer cytotoxicity studies, 1-4 display micromolar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs. The most effective complex in the series 2 is up to 13-fold more potent towards OSCs than cisplatin and carboplatin (the only metallodrugs used in the clinic to treat osteosarcoma). Remarkably, the bi-nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1-4 are significantly more potent towards three-dimensionally cultured sarcospheres than OSCs cultured in monolayers indicating effective penetration of the sarcosphere multicellular architecture. The bi-nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1-4 are up to 53-fold more potent towards sarcospheres than cisplatin and carboplatin. Mechanistic studies show that gallium(III) complex 2 kills osteosarcoma cells by caspase-dependent apoptosis and paraptosis, leading to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns associated to immunogenic cell death. Osteosarcoma cells and OSCs treated with gallium(III) complex 2 are effectively phagocytosed by immune cells, highlighting its immunogenic potential. As far as we are aware, gallium(III) complex 2 is the first metal complex to evoke an immunogenic response towards both bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs.
40202772	Self-propulsion of liquid droplet assemblies controlled by the functionalities of their components.	The self-propulsion of droplet assemblies consisting of droplets of 1-decanol and either an ethyl salicylate (ES) or a composite droplet of ES and liquid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is reported. The ES-PDMS composite droplets have an ES core covered by a PDMS layer that stabilizes the assembly significantly. Their self-propulsion exhibits characteristic predator-prey behavior, with a decanol droplet closely chasing the ES or ES-PDMS composite droplet, forming a bound droplet pair. Furthermore, the stability that PDMS gives the system enables us to construct more complex assemblies, such as two, three, and four decanol droplets closely chasing an ES-PDMS droplet, whose motion patterns depend strongly on the symmetry in the structure of the assemblies. Our findings demonstrate that long-lived assemblies composed of droplets with distinct functionalities can serve as a versatile platform for developing self-organizing and adaptive droplet systems, functioning as "droplet robots".
40202771	Death education and educators: The role of attitudes, anxiety, and future time perspective.	This study explores the impact of death representations on openness to death education among university students in teaching and education degree programs. Drawing from Terror Management Theory, the roles of future time perspective (FTP), death anxiety, and the ontological representation of death as total annihilation were analyzed. The results show that viewing death as annihilation negatively impacts FTP, reducing the ability to think about the future. Diminished FTP increases negative thoughts about death and lack of death acceptance. When FTP still allows making sense of life despite death, it reduces death rejection, however, it does not increase openness to death education, activating proximal defenses. Conversely, when death representation constrains FTP, death thoughts emerge that lead to desiring death education pathways, activating distal defenses. The study highlights the importance of addressing death representations and developing a healthy time perspective in training programs for educators.
40202770	The bridging role of Schwann cells in the interaction between tumors and the nervous system: a potential target for cancer therapy.	Nerves are important components of the tumor microenvironment and can regulate the progression of various solid tumors. Tumor innervation (TIN) and perineural invasion (PNI) are the two main modes of interaction between tumors and the nervous system. The former simulates neurogenesis or axonogenesis during neural development, while the latter causes neuroinflammation during nerve injury. As the principal glial cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cells (SCs) are easily hijacked and utilized by cancer cells due to their high plasticity and versatility. Whether TIN or PNI occurs in a tumor, SCs are believed to be associated with these processes, which indicate that SCs may be a target for cancer neurotherapy. This review focuses on elucidating the interactions between tumors and the PNS and the underlying mechanisms involved. Specifically, we delineated the pivotal role of SCs in TIN, PNI, cancer pain, and the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Furthermore, we compared the advantages and disadvantages of several preclinical trials that have exploited the nervous system to treat cancer and discussed the importance of SCs as a new target in cancer neuroscience research. We hope that this review will contribute to a deeper understanding of the significant involvement of SCs within the tumor-neuroimmune axis, and provide novel insights for innovative antitumor therapies.
40202768	Nanostructured films from poly(3-hexylthiophene)-<i>graft</i>-poly(ε-caprolactone) as light-responsive generators of reactive oxygen species.	The design of smart photoelectrodes is used to modulate and control the spatio-temporal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, we develop photoactive films with tunable nanostructured morphologies to favor ROS production <i>via</i> photostimulation. To that aim, we synthesized graft copolymers, made of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), P3HT-<i>g</i>-PCL, which were employed to fabricate compact films by drop casting. The films were further subjected to a thermo-oxidative treatment in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 42 °C. This led to nanostructured films with a porosity (∼500 nm diameter and ∼70 nm height) controlled at specific copolymer compositions, as determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nanostructured P3HT films possess higher storage moduli (<i>E</i>') than flat P3HT films, as determined by nanoindentation measurements. Finally, the performance of nanostructured P3HT films as photoelectrodes is assessed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell upon visible-light irradiation (<i>λ</i> = 467 nm), leading to the spatiotemporal production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at non-cytotoxic levels for future non-invasive redox medicine applications.
40202767	Participant engagement in a moderated Facebook group to promote COVID-19 vaccination.	Interventions with high levels of engagement have been found to be more effective at changing health behavior than those with low levels. Few prior studies have examined whether engagement in interventions using social media groups is associated with higher program effectiveness. This study examined whether participant engagement in a moderated private Facebook group aimed at COVID-19 vaccination was associated with improvements in immunization intentions (N = 263). Engagement in the group (i.e. emoji reactions, comments, poll votes and posts) and change in COVID-19 vaccine intentions were assessed through a retrospective review of participant engagement metrics and self-reported surveys at 4 weeks. Overall, 59% of participants engaged at least once. Participants on average made 11.9 total engagements during the 4-week study (SD = 25.5), of which 6.3 (SD = 15.2) were emoji reactions, 4.0 (SD = 12.3) comments, 1.4 (SD = 2.2) poll votes and 0.2 (SD = 0.7) post. No significant differences were found between engagement and sociodemographic characteristics or group size. Emoji reactions were associated with increased intentions. Each emoji reaction used was associated with a 4% increase in the odds of improvements in intention to vaccinate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08, P = 0.015). Future interventions on social media should encourage users to use emoji reactions on posts.

40202752	Use of MACI (Autologous Cultured Chondrocytes on Porcine Collagen Membrane) in the United States: Expanded Experience over 5,000 Cases.	ObjectiveTo determine whether there are differences in MACI (matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation) treatment in the United States, by comparing cartilage defects and patient characteristics between the initial 1,000 patients treated with the next 5,000MethodsFollowing initial analysis of the first 1,000 consecutive patients treated with MACI, data were collected and analyzed for the subsequent 5,000. Patients were identified by MACI lot number and surgery date. Adverse events were summarized with descriptive statistics. Group differences were assessed with <i>t</i>-tests and chi-square, with significance set at <i>P</i> < 0.05.ResultsFive thousand adults (5,198 knees) were implanted with MACI by 1,130 surgeons. Patient sex (male 49.2%) was evenly split, and the mean age was 33.6 years. Most patients had a single cartilage defect treated, and the mean defect size was 4.4 cm<sup>2</sup>. The patella was the most treated surface (38.4%), followed by the medial femoral condyle (25.7%). Most patients (85.5%) had concomitant surgical procedures at the time of cartilage biopsy procurement. There were statistically significant differences in the number of patella (<i>P</i> < 0.001), medial femoral condyle (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and "not specified" (<i>P</i> = 0.008) between groups. Mean defect size and mean total defect size were both larger (<i>P</i> < 0.001 and <i>P</i> = 0.009, respectively) in the subsequent 5,000 patients.ConclusionThe utilization of MACI has remained consistent. Patient demographics and concomitant surgical procedures between the first 1,000 MACI patients and subsequent 5,000 MACI patients were comparable. Patellofemoral defects were the most treated in both subsets, and an overall low rate of adverse events was observed.

40202729	Spatial and breeding site analysis of <i>Aedes</i> spp. at dengue-prone areas in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.	Understanding Aedes breeding sites is crucial for effective vector control, yet the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis in Kuala Lumpur is limited. This study explores the spatial distribution and characteristics of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> breeding sites in dengue-prone areas of Bandar Tasik Selatan. Entomological data from the Kuala Lumpur Health Department (2022-2023) were analyzed using Average Nearest Neighbor (ANN), Global Moran's I, and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). Logistic regression and principal component analyses (PCA) were used to assess breeding site characteristics. Of 6,027 water containers inspected, 402 (6.7%) were positive for Aedes larvae. ANN and Moran's I analyses revealed significant clustering in Zone A and Zone B, while KDE identified breeding hotspots. Logistic regression indicated higher risk in plastic (aOR = 69.58), rubber (aOR = 35.11), and cement (aOR = 24.70) containers, while rainwater (aOR = 0.24), tap water (aOR = 0.27), and partial shading (aOR = 0.41) reduced risk. PCA revealed key breeding site variations across residential, public, school, and food areas. These findings support targeted vector control, efficient resource allocation, and tailored interventions to mitigate dengue risks in high-priority areas.

40202721	Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Parkinson's Disease.	Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can synergistically accelerate dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Small extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-sEVs) inhibit Nox4/ROS production by delivering specific miRNAs, regulate the EGR1/NOX4/p38MAPK axis to exert antioxidant effects, and can enhance antioxidant capacity by activating the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Additionally, at the same time, neuroinflammation can be alleviated by inhibiting the Sp1 signal and regulating pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory factors. MSC-sEVs can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, improve movement disorders, and relieve neuronal damage in PD models, providing a new anti-inflammatory and antioxidant strategy for PD treatment.
40202720	Discotic amphiphilic supramolecular polymers for drug release and cell activation with light.	The limited efficacy shown by drug delivery systems so far prompts the development of new molecular approaches for releasing drugs in a controlled and selective manner. Light is a privileged stimulus for delivery because it can be applied in sharp spatiotemporal patterns and is orthogonal to most biological processes. Supramolecular polymers form molecular nanostructures whose robustness, versatility, and responsivity to different stimuli have generated wide interest in materials chemistry. However, their application as drug delivery vehicles has received little attention. We built supramolecular polymers based on discotic amphiphiles that self-assemble in linear nanostructures in water. They can integrate diverse amphiphilic bioligands and release them upon illumination, acutely producing functional effects under physiological conditions. We devised two strategies for drug incorporation into the photoswitchable nanofibers. In the co-assembly strategy, discotic monomers with and without conjugated bioligands were co-assembled in helicoidal supramolecular fibers. In the drug embedding approach, we integrated a potent agonist of muscarinic receptors into the discotic polymer by noncovalent stacking interactions. This ligand can be released on demand with light <i>ex situ</i> and <i>in situ</i>, rapidly activating the target receptor and triggering intracellular responses. These novel discotic supramolecular polymers can be light-driven drug carriers for small, planar, and amphiphilic drugs.
40202719	The effect of elevated levels of the gut metabolite TMAO on glucose metabolism after sleeve gastrectomy.	<b>Purpose：</b>Bariatric surgery can effectively alleviate obesity and diabetes by regulation of the gut microbiota. This study aimed to investigate the change in the gut microbiota metabolite TMAO and to explore its effect on glucose metabolism after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). <b>Materials and methods：</b>Diet-induced obesity mouse models were established, and the mice were randomly divided into four groups: an SG group, a sham-operated group pair-fed with the SG group (PF), a sham-operated group fed ad libitum (AL), and a lean control group (C). At 10 weeks post-surgery, the changes in glycogen content of liver, gut microbiota and the level of FMO3 in the liver were evaluated, and their correlation with TMAO production was analysed. The expression levels of the TMAO/PERK/FOXO1 pathway and the gluconeogenic genes G6PC and PCK1 were measured. <b>Results：</b>At 10 weeks post-surgery, hepatocyte glycogen levels were restored, and serum TMA and TMAO levels were significantly increased. Faecal metagenomic sequencing results showed that the abundances of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, which were positively correlated with TMAO production, were significantly increased after surgery. While the changes in FMO3, the key enzyme producing TMAO in the liver was found decreased significantly after SG. The expression levels of the TMAO/PERK/FOXO1 pathway and the gluconeogenic genes G6PC and PCK1 were measured. Inconsistent with the changing trend of TMAO, the expression of PERK, FOXO1, PCK, and G6PC significantly decreased after SG. <b>Conclusions：</b>SG can significantly reduce obesity and restore glucose metabolism. After surgery, TMAO metabolites increased in a microbiota-dependent manner.

40202717	Proteomic Insights into the Adaptation of <i>Acidithiobacillus ferridurans</i> to Municipal Solid Waste Incineration Residues for Enhanced Bioleaching Efficiency.	<i>Acidithiobacillus</i> spp. have traditionally been utilized to extract metals from mineral ores through bioleaching. This process has recently expanded to include artificial ores, such as those derived from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) residues. Previous studies have indicated that microbial adaptation enhances bioleaching efficiency, prompting this study to identify proteins involved in the adaptation of <i>A. ferridurans</i> to MSWI residues. We employed data-independent acquisition-parallel accumulation serial fragmentation to determine the proteomic response of <i>A. ferridurans</i> DSM 583 to three distinct materials: bottom ash (BA), kettle ash (KA), and filter ash (FA), which represent typical MSWI residues. Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the residue type, a suite of membrane transporters, porins, efflux pumps, and specific electron and cation transfer proteins was notably upregulated. The upregulation of certain proteins involved in anaerobic pathways suggested the development of a spontaneous microaerobic environment, which minimally impacted the bioleaching efficiency. Additionally, the adaptation was most efficient at half the target FA concentration, marked by a significant increase in the detoxification and efflux systems required by microorganisms to tolerate high heavy metal concentrations. Given that metal recovery peaked at lower FA concentrations for most metals of interest, further adaptation at the level of protein expression may not be warranted for improved bioleaching outcomes.
40202716	Systematic Literature Review of the Impact of Islamic Psychotherapy on Adolescent Spiritual Well-Being.	Islamic psychotherapy has been widely utilized in various fields, particularly in psychology, focusing on aspects of aqidah, worship, and morality, which can significantly contribute to individuals' spiritual well-being. Despite the abundance of studies on Islamic psychotherapy, systematic literature reviews on this topic remain scarce. This article aims to review the literature on the impact of Islamic psychotherapy on adolescent spiritual well-being. A qualitative research methodology was employed, involving the collection of documentary data from past studies and the inductive analysis of findings. This systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Articles and related resources were identified through three primary databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The thematic analysis revealed three main themes: mental health, therapeutic approaches and interventions, and well-being. The findings indicate that mental health significantly influences both psychological and physical health issues, necessitating appropriate therapeutic interventions to enhance adolescents' spiritual well-being. This review emphasizes the importance of Islamic psychotherapy in addressing mental health challenges among Muslim  adolescents. Future researchers are encouraged to conduct more comprehensive SLRs with broader scopes, including more significant research questions and diverse databases.

40202710	Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell exosomes promote elastin production and acute skin wound healing via TGFβ1-Smad pathway.	Skin wound healing is a complex physiological process influenced by multiple factors, including the patient's overall health status. Exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSC-Exos) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing wound repair. This study investigates the mechanisms through which hUCMSC-Exos facilitate skin wound healing and evaluates their potential application in combination with hydrogels for clinical treatment. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF-1) were treated with varying concentrations of hUCMSC-Exos to evaluate their impact on cell proliferation, assessed via the CCK-8 assay. Exosome uptake by HFF-1 cells was visualized using PKH-26 dye staining, while flow cytometry was employed to analyze cell cycle changes. Cell migration was evaluated through scratch and Transwell assays. Gene expression levels of Collagen I, Elastin, and Fibronectin were quantified by qRT-PCR, while Elastin secretion was measured by ELISA. Western blotting was used to examine proteins in the TGFβ1-Smad signaling pathway. The role of SP1 in regulating Elastin gene expression was investigated by testing the SP1 inhibitor Plicamycin and examining hUCMSC-Exos ability to counteract its effect. Additionally, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed to analyze SP1 binding at the Elastin gene promoter. In vivo, the efficacy of hUCMSC-Exos combined with hydrogels in promoting wound healing was assessed using a mouse skin wound model. hUCMSC-Exos significantly enhanced HFF-1 cell proliferation at concentrations exceeding 1 × 10⁹ particles/mL and increased the proportion of cells in the S and G2/M phases. HFF-1 cells readily absorbed these exosomes, leading to improved cell migration. Treatment with hUCMSC-Exos upregulated the gene expression of Collagen I, Fibronectin, and Elastin. The SP1 inhibitor Plicamycin reduced Elastin gene expression, an effect that was reversed by hUCMSC-Exos. In vivo, the combination of hUCMSC-Exos and hydrogels accelerated wound healing, enhanced collagen organization, and promoted the formation of elastic fibers and blood vessels. hUCMSC-Exos facilitate skin wound healing by promoting SP1 binding to the Elastin gene promoter, thereby upregulating Elastin expression and supporting extracellular matrix remodeling. These findings suggest a promising therapeutic role for hUCMSC-Exos in clinical applications for wound healing.
40202709	Successful treatment of MPO-ANCA positive crescentic IgA nephropathy/IgA vasculitis with nephritis potentially triggered by a COVID-19 vaccine in a young adult female using corticosteroids, rituximab, and avacopan.	An 18-year-old female presented with palpable purpura nine months before her hospital admission, which first appeared 1 month after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and recurred intermittently. One month prior to admission, she developed macrohematuria, abdominal pain, and a loss of appetite. Occult blood in urine had been noted during high school health check-ups. Upon admission, she continued to have macrohematuria, along with renal dysfunction and a nephritic urinalysis, serum myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA) positivity. A renal biopsy revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis with mesangial and endocapillary hypercellularity, and dominant IgA deposition and electron-dense deposits in the mesangial regions. The diagnosis was IgA nephropathy (IgAN) or IgA vasculitis with nephritis (IgAVN), with a possible overlap of MPO-ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. Treatment began with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and prednisolone. After the diagnosis, rituximab (RTX) and avacopan were added to the regimen. Within two months, renal function, hematuria, and MPO-ANCA levels had normalized, and proteinuria was almost fully resolved by 13 months. If IgAN/IgAVN and ANCA-associated vasculitis were indeed triggered by the COVID-19 vaccination in this case, it is plausible that both conditions share similar pathologic mechanisms. This case emphasizes the need for a reliable laboratory method to detect pathogenic ANCA to guide both induction and maintenance therapy. Further investigation into the effectiveness of the ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis treatment protocol including corticosteroids, RTX, and avacopan in managing crescentic IgAN/IgAVN could offer valuable insights into improving patient care.
40202708	Understanding the Heterogeneity of Maltreatment Effect: the Role of Temperamental Sensitivity.	Despite the impact of maltreatment on child psychopathology, research has shown that the effects of maltreatment can vary depending on individual characteristics. Guided by differential susceptibility theory, this multi-method longitudinal study examined the role of temperamental sensitivity in shaping the relation between maltreatment and the development of child psychopathology over time. Participants included 316 maltreated and 269 non-maltreated children who attended a research summer camp and were followed over two measurement occasions spaced roughly one year apart (Wave 1: M<sub>age</sub> = 9.35 years old; 47.1% girls, 66.7% Black, 21.1% White). Maltreatment status and timing were determined via examination of Department of Human Services records for the maltreated group. Camp counselors rated temperamental sensitivity at the first wave using the Temperamental Sensitivity Q-scale. Child internalizing and externalizing problems were rated by counselors at both measurement occasions. Findings indicated that maltreatment, whether measured broadly or by developmental timing (reflecting early onset and prolonged exposure), was linked to greater increases in externalizing problems over time. Greater temperamental sensitivity was associated with greater decreases in externalizing problems but greater increases in internalizing problems. The relation between childhood maltreatment and changes in internalizing problems was moderated by temperamental sensitivity. While children with high temperamental sensitivity showed higher increases in internalizing problems regardless of maltreatment experiences, children with lower temperamental sensitivity exhibited greater increases in internalizing problems only if exposed to childhood maltreatment. These findings highlight the role of temperamental sensitivity in high-risk contexts and provide a more nuanced understanding of the impact of childhood maltreatment.

40202705	The use of isomerases and epimerases for the production of the functional sugars mannose, allulose and tagatose from Fructose.	Fructose, a common monosaccharide in nature extensively utilized in the food industry, poses a risk of elevated chronic disease incidence with excessive consumption. The global movement for a healthier living has sparked a quest for sugar reduction in foodstuff. The growing concern regarding the adverse impact of excessive sugar consumption on public health has led to significant interest in investigating healthier sugar alternatives. Research efforts have refocused on converting fructose into high-value, reduced-calorie functional sugars. Fructose can undergo direct conversion into three such sugars-mannose, allulose, and tagatose-via a streamlined bioconversion process. Allulose and tagatose, epimers of fructose, are derivable directly from fructose through C-3 and C-4 epimerization processes, whereas mannose, the aldose isomer of fructose, can be synthesized via isomerization pathways. This article aims to present recent advancements in the physiological functions, production methods, and applications of functional sugars derived from fructose. Particularly, it focuses on the bioproduction of mannose, allulose, and tagatose from fructose, encompassing discussions on the recent progress in the related isomerases and epimerases, such as mannose isomerase/lyxose isomerase, ketose 3-epimerase, and tagatose 4-epimerase. This review will provide a fresh perspective on the high-value biological utilization of fructose resources.
40202704	Potential Roles of Natural Antioxidants in Modulating Neurodegenerative Disease Pathways.	Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are increasingly prevalent among aging populations. Oxidative stress contributes to these diseases, leading to cellular damage and neuronal death. Natural antioxidants are being explored as preventive measures. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of natural antioxidants in delaying the onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases by identifying their specific mechanisms of action. A comprehensive review of existing literature was conducted, focusing on studies that examine the role of natural antioxidants in neuroprotection. Key natural antioxidants, including flavonoids, polyphenls, vitamins C and E, and omega-3 fatty acids, were reviewed and analyzed for their bioavailability, mechanisms of action, and outcomes in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Additionally, clinical trials involving human subjects were considered to provide insights into the translational implications of antioxidant consumption. The findings suggest that several natural antioxidants exhibit neuroprotective properties by modulating oxidative stress, reducing inflammation, and promoting neuronal survival. For instance, flavonoids such as quercetin and resveratrol have shown promise in enhancing cognitive function and mitigating the pathophysiological alterations associated with neurodegeneration. In clinical studies, higher intakes of dietary antioxidants were correlated with a reduced risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders. Natural antioxidants offer potential for preventing neurodegenerative diseases by counteracting oxidative stress and maintaining cellular integrity. Overall, our report recommends that further research is needed to optimize dosages and understand their long-term benefits.
40202703	Theoretical and Experimental Analysis of 3-(4-{9-[4-(3, 4-Dicyanophenoxy) Phenyl]-9 h-Fluoren-9 Yl} Phenoxy) Phthalonitrile Interactions with Cobalt and Nickel Chlorides.	This study provides a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the interactions between 3-(4-{9-[4-(3, 4-dicyanophenoxy) phenyl]-9 H-fluoren-9-yl}phenoxy)phthalonitrile and metal chlorides, focusing specifically on nickel chloride (NiCl₂) and cobalt chloride (CoCl₂). Combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with various spectroscopic techniques and electrochemical methods, the research explores the binding mechanisms and the electronic changes induced by the metal chlorides. DFT calculations, using the B3LYP functional and a 6-31G basis set for ground-state optimization, revealed significant modifications in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap upon coordination with the metal chlorides, indicating notable shifts in the compound's electronic properties. Experimental data from UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the formation of metal-ligand complexes, with observed shifts in absorption and emission spectra that corresponded with theoretical predictions. Further electrochemical insights were obtained through cyclic voltammetry, demonstrating an enhanced electron transfer process due to the metal ion interactions. These findings highlight how the inclusion of NiCl₂ and CoCl₂ significantly influences the electronic and optical characteristics of the phthalonitrile compound, suggesting their potential applications in optoelectronic devices and catalytic systems. This multidisciplinary approach provides a deeper understanding of metal-organic interactions and emphasizes the compound's promise in material science applications.

In the last three decades, DNA sequencing of ancient animal osteological assemblages has become an important tool complementing standard archaeozoological approaches to reconstruct the history of animal domestication. However, osteological assemblages of key archaeological contexts are not always available or do not necessarily preserve enough ancient DNA for a cost-effective genetic analysis. Here, we develop an in-solution target-enrichment approach, based on 80-mer species-specific RNA probes (ranging from 306 to 1686 per species) to characterise (in single experiments) the mitochondrial genetic variation from eight domesticated animal species of major economic interest: cattle, chickens, dogs, donkeys, goats, horses, pigs and sheep. We also illustrate how our design can be adapted to enrich DNA library content and map the Y-chromosomal diversity within Equus caballus. By applying our target-enrichment assay to an extensive panel of ancient osteological remains, farm soil, and cave sediments spanning the last 43 kyrs, we demonstrate that minimal sequencing efforts are necessary to exhaust the DNA library complexity and to characterise mitogenomes to an average depth-of-coverage of 19.4 to 2003.7-fold. Our assay further retrieved horse mitogenome and Y-chromosome data from Late Pleistocene coprolites, as well as bona fide mitochondrial sequences from species that were not part of the probe design, such as bison and cave hyena. Our methodology will prove especially useful to minimise costs related to the genetic analyses of maternal and paternal lineages of a wide range of domesticated and wild animal species, and for mapping their diversity changes over space and time, including from environmental samples.
40202700	Management of Late-Onset Rheumatoid Arthritis with Treat-to-Target Strategy.	The incidence of patients with late-onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) is increasing. The clinical diagnosis of LORA is essentially the same as that of young-onset rheumatoid arthritis (YORA), but special attention should be paid to the differences in clinical features between LORA and YORA. Undertreatment of LORA can lead to reduced physical function and increased societal burden. The treat-to-target strategy has been successfully applied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but evidence supporting this strategy is still insufficient for LORA. A wide range of factors should be considered and evaluated in addition to age and RA-related factors, including comorbidity/organ damage, psycho-neurological factors, socio-economic factors and frailty. Considering the proportion of patients with LORA achieving clinical remission or low disease activity in observational studies, the treat-to-target strategy could be stratified by age. Patients with LORA aged < 75 years are treated according to the treat-to-target algorithm used for all patients with RA, with clinical remission as the main target and low disease activity as the alternative target. In patients with LORA aged ≥ 75 years, the initial main target is set at low disease activity, which can be escalated to clinical remission with appropriate adaptation of treatment if a favourable balance of effectiveness and safety is struck at the time of achieving low disease activity by 6 months of treatment. Evidence of the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of methotrexate, biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, Janus kinase inhibitors and glucocorticoids in patients with LORA is accumulating, but further research is warranted.

40202694	Spatial and temporal classification and prediction of aspen probability in boreal forests using machine learning algorithms.	Mapping and classifying the probability of occurrence of Populus tremula L. (aspen) in boreal forests is a complex task for sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation. As a key broadleaved species in the taiga region, aspen supports both forestry and local biodiversity habitats. This study introduces a methodology to predict aspen presence using Sentinel- 2 satellite data and machine learning, combining binary classification (presence/absence) with probability estimation. We utilized spectral features (e.g., NDVI, EVI, SAVI) extracted from Sentinel- 2 imagery, employing a logistic regression model to classify aspen occurrence. To assess feature importance, we applied Permutation Importance (PI) and SHAP, enhancing model interpretability and ensuring transparency in identifying influential factors for forest management applications. Results revealed the significant role of spectral features in determining aspen growth probability. SAVI exhibited a strong effect on classification accuracy due to its soil correction capability, while EVI and NDVI proved highly important in summer, reflecting seasonal vegetation dynamics. High EVI values often indicate complex vegetation and conifer biomass, whereas aspen, with its distinct canopy and phenology, shows lower EVI compared to conifers. NDVI, tied to aspen's photosynthetic activity, remained a reliable indicator in mixed taiga forests. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 94.77% with XGBoost and 95.03% with Random Forest across all seasons, demonstrating robust performance. This reliable aspen distribution data aids forestry planning, such as harvesting, and the algorithm automates inventorying and mapping aspen stands, reducing reliance on labor-intensive ground surveys.

Given the side effects of systemic antiviral therapy, development of an approved topical antiviral agent for CMV corneal endotheliitis is desirable. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of topical 0.15% GCV gel, ROH-101, in the treatment of CMV corneal endotheliitis in Japanese patients.
40202691	Wolbachia Offers Protection Against Two Common Natural Viruses of Drosophila.	Wolbachia pipientis is a maternally transmitted endosymbiont infecting more than half of terrestrial arthropod species. Wolbachia can express parasitic phenotypes such as manipulation of host reproduction and mutualist phenotypes such as protection against RNA virus infections. Because Wolbachia can invade populations by reproductive manipulation and block virus infection, it is used to modify natural insect populations. However, the ecological importance of virus protection is not yet clear, especially due to scarce information on Wolbachia protection against viruses that are common in nature. We used systemic infection to investigate whether Wolbachia protects its host by suppressing the titer of DMELDAV and DMelNora virus, two viruses that commonly infect Drosophila melanogaster flies in natural populations. Antiviral protection was tested in three systems to assess the impact of Wolbachia strains across species: (1) a panel of Wolbachia strains transfected into Drosophila simulans, (2) two Wolbachia strains introgressed into the natural host D. melanogaster, and (3) two native Wolbachia strains in their natural hosts Drosophila baimaii and Drosophila tropicalis. We showed that certain Wolbachia strains provide protection against DMelNora virus and DMELDAV, and this protection is correlated with Wolbachia density, which is consistent with what has been observed in protection against other RNA viruses. Additionally, we found that Wolbachia does not protect its original host, D. melanogaster, from DMELDAV infection. While native Wolbachia can reduce DMELDAV titers in D. baimaii, this effect was not detected in D. tropicalis. Although the Wolbachia protection-induced phenotype seems to depend on the virus, the specific Wolbachia strain, and the host species, our findings suggest that antiviral protection may be one of the mutualistic effects that helps explain why Wolbachia is so widespread in arthropod populations.

RL for healthcare applications has been an exciting topic across multiple disciplines, including operations research, operations management, healthcare systems engineering, and data science. This review paper first provides a tutorial on the overall framework of RL, including its key components, training models, and approximators. Then, we present the recent advances of RL in the domain of healthcare operations management (HOM) and analyze the current trends. Our paper concludes by presenting existing challenges and future directions for RL in HOM.
40202689	Rheumatology speaker introductions suggest gender bias: an evaluation of the 2022 American college of rheumatology convergence meeting.	Despite gender parity in the rheumatology workforce, biases may persist in speaker introductions at professional rheumatology meetings, as observed in other specialties. We analyzed speaker introductions at an international rheumatology conference to assess the relationship between speaker and moderator gender on professional address. We analyzed video-archived speaker introductions from the 2022 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence meeting. Two reviewers coded speaker and moderator gender and form of address. We defined a "strict address" as use of "Doctor" or "Professor" and "lenient address" as full name with a professional title. Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression analyses examined associations between gender and forms of address. We analyzed 355 speakers (52.7% female, 47.3% male). Female speakers were less likely to receive a strict address by male moderators than male speakers (42.1% versus 57.9%, χ<sup>2</sup>=4.20, p = 0.030). In logistic regression models after adjusting for moderator gender, male speakers were 1.8 times more likely to receive a strict address versus female speakers [odds ratio (OR) 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.10, 2.82)]. Male moderators were 64% less likely to provide a strict address than female moderators [OR 0.46; 95% CI (0.29, 0.73)], adjusting for speaker gender. At an international rheumatology meeting, male (versus female) speakers received formal introductions more frequently, and male (versus female) moderators were less likely to provide them. Our results suggest persistent gender bias in speaker introductions, highlighting a need for standardized practices for session moderators to improve gender equity.

40202684	Wind turbine noise pollution reduces songbird vocal presence through changes in abundance.	Wind turbines add to global environmental pollution through prominent noise emissions, yet significant gaps remain in our understanding of the adverse effects of this noise on wildlife. In this study, we investigated the impact of this noise on the acoustic environment and songbird behavior by employing a unique "phantom wind turbine" method: broadcasting wind turbine noise in a natural habitat and monitoring the area before, during, and after the noise treatment. Specifically, we recorded calls and abundance of the Sardinian warbler, Curruca melanocephala momus. Our results reveal a significant reduction of 25% in the mean number of calls in the area, and 43% in mean bird abundance during the wind turbine noise treatment compared to before it. Controlling for abundance, we found no significant impact on calling effort per capita. Moreover, we found a 63% reduction in the probability of vocal presence at the heart of the noise-polluted area compared to the peripheries. However, once calls were present, their number was seemingly unaffected by sound level. We conclude that the reduction in bird abundance alters the acoustic environment without evidence of a direct change in warbler vocal activity. Our study highlights the need to consider noise pollution's ecological impacts when developing wind energy infrastructure to ensure sustainable development and protect declining songbird populations.
40202683	Empathy and Interest Towards an Autistic Person and the Effect of Disclosing the Diagnosis.	This study investigates the effects of disclosing an autism diagnosis on non-autistic listeners' empathy and social interest towards the autistic discloser. In Study 1, participants (non-autistic students in the social sciences/humanities [n = 99; 70% female]) watched a video of an autistic adult sharing an autobiographical story and reported how they believed the storyteller felt, following an introduction in which the storyteller did or did not disclose their diagnosis. Their evaluation of the storyteller's emotions was compared to the storyteller's own reports, resulting in an empathic accuracy measure. Participants reported how empathic they felt towards the storyteller and how socially interested they were in them. Studies 2 and 3 replicated the same procedure with STEM students (n = 96; 40% female), and with non-student adults (n = 76; 50% female) from diverse professional/occupational backgrounds, with an additional question about working together. In Study 1, participants in the self-disclosure condition demonstrated higher empathic accuracy, reported more empathy, and greater social interest in the storyteller. Study 2 showed a similar trend of higher empathy in the self-disclosure condition but no differences in social interest measures. Interest in working with the storyteller was higher in the self-disclosure condition. In Study 3, participants in the self-disclosure condition demonstrated higher empathy and greater interest in hearing another story and working with the storyteller. An individual's self-disclosure of an autism diagnosis improved others' ability to empathize with them and willingness to work with them. We discuss the complex effect of self-disclosure on social interest in an autistic person.

40202681	A switch-on chemo-photothermal nanotherapy impairs glioblastoma.	Judiciously combined modality approaches have proved highly effective for treating most forms of cancer, including glioblastoma. This study introduces a hybrid nanoparticle-based treatment designed to induce a synergistic effect. It employs repurposed celecoxib-loaded hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs) that are thermally activated by near-infrared laser irradiation to damage glioblastoma cells. The HNPs are constructed by covalently binding organic (ultra-small nanostructured lipid carriers, usNLCs) and inorganic nanoparticles (gold nanorods, AuNRs, with photothermal therapy capability), using c(RGDfK) that serves the dual purpose of a biolinker and a tumor-targeting peptide. The HNPs are further functionalized with transferrin (Tf) as a blood-brain barrier ligand denoted as HNPs<sup>Tf</sup>. Our comprehensive <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies have unveiled the remarkable capability of HNPs<sup>Tf</sup> to safely and specifically increase blood-brain barrier permeability through transferrin receptor interactions, facilitating precise nanoparticle accumulation in the tumor region within orthotopic tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, the orchestrated combination of chemo- and photothermal therapy has exhibited a substantial therapeutic impact on glioblastoma, showcasing a noteworthy 78% inhibition in tumor volume growth and an impressive 98% delay in tumor growth. Notably, this treatment approach has resulted in prolonged survival rates among tumor-bearing mice, accompanied by a favorable side effect profile. Overall, our findings unequivocally demonstrate that celecoxib-loaded HNPs<sup>Tf</sup> offer a game-changing, chemo-photothermal combination, unleashing a synergistic effect that significantly enhances both brain drug delivery and the efficacy of anti-glioblastoma treatments.

40202677	Invisible threats in soil: Microplastic pollution and its effects on soil health and plant growth.	Microplastics (MPs) are a significant environmental contaminant that increasingly threaten soil health and crop productivity in agricultural systems. This review explores the origins, migration patterns, and ecological impacts of MPs within soil environments, specifically examining their influence on soil structure, microbial communities, and nutrient cycles essential for plant growth. Despite the progress in understanding Microplastic (MP) pollution, gaps remain in assessing the long-term implications on soil stability, microbial biodiversity, and crop yield. Through bibliometric and synthesis analyses of recent studies, this paper identifies how MPs disrupt soil physical and chemical processes, alter microbial dynamics, and interfere with carbon and nitrogen cycles, resulting in reduced soil fertility and compromised crop health. Key findings reveal that MPs can infiltrate plant root systems, impair water and nutrient uptake, and even accumulate in plant tissues, causing oxidative stress, cellular dysfunction, and yield reduction. This work emphasizes the urgent need for refined environmental risk assessments and sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate MP pollution. This comprehensive synthesis offers a foundational perspective to guide future research and policy efforts in addressing MPs' environmental and agricultural impacts.
40202676	The current findings on the gut-liver axis and the molecular basis of NAFLD/NASH associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis.	Recent research has highlighted the complex relationship between gut microbiota, metabolic pathways, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression. Gut dysbiosis, commonly observed in NAFLD patients, impairs intestinal permeability, leading to the translocation of bacterial products like lipopolysaccharides, short-chain fatty acids, and ethanol to the liver. These microbiome-associated mechanisms contribute to intestinal and hepatic inflammation, potentially advancing NAFLD to NASH. Dietary habits, particularly those rich in saturated fats and fructose, can modify the microbiome composition, leading to dysbiosis and fatty liver development. Metabolomic approaches have identified unique profiles in NASH patients, with specific metabolites like ethanol linked to disease progression. While bariatric surgery has shown promise in preventing NAFLD progression, the role of gut microbiome and metabolites in this improvement remains to be proven. Understanding these microbiome-related pathways may provide new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for NAFLD and NASH. A comprehensive review of current literature was conducted using multiple medical research databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, ScienceDirect, Medline, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. The review focused on studies that examine the relationship between gut microbiota composition, metabolic pathways, and NAFLD progression. Key areas of interest included microbial dysbiosis, endotoxin production, and the influence of diet on gut microbiota. The analysis revealed that gut dysbiosis contributes to NAFLD through several mechanisms, diet significantly influences gut microbiota composition, which in turn affects liver function through the gut-liver axis. High-fat diets can lead to dysbiosis, altering microbial metabolic activities and promoting liver inflammation. Specifically, gut microbiota-mediated generation of saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, can activate liver macrophages and increase TNF-α expression, contributing to NASH development. Different dietary components, including cholesterol, fiber, fat, and carbohydrates, can modulate the gut microbiome and influence NAFLD progression. This gut-liver axis plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis, with the liver responding to gut-derived bacteria by activating innate and adaptive immune responses. Microbial metabolites, such as bile acids, tryptophan catabolites, and branched-chain amino acids, regulate adipose tissue and intestinal homeostasis, contributing to NASH pathogenesis. Additionally, the microbiome of NASH patients shows an elevated capacity for alcohol production, suggesting similarities between alcoholic steatohepatitis and NASH. These findings indicate that targeting the gut microbiota may be a promising approach for NASH treatment and prevention. Recent research highlights the potential of targeting gut microbiota for managing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The gut-liver axis plays a crucial role in NAFLD pathophysiology, with dysbiosis contributing to disease progression. Various therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating gut microbiota have shown promise, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions. Probiotics have demonstrated efficacy in human randomized controlled trials, while other interventions require further investigation in clinical settings. These microbiota-targeted therapies may improve NAFLD outcomes through multiple mechanisms, such as reducing inflammation and enhancing metabolic function. Although lifestyle modifications remain the primary recommendation for NAFLD management, microbiota-focused interventions offer a promising alternative for patients struggling to achieve weight loss targets.

40202673	Targeting diabetes with flavonoids from Indonesian medicinal plants: a review on mechanisms and drug discovery.	The rich biodiversity of Indonesia provides a wide variety of plants rich in flavonoids, which show promising potential as antidiabetic agents. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds recognized for their broad biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic effects. Traditional Indonesian medicinal plants such as Syzygium cumini, Moringa oleifera, and Curcuma longa are currently being studied for their flavonoid content and potential in diabetes treatment. Studies suggest that flavonoids can influence crucial pathways in diabetes management, including enhancing insulin sensitivity, boosting insulin production, and safeguarding pancreatic β cells against damage caused by oxidative stress. For example, quercetin and kaempferol, flavonoids in many Indonesian plants, have demonstrated potential for managing glucose metabolism and lowering high blood sugar levels. Additionally, these substances have been shown to inhibit enzymes such as α-glucosidase and α-amylase, which are involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates, thus aiding in the regulation of blood sugar levels after meals. The antioxidant qualities of flavonoids play a crucial role in fighting oxidative stress and are a significant contributor to the development of diabetes and related complications. Flavonoids help neutralize free radicals and enhance the body's antioxidant protection, reducing oxidative harm and promoting metabolic wellness. Additionally, their anti-inflammatory properties aid in reducing the chronic inflammation linked to insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. Formulation advancements, such as nanocarrier technology, have been explored to boost the effectiveness of flavonoid-based therapies. Due to its vast plant diversity, Indonesia offers a potential reservoir for new antidiabetic drugs, meriting additional research and development with the aim of this review providing new knowledge on the potential of flavonoids that can play a role in the treatment of diabetes.

Therefore, it is essential to investigate new approaches to improve pancreatic cancer treatment. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying existing gaps, this article provides a comprehensive overview of risk factors, pathology, conventional treatments, targeted therapies, and recent advancements in nanocarriers for its treatment, along with various clinical trials and patents that justify the safety and efficacy of innovative carriers for drug delivery systems. Ultimately, this review underscores the potential of these innovative formulations to improve outcomes and contribute significantly to the advancement of Pancreatic Cancer treatment. Together, these insights highlight nano-formulations as a promising frontier for effectively treating Pancreatic Cancer.
40202622	Morphological and molecular description of a novel species of Eimeria (Apicomplexa) that infects extraintestinal tissues of kiwi (Aves: Apteryx spp.).	Coccidia (Apiconmplexa) are naturally occurring and occasionally detrimental parasites of kiwi (Apteryx spp.), a unique, flightless bird species dependent upon conservation efforts for survival. Using morphological and molecular data, a new coccidia species, Eimeria koka n. sp., isolated from two closely related but geographically isolated kiwi host species, Apteryx rowi Tennyson et al. (rowi) and Apteryx mantelli Bartlett (North Island brown kiwi), is described. Oocysts are oval (20.8 × 15.9 μm) with a mean L/W ratio of 1.3, and a distinctive rough, crenellated brown oocyst wall (mean 1.2 μm), an oocyst residuum, 1-2 polar granules, and no micropyle. Sporocysts are ellipsoidal (11.6 × 6.3 μm) with a Stieda body and sporocyst residuum. Phylogenetic analysis of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) placed E. koka n. sp. in a separate clade to other Eimeria species previously identified from kiwi (Coker et al., Syst Parasitol 100(3):269-281, 2023). Comparison of DNA from oocysts with infected tissues from a single juvenile North Island brown kiwi confirmed parasitism of the kidney and lung tissues. This is the first Eimeria species identified from extraintestinal tissues in kiwi. Further molecular studies are recommended to determine the tissue distribution of E. koka n. sp. and other Eimeria species in kiwi.

Standard diagnostic tools, such as imaging techniques and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology, have limitations in detecting minimal tumor dissemination. GD2 synthase, a key enzyme that controls ganglioside synthesis, has been proposed as a promising marker for tumor dissemination in various cancers but its relevance in RB remains unexplored. This study evaluates GD2 synthase expression in RB tumors and CSF samples to assess its association with poor prognosis.
40202618	Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Alone or in Combination with Eszopiclone in Comorbid Insomnia and Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Randomized Trial.	We sought to assess the augmentation of brief behavioral therapy for insomnia (BBTI) with eszopiclone (ESZ) over BBTI alone for the treatment of chronic insomnia on sleep quality, sleep indices, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence in PTSD veterans with COMISA. The pilot trial involved 53 PTSD patients (46 males and 7 females, mean age 48.2±8.3 years) with COMISA randomized to combination therapy of BBTI plus 2 weeks of eszopiclone (2 mg/d) or BBTI alone with follow-up visits conducted at 6 and 24 weeks. The main outcome measure was sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A significant decrease in PSQI scores was observed between baseline and 24 weeks for BBTI plus ESZ (-5.24 [95% CI, -6.55 to -3.94]; p < 0.001) and BBTI-only (-5.45 [95%CI, -6.75 to -4.14]; p < 0.001). No significant group allocation effects x time interactions were detected. Similar improvements were recorded for ISI between baseline and 24 weeks (BBTI plus ESZ (-8.32 [95%CI, -10.51 to -6.14]; p < 0.001) and BBTI-only (-8.64 [95%CI, -10.88 to -6.41]; p < 0.001)) with no interaction effect between treatment groups x time. Combination therapy produced a higher remission rate of insomnia at 6 weeks, with both interventions achieving comparable rates at 24 weeks. Results of the mixed effect models for CPAP use revealed no group x time interaction effects. In patients with COMISA, the combination of eszopiclone with BBTI resulted in comparable improvement in sleep quality of life to that achieved with BBTI-only therapy. Although the addition of eszopiclone to BBTI conferred an early benefit in remission rate of insomnia relative to BBTI, both modalities achieved similar outcomes at long-term follow-up. Clinical Trial Registration This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT03937713).

The present systematic review and meta-analysis shed light on the frequency and distribution of the infection in a nationwide perspective.
40202614	Extracellular Vesicles from Dendritic Cells Protect Against Sporothrix brasiliensis Yeast Cells.	Sporotrichosis is an emerging subcutaneous mycotic zoonosis that affects the skin, lymphatic system, and other organs of humans and animals. Like other infectious fungal diseases, it becomes even more severe when it affects immunosuppressed patients. This infection has a global distribution and is endemic in some regions of Brazil and it is an important zoonotic public health problem. The disease is caused by a complex of at least four pathogenic species, including Sporothrix brasiliensis. The immunological response against these species has not yet been completely elucidated. Still, structures such as extracellular vesicles could carry important components that can contribute to the modulation and control of this significant infection. Thus, this work aims to analyze the participation of EVs from naïve dendritic cells and EVs from DCs previously primed with S. brasiliensis yeast and primed with EVs from the fungus in the immune response against experimental sporotrichosis in murine models. The groups that received EVs from DCs primed with S. brasiliensis or their EVs showed a significant decrease in fungal load compared to the negative control group. When we analyzed the cytokine profile in the skin of mice treated with EVs before infection, we observed an increase in IFN-ℽ, TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-10, mainly in animals previously treated with EVs from DCs cultivated with yeast cells. It is worth highlighting that all prophylactic protocols modulated and minimized fungal growth compared to the control; that is, EVs contributed to the control of the infection and acted in favor of the host, demonstrating a protective character.
40202613	Pre-fracture functional status and 30-day recovery predict 5-year survival in patients with hip fracture: findings from a prospective real-world study.	Disability overcomes mortality burden in older adults with hip fracture, expanding unhealthy lifespan. Building comprehensive assessment, pre-fracture functional status and 30-day post-surgical recovery are the most powerful predictors of 5-years survival. A tool supporting estimation of long-term survival may optimize the appropriate delivery of targeted interventions.
40202612	Hamate metacarpal injury: a case series and suggested algorithm for treatment.	Ulnar-sided carpometacarpal fractures and fracture-dislocations are relatively rare but significant injuries due to their impact on hand function. Hamate metacarpal injury represents a trauma to the ulnar corner of the hand. It could lead to fracture of the base of the fourth and fifth metacarpals with associated dislocation. The fourth and fifth carpometacarpal joints have a unique saddle-shaped structure consisting of the metacarpal bases and the distal articular surfaces of the hamate bone. This anatomical design ensures high congruence and significant stability while allowing a variety of movements essential for grip strength and hand dexterity. In this case series, we suggest the term "hamate metacarpal injury" to describe this injury better, as the injury includes dislocation, fracture-dislocation, or impaction to the joint.

The comparative efficacy of tenecteplase versus alteplase in achieving early recanalization (ER) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for large-vessel occlusion (LVO) remains uncertain.
40202610	ITGA1, the alpha 1 subunit of integrin receptor, is a novel marker of drug-resistant senescent melanoma cells in vitro.	Chemotherapy-induced senescence may promote drug resistance and treatment failure. Precise detection and elimination of senescent cancer cells is considered as a novel promising anticancer strategy. However, data on senescence-associated skin cancer cell surface markers as potential therapeutic targets are limited. In the present study, we have established two models of drug-induced senescence in vitro using DNA damaging chemotherapeutics, namely etoposide (0.75-5 µM) and cisplatin (1.25-5 µM), and ten skin cancer cell lines, both melanoma (n = 8, A375, G-361, MM370, SH-4, SK-MEL-1, MeWo, MM127, RPMI-7951) and non-melanoma (n = 2, A431, MCC13), to investigate the levels of 97 cell surface markers. Initial gene expression analysis revealed the increasing tendency in the levels of seven transcripts (ITGA1, ITGA3, VAMP3, STX4, ARMCX3, ULBP2, and PLAUR) and five transcripts (ITGA1, ITGA3, STX4, ARMCX3, and PLAUR) in five etoposide and cisplatin-induced senescent melanoma cell lines, respectively, compared to corresponding proliferating cells. Elevated pools of integrin α1 (ITGA1) were confirmed at mRNA and protein levels in eight drug-induced senescent melanoma cell lines. Similar pattern of changes in integrin α1 levels was not observed in drug-induced senescent non-melanoma skin cancer cells. Analysis using clinical melanoma samples also showed that the levels of ITGA1 and ITGA3 were correlated with the presence of melanoma cells in a section. We document that integrin α1 can be considered as a novel marker of drug-induced senescent melanoma cells. Thus, we postulate that new integrin α1-based targeted therapies can be designed and tested against drug-induced senescent melanoma cells.
40202609	Intracellular hydrogen sulfide induces stress granule formation and translational repression through eIF2α phosphorylation.	Acute exposure to high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a toxic gaseous substance, can cause potentially lethal respiratory damages. Stress granules (SGs) are cytoprotective membrane-less intracellular organelles formed transiently in response to various stressors. We examined SG formation and the underlying molecular mechanism following exposure to high concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S using human bronchial BEAS-2B (BEAS) and GFP-tagged G3BP1-stably transfected CHO cells. We first examined the changes in intracellular H<sub>2</sub>S concentration by NaHS exposure. Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that intracellular H<sub>2</sub>S levels rapidly increased after NaHS exposure and accumulated in cells dose dependently. In terms of the response to H<sub>2</sub>S taken up after exposure to 2.5-10 mM NaHS, both cell lines formed discrete SG assemblies within 1 h. SG formation induced by NaHS exposure was enhanced by treatment with glutathione (GSH) or thioredoxin (Trx) inhibitor but suppressed by treatment with a PERK inhibitor or integrated stress response inhibitor. Levels of phosphorylation of eIF2 α, which is essential for canonical SG formation, were significantly and dose-dependently increased in NaHS-exposed BEAS cells. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was further increased by GSH or Trx inhibitor treatment. These results suggest that GSH and Trx play protective roles in H<sub>2</sub>S-induced SG formation. PERK, a kinase of eIF2α, might activate the pathway partially. Levels of newly synthesized proteins were markedly reduced in NaHS-exposed cells. In summary, when humans inhale high concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>S is rapidly taken up by pulmonary cells and induces SG formation and translational repression via eIF2α phosphorylation, thereby protecting against cell death.
40202608	Physical and mental disability is evident 8 years after diagnosis in early rheumatoid arthritis despite contemporary medication and non-pharmacological interventions.	Early interventions are known to reduce disease activity and physical disability in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but less is known about mental health, especially in the era of early active pharmacotherapy. Consequently, we compared long-term physical and mental disability in an early RA cohort (1996-1998) with a later cohort (2006-2008).

The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical significance of CD3 + CD4 + T cells counts in CTD-ILD with IPA patients.
40202606	Applications of gene pair methods in clinical research: advancing precision medicine.	The rapid evolution of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized biomedical research, producing vast amounts of gene expression data that hold immense potential for biological discovery and clinical applications. Effectively mining these large-scale, high-dimensional data is crucial for facilitating disease detection, subtype differentiation, and understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression. However, the conventional paradigm of single-gene profiling, measuring absolute expression levels of individual genes, faces critical limitations in clinical implementation. These include vulnerability to batch effects and platform-dependent normalization requirements. In contrast, emerging approaches analyzing relative expression relationships between gene pairs demonstrate unique advantages. By focusing on binary comparisons of two genes' expression magnitudes, these methods inherently normalize experimental variations while capturing biologically stable interaction patterns. In this review, we systematically evaluate gene pair-based analytical frameworks. We classify eleven computational approaches into two fundamental categories: expression value-based methods quantifying differential expression patterns, and rank-based methods exploiting transcriptional ordering relationships. To bridge methodological development with practical implementation, we establish a reproducible analytical pipeline incorporating feature selection, classifier construction, and model evaluation modules using real-world benchmark datasets from pulmonary tuberculosis studies. These findings position gene pair analysis as a transformative paradigm for mining high-dimensional omics data, with direct implications for precision biomarker discovery and mechanistic studies of disease progression.
40202605	Sauna therapy in rheumatic diseases: mechanisms, potential benefits, and cautions.	Rheumatic diseases (RDs) present a major global health challenge, particularly in aging populations, due to chronic inflammation, progressive joint damage, and impaired mobility. While pharmacologic interventions, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), remain central to RDs management, concerns regarding their side effects and incomplete symptom relief have increased interest in complementary therapies. Sauna therapy, particularly its Finnish and infrared modalities, has emerged as a promising non-pharmacologic intervention with potential anti-inflammatory, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular benefits. Heat exposure modulates inflammatory pathways by reducing pro-inflammatory agents (TNF-α, CRP, PGE2, LTB4) while promoting IL-10-mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, sauna therapy mitigates oxidative stress and enhances neuroendocrine regulation, contributing to systemic health benefits. Clinical evidence points to benefits of sauna therapy related to alleviating pain, reducing stiffness, and improving mobility in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and osteoarthritis (OA). Some studies have demonstrated reductions in pain scores and inflammatory markers, improved physical function, and disease stability following infrared sauna exposure. Moreover, cardiovascular advantages of regular sauna use are particularly relevant for RD patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. Given the growing body of evidence supporting its therapeutic potential, sauna therapy represents a viable adjunctive strategy for RD management. Further research is warranted to optimize treatment protocols, assess long-term safety, and delineate patient-specific benefits. Integrating sauna therapy into comprehensive RD care may enhance symptom control, improve quality of life, and reduce reliance on pharmacologic interventions.
40202604	Evaluation of response to clopidogrel in patients with CYP2C19*2/*3 polymorphisms and its association with miR-19b expression.	Clopidogrel is a widely used antiplatelet drug for treating acute coronary syndrome. Its metabolism primarily involves the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, with CYP2C192 and CYP2C193 alleles associated with reduced metabolic activity. MicroRNAs, particularly miR-19b, have been linked to cardiovascular disease, but their role in clopidogrel metabolism remains unclear.
40202603	Risk of mortality and maternal status are key determinants of the dynamic use of cover by moose in a landscape characterized by forest harvesting.	Human-caused landscape disturbance is one of the most widespread threats to wildlife. Forest harvesting reduces canopy closure, an important component of habitat that allows ungulates to mitigate warm temperatures and deep snow. These pressures may be exacerbated by the warming temperatures and increased snowfall associated with climate change. Also, linear features that result from human activities increase the movement rate and efficiency of predators. We used LiDAR and GPS-collar data to test three hypotheses that explained the use of forest cover by female moose (Alces americanus) in a landscape characterized by extensive forest harvest; the Thermal Stress, Locomotion, and Direct Mortality Hypotheses. The risk of direct mortality by predation and during the licensed hunting season was the primary factor influencing the use of horizontal and vertical cover by moose. Moose used less horizontal cover when accompanied by a neonate and in areas with greater risk of predation by wolves. Maternal status of moose mediated their use of vertical cover to avoid predation. Moose also used more horizontal and vertical cover during peak hunting season and in the spring and summer. Our results suggest that the use of forest type and cover by moose differs, from open to closed, depending on the type of threat and reproductive status. When managing moose habitat, we recommend maintaining forests that vary in structure and cover, attributes often associated with a spatially adjacent mix of young and old forest.

40202601	NDM- or VIM-producing Citrobacter spp. in Poland, 2011-19: high genetic diversity with broader representation of ST8, ST18 and ST22 global clones.	This study focused on genomic epidemiology of metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Citrobacter spp. in Poland. It included 118 isolates with VIM (n = 100), NDM (n = 17) or IMP (n = 1) enzymes from 2011 to 19, largely C. freundii (n = 94) of 33 sequence types (STs). Three globally-spread STs were more prevalent, namely ST18 (n = 15), ST8 (n = 11) and ST22 (n = 10), each diversified clonally and by VIM and NDM determinants. Only few outbreaks were evidenced, indicating MBL presence to result mainly from independent acquisitions, consistent with co-identifications of Citrobacter isolates (n = 12) with other MBL-producing Enterobacterales. Despite lower outbreak potential, Citrobacter spp. constitute a significant MBL reservoir, requiring attention and surveillance.
40202600	Treatment of pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in a 4-month-old infant using a regimen of bedaquiline, delamanid, and contezolid.	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a significant global challenge, especially in children, where diagnosis and treatment are difficult. This report describes a 4-month-old male infant with pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (pre-XDR-TB) successfully treated with bedaquiline, delamanid, and contezolid. The patient, born prematurely, developed severe pulmonary TB after exposure to drug-resistant TB from the mother. After discontinuing the initial regimen due to adverse effects, the adjusted regimen resulted in negative TB culture conversion, significant pulmonary improvement, and no notable adverse effects.
40202599	COVID-19 evolution in pediatric emergency department patients in Madrid, Spain: a single-center, retrospective study.	COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, had a significant global impact since its emergence in December 2019. In Spain, the pandemic caused multiple waves of infections, with variations in clinical presentation and predominant viral strains. This study analyzed the evolution of COVID-19 in pediatric patients in a pediatric emergency department in Madrid (Spain), focusing on the changes in clinical manifestations over time.

40202597	Groundwater divide shifting due to pumping in a sector of the Doñana aquifer system (SW Spain): environmental implications.	The Doñana Natural Space (SW Spain) is considered one of the most important European wetlands, with many ecosystems depending on groundwater. As a consequence of intense groundwater withdrawals for urban use and, above all, irrigation, serious impacts have been observed in the eastern part of this aquifer, where the Doñana National Park is located. There is also groundwater exploitation in the western part of the aquifer, where a groundwater divide exists. The main goal of this work is to analyze the impact of groundwater withdrawals in this area. For this, the evolution of groundwater levels since 1968 in piezometers and pumping wells has been compiled and analyzed. This zone is characterized by the existence of a deep aquifer of high transmissivity, and a shallow aquifer with lower hydraulic conductivity, which behaves as an aquitard. Results show that pumping has caused a strong cone of depression in the deep aquifer, shifting the groundwater divide, and diverting water originally directed to the protected area, aggravating the overexploitation problems. Drawdowns in the shallow aquifer are lower and seem to be masked by the slow groundwater dynamic. However, a small lowering of the water table may cause severe impacts on such fragile ecosystems. The division of the aquifer for its management into six groundwater bodies belonging to two hydrographic districts has caused these important changes to go unnoticed until now. A proper coordination between the different water authorities managing groundwater and urgent adoption of remediation measures is essential.

40202595	Seasonal dynamics and enzyme profiles of diverse endophytic fungi in Sterculia urens Roxb.: insights into host-associated trends.	Sterculia urens Roxb., well known for its medicinal uses, remains largely unexplored in terms of its fungal endophytic communities. This study is the first comprehensive assessment of fungal endophyte diversity in S. urens. Sampling was conducted across different plant parts, seasons, and study sites. Molecular identification of fungal isolates was carried out using ITS sequencing. Additionally, colonization frequency and endophytic fungal diversity were analyzed. These isolates were evaluated for extracellular enzyme. A total of 31 different endophytic fungal species, representing 16 genera, were identified based on > 97% ITS sequence similarity. Colonization frequency was significantly influenced by season (P ≤ 0.0001), tissue type (P ≤ 0.0001), and site (P ≤ 0.0001). Diversity indices revealed a significant difference in relation to season and tissue type, but not with respect to location. Furthermore, this study reports, for the first time globally, the identification of Chaetomium meridiolense and Crinipellis wandoensis as endophytic fungi. Extracellular enzyme analysis revealed enzymatic activity in 29 morphotypes. The diverse enzymatic profiles of these fungal endophytes highlight their potential for various biotechnological applications. In addition, molecular and genomic investigations will provide a deeper understanding of the functional roles and symbiotic mechanisms of these fungal endophytes. Potential applications of this research include enhancing plant growth and stress tolerance, developing sustainable biofertilizers and biocontrol agents, promoting eco-friendly bioremediation strategies for dye-contaminated environments, and discovering novel enzymes suitable for industrial biotechnological processes.
40202594	De Novo Creation of Two Novel Spliceosomal Introns of RECG1 by Intronization of Formerly Exonic Sequences in Orchidaceae.	Spliceosomal introns are a key characteristic of eukaryotic genes. However, the origins and mechanisms of new spliceosomal introns remain elusive, and definitive case studies documenting intron creation are still limited. This study examined the RECG1 genes of 49 land plants, including 21 orchids and 28 non-orchid species. Sequence comparison revealed that the fourth intron of Gastrodia and Platanthera (Orchidaceae) is a newly gained spliceosomal intron, originating from the intronization of former exonic sequences. This intronization event was accompanied by the creation of novel recognizable GT/AG splice sites. In contrast, other orchid species lack the corresponding splice sites in the counterpart regions. Moreover, the secondary and tertiary protein structures implied that the intronization events do not affect the protein function. Given the diverse trophic modes of the two genera, we infer that relaxed selection may have contributed to the fluidity of gene structures. This study provides a typical example of de novo lineage-specific intron creation via intronization in orchids supported by multiple lines of evidence, and the two intronization events occurred independently in the same gene. This research enhances our understanding of gene evolution in orchids and provides valuable insights that may assist the annotation of structurally complex genes.
40202592	Trends, outcomes, and predictors of open conversion during minimally invasive radical nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: a national analysis from 2010 to 2020.	We evaluated trends, predictors, and outcomes of unplanned open conversion for patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) undergoing robotic radical nephroureterectomy (R-RNU) or laparoscopic RNU (L-RNU). The National Cancer Database was queried from 2010 to 2020 for patients with non-metastatic UTUC treated with RNU. Trends in surgical approach and conversion were evaluated. Demographics and outcomes including lymph node dissection, lymph node yield, positive surgical margins (PSM), prolonged length of stay (PLOS) (≥ 90th percentile), unplanned readmission (UR), and 30- and 90-day mortality were compared between converted and unconverted cases. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated predictors of conversion and whether conversion predicted adverse clinical outcomes. 25,523 cases were included (robotic = 40.4%, laparoscopic = 36.9%, open = 22.7%), where 3.2% and 9.2% of R-RNU and L-RNU cases were converted, respectively. From 2010 to 2020, robotic cases increased while open and laparoscopic approaches decreased, p < 0.001. A higher T-stage and a ureteral tumor site predicted conversion while a higher R-RNU and L-RNU facility volume, respectively, were protective against conversion, all p < 0.05. Compared to unconverted cases, conversion generally resulted in a higher rate of all adverse outcomes, and was predictive of 30-day mortality, PLOS, UR, and PSM, all p < 0.05. Conversion to open RNU is becoming less frequent but is more common with a laparoscopic approach. Oncologic complexity and facility surgical volume influence conversion rates which in turn are associated with higher rates of morbidity, mortality, and greater resource utilization when compared to unconverted cases.

40202589	A Network Based Model for Predicting Spatial Progression of Metastasis.	Metastatic cancer is reported to have a mortality rate of 90%. Understanding the underlying principles of metastasis and quantifying them through mathematical modelling provides insights into potential treatment regimes. This work presents a partial differential equation based mathematical model embedded on a network, representing the organs and the blood vessels between them, with the aim of predicting likely secondary metastatic sites. Through this framework the relationship between metastasis and blood flow and between metastasis and the diffusive behaviour of cancer is explored. An analysis of the model predictions showed a good correlation with clinical data for some cancer types, particularly for cancers originating in the gut and liver. The model also predicts an inverse relationship between blood velocity and the concentration of cancer cells in secondary organs. Finally, for anisotropic diffusive behaviour, where the cancer experiences greater diffusivity in one direction, metastatic efficiency decreased. This is aligned with the clinical observation that gliomas of the brain, which typically show anisotropic diffusive behaviour, exhibit fewer metastases. The investigation yields some valuable results for clinical practitioners and researchers-as it clarifies some aspects of cancer that have hitherto been difficult to study, such as the impact of differing diffusive behaviours and blood flow rates on the global spread of cancer. The model provides a good framework for studying cancer progression using cancer-specific information when simulating metastasis.
40202588	Integration of Conjugated Linoleic Acid-Producing Probiotic Strains Having Anti-adipogenic Properties with Honey and Oyster Mushrooms for the Formulation of Non-dairy Probiotic Beverage.	Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been linked to various health benefits, including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and anti-obesity effects. Obesity, marked by abnormal fat deposition, increases the risk of metabolic disorders such as cardiovascular diseases and type-2 diabetes. Natural anti-adipogenic modulators with insulin sensitivity are one of the approaches to address the issue. In the present study, four distinct CLA-producing probiotic strains (Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LUL:01, Latilactobacillus curvatus LGM:16, Lactiplantibacillus paraplantarum LRJ1:09, and Enterococcus faecalis LJM:05) were assessed in vitro for their potential anti-adipogenic properties using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Out of four strains, LGM:16 inhibited lipid accumulation (100.27%), reduced intracellular triglyceride content (168.42, 168.16, and 153.66 mg/dL in a dose-dependent manner), and enhanced insulin sensitivity (32.23%) by increasing glucose uptake. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed the expression genes (PPARγ, C/EBPα, and GLUT-4) in LGM:16 strain. Consequently, LGM: 16 was used to develop a non-dairy probiotic formulation incorporating honey and Pleurotus ostreatus mushroom, ensuring a probiotic count above the minimum recommended level of 6 Log10 CFU/mL. Further, response surface methodology optimized probiotic beverage formulation to achieve favorable nutritional, good sensory profile, antioxidant, and anti-obesity activity, making it a promising candidate for health benefits.

40202586	Novel TEAD1 Inhibitor VT103 Enhances Dabrafenib Efficacy in BRAF V600E Mutated Lung Adenocarcinoma via Survivin Downregulation.	The BRAF V600E mutation is observed in 2% of the patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and combination therapy targeting BRAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) is the standard treatment for this population. However, acquired resistance inevitably develops, which highlights the need for novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we established a patient-derived BRAF V600E-mutated LUAD cell line, KTOR81, and investigated the potential of targeting the Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)/transcriptional enhanced associate domain 1 (TEAD1) pathway in combination with BRAF inhibition. We observed that the novel TEAD1 inhibitor VT103 enhanced the efficacy of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in KTOR81 cells and xenograft models. The combination of dabrafenib and VT103 downregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin, which is transcriptionally regulated by the YAP1/TEAD1 complex, leading to increased apoptosis. Moreover, we used a LUAD tissue microarray to compare the staining patterns of YAP1, TEAD1, and survivin, and examined their association with prognosis. These analyses revealed a strong correlation between YAP1, TEAD1, and survivin expression in LUAD, suggesting the relevance of the YAP1/TEAD1-survivin axis beyond BRAF V600E-mutated cases. While no statistically significant association was observed between survivin expression and prognosis, when limited to driver oncogene-positive patients, high survivin expression was suggested to be associated with poor prognosis. These findings provide preclinical evidence for the efficacy of combining TEAD1 inhibition with BRAF-targeted therapy in BRAF V600E-mutated LUAD and highlight the YAP1/TEAD1-survivin axis as a potential therapeutic target especially in the driver oncogene-positive LUAD patients.

40202581	Negative cooperativity in the UHRF1 TTD-PHD dual domain masks the contributions of cation-π interactions between trimethyllysine and the TTD aromatic cage.	UHRF1 is a promising epigenetic target in oncology, but inhibitor development has proven challenging due to the interplay between its tandem Tudor domain (TTD) and plant homeodomain (PHD). The TTD binds trimethyllysine (Kme3) at position 9 while the PHD binds Arg at position 2 on histone 3. Herein, we report how the PHD influences TTD recognition of the histone 3 tail containing Kme3 (H3K9me3) versus its neutral isostere, tert-butyl norleucine (tBuNle). Our findings show that the dual domain binds both peptides equally, supporting tBuNle's potential for inhibitor development. However, unexpectedly, the binding mechanism of H3K9me3 differs between the single and dual domains. In the TTD alone, Kme3 is bound in the aromatic cage via electrostatically tunable cation-π interactions, but in the dual domain, Kme3 binding is independent of electrostatics in the aromatic cage-an unprecedented observation. Computational studies suggest cation-π interactions should contribute in both cases. The contrasting experimental and computational results point to an unusual example of negative chelate cooperativity: interactions between the histone and PHD mask the mechanism of TTD recognition of K9me3. This work underscores the complexity of histone PTM readout in multi-domain proteins and demonstrates the first example of a masked cation-π interaction.

The use of silica nanoparticles as a precursor could lead to the creation of a more homogeneous distribution of cations and dopant ions. This uniform distribution could facilitate the proper infusion of dopants into the crystal host, resulting in improved emission. The phosphor exhibited high thermal stability, with 56% of its luminescence intensity maintained even at 190 °C compared to room temperature. To reduce thermal stress, a flexible remote phosphor has been developed successfully using optimized silica nanoparticles assisted Ba<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>2+</sup> phosphor.

Older people are often cared for by family caregivers who may experience a variety of challenges. Robots may be helpful. Understanding the attitudes of family caregivers in this context is essential as they are a major factor in robot use. To date, most studies on family caregivers ' attitudes toward robot assistance in elder care have been conducted in East Asian or Western societies, but as such perceptions are affected by culture, in the present study, we investigated the attitudes of Arab family caregivers in Israel. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty Arab family caregivers who provide care to ADL (activities of daily living)-dependent older people. All participants were Muslim and adult children of a person requiring care. The majority (75 per cent) were women, and the average age was fifty-one. Analysis of the interviews revealed two main themes: (1) Attitudes: Most participants strongly objected to the assistance of a robot in caring for older people, and perceived it as a violation of family values; and (2) Reasons for attitudes: Participants preferred human care over robot care due to concerns previously documented among other populations regarding system malfunctions, the risk of loneliness, and lack of technological literacy. We also identified a unique factor: the family 's moral obligation to care for older people. The absolute opposition of family members to the use of a robot in the care of older people requires the development of intervention programmes to increase technological literacy among family caregivers and reduce negative attitudes. These programmes need to address the opportunities and risks associated with the use of robots, and how these risks can be avoided.

40202565	Interplay between LncRNAs and autophagy-related pathways in leukemia: mechanisms and clinical implications.	Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that removes protein clumps and defective organelles, thereby promoting cell equilibrium. Growing data suggest that dysregulation of the autophagic pathway is linked to several cancer hallmarks. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are key parts of gene transcription, are increasingly recognized for their significant roles in various biological processes. Recent studies have uncovered a strong connection between the mutational landscape and altered expression of lncRNAs in the tumor formation and development, including leukemia. Research over the past few years has emphasized the role of lncRNAs as important regulators of autophagy-related gene expression. These RNAs can influence key leukemia characteristics, such as apoptosis, proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and angiogenesis, by modulating autophagy-associated signaling pathways. With altered lncRNA expression observed in leukemia cells and tissues, they hold promise as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The current review focuses on the regulatory function of lncRNAs in autophagy and their involvement in leukemia, potentially uncovering valuable therapeutic targets for leukemia treatment.
40202564	Is granulomatous mastitis a rheumatologic disease? The emerging role of rheumatologists in disease management.	Granulomatous mastitis (GM) is a rare, chronic inflammatory breast disease characterized by non-caseating granulomas. While its etiology remains unclear, emerging evidence supports an immune-mediated pathogenesis with parallels to autoimmune rheumatic diseases. This review explores the inflammatory mechanisms underlying GM, emphasizing the roles of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and the Th17 axis in sustaining granulomatous inflammation. Traditional management has centered on surgical excision, but high recurrence rates have prompted a shift toward immunosuppressive therapy, particularly corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Recent studies suggest that DMARDs offer effective disease control while minimizing the adverse effects of long-term steroid use. Given the autoimmune overlap and the efficacy of targeted immunomodulatory therapy, rheumatologists play an increasingly critical role in GM management. This review advocates for increased awareness of GM within the rheumatology community and underscores the need for further research to refine therapeutic strategies.
40202563	Microrchidia OsMORC6 Positively Regulates Cadmium Tolerance and Uptake by Mediating DNA Methylation in Rice.	Rice (Oryza sativa) is an extremely important global food crop. However, cadmium (Cd) contamination in paddy fields poses a serious threat to human health worldwide. To generate low-Cd or Cd-free rice germplasms, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in Cd tolerance, uptake, and translocation from soil to plant. In this study, we identify three Microrchidia proteins, OsMORC6a, OsMORC6b, and OsMORC6c, that regulate Cd tolerance and accumulation, although they do not alter the translocation of Cd from roots to shoots. Knockout of all three genes results in reducing Cd accumulation and increasing sensitivity to Cd stress. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis reveals 1,127 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the morc6abc mutants, which are significantly enriched in 'plant-type cell wall' and 'oxidoreductase activity' pathways. Through an integrating DNA methylome and transcriptome data, we identify 247 hyper-DMR-associated DEGs and 325 hypo-DMR-associated DEGs in morc6abc mutants. Gene Ontology (Go) enrichment analysis reveals that OsMORC6 proteins positively regulate Cd tolerance and uptake by mediating DNA methylation, which regulates the proper expression of genes related to plant cell wall and oxidative stress under Cd stress. Taken together, our findings reveal novel genes that mediate Cd tolerance and accumulation by affecting DNA methylation, offering valuable resource for breeding low-Cd or Cd-free rice germplasms.
40202562	Dexmedetomidine Promotes Angiogenesis After Ischemic Stroke Through the NRF2/HO-1/VEGF Pathway.	Neurological dysfunction following stroke presents a significant challenge for patients. Recent studies suggest that angiogenesis can improve neurological function and enhance neuronal survival after ischemic stroke. Dexmedetomidine exhibits neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms; therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether it promotes angiogenesis and improves neurological function after stroke. A mouse model of ischemic stroke was developed by embolizing the middle cerebral arteries. Neurological function was assessed using scoring methods, the water maze test, and histological analyses, including Nissl and hematoxylin and eosin staining, to evaluate neuronal survival in the ischemic penumbra. Angiogenesis was observed through immunofluorescence staining, whereas pathway protein expression was analyzed via western blotting. Additionally, a model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation was established in mouse cerebral microvascular cells to conduct angiogenesis-related experiments. Dexmedetomidine reduced cerebral infarction size, alleviated neurological damage, promoted angiogenesis in the ischemic penumbra, and decreased neuronal death through the Nrf2/HO-1/VEGF pathway. However, these neuroprotective effects were reversed by the NRF2 inhibitor ML385. In vitro, dexmedetomidine enhanced the proliferation, migration, and tube-formation of cerebral microvascular cells in mice. ML385 also reversed the protective effects of dexmedetomidine against hypoxia and glucose deprivation-induced axonal damage. Dexmedetomidine enhances angiogenesis, reduces neuronal damage, and promotes cerebral microvascular cell migration and tube formation in the ischemic penumbra of an ischemic stroke mouse model through the Nrf2/HO-1/VEGF pathway.
40202561	Mutated sigma-1R disrupts cell homeostasis in dHMN patient cells.	Hereditary-Motor-Neuropathies (dHMNs) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurological disorders characterized by degeneration of peripheral motoneurons. We previously identified two sigma-1 receptor (Sigma-1R) variants (p.E138Q; p.E150K) in dHMN Italian patients that behave as "loss-of-function" mutations in neuroblastoma cell lines. Here, we characterize the functional effects of Sigma-1R mutation in primary fibroblasts from homozygous patients bearing the E150K mutation, and matched controls, by performing biochemical, gene expression, immunofluorescence and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analysis. Our results show that Sigma-1R expression and distribution is significantly altered in patient fibroblasts. Moreover, patient cells present a general derangement of cell homeostasis as revealed by impairment of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, disorganization of the ER-mitochondria tethers, enhancement of the autophago-lysosomal pathway and blunting of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism compared to controls. These findings highlight the crucial role of Sigma-1R in the maintenance of cell and protein homeostasis, inter-organelle communication and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, supporting the notion that Sigma-1R is protective for motor neuron activity and its down-regulation and/or loss-of-function, as in the case of the E150K mutation, might play the key role in the neuronal degeneration in dHMN patients.
40202560	A Risk-Structured Model of the Influence of Mental Health on Opioid Addiction.	In 2021, over 80,000 of the 107,622 overdose deaths in the United States involved opioids, with opioid use disorder (OUD) and fatal overdoses imposing economic costs exceeding $1 trillion in 2017. Mathematical modeling provides an important tool for understanding the dynamics of the opioid epidemic and evaluating the potential benefits of different treatment and prevention strategies. In particular, we extend the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered paradigm for modeling infectious diseases to the opioid crisis. While existing compartmental models of OUD often assume equal risk of addiction across individuals, this assumption overlooks the significant role of risk heterogeneity. Unlike previous models that assume uniform addiction risk, our model incorporates risk stratification to account for the disproportionate burden among individuals with mental health disorders, who represent 20% of the U.S. population but account for over half of opioid prescriptions and misuse. Our compartmental model distinguishes between addiction pathways initiated by prescription opioids and those driven by social influences. Using existing data, we calibrate the model to estimate key parameters and quantify the impact of risk heterogeneity, offering insights to the addiction process.

40202558	Chlorophyllin and sunlight against Penicillium digitatum: exploring Photodynamic Inactivation as a green postharvest technology in citriculture.	Green mold, induced by the fungal phytopathogen Penicillium digitatum, is one of the major causes of postharvest losses in citriculture. To minimize mold infections oranges are treated harshly with fungicides, edible coatings, or physical treatment, leading to evolving resistance, low consumer acceptance, or reduced crop quality, respectively. Photodynamic Inactivation (PDI) might represent an ecofriendly alternative for treatment of P. digitatum spoilage, especially if based on natural photosensitizers. Here, we introduce PDI using three formulations consisting of different concentrations of the natural photosensitizer sodium magnesium chlorophyllin (Chl), Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA as cell-wall permeabilizing agent and a surfactant for postharvest treatment of P. digitatum. As experimental model systems (i) mycelial spheres in liquid suspension, (ii) fungal spores or (iii) a newly developed experimental setup using orange peel plugs are employed. Illumination was done by an LED device with a main wavelength of 395 nm (106 J cm<sup>-2</sup>). The lowest concentrated photosensitizer formulation (219 µM Chl) effectively photokilled samples of model systems (i) and (ii) with 100% and 62.5% dead samples, respectively. Orange peel plugs of model system (iii) were best disinfected using the mid-concentrated formulation (475 µM Chl, 70% dead samples). Additionally, model systems (ii) and (iii) were treated with the mid-concentrated formulation and illuminated by sunlight. Eradication of P. digitatum liquid spore culture (ii) was enhanced when illuminating with sunlight (300 J cm<sup>-2</sup>). Further, a complete disinfection of orange peel plugs (iii, 100% dead samples) was achieved with sunlight (300 J cm<sup>-2</sup>). To evaluate the antioxidant scavenging activity post-PDI treatment with LED light (395 nm, 106 J cm<sup>-2</sup>) a DPPH assay was performed on model system (iii). The treatment with the mid- and low-concentrated Chl formulations and LED light showed little to no change in DPPH scavenging activity when compared to the not-illuminated controls. Concisely, with this study we demonstrate that PDI using Chl-based photosensitizer formulations has an in vitro antifungal effect against P. digitatum, without altering the antioxidant scavenging activity of the fruit. Different model systems, to mimic the different stages of green mold infection, were effectively treated with Chl and sunlight.

40202554	Synthesis of porphyrin-formononetin derivatives and their anti-tumor activity studies.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received much attention in cancer treatment because of its low toxicity and side effects. In this study, we successfully synthesized 14 novel porphyrin-formononetin derivatives. In reactive oxygen species detection experiments, the target compounds 4a-6d caused a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of DPBF compared with the porphyrin parent and formononetin feedstock after illumination, and it was found that the target compound had a higher ROS quantum yield, among which the quantum yield of compound 6c was higher. In the in vitro anti-tumor activity assay, the target compounds 4a-6d exhibited a certain degree of growth inhibition against six cancer cells (A549, MDA-MB-231, HCT-116, HGC-27, DU145, and TCCSUP) under light conditions, whereas the cytotoxicity of the target compounds against the normal cells H9c2 was less. The results of the scratch assay showed that 6c could inhibit the growth of tumor cells by inhibiting the migration of DU145 cells. The experimental results indicate that the target compounds achieve the synergistic effect of PDT and chemotherapy.
40202553	The perspective of targeting cancer cell metabolism: combination therapy approaches.	Cancer cells are considered the most adaptable for their metabolic status, which supports growth, survival, rapid proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis in a nutrient-deficient microenvironment. Since the discovery of altered glucose metabolism (aerobic glycolysis), which is generally known as a part of metabolic reprogramming and an innate trait of cancer cells, in 1930 via Dr. Otto Warburg, numerous studies have endeavored to recognize various aspects of cancer cell metabolism and find new methods for efficiently eradicating described cells by targeting their energy metabolism. In this way, the outcomes have mainly been promising. Accordingly, outlining the related results will indeed assist us in making a definitive path for developing targeted therapy strategies based on cancer cell-altered metabolism. The present study reviews the key features of cancer cell metabolism and treatment strategies based on them. It emphasizes the importance of targeting cancer cell dysregulated metabolic pathways that influence the cell energy supply and manage cancer cell growth and survival. This trial also introduces a multimodal therapeutic strategy hypothesis, a potential next-generation combination therapy approach, and suggests interdisciplinary research to recognize the complexities of cancer metabolism and exploit them for designing more efficacious cancer therapeutic strategies.

40202551	Cognitive decline limits compensatory resource allocation within the aged swallowing network.	Cognitive decline has been postulated to predispose to presbyphagia but the neurophysiological basis of this interaction is unclear. To investigate the role of cognition for compensatory resource allocation within the swallowing network and behavioral swallowing performance in dual-task cognitive and motor interference in ageing, volunteers ≥ 70 years of age without preexisting diseases causing dysphagia were investigated using Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) including a cognitive and motor dual-task paradigm and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The neural correlates of swallowing during dual-task were characterized using magnetoencephalography. Results were related to cognitive function. Sixty-three participants (77.7 ± 6.1 years) underwent FEES, of which 40 additionally underwent MEG. Both cognitive and motor dual-tasks interfered with swallowing function resulting in an increase in pharyngeal residue and premature bolus spillage. The extent of swallowing deterioration ("dual-task cost") was associated with cognitive decline (cognitive dual-task: Spearman's rho =  - 0.39, p = 0.002; motor dual-task: Spearman's rho =  - 0.25, p = 0.046). When challenged with dual-tasking participants with regular cognition showed compensatory stronger and broader brain activation in cortical pre- and supplementary motor planning areas as well as in frontal executive regions within the cortical swallowing network (p = 0.004) compared to participants with cognitive deficits. They also performed better in the competing cognitive and motor dual-task and showed fewer incorrect responses (p = 0.028). Oropharyngeal swallowing involves cognitive cortical processing. Cognitive decline seems to limit the capacity for compensatory resource allocation within the swallowing network. This may lead to deterioration in both swallowing function and concurrent cognitive-motor performance in challenging dual-task situations.
40202550	Mitigation of Injury from Myocardial Infarction by Pentamidine, an Inhibitor of the Acetyltransferase Tip60.	There is an urgent unmet need for new pharmacologic approaches that promote re-muscularization and repair following myocardial infarction (MI). We previously reported that genetic depletion of the acetyltransferase Tip60 after MI in a mouse model activates the CM cell-cycle, reduces scarring, and restores cardiac function, and that these beneficial effects are mimicked by the Tip60-selective inhibitor TH1834. Here, we investigated whether the FDA-approved anti-microbial agent pentamidine, a Tip60 inhibitor from which TH1834 is derived, also protects from the damaging effects of MI.

40202548	Highly Permeable and Liquid-Repellent Textiles with Micro-Nano-Networks for Medical and Health Protection.	Current protective clothing often lacks sufficient comfort to ensure efficient performance of healthcare workers. Developing protective textiles with high air and moisture permeability is a potential and effective solution to discomfort of medical protective clothing. However, realizing the facile production of a protective textile that combines safety and comfort remains a challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of highly permeable protective textiles (HPPT) with micro/nano-networks, using non-solvent induced phase separation synergistically driven by CaCl<sub>2</sub> and fluorinated polyurethane, combined with spraying technique. The HPPT demonstrates excellent liquid repellency and comfort, ensuring high safety and a dry microenvironment for the wearer. The textile exhibits not only a high hydrostatic pressure (12.86 kPa) due to its tailored small mean pore size (1.03 μm) and chemical composition, but also demonstrates excellent air permeability (14.24 mm s<sup>-1</sup>) and moisture permeability (7.92 kg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) owing to the rational combination of small pore size and high porosity (69%). The HPPT offers superior comfort compared to the commercially available protective materials. Additionally, we elucidated a molding mechanism synergistically inducted by diffusion-dissolution-phase separation. This research provides an innovative perspective on enhancing the comfort of medical protective clothing and offers theoretical support for regulating of pore structure during phase separations.

40202545	Associations between air pollutants and emergency ambulance dispatches for all-cause and nervous system disease in China Qingdao: a time-stratified case-crossover study.	The health hazards of air pollution have been recognized worldwide, and emergency ambulance dispatches (EADs) data have excellent research value in the field of environmental health and wellness. This study evaluated EADs data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, in Qingdao to assess the impact of air pollution on all-cause as well as nervous system emergency ambulance dispatches (NS-EADs). This study adopted a time-stratified case-crossover design to construct a time-series distribution-lagged single-pollutant model to assess the effects of air pollution on all-cause and NS-EADs, stratified by gender, age, and season. Confounding factors that could affect the results were controlled for in the model. Air pollutants were positively associated with all-cause and NS-EADs. The findings of the single-day lag effect demonstrated positive associations between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (lag0 and lag1 days), CO (lag0 and lag1 days), PM<sub>10</sub> (lag0 and lag1 days), SO<sub>2</sub> (lag1 days), and NO<sub>2</sub> (lag1 days) with an increased risk of all-cause EADs. Additionally, O<sub>3</sub> (lag0 days), CO (lag0 days), PM<sub>10</sub> (lag0 days), and NO<sub>2</sub> (lag0 days) exhibited positive correlations with an elevated risk of NS-EADs. To be specific, with every 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in the concentrations of O<sub>3</sub>, CO, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> at lag 0, there was a corresponding increase in NS-EADs risk of 0.67% (95% confidence interval, 0.05%, 1.30%); 0.05% (0.01%, 0.10%); 0.50% (0.13%, 0.87%); and 1.52% (0.24%, 2.82%), respectively. Stratified analysis revealed a higher risk of NS-EADs associated with air pollution, specifically observed in subgroups including individuals under 65 years old, males, and during the cold season. Air pollution was associated with all-cause EADs and NS-EADs, and males, people under 65 years old were more vulnerable to air pollution. Furthermore, the impact of air pollution is more pronounced during the cold season.

40202541	Diffuse astrocytoma, AYA-type, frequently MAPK-altered: report of 45 patients.	A putative molecular subtype of IDH-wildtype diffuse glioma with recurrent MAPK pathway alterations has recently been reported. By dimensionality reduction analysis of genome-wide methylation profiling, these tumors form a distinct methylation cluster of gliomas. Characterization of 47 tumors from 45 patients reveals that these gliomas are predominantly supratentorial in young adults, are highly infiltrative, and harbor mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations with high rates of CDKN2A/2B deletion, PDGFRA amplification, MYCN amplification, NF1 variants, and BRAF alterations. The tumors' epigenetics are distinct from other adult and pediatric gliomas in the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The histology of the gliomas most often demonstrates high-grade astrocytic features, but can be variable from tumor to tumor, as well as fall into a spectrum of histologic grades. Outcomes show considerable variability based on histologic grade and molecular features, supporting grading within this group of tumors to ensure optimal care choices on an individual patient basis. These unifying epigenetic, sequencing, and infiltrative astrocytic features allow the tumors to be considered diffuse astrocytoma, adolescent, and young adult-type, with MAPK alterations (DAYA).

40202539	Impact of BCOR/BCORL1 mutation on outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in acute myeloid leukemia patients.	BCOR alteration is a well-established adverse-risk marker for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2022 ELN risk stratification. However, outcomes of BCOR- or BCORL1-mutated AML after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are as yet poorly defined. In an 877-patient consecutive AML transplantation cohort, we found 83 (9.5%) patients with BCOR or BCORL1 mutation (BCOR/BCORL1<sup>mut</sup>). We retrospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics and transplant outcomes of BCOR/BCORL1<sup>mut</sup> patients and compared them with 276 patients with normal karyotype (BCOR/BCORL1<sup>wt</sup>). Frameshift mutation was the predominant alteration of BCOR (n = 22, 39.3%), and the majority of BCORL1 was missense mutation (n = 25, 65.8%). The most common co-mutated gene of BCOR/BCORL1<sup>mut</sup> was DNMT3A (n = 23, 27.7%). BCOR/BCORL1<sup>mut</sup> was also associated with lower WBC counts at diagnosis (P = 0.003), shorter interval from diagnosis to transplantation (P = 0.037), and fewer achieved minimal residual disease negativity pre-transplantation (P < 0.001), compared to BCOR/BCORL1<sup>wt</sup>. Three-year OS, DFS and CIR of BCOR/BCORL1<sup>wt</sup> and BCOR/BCORL1<sup>mut</sup> groups were 75.2% (95% CI, 70.0-80.8%) vs. 76.0% (95% CI, 66.0-87.5%) (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.54-1.57; P = 0.77), 74.5% (95% CI, 69.4-80.1%) vs. 67.7% (95%CI, 57.0-80.4%) (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.75-1.91; P = 0.46), and 12.6% (95% CI, 8.9-17.0%) vs. 24.0% (95% CI, 14.1-35.4%) (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.04-3.3; P = 0.03), respectively. We also investigated the impact of the type and location of BCOR/BCORL1<sup>mut</sup> on transplant outcomes, but no significant effect was observed. Our findings suggest that BCOR/BCORL1<sup>mut</sup> is associated with relapse after allo-HSCT, despite no observed difference in OS, and that allo-HSCT could help to overcome the impact of BCOR/BCORL1<sup>mut</sup> characteristics on outcomes.
40202538	Immunoglobulin heavy/light chain assay in the diagnosis, monitoring and follow-up of renal AL amyloidosis patients at different disease stages.	Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare clonal plasma cell disorder with high rate of missed diagnosis, misdiagnosis and mortality. Conventional assays, such as serum immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) and serum free light chain (FLC) assay, are unable to accurately detect low concentrations of monoclonal protein (M protein), especially as a patient's renal function deteriorates. The heavy/light chain (HLC) assay, a relatively new method, can quantify intact immunoglobulins in serum and has proven to be valuable in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma (MM). However, there is limited research on its application in AL amyloidosis. In this study, we evaluate the value of HLC assay in AL amyloidosis patients at different disease stages, and compare it to the performance of IFE and FLC assay. Among 40 untreated patients, 34 (85%) were positive for IFE, 34 (85%) had an abnormal free light chain ratio (FLCr), and 31 (78%) had an abnormal heavy light chain ratio (HLCr). Among 67 serum samples obtained from 44 treated patients, 57 (85%) were positive for IFE, 9 (13%) had abnormal FLCr, and 45 (67%) had abnormal HLCr. There were 1 (14%) of 7 patients in complete response (CR), 17 (68%) of 25 patients in very good partial response (VGPR), 9 (82%) of 11 patients in partial response (PR) and 6 (75%) of 8 patients in no response (NR) showed an abnormal HLCr. Our findings identified the potential value of the HLC assay in the detection of M proteins and response and serologic residual disease monitoring.
40202537	Exploring perceptions in the management and treatment of polycythaemia vera in the UK.	Approximately 1140 people are diagnosed with polycythaemia vera (PV) annually in the United Kingdom (UK). Adherence to the British Society of Haematology (BSH) guidelines for PV diagnosis and management is not well understood. To explore UK's PV diagnosis, management practices and unmet needs. A structured survey, co-developed with a UK haematology consultant, an advanced nurse practitioner and a pharmacist, was completed by 57/332 invited healthcare practitioners from July to October 2023 through 1:1 interviews conducted by Novartis Medical Science Liaisons. Results were analysed descriptively. Most respondents (68%) follow the BSH 2018 guidelines for diagnosing PV. Treatment goals are to reduce thromboembolic event risk and control haematocrit and symptoms. Most patients (68%) were receiving cytoreductive therapy (typically first-line hydroxycarbamide); 28% received antiplatelet medication and/or venesection alone. Stable patients are usually monitored every 3 months through telephone (68%), increasing to monthly when uncontrolled, mainly in-person (54%). General practitioners (56%) manage cardiovascular risks, but there is doubt over referral response. All respondents monitor symptoms, with only 19% regularly using MPN10. The greatest educational need was identifying hydroxycarbamide resistance and intolerance (58%). This survey offers insights into therapeutic approaches and areas for improvement in the UK's PV clinical practice.
40202536	Mutational heterogeneities in STAT3 and clonal hematopoiesis-related genes in acquired pure red cell aplasia.	Dysregulation of T cell-mediated immunity is considered a major pathophysiological mechanism in acquired pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), including idiopathic PRCA, large granular lymphocytic leukemia-associated PRCA, and thymoma-associated PRCA. Although STAT3 mutations are frequently detected in PRCA patients, the roles of other mutational profiles and their impact on clinical characteristics remain unclear. In this study, whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing using a custom-designed panel were performed on 53 PRCA patients. The most frequently mutated genes were STAT3 (36%), PCLO (9%), TET2 (9%), NEB (6%), DNMT3A (6%), and POT1 (6%). Based on genetic profiles, patients were classified into three groups: those with STAT3 variants (group S), those without STAT3 variants but with variants in clonal hematopoiesis (CH)-related genes (group C), and those without variants in either STAT3 or CH-related genes (group O). Patients in group O had a higher median age compared to group S, while group S exhibited milder anemia severity than group C. Additionally, POT1 variants were associated with the idiopathic subtype of PRCA in females, often co-occurring with STAT3 variants. Variants in CH-related genes and other genes, including STAT3 and POT1, may play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of PRCA.
40202535	Feasibility and effectiveness of a digital voice assistant for improving anti-osteoporosis medication adherence, and osteoporosis knowledge and attitudes, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: A 12-month randomised controlled trial.	Digital voice assistants (DVAs) are feasible for delivering a digital health intervention designed to improve osteoporosis self-management in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. However, the DVA intervention did not improve anti-osteoporosis drug adherence, nor did it enhance osteoporosis knowledge or attitudes in this population.

40202531	Harnessing the SPOP E3 Ubiquitin Ligase via a Bridged Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) Strategy for Targeted Protein Degradation.	Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) represent promising therapeutic modalities for degrading disease-causing proteins. However, the development of effective PROTACs has been limited by the availability of suitable E3 ligase ligands. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that SPOP, an unexplored E3 ligase, can be recruited to degrade target proteins of interest. We developed a bridged PROTAC strategy and successfully discovered a proof-of-concept PROTAC degrader <b>9</b> (MS479), which recruits the E3 ligase SPOP by directly binding its substrate GLP as a bridge protein. This approach facilitates the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of BRD4/3/2 by the 26S proteasome. <b>9</b> effectively reduced the protein level of BRD4 short isoform in a time-, concentration-, GLP-, SPOP-, and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-dependent manner. Additionally, <b>9</b> effectively inhibited the proliferation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Overall, our study expands the limited repertoire of the E3 ligases that can be harnessed for targeted protein degradation.

40202525	Risk factors for non-vertebral fractures in community-dwelling elderly: a 10-year follow-up study in New Zealand.	This 10-year study of 5000 + adults aged 50-84 found 20% experienced non-vertebral fractures. Higher risk was linked to female sex, older age, European ethnicity, lower education, living alone, alcohol use, prior falls/fractures, osteoporosis, arthritis, and antidepressants. Targeting modifiable factors (living arrangements, alcohol, antidepressants) could reduce fracture burden cost-effectively in older adults.
40202524	Domino-Annulation-Based Approach to Synthesize Bridged Bis-thiopyrano[2,3-<i>b</i>]indoles and Unbridged Thiopyrano[2,3-<i>b</i>]indoles.	A novel domino strategy for the construction of intricate bridged bis-thiopyrano[2,3-<i>b</i>]indoles was disclosed, which involved one molecule of 3-formylchromones and two molecules of indoline-2-thiones, enabling the formation of four new bonds in a single operation. The transformation occurred under mild reaction conditions, facilitated by the synergistic action of the base NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and the catalytic acid ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. Notably, when these bridged bis-thiopyrano[2,3-<i>b</i>]indole skeletons were treated with alkyl halides under basic conditions, they underwent deconstruction to yield alkylthio-substituted indole-decorated thiopyrano[2,3-<i>b</i>]indoles.
40202523	Oculomotor, vestibular, reaction time, and cognitive (OVRT-C) responses in 7- to 17-year-old children.	Several aspects of oculomotor, vestibular, reaction time, and cognitive (OVRT-C) abilities improve throughout childhood at varying rates and become adult-like at different ages. However, developmental testing of these abilities often focuses on limited age ranges and does not elucidate clear developmental trajectories. The present study utilized high-resolution eye-tracking to evaluate 40 children aged 7-17 years on a comprehensive battery of OVRT-C tests to better understand how and when these abilities develop across childhood. As expected, mean responses on OVRT-C tests showed consistent improvement as subject age increased. We report a high prevalence of saccadic intrusions during smooth pursuit in children and adolescents, more self-paced saccades in older children, decreased auditory and visual RT with age, and fewer errors on the anti-saccade test in older children. We also used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) modelling to determine whether a two- or three age group division would be most appropriate for each OVRT-C test. For all key OVRT-C metrics, our data support a separation of children into two age groups as opposed to three. While the age group divide varied by OVRT-C test, these data suggest these abilities mature at differing rates, and optimal separations into two age groups rather than three may reflect a slowing of rapid development as OVRT-C performance becomes more adult-like.
40202522	Assessing water quality of River Mahananda, Malda, India using Cirrhinus reba as a bioindicator: Oxidative stress biomarkers and histopathological fingerprints.	Environmental pollution has been seen to cause a catastrophic effect on the River Mahananda, Malda, West Bengal, due to the discharge of untreated urban wastes and wastewater into the riverine system resulting in the decline of several local fish species owing to deteriorating water quality. Hence, the objective of this work was to assess the alteration of different physicochemical parameters of water in the River Mahananda owing to pollution during various seasons, and to examine their toxicological effects on the intracellular antioxidant system and histological parameters in Cirrhinus reba. The WPIs of the polluted sampling sites declined significantly from fall to summer. The season-based principal component analysis indicated that TDS, dissolved oxygen, total hardness, total alkalinity, free chlorine, chloride, copper, and zinc were the most common descriptors for the physicochemical alterations of the River Mahananda, reflecting its prominent pollution portfolio. SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, and GSH were found significantly (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001) decreased in liver of C. reba collected from polluted sites compared to the control. The acetylcholinesterase activity was noted to increase significantly (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) in an order of S2 > S3 > S4 > S1. A several-fold increase in TBARS level was observed in C. reba collected from polluted sites during summer, compared to the control. Major histopathological changes were observed in summer and spring in liver, kidney and gill tissues of C. reba. In conclusion, while certain principal components were significant predictors for various biochemical parameters, the overall model showed varying degrees of predictive power, highlighting the need for further research with larger sample size and potentially more comprehensive modelling strategies.
40202521	Spatio-temporal dynamics of fish communities and habitat conditions in the Bichom River Basin.	The distribution and abundance of freshwater ichthyofauna are closely associated with habitat conditions and serve as good indicators of the ecosystem's health. Various topographic, hydrological, and physico-chemical properties play a unique role in shaping ichthyofaunal distribution. A healthy freshwater habitat supports rich diversity and abundance. Thus, this study explores the habitat condition of river water and associates it with the ichthyofauna. Data were collected from three sampling sites across four seasons over three years (2021-2023). A total of 7793 fish individuals belonging to 2 orders, 6 families, 19 genera, and 37 species were collected during the study period. Thirteen habitat parameters were correlated with the ichthyofaunal indices. Additionally, KMO, Bartlett's test, and PCA were estimated to assess the dimensionality of the habitat parameters. Finally, CCA was used to examine the association between habitat parameters and ichthyofauna. The CCA analysis revealed a significant association between selected habitat parameters and ichthyofauna. The study provides valuable information for the conservation and management planning of ichthyofauna in the Bichom River Basin.
40202520	How I do it: Optic nerve decompression in patient with osteopetrosis.	Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disorder causing excessive skeletal density, with a predilection to affect the skull base. This commonly leads to optic canal stenosis, optic nerve compression, and atrophy and vision loss. Timely optic nerve decompression can be an effective surgical intervention to preserve vision.
40202519	The Relationship Between High-Quality Physical Education, Physical Literacy, and Physical Activity Participation: A Retrospective Study From U.S. College Students.	Physical education (PE) participation at school age is suggested to increase physical activity levels in adulthood. However, there is a limited understanding of the underlying mechanism in this relationship between PE and physical activity (PA). This study aimed to examine how the quality of PE in high school is associated with future physical activity engagement in young adulthood and whether physical literacy is a mediator in this relationship. A group of 280 college students (62.1% women; M<sub>age</sub> = 20.09, SD = 2.04) were recruited from 11 universities in the United States. The students filled out an online survey measuring the quality of PE in high school, leisure-time physical activity, and physical literacy. A path analysis revealed a good fit of the mediation model with sex as a covariate (χ<sup>2</sup>/df = 1.73, <i>p</i> = .02; CFI = 0.99; IFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.98; RMSEA = 0.05, 90% CI [0.02, 0.08]). Quality of PE has a significant direct association (β = 0.12) with physical activity and an indirect association with physical activity through physical literacy (β = 0.05). The findings illustrate that high-quality high school PE is associated with physical activity directly and indirectly through physical literacy. It is critical to provide high-quality high school PE by addressing the environment, curriculum, instruction, and assessment to develop physical literacy and physical activity participation. Improving physical literacy through high-quality PE and other settings (e.g., school sports and community clubs) is a viable way to promote PA participation.
40202518	Care, dying, death, and loss in children's drawings from the Covid-19 pandemic in Sweden.	Most studies gather data on children's Covid-19 experiences from proxy adults rather than from children. We explore depictions of end-of-life issues in drawings created by children in Sweden about their experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic, generated in response to an open invitation to schools, teachers, culture centers, etc. from a public archive of children's art. A transdisciplinary team inductively analyzed 172 drawings containing images of care, dying, death and loss, finding qualitatively different portrayals differentiated by focus on (re)actors versus victims in the pandemic. The virus was often drawn as an aggressive, active agent, while humans, including professionals, appeared reactive and at a loss. The largest group of victims were without identity, although some children depicted themselves as victims. These children illustrate Covid-19-related questions, concerns, and fears about the end of life, reflecting "epistemological uncertainty" resulting from the pandemic. This uncertainty should be addressed, for example by trustworthy support in making sense of surrounding world, and by pro-active death educational approaches for both children and the adults who are in contact with them.
40202517	Paradoxical Effects of Erucic Acid-A Fatty Acid With Two-Faced Implications.	Erucic acid (EA) is a monounsaturated fatty acid primarily consumed as rapeseed oil and mustard oil (MO). The consumption of EA-rich food has been reported to have adverse effects on health, particularly myocardial lipidosis and hepatic steatosis. Consequently, several countries, including the United States, European countries, New Zealand, and Australia, set limits on their daily intake. However, EA-rich MO (30%-50%) is still consumed in Asia. In contrast, limited studies on humans have reported a protective role of MO in acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and neurologic disorders. The previous studies have shown the association of EA with both beneficial and adverse effects. Therefore, a comprehensive review of EA will help us understand its effect on health. Because EA consumption is banned in some countries, a detailed and updated review on EA might help us understand its role as a toxicant or therapeutic.
40202516	Visible-Light-Promoted Radical Cascade Bicyclization to Access Partially Saturated Pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines.	A visible-light-promoted cascade [2+2+1] bicyclization reaction of N-cyanamide alkenes and activated alkyl bromides has been successfully established. This reaction exhibits mild conditions, metal-free characteristics, and excellent atom- and step-economy, along with environmental friendliness. It demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and scalability to gram-scale synthesis, underscoring its potential for practical applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a photoinduced single-electron transfer (SET) process and a 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process mediated by an iminyl radical.
40202515	Repeated activation of preoptic area recipient neurons in posterior paraventricular nucleus mediates chronic heat-induced negative emotional valence and hyperarousal states.	Mental and behavioral disorders are associated with extended period of hot weather as found in heatwaves, but the underlying neural circuit mechanism remains poorly known. The posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) is a hub for emotional processing and receives inputs from the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA), the well-recognized thermoregulation center. The present study was designed to explore whether chronic heat exposure leads to aberrant activities in POA recipient pPVT neurons and subsequent changes in emotional states. By devising an air heating paradigm mimicking the condition of heatwaves and utilizing emotion-related behavioral tests, viral tract tracing, in vivo calcium recordings, optogenetic manipulations, and electrophysiological recordings, we found that chronic heat exposure for 3 weeks led to negative emotional valence and hyperarousal states in mice. The pPVT neurons receive monosynaptic excitatory and inhibitory innervations from the POA. These neurons exhibited a persistent increase in neural activity following chronic heat exposure, which was essential for chronic heat-induced emotional changes. Notably, these neurons were also prone to display stronger neuronal activities associated with anxiety responses to stressful situations. Furthermore, we observed saturated neuroplasticity in the POA-pPVT excitatory pathway after chronic heat exposure that occluded further potentiation. Taken together, long-term aberration in the POA to pPVT pathway offers a neurobiological mechanism of emotional and behavioral changes seen in extended periods of hot weather like heatwaves.
40202514	Targeting the ER stress sensor IRE1 protects the liver from fibrosis through the downregulation of the proteostasis factor P4HB/PDIA1.	Collagen is the main cargo of the secretory pathway, contributing to hepatic fibrogenesis due to extensive accumulation of extracellular matrix. An excess of collagen deposition is a characteristic feature of several chronic liver diseases. Collagen overproduction imposes pressure on the secretory pathway, altering endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis. Here we investigated the possible contribution of the unfolded protein response UPR, the main adaptive pathway that monitors and adjusts protein production capacity at the ER, to collagen biogenesis and liver disease. Genetic ablation of the ER stress sensor IRE1 in the liver using conditional knockout mice reduced liver damage and collagen deposition in models of fibrosis, steatosis, and acute hepatotoxicity. Proteomic profiling identified the prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4HB, also known as PDIA1) as a major IRE1-regulated gene, a critical factor involved in collagen maturation. Cell culture studies demonstrated that IRE1 deficiency results in collagen retention at the ER, reducing its secretion, and this phenotype is rescued by P4HB/PDIA1 overexpression. Analyses of human MASH samples revealed a positive correlation between IRE1 signaling and P4HB/PDIA1 expression as well as the severity of the disease. Altogether, our results establish a role of the IRE1/P4HB axis in the regulation of collagen production and support its implication in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.
40202513	From technology adopters to creators: Leveraging AI-assisted vibe coding to transform clinical teaching and learning.	Integrating theoretical knowledge with the practical skills essential for clinical practice remains a significant challenge in clinical education. Conventional teaching strategies often fall short in preparing clinicians to navigate the unpredictable, urgent, and multifaceted nature of clinical decision-making, while also providing limited support for the development of cognitive heuristics essential to forming independent clinical judgment. To address these challenges, we introduce vibe coding, a novel AI-assisted, no-code development approach that enables educators to create interactive, customisable learning simulations without programming expertise. By prioritising rapid prototyping and iterative refinement, vibe coding shifts the focus from technical constraints to pedagogical goals, allowing educators to generate code through intuitive, conversational prompts. We applied this approach to develop two distinct applications: the Differential Diagnosis Trainer (DDT), which enhances diagnostic reasoning through randomised clinical scenarios and AI-generated feedback, and the Insulin and Blood Sugar Simulation (IBSS), which offers real-time exploration of metabolic dynamics. Both tools were built using AI-powered no-code platforms, demonstrating significant improvements in accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and scalability. We encourage educators to transition from technology adopters to creators, leveraging AI-driven platforms to develop innovative, scalable, and personalised clinical simulations that transform learning experiences and ultimately enhance patient care.
40202512	Introducing a data-driven learning progress dashboard for programmatic assessment.	Programmatic Assessment (PA) relies on the integration of diverse data sources to deliver holistic feedback that supports student learning. However, the complexity and volume of assessment data can hinder efficient tracking and interpretation, challenging the implementation of PA's principles. To address these challenges, we developed the Learning Progress Dashboard (LPD) - a bespoke technological-enhanced solution and infrastructure designed for medical students. Built with an user-centric approach, the dashboard integrates previously siloed data systems, offering tailored interfaces for both students and faculty to facilitate data-informed learning strategies. Key lessons were the importance of breaking down data silos, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and employing gradual change management strategies to balance innovation with user acceptance.
40202511	The Stigma of Hearing Loss: A Scoping Review of the Literature Across Age and Gender.

This study reviews the literature for stigma related to hearing loss and hearing device use.
40202510	Role of fragile sites FATS and FMR1 in tumor progression and their potential clinical significance.	The fragile sites are defined as specific segments of genes that are particularly susceptible to breakage under conditions of accelerated replication stress or certain external influences. It has been demonstrated that fragile sites can influence the progression of various tumors. However, the majority of existing studies have focused on the functions of well-characterized common fragile sites, such as FHIT, WWOX, and PARK2, in different oncogenic processes, with insufficient attention directed towards other fragile sites. This article presents an analysis of recent investigations into the fragile sites, fragile site-associated tumor suppressor (FATS) and fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1), across various tumor types. The article discusses the mechanisms and signaling pathways regulated by these sites in a range of cancers, as well as their clinical implications for tumor treatment. The review highlights the significance of the fragile sites FATS and FMR1 in various cancers and their clinical relevance.
40202509	MYO1F in neutrophils is required for the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.	Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) represent a significant barrier to the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. A comprehensive understanding of TANs' regulatory mechanisms is therefore essential for predicting ICB efficacy and improving immunotherapy strategies. Our study reveals that MYO1F is selectively downregulated in neutrophils within both human cancers and murine tumor models, showing a negative correlation with ICB response. Mechanistically, MYO1F normally inhibits neutrophil immunosuppression and proliferation by restraining STAT3 activity. However, during tumorigenesis, tumor-derived TGF-β1 disrupts the binding of SPI1 to intron 8 of Myo1f via DNA methylation, thereby suppressing Myo1f transcription. The resultant decrease in MYO1F reprograms neutrophils into an immunosuppressive state through the STAT3-dependent signaling pathways. This immunosuppressive state further contributes to tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling by inducing CTL exhaustion. These findings establish MYO1F as a critical regulator within TANs, highlighting its significant role in modulating ICB therapy efficacy.
40202506	Challenges in estimating effects of hypothetical interventions on resources patterned by structural racism: An example in a rural North Carolina Medicaid population.	Structural racism has likely shaped the geographic distribution and resource allocation of rural populations and marginalized racial/ethnic groups. We sought to 1) quantify disparities in severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and distributions of resources by race and racial composition of county, and 2) determine whether a hypothetical intervention on resources would reduce racial disparities in SMM, using linked birth certificates and claims from Medicaid beneficiaries giving birth from 2014-2019 in rural North Carolina (61 rural counties, 77,665 births). We used ratio of mediator probability weights to enact a hypothetical intervention that would equalize distributions of pregnancy care provider ratios and obstetric units across race and racial composition of county. Despite observed disparities in the distributions of resources and SMM, we were unable to demonstrate that the hypothetical interventions would reduce SMM. This may be due to a lack of common support - marginalized groups never experienced the more optimal extremes of the healthcare resources distributions that privileged groups did. Our findings may have implications for the use of causal inference methods for addressing health disparities more broadly: if distributions of resources among privileged groups are outside those that marginalized groups experience, hypothetical interventions on these distributions cannot be emulated with data.
40202505	Mechanistic Insights into the CO2-Assisted NO Electrochemical Deoxygenation and Hydrogenation.	Electrocatalytic NO reduction to NH3 holds significant potential for pollutant treatment and resource recovery. Herein, we report that the introduction of CO2 on oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu) prepared from octahedral cuprous oxide (o-Cu2O) significantly enhances the electrochemical reduction of NO to NH3. With 10% NO in a CO2 environment, the Faradaic efficiency for NH3 production in a flow cell remains around 80% over a wide current density range from 20 to 250 mA cm-2. At a current density of 250 mA cm-2, the yield can reach up to 1403.9 μmol cm-2 h-1, which is 3.71 times higher than without CO2 and surpasses the performance reported in similar literature. Moreover, even at a low concentration of 1% NO, the Faradaic efficiency can reach a maximum of 70.11% at a current density of 20 mA cm-2. In situ investigations and theoretical calculations revealed that, in the coexistence of NO and CO2, the NO reduction pathway involves a unique route wherein *CO and *COOH, produced from CO2 reduction, can respectively promote the deoxygenation of *NO and hydrogenation of *N by acquiring O atoms from *NO and providing H atoms for the sustain hydrogenation of *N, thereby accelerating the conversion process of NO to NH3.
40202504	Liraglutide treatment reverses unconventional cellular defects in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived β cells harboring a partially functional WFS1 variant.	Wolfram Syndrome 1 (WS1) is a rare genetic disorder caused by WFS1 variants that disrupt Wolframin, an endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein essential for cellular stress responses, Ca2+ homeostasis, and autophagy. Here, we investigated how the c.316-1G>A and c.757A>T WFS1 mutations, which yield partially functional Wolframin, affect the molecular functions of β cells and explored the therapeutic potential of the Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide. Pancreatic β cells obtained from patient-derived induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) carrying this WFS1 variant exhibited reduced insulin processing and impaired secretory granule maturation, as evidenced by proinsulin accumulation and decreased prohormone convertase PC1/3. Moreover, they exhibited dysregulated Ca2+ fluxes due to altered transcription of Ca2+-related genes, including CACNA1D, and significantly reduced SNAP25 levels, leading to uncoordinated oscillations and poor glucose responsiveness. Affected cells also showed increased autophagic flux and heightened susceptibility to inflammatory cytokine-induced apoptosis. Notably, liraglutide treatment rescued these defects by normalizing Ca2+ handling, enhancing insulin processing and secretion, and reducing apoptosis, likely through modulation of the unfolded protein response. These findings underscore the importance of defining mutation-specific dysfunctions in WS1 and support targeting the GLP-1/GLP-1R axis as a therapeutic strategy.
40202501	Travel Health Needs of Children in U.S. Military Families Stationed Abroad.	While the U.S. DoD mandates preventive health measures for service members overseas, the health needs of their accompanying children are poorly described. This study aims to quantify and characterize the recommended travel health preventive services, with attention to malaria, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), typhoid, and rabies, in military-connected expatriate children.
40202500	Symptom Subtypes of Obstructive Sleep Apnea 10 Years Later: Past, Present and Future.	As first described in Iceland over 10 years ago and since replicated across thousands of diverse subjects from community-based and clinical cohorts throughout the world, there exist different subtypes of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) characterized by patient-reported symptoms. Subtypes defined by excessive sleepiness, disturbed sleep, and minimal symptoms have been consistently identified across these various cohorts, and are often joined by a moderately sleepy subtype. Identifying symptom subtypes using cluster analysis provided a data-driven approach to formalize the concept of symptomatic differences among patients with OSA that has been discussed for decades in prior research, and has important implications for future research and clinical applications. Current evidence favors excessive sleepiness as a marker of increased cardiovascular risk related to OSA, but there remains an opportunity for more research on non-cardiovascular endpoints. The framework of symptom subtypes can inform future randomized clinical trials, which are challenging in patients with excessive sleepiness, but both feasible and clinically important in the other subtypes. Symptom heterogeneity should also be used to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment recommendations, including consideration of whether patients with minimally symptomatic OSA require or receive any benefits from therapy. Studies to identify the underlying mechanisms of different symptom presentations, demonstrate short-term reliability, determine the minimum number of questions required for accurate identification, and implement a tool for assigning subtypes in routine clinical practice are needed in order to realize the full potential of symptom subtypes to inform more personalized medicine approaches.
40202499	Defining methodologic and other core competencies for PhD-level training in epidemiology.	In this manuscript, we present the results of a series of workshops convened in conjunction with the 2023 Society for Epidemiologic Research (SER) annual meeting. The overall objective of the workshops was to develop a set of core competencies for PhD students in epidemiology. The topics presented in the lists of competencies are organized using a framework similar to many graduate programs in epidemiology, proceeding from basic to advanced topics. Given the breadth of substantive topics in the fields of epidemiology and public health, this list of competencies focuses on methodologic topics that are relevant to all students, regardless of research interest. The final topic lists were developed based on discussions including a large and diverse group of epidemiologists with different areas of expertise. By creating this resource, we aim to facilitate training of future generations of epidemiologists.
40202498	Rhythmic TDP-43 affects RNA splicing of USP13, resulting in alteration of BMAL1 ubiquitination.	Circadian rhythm disorders are common characteristics of neurodegenerative diseases. The pathological aggregation of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the relationship between TDP-43 and circadian rhythm remains unknown. Here, we found that TDP-43 is rhythmically expressed both in vivo and in vitro. TDP-43 knockdown affected the expression of circadian genes, including BMAL1, CLOCK, CRY1, and PER2, and impaired autonomous circadian wheel behavior, cognitive functions, and balance abilities in mice. Furthermore, TDP-43 knockdown induced aberrant splicing of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 13 (USP13) and blocked USP13 rhythmic expression, enhancing the ubiquitination of BMAL1. Meanwhile, TDP-43 knockdown altered the rhythmic expression of phospho-AMPKα (Thr172) and platelet-type phosphofructokinase (PFKP), which may change cellular glucose uptake and ATP production. Our findings further the understanding of the role of TDP-43 dysfunction in circadian rhythm disruption in neurodegenerative diseases and provide new mechanistic evidence supporting the interaction between circadian rhythm disruption and neurodegeneration.
40202497	In Vivo Interrogation of Cell-Penetrating Peptide Function: Accumulation in Tumors and the Potential as a Specific PET Probe.	We aimed to evaluate the biodistribution and specificity of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-TAT and RHO-TAT using MGC-803 and HT-29 tumor cells as well as tumor-xenografted nude mice and to demonstrate its application in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The in vitro evaluation of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-TAT was assessed in MGC-803 and HT-29 cell lines, and the in vivo evaluation of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-TAT was also performed in mice bearing MGC-803 or HT-29 tumors, respectively. Fluorescence microscopy was also employed to evaluate the specificity of RHO-TAT in vitro in MGC-803 and HT-29 cells as well as ex vivo in tumor slices of the corresponding tumor models. The in vivo imaging differences between <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-TAT and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in MGC-803 and HT-29 tumors were also studied. The biodistribution and micro-PET results demonstrated significant uptake of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-TAT in non-FDG-avid MGC-803 tumors, whereas there was negligible uptake in FDG-avid HT-29 tumors. RHO-TAT showed superior fluorescence microscopy imaging effects in MGC-803 cells and tumor slices but not in HT-29 cells and tumor slices, which were consistent with the in vivo results. <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-TAT combined with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG can be applied noninvasively in cancers with PET imaging for potential patient selection and stratification. We demonstrated a higher binding of <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTA-TAT and RHO-TAT to MGC-803 cells as well as to non-FDG-avid MGC-803 xenografted tumors and a lower binding to HT-29 cells and FDG-avid xenografted tumors. These results suggest that TAT has the potential to be a ligand for targeting certain tumors.

40202495	Highly Conjugated Imine-Linked Donor-Acceptor Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient HCl Sensing and Photocatalytic Oxidation of Benzylamine.	Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show potential as photocatalysts for harnessing solar energy, primarily because of their adjustable band gap, which enhances their ability to harvest light energy. However, their efficiency as photocatalysts is frequently hampered by inadequate charge transfer and fast charge recombination. In this work, we integrated a donor-acceptor pair into the 2D COF material to enhance charge transfer and reduce charge recombination, thereby improving the overall photoactivity. The 2D COF (<b>OML-4</b>) was synthesized through the polycondensation of a 4',4‴,4‴″,4‴‴'-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetrakis(([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carbaldehyde)) (ETBC) linker serving as the donor and a 4,4',4″-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline (TAPT) linker acting as the acceptor. This imine-linked 2D COF (<b>OML-4</b>) material shows photocatalytic activity toward benzylic amine oxidation in the presence of visible light for the formation of aldehyde molecules in an aqueous medium. This COF was also investigated for HCl gas sensing behavior based on the protonation of the imine linkage and triazine unit present in the COF material. This exhibits exceptionally good sensitivity up to the ppm level and naked eye detection of HCl by changing in color from yellow to red and turning back to yellow in ammonia vapor, showing the reversible and recyclable nature of the COF.
40202494	af3cli: Streamlining AlphaFold3 Input Preparation.	With the release of AlphaFold3, modeling capabilities have expanded beyond protein structure prediction to embrace the inherent complexity of biomolecular systems, including nucleic acids, ions, small molecules, and their interactions. The increased complexity of these assemblies is reflected in the input file generation process, presenting a significant hurdle for researchers without advanced computational expertise. While AlphaFold Server comes with a user-friendly graphical user interface, it supports only a subset of the features of AlphaFold3. To address this, we present af3cli, an open-source tool designed to facilitate the generation of AlphaFold3 input files, specifically tailored to the standalone version of AlphaFold3 and its unrestricted functionality. Featuring a user-friendly command-line interface and an accompanying Python library, af3cli simplifies the input generation process while maintaining flexibility and customization, which makes af3cli especially useful for fast (automated) generation of a large number of input files since it enables direct incorporation of FASTA files, keeps track of IDs, and validates the JSON file. Through practical examples, we demonstrate its capabilities for constructing input data for diverse biological structures, ranging from simple proteins to complex systems, and demonstrate its seamless integration into both manual and automated workflows.

40202489	Immunomodulatory effects of metal nanoparticles: current trends and future prospects.	The advent of nanotechnology has steered into a new era of medical advancements, with metal nanoparticles (MNPs) emerging as potent agents for precise regulation of the immune system. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the immunomodulatory roles of MNPs, including gold, silver, and metal oxide nanoparticles, in regulating innate and adaptive immunity. Additionally, we discuss the immunological effects of metal ions and metal complexes, offering a comparative analysis with nanoparticulate systems. We analyse cutting-edge strategies utilising MNPs to optimise vaccine efficacy, achieve targeted delivery to immune cells, and orchestrate inflammatory responses. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of MNPs in combating autoimmune diseases, cancers, and infectious agents, which is evaluated within the framework of precision medicine. Furthermore, we critically assess challenges such as biocompatibility, potential toxicity, and regulatory hurdles. Finally, we propose future directions for integrating MNPs with advanced delivery systems and other nanomaterials to propel the frontiers of immunotherapy. This review aims to provide a foundational understanding of MNP-mediated immunomodulation, inspiring further research and development in this burgeoning field.

In Crohn's disease (CD), symptomatic and endoscopic assessments often show poor correlation. Bile acid malabsorption (BAM) is a common comorbidity in these patients and often results in bile acid diarrhea (BAD). This post-hoc clinical trial analysis evaluated BAD presence and association with symptoms and disease activity in patients with active CD.
40202487	Molecular dynamics exploration of the barrier properties of small gas molecules in the semicrystalline parylene C.	Poly(chloro-<i>p</i>-xylylene) (parylene C) is recognized for its outstanding chemical resistance, high thermal stability, biocompatibility, and superior permeability barrier properties. This material predominantly exists in a semicrystalline state. Despite its significance, theoretical studies simulating the semicrystalline parylene C system are scarce. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between the semicrystalline structures and the barrier properties of parylene C through a molecular dynamics approach. Semicrystalline parylene C with 10-50% aligned regions were constructed, which exhibited a degree of crystallinity ranging from 17% to 44%. We discovered that increased aligned chains could significantly alter the material's structure and morphology. These changes could further lead to variations in the density, fractional free volume, and pore size distribution of parylene C, thus affecting its glass transition temperature, permeability barrier and mechanical properties. Additionally, the relative values of gas permeability coefficients closely match experimental data. The insights into the structure-property relationship presented in this work could offer valuable guidance for developing functionalized and structured parylene C as coating materials.
40202486	Plasticity of mitotic cyclins in promoting the G2-M transition.	Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) orchestrate key events in the cell cycle. However, the uniqueness of individual mitotic cyclins has been a long-standing puzzle. By rapidly removing cyclins in G2 human cells, we found that deficiency of B-type cyclins attenuates mitotic onset and uncouples the G2-M kinase network from mitosis, resulting in sustained activation of PLK1 and cyclin A-CDK1. This culminates in mitotic slippage without completing nuclear envelope breakdown. Remarkably, elevating cyclin A several-fold above its endogenous level is adequate to restore mitosis, allowing cells to survive without B-type cyclins. In contrast, cyclin A is rate-limiting but not essential for G2-M due to compensation by endogenous cyclin B1-CDK2, a non-canonical pair. These findings challenge the traditional indispensable roles of different cyclins and highlight their plasticity. Due to the high malleability of the A- and B-type cyclins, cancer cells may be able to place different weights on different cyclins, while maintaining sufficient CDK activities for successful mitosis.
40202485	The autophagy protein ATG-9 regulates lysosome function and integrity.	The transmembrane autophagy protein ATG9 has multiple functions essential for autophagosome formation. Here, we uncovered a novel function of ATG-9 in regulating lysosome biogenesis and integrity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Through a genetic screen, we identified that mutations attenuating the lipid scrambling activity of ATG-9 suppress the autophagy defect in epg-5 mutants, in which non-degradative autolysosomes accumulate. The scramblase-attenuated ATG-9 mutants promote lysosome biogenesis and delivery of lysosome-localized hydrolases and also facilitate the maintenance of lysosome integrity. Through manipulation of phospholipid levels, we found that a reduction in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) also suppresses the autophagy defects and lysosome damage associated with impaired lysosomal degradation. Our results reveal that modulation of phospholipid composition and distribution, e.g., by attenuating the scramblase activity of ATG-9 or reducing the PE level, regulates lysosome function and integrity.
40202484	Mechanical Power to Predict Ventilator Liberation in Patients With a Tracheostomy.	<b>Background:</b> Mechanical power (MP) is useful for predicting the outcomes of attempts to liberate patients from mechanical ventilation. MP is computed based on measured variables derived to determine the power in joules required to breathe while receiving mechanical ventilation. The main objectives of this study were to calculate a cutoff value of MP that would predict successful liberation and to determine the prediction rate of liberation success based on this cutoff value. <b>Methods:</b> This was a single-center retrospective study. Data from 110 tracheostomized subjects receiving mechanical ventilation were analyzed. We divided subjects into two groups based on ventilator liberation outcome. Confounding factors in subject background were adjusted using propensity score matching (PSM). Statistically significant differences in MP at tracheostomy and liberation success between liberation success and failure groups were examined. We calculated the MP cutoff value for successful liberation using the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and its corresponding prediction rate of liberation success. <b>Results:</b> The number of subjects in the successful liberation group was 79 and that of the failed liberation group was 31. The MP cutoff value and corresponding prediction rate for liberation success were 256.5 J/min (area under the curve-ROC = 0.839) and 92.2%, respectively. After PSM, the low MP group (<i>n =</i> 36), divided based on the MP cutoff value, had a significantly higher liberation success rate than the high MP group (<i>n =</i> 36), with an odds ratio of 19.95 (CI 3.95, 91.23, <i>P</i> < .001). <b>Conclusion:</b> MP at tracheostomy was a strong predictor of successful ventilator liberation, and the prediction rate of liberation success based on the MP cutoff value was shown to be very high. We recommend that patients with low MP be actively considered for liberation. In contrast, those with high MP should continue weaning while simultaneously making early transfer arrangements if liberation is unsuccessful.
40202482	The Hand Surgeon's Role in the Management of Upper-Extremity Arteriovenous Malformation: A Review of the Literature.	The diagnosis and treatment of fast-flow arteriovenous malformations with or without dynamic arteriovenous fistulae in the upper limb can be both frustrating and daunting for the hand surgeon. The clinical presentation can vary from an incidental finding to a pulsating mass, threatening the entirety of the upper extremity and precipitating cardiac failure secondary to diverging vasculature. Non-operative treatment is appropriate for the small, minimally symptomatic mass. However, considerable controversy remains regarding the management of symptomatic lesions, specifically regarding the utility of embolization or sclerotherapy and the aggressiveness of surgical resection, concepts that are dependent primarily on both the size and location of the lesion. Although classification schemes exist, which attempt to stratify the severity of the lesion encountered by the upper-extremity surgeon, they make no attempt to categorize its location based on clinical relevance. Therefore, our purpose was to review the etiology, clinical presentation, and management of arteriovenous malformations in the upper limb and to refine the present classification to include present treatment options for this uncommonly encountered pathology.

Transitioning from pediatric to adult care is critical for young adults with sickle cell disease. While the transfer typically occurs at age 18, some pediatric providers continue care into adulthood. This study evaluates whether remaining in pediatric care versus transferring to adult care affects health outcomes. We hypothesized that those who remain in pediatric care after age 18 would experience fewer acute health-care events and better outcomes than those who transfer to adult care.
40202466	Guidelines on the Inclusion and Protection of Adolescent Minors and Young Adults in Health Research: A Position Statement of the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.	These guidelines aim to assist researchers and research ethics committees/institutional review boards in the ethical conduct of health research with adolescents and young adults (AYA), particularly research with adolescent minors. Inclusion of AYA in research and protection from research harms are essential if, as individuals and as a group, they are to receive the benefits of research. The ethical principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice, the human rights concepts of best interests and emerging capacity, and the concept of appropriate inclusion collectively provide an ethical framework for evaluating the circumstances within which adolescent minors can and should be involved as research participants. Likewise, legal concepts guiding informed consent in health-care practice-age of majority, emancipation, mature minor, and minor consent-provide an important conceptual basis for informed consent with adolescents in health research. Consent processes in adolescent health research should be based on scientific understandings of AYA cognitive, psychological, and social development; the weight of current scientific evidence suggests that capacity to provide informed consent for research is present by the age of 14 years. When adolescent minors consent for themselves (i.e., autonomously or independent of parents/guardians), procedures should be in place to assess and support their desire for advice from parents and other trusted adults. Researchers should involve AYA in the codesign of research and should involve community members, parents, and AYA in the development of research priorities and questions, to ensure that research is relevant to AYA, to protect privacy and confidentiality, to facilitate the dissemination of research findings, and to promote translation of research into practice. Research with AYA should never reinforce stigma and discrimination of AYA or the groups to which they belong.
40202461	Efficacy, Residue Risk, and Soil Ecosystem Safety of Butylidenephthalide for the Control of Peanut Stem Rot.	Peanut stem rot caused by <i>Sclerotium rolfsii</i> is becoming increasingly severe. Although butylidenephthalide exhibits great antifungal activity against <i>S. rolfsii</i>, its appropriate application strategy is unclear. Greenhouse experiments suggested that butylidenephthalide was suitable to be preventatively applied by root drenching at 400 mg/L for three times with an interval of 7 days. In field trials, butylidenephthalide exhibited an efficacy of 51.75% after 21 days and increased the peanut yields by 9.89%. Butylidenephthalide rapidly dissipated in soil and plants (<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 2.28-3.41 d), with no residues detected in edible peanut kernels or haulms at harvest. Butylidenephthalide showed a strong uptake and accumulation ability in plants from the soil (root concentration factor/bioconcentration factor > 1) and a moderate upward conductivity from roots to the above-ground parts (TF<sub>stem+leaf</sub> = 0.95). Butylidenephthalide exhibited low earthworm toxicity and stimulated bacterial/actinomycete populations while suppressing fungi in soil. Overall, butylidenephthalide showed a favorable efficacy, no residue risks, and high safety on the soil ecosystem in the control of peanut stem rot.

40202459	Exploring catalytic activity modulations: photoredox catalysis with substituted copper(I)-dipyridylamine derivatives.	In this work, we have successfully synthesized five new heteroleptic copper(I) complexes (C1-5), bearing N,N ligands derived from dipyridylamine and <i>S</i>-BINAP as the P,P auxiliary ligand. All complexes were structurally characterized using NMR, FT-IR, and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the molecular structures of C1, C4, and C5 were determined <i>via</i> X-ray diffraction analysis. The photophysical properties of all complexes were assessed using UV-Vis spectroscopy and spectrofluorometric measurements in dichloromethane solution and the solid state. All complexes displayed absorption bands at lower energies, attributed to spin-allowed MLCT transitions. In degassed dichloromethane solution at room temperature, all complexes exhibited broad luminescence in the visible spectrum, mainly assigned to MLCT/LLCT phosphorescence, with excited state lifetimes in the μs time regime. Besides, all complexes were assessed as photoredox catalysts in chlorosulfonylation and bromonitromethylation reactions of styrene, showing remarkable performances, thus highlighting the privileged role of the dpa ligand for the design of Earth-abundant metal photocatalysts.

Plant dehydration and rehydration cycles are universal phenomena in natural environments, especially in arid environments. Once a moderate water stress is relieved, the plant hydraulic system can recover, but the recovery process across roots, stems and leaves remains unknown.

40202456	Engineered hybrid cell membrane nanovesicles for potentiated cancer immunotherapy through dual immune checkpoint inhibition.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated remarkable success in treating various types of solid tumors; however, only a limited number of patients currently benefit from these therapeutic agents. Developing novel ICIs that elicit systemic and durable antitumor immune responses remains a significant challenge in improving immunotherapy outcomes. In this study, we engineered PD-1/LAG-3 receptors onto cell membrane nanovesicles to simultaneously block two immune checkpoints for the treatment of colorectal cancer. This dual-checkpoint blockade strategy led to significantly more potent tumor growth suppression in mice with MC38 xenografts compared to nanovesicles targeting PD-1 or LAG-3 alone. Notably, the hybrid nanovesicles substantially rejuvenated exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, promoting dendritic cell maturation and depleting regulatory T cells (Tregs). This research highlights the promising potential of cell membrane nanovesicles as an effective platform for delivering multiple immune checkpoints in cancer immunotherapy, offering a novel strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy.

40202454	A Flexible Leather-Based Sensor via the Dual In Situ Growth of Conductive Materials for Human Motion Detection.	Natural leather, with its mechanical strength, flexibility, and wearing comfort, is an ideal substrate material for wearable sensors. Currently, leather-based piezoresistive sensors still suffer from poor uniformity of conductive networks and weak interfacial interactions between conductive materials and leather, which limit their performance. Herein, it was innovatively proposed that polypyrrole (PPy) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were sequentially grown in situ on the surface of collagen fibers (CFs). Then, the tanning process was carried out to produce a leather-based flexible wearable sensor (PPy/AgNPs-LBPS) with excellent conductivity, hydrothermal, and environmental stability. Specifically, the dual in situ growth and tanning process ensured the uniform penetration and distribution of conductive materials in leather substrates. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonds between the conductive materials and CFs provided a firm combination to prevent the dropping of conductive materials. The synergistic effect of PPy and AgNPs enhanced the sensing performance of PPy/AgNPs-LBPS. It exhibited high sensitivity (0.65 kPa<sup>-1</sup> and 3.76), a wide detection range (0-80 kPa and 0-100%), and fast response capability. These characteristics enabled PPy/AgNPs-LBPS to monitor subtle activities and large-scale movements of the human body in real time, as well as tactile perception. This thesis provides a new idea for the intelligent design of traditional leather materials, multidimensional perception in electronic skin, and advancements in artificial intelligence.

40202450	Microscopic morphology modulation and microwave absorption properties of nano-ZnO.	Electromagnetic waves can cause varying degrees of damage to the human body and equipment, making the development of unique nanostructured materials with excellent reflection loss (RL), minimal thickness, wide frequency band, and light weight highly valued. To enhance the efficiency of microwave absorption, this study employs the hydrothermal method, using copper sheets as substrates, and varying the concentration of precursors, reaction time, and reaction temperature, successfully preparing three different morphologies of nano-ZnO (flake-like, flower-like, and rod-like). The electromagnetic properties and wave absorption performance of the obtained three morphologies were analyzed. The microwave loss effect of ZnO mainly comes from the sample's dielectric polarization, interfacial polarization, and multiple reflections. By comparing the different morphologies of ZnO, rod-like ZnO has better impedance matching and attenuation capabilities. When mixed with paraffin at a mass ratio of 20 wt% and a thickness of <i>d</i> = 3.5 mm, the sample exhibits good wave absorption performance (-11.02 dB) and an effective absorption bandwidth of 2.42 GHz. When rod-like ZnO is mixed with paraffin wax at 50 wt%, the maximum scattering loss is -19.2 dB and the effective absorption bandwidth is 1.5 GHz at a thickness of 4.5 mm and 16.82 GHz. There are significant differences in the absorption of electromagnetic waves by nano-ZnO with different microstructures, making it particularly important to study the absorption characteristics and microwave loss mechanisms of ZnO with specific morphologies.
40202449	Promoting Accurate Language on Lactation from Prenatal to Postpartum.	Lactation is a vital function of reproduction and population dynamics as human milk supports infant survival and development. Although the physiological processes of lactation have largely remained unchanged throughout human history, contemporary practices in human milk provision have expanded the original lexicon, resulting in ambiguity and potential misrepresentations in lactation-related language. We provide an overview of the anatomy and physiology of lactation to emphasize the importance of precise and consistent language as most nurses and health care professionals receive little to no education in their programs of study about lactation and breastfeeding. Concrete definitions and explanations on how to use the science of human milk and the physiology of lactation are crucial for evidence-based lactation education, support, and intervention. LactaPedia, an online comprehensive human lactation glossary, is freely accessible to nurses and the public to remain updated on lactation-related language as well as offer feedback on the relevancy and usability of any fundamental terminology. Precise and consistent use of lactation-related language will overall improve communication between nurses and multidisciplinary teams and thereby enhance care and outcomes for families.
40202447	Characteristic Findings in Aborted Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomies.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> In rare instances, patients deemed operative candidates for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) have their procedure aborted intraoperatively. Understanding the incidence and factors associated with aborted RARP cases can improve preoperative counseling and intraoperative decision-making. We performed a retrospective analysis of RARP cases performed by high-volume surgeons across our multihospital medical system to characterize the incidence and causes of aborted procedures. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We queried the Northwestern Electronic Data Warehouse from January 2018 to June 2024 for patients who underwent RARP performed by high-volume surgeons. Aborted procedures were defined as those terminated after anesthesia but before completion. Comparative statistics were used to evaluate clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characteristics between aborted and completed cases. Imaging features of propensity-matched patients with completed or aborted procedures were also analyzed. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Among 3316 RARPs performed by 10 high-volume surgeons, 26 cases (0.7%) were aborted. The leading causes were pelvic lipomatosis (35%), adhesions (27%), and cardiorespiratory events (12%). Higher body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with aborted operation (30.7 <i>vs</i> 27.8, <i>p</i> = 0.015). Although prior abdominal operations were more frequent in the aborted group (7.7% <i>vs</i> 2.6%), this was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.2). Perioperative complications occurred in 12% of aborted cases. Four cases were reattempted, with three completed effectively. The apparent diffusion coefficient of perivesical pelvic fat was higher in aborted cases but not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.13). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The incidence of aborted RARP among experienced surgeons is low, accounting for less than 1% of all cases. Pelvic lipomatosis was the most common reason for an aborted procedure and may be recognized preoperatively on imaging. Higher BMI was associated with a significantly higher risk for aborted procedure. When counseling patients, this information could be used to set expectations for the risk of an aborted procedure.

Berbamine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid (bisBIA), is a promising lead for developing novel therapeutics to treat aggressive cancers such as lymphoma, by targeting the CaMKIIγ:cMyc axis. Herein, we report an aza-Friedel-Crafts method for <i>ortho</i>-aminoalkylation of berbamine's phenolic motif, enabling the semisynthesis of the natural product bersavine and analogs that complement current methods focusing on modifying the phenolic oxygen. Several new analogs synthesized by this method exhibit potent cytotoxicity against lymphoma-associated cell line H9 exceeding the naturally occurring berbamine (1) and bersavine (3a). A molecular docking analysis was used to devise a model that rationalizes the structure-activity relationship between the novel bisBIA analogs and CaMKIIγ inhibition.

40202441	Enhancing the acoustoelectric conversion of a nanofiber transducer in combination with a kazoo.	Acoustoelectric transducers are often combined with an acoustic resonator to improve their acoustoelectric performance. Previous studies have mostly been based on Helmholtz resonators, which are bulky in size and have limited improvement in acoustoelectric performance. In this study, for the first time, a kazoo, a flat miniature musical instrument, was used as an acoustic resonator to improve the acoustoelectric performance of a nanofiber acoustoelectric transducer. When a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber membrane was incorporated into the kazoo as a sound vibration diaphragm, it improved the acoustoelectric output in the low-frequency sound range and allowed sound to be collected from the side of the entire device. The electrospun PVDF nanofiber membrane worked with the polymethylmethacrylate kazoo to increase the sound intensity by at least 15 decibels in the nanofiber region. Under 100 Hz, 115 dB input sound conditions, the device generated 196.0 ± 8.6 V peak-to-peak voltage and 12.0 ± 1.1 μA current outputs. The generated power was sufficient to power applications. By rethinking resonator design and exploiting the versatility of nanofibers, this work establishes a paradigm shift in acoustic energy harvesting, offering a scalable, high-efficiency alternative to conventional resonator-dependent systems.
40202440	Highly efficient photocatalytic reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO under visible light using rhenium benzo[<i>d</i>]oxazole complexes.	A series of six isomeric rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes featuring asymmetric diimine ligands 5,7-di-<i>tert</i>-butyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)benzo[<i>d</i>]oxazole, 2-(pyridin-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-<i>d</i>]oxazole, 2-(pyridin-2-yl)naphtho[2,3-<i>d</i>]oxazole, 2-(quinolin-2-yl)benzo[<i>d</i>]oxazole, 2-(quinolin-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-<i>d</i>]oxazole, and 2-(isoquinolin-1-yl)benzo[<i>d</i>]oxazole, was synthesized and comprehensively characterized through analytical techniques, spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. These complexes were assessed as catalysts for visible-light-driven CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, both with and without an external photosensitizer (PS), and also exhibited catalytic activity in electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, effectively functioning in both regimes. In the presence of a proton donor, trifluoroethanol (TFE), the complexes produced methane and carbon monoxide (CO) electrochemically. Under photochemical conditions, high selectivity for CO production was achieved in acetonitrile with triethanolamine (TEOA) as the proton source. This work highlights the tunability of metal complex photocatalysts for solar-to-fuel conversion through ligand design. Among the complexes studied, the rhenium complex featuring the 2-(pyridin-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-<i>d</i>]oxazole ligand demonstrated the highest catalytic efficiency, achieving a turnover number of 660 for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO after 5 hours. Mechanistic studies employing NMR, UV-vis spectroscopy, and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations provided insights into the catalytic process. These rhenium(I) complexes demonstrate promising potential for photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO, offering valuable insights into the design and development of efficient catalysts for artificial photosynthesis and solar-to-fuel conversion.
40202439	Guidelines for Primary Pediatric Care Professionals to Help Patients Establish and Protect Milk Supply.	The first well-child encounter for healthy, full-term newborns occurs within the critical window for the establishment of the milk supply. Frequent, effective removal of human milk from the breast is essential to achieving a robust milk supply. Nurses in primary care settings are crucial in providing quality and timely lactation care to ensure the parent is experiencing effective milk removal. Identification of risk factors and barriers to achieving a milk supply requires adept assessment and knowledge of lactation physiology. Not all nurses receive formal education on human milk and lactation. This resource can be used by primary care nurses to prioritize establishing and protecting the milk supply among families with a desire to breastfeed.
40202438	Research on cluster hollow fiber membrane proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (CHFM-PTR-MS) and its application in odorous gas detection.	Odorous gas emission is one of the world's seven major public nuisances, easily causing disturbances and complaints, and posing a threat to air quality and public health. Emissions of odorous substances are characterized by their sudden and instantaneous nature, with some odorous compounds having extremely low olfactory thresholds. Therefore, it is essential to develop highly sensitive on-site rapid detection techniques. This paper presents a new technology that combines a cluster hollow fiber membrane (CHFM) with mobile proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), developing a cluster hollow fiber membrane-proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (CHFM-PTR-MS) technique. Due to the large membrane area (1000 cm<sup>2</sup>) of the cluster hollow fiber membrane module, the CHFM-PTR-MS shows improved sensitivity for eight tested odorous substances by 7.6 to 12.2 times and an enhanced limit of detection by 6.7 to 12.4 times compared to traditional direct-injection PTR-MS. Through a 28-hour continuous monitoring experiment of odorous gases released from household waste, the capability of the new CHFM-PTR-MS technology for on-site rapid detection of trace odorous organic compounds was verified. The CHFM-PTR-MS is expected to provide a new technique and device for on-site rapid detection of odorous organic compounds with high sensitivity.
40202437	Harvesting Bright Green Photoluminescence of Tb<sub>2</sub>(BDC)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> MOF via Pressure-Modulated Ligand-to-Metal Energy Transfer.	Lanthanide metal-organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs) exhibit distinctive emission spectra and prolonged luminescent lifetimes, thereby offering a unique platform for the advancement of solid-state photoluminescence (PL) materials. However, the mismatch between the energy levels of metal ions and organic ligands leads to a weak PL emission. Herein, this study presents a pressure-treated strategy aimed at achieving efficient green PL in Tb<sub>2</sub>(BDC)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> MOF. Compared to the initial intensity, the PL intensity is enhanced eightfold below 3.1 GPa. Intriguingly, the PL intensity of pressure-treated sample is amplified by 2.5-fold compared to the initial state, and the green emission monochromaticity is maintained. Experiments and calculations reveal that the enhanced hydrogen bonds are retained to the ambient conditions after pressure treatment. They lock the conjugated configuration formed between the planes of carboxyl group and benzene ring, facilitating the intersystem crossing. The reduced distances between metal ions and organic ligands drive the ligand-to-metal energy transfer process. This finding provided significant insights into structure-property relationship of Tb<sub>2</sub>(BDC)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>, offering a new platform for boosting emission enhancement in Ln-MOFs.
40202436	Dual palladium-organophotoredox catalyzed C-H olefination-annulation of aryl carboxylic acids.	Herein, we report a dual palladium-photoredox mediated tandem C-H olefination-cyclization of aryl carboxylic acids with both terminal and internal alkenes using molecular oxygen as a green oxidant. This method offers a mild and simple route for the synthesis of various isobenzofuranone derivatives. The synthetic utility of the method was demonstrated by late stage functionalization of various carboxylic acid containing drugs. Further derivatizations of the final isobenzofuranones were performed to access other important molecular scaffolds. Mechanistic studies indicated that the final cyclization step involves an oxopalladation-protodemetallation mechanism rather than a simple oxa-Michael addition commonly employed in other methodologies at elevated temperatures.

40202433	Nickel-Catalyzed Electroreductive Heck Reaction: A Divergent Synthesis of C7- or C2-Arylindolines.	Herein, we present a novel electrochemically driven nickel-catalyzed Heck reaction of readily available <i>N</i>-arylacrylindoles for the construction of both 7-arylindolines and 2-arylindolines. The reaction proceeds in an undivided electrochemical cell and employs a sacrificial zinc anode as the reductant. This catalytic protocol features a consecutive electroreductive process under exceedingly mild reaction conditions, with moderate yields. Detailed mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves a domino sequence of intramolecular electroreductive Heck arylation and selective C-C or C-O bond cleavage, which could be accomplished by aryl migration or carbethoxy removal.
40202432	MnO<sub>2</sub>-based nanoparticles remodeling tumor micro-environment to augment sonodynamic immunotherapy against breast cancer.	The tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by a complex array of factors, including aerobic conditions, high glutathione (GSH) levels, acidic pH, and elevated hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) content, all of which promote cancer progression and contribute to poor prognosis. Fortunately, these challenges can be addressed using MnO<sub>2</sub>-based nanomaterials. In this study, we have designed and synthesized a Curcumin/MnO<sub>2</sub>@PLGA@4T1 cell membrane (CMP@4T1m) system aimed at remodelling the TME and enhancing sonodynamic immunotherapy for breast cancer. Through the homologous targeting ability of 4T1m, CMP@4T1m efficiently accumulates at the tumor site. Upon ultrasound irradiation, curcumin (Cur) acts as a sonosensitizer, generating cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), activate T-cell responses, and repolarize protumoral M2-like macrophages to antitumoral M1-like macrophages. In the TME, which is mildly acidic and enriched with GSH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub> not only oxidizes GSH to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) but also reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup> to produce oxygen, alleviating hypoxia and significantly enhancing the sonodynamic immunotherapy effect. Additionally, Mn<sup>2+</sup> generated during this process converts H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). This study thus lays the foundation for advancing cancer nanomedicine, offering a novel approach that integrates TME remodelling with sonodynamic immunotherapy.
40202431	Cationic and anionic phenothiazine derivatives: electrochemical behavior and application in DNA sensor development.	The global shift toward personalized medicine and point-of-care testing drives the need for improved analytical performance in sensor technologies. A critical aspect of developing voltammetric sensors lies in identifying novel materials for electrode modification. This study focuses on the electrochemical investigation of two phenothiazine derivatives with distinct terminal functional groups: a cationic compound, 3,7-bis(4-aminophenylamino)phenothiazin-5-ium chloride, and an anionic compound, 3,7-bis(4-carboxyphenylamino)phenothiazin-5-ium chloride. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance, and scanning electron microscopy were employed to characterize these novel materials. The mutual influence of phenothiazines on voltammetric signals in solutions was analyzed, revealing changes in the number of hydrogen ions transferred when transitioning from an individual cationic derivative solution to a mixed solution with the anionic derivative. Two approaches for modifying glassy carbon electrodes were studied: electropolymerization from a mixture of phenothiazines and consecutive electrodeposition of polymeric films from individual solutions. Morphological and quantitative differences in the resulting electrode films were observed, with the latter method yielding a more uniform and thicker layer of redox-active material. A DNA sensor based on the consecutive electrodeposited films for the detection of doxorubicin was developed. The redox peak currents of the electropolymerized phenothiazine products exhibited a linear response to the logarithm of doxorubicin concentration. The sensor displayed two distinct linear ranges from 0.1 fM to 1 nM and from 1 nM to 1 μM, with a limit of detection calculated from the first range at 0.6 fM. This DNA sensor offers promising applications for advancing point-of-care diagnostics.
40202430	Evaluation of pure shift NMR methods for the analysis of complex metabolite mixtures with a benchtop NMR spectrometer.	Compact, low-cost and cryogen-free benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers have become an attractive option for analysing complex biological mixtures. The implementation of spectral simplification methods such as pure shift spectroscopy is particularly important to circumvent the ubiquitous peak overlaps that occur due to the limited resolution of compact instruments. Pure shift (PS) strategies consist of eliminating the signal multiplicity induced by the homonuclear J-couplings observed in 1D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra, thereby simplifying the spectral information. This paper provides an analytical evaluation of optimised pure shift spectroscopy pulse sequences for the analysis of metabolite mixtures on a recent benchtop NMR spectrometer. Six PS pulse sequences were carefully evaluated, based on three families of PS techniques: 1D projections of 2D J-resolved spectra, Zangger-Sterk (ZS) and PSYCHE. The methods were evaluated in terms of resolution, sensitivity, spectral purity and repeatability. Among the strategies we explored, 1D projections of 2D J-resolved double-echo (J-RES DE) spectra, combined with an improved processing strategy, appeared to offer the best compromise based on these analytical criteria. The potential of this method was illustrated on a complex sample from the food industry and enabled key metabolites to be detected with improved resolution and sensitivity, showing that PS NMR could be used for a rapid (22 minutes) profiling of complex metabolite mixtures on a benchtop NMR spectrometer.

Mechanistic investigations of prospective intermediates in copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with alkyllithium-activated alkylboronic esters are described. Complexes between (NHC)copper and the borate salts were characterized by X-ray crystallography and NMR, and the rate of intramolecular transmetalation of an alkyl group from boron to copper was measured. Derived activation parameters were correlated with those determined by DFT analysis and give insight into the mechanism of stereospecific transmetalation.
40202427	Meckel's diverticulum discovered by capsule endoscopy: a systematic review of case reports.	Capsule endoscopy has achieved its place as a diagnostic tool in a clinical setting, especially in the small bowel. The most frequent malformation of the gastrointestinal tract (Meckel's Diverticulum) has therefore been discovered incidentally by capsule endoscopies multiple times. However, it is still not a regular diagnostic modality when the pathology is suspected. In this review of case reports, we aim to evaluate the knowledge and rationales of using capsule endoscopy as a diagnostic tool for Meckel's diverticulum.

A kinetic resolution of binols and biphenols has been realized <i>via</i> dehydrogenative coupling with hydrosilanes catalyzed by a frustrated Lewis pair of chiral borane and chiral phosphine. A variety of axially chiral siloxanes, along with the corresponding optically active binols and biphenols, were obtained in good yields with moderate to high enantioselectivities.
40202425	Interfacial H-bond Network/Concentration Fields/Electric Fields Regulation Achieved by D-Valine Anions Realizes the Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries.	Uncontrolled mobile anions and proton transport result in many issues, including interfacial anion depletion, irregular multi-physics fields fluctuations, space charge layer-induced interfacial Zn dendrites, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which seriously exacerbates the cycling stability of zinc-ion batteries. Herein, this work constructs an efficient D-valine anion interface structure to reversely regulate the Zn2+/H+ dynamic chemistry and unlocks the multiple regulation effects of this anionic interface by investigating interfacial proton transport and complex concentration/electric fields distribution of Zn anode through dynamic in-situ spectroscopy analysis, static energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulation. We unravel core factors affecting complicated interfacial HER processes and the generation of the space charge layer. This anionic interfacial layer severs proton hopping transport by rupturing the initial water-water hydrogen bond, which effectively restrains uncontrolled HER processes. Further, the anion-immobilized interfacial layer accelerates Zn2+ transfer to optimize the interfacial concentration fields. Also, the anionic interface restrains the formation of the anion depletion layer by relieving rapid Zn2+ ions exhaustion and strengthening the uniformity of interfacial electrical field distribution, which suppresses space charges-induced Zn dendrite growth. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells deliver an ultra-long cycle life of 4150 h. Importantly, the multiple regulation effects enable Zn||I2 cells exhibit long-term stable life.
40202424	Trajectories of maternal depression, anxiety, stress, and child developmental milestones at 24 months.	<i>Background</i>: Literature suggests a link between maternal mental health and adverse child developmental outcomes. However, we do not know to what extent this is true in low and middle-income settings, and most studies do not explore mental health longitudinally since birth.<i>Objective</i>: We aimed to assess the association between maternal mental health and early child development outcomes in southern Brazil.<i>Methods</i>: We studied 992 mother-child pairs in a birth cohort from 2019 to 2022. We used standardised instruments to assess maternal depression, anxiety, and distress at different time points during the perinatal period. We used Group Based Trajectory Modelling to create maternal mental health trajectories. We assessed these trajectories associated with the child's social, language, cognitive, and motor development at 24 months using Poisson multiple regression models.<i>Results</i>: Children of mothers with elevated symptoms of depression experienced an 80% [RR = 1.80; 95%CI(1.19-2.71)] increase in language delays, 23% [RR = 1.23; 95%CI(1.01-1.51)] in cognitive delays, and 40% [RR = 1.40; 95%CI(1.07-1.83)] in motor delays. Children of mothers experiencing increasing symptoms of anxiety to moderate levels had 38% [RR = 1.38' 95%CI(1.07-1.82)] more language delays and 20% [RR = 1.20; 95%CI(1.05-1.38)] more cognitive delays. Low subjective distress led to 54% [RR = 1.54; 95%CI(1.15-2.05)] more language delays.<i>Conclusion</i>: Our findings underscore the effect of maternal mental health on child developmental outcomes among this sample in southern Brazil.

40202420	Enhancing stability and iterative learning in neuromorphic memristor <i>via</i> TiN/SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub>/TiN interface engineering.	In this study, we fabricated SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-based interface-type resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) devices and demonstrated their superior performance. The device was operated at voltages below 3 V with a maximum current of less than 1 mA. It exhibited an on/off ratio of approximately 10, with a set speed of 1 μs at 3 V and a reset speed of 1 μs at -4.5 V. Notably, the retention time at 85 °C reached 10<sup>4</sup> s. The interface-type ReRAM displayed significant linearity owing to gradual operation, which is characteristic of long-term potentiation and long-term depression. This high linearity facilitates an impressive modified national institute of standards and technology database (MNIST) digit recognition accuracy of 92.21%. To further understand the influence of endurance on learning performance, we evaluated the impact of synaptic weight degradation by comparing both TiN/SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub>/TiN and Pt/SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub>/Pt devices. This approach allowed us to assess how degradation directly affects synaptic behavior and learning efficiency in neuromorphic applications. The TiN/SiO<sub><i>x</i></sub>/TiN configuration exhibited superior endurance, as the presence of an oxygen reservoir improved synaptic performance and stability, which aligns with the gradual switching dynamics observed in our experiments and contributes to the overall device robustness and efficiency.
40202419	MXene-Wood Composites: A Review of Fabrication, Properties, Applications, and Future Prospects.	MXene is a cationic 2D material made of transition metal carbides known for its diverse structure and multifunctionality. It faces challenges like stacking, oxidation, and weak mechanical properties that limit its use. By integrating MXene with self-supporting porous materials, it can be stabilized and converted from fragile 2D sheets to strong 3D structures. Wood, due to its natural structure and stability, is ideal for depositing MXene, which adheres to wood via adsorption, hydrogen bonding, or reactions with wood fibers. New MXene-wood composites with improved functions have been created and show great potential for interdisciplinary research. This review covers preparation methods, applications, potential development, and challenges of MXene-wood composites, aiming to provide a research framework and progressive direction for their future development.

40202417	Predicting Major Adverse Cardiac Events Using Deep Learning-based Coronary Artery Disease Analysis at CT Angiography.	<i>"Just Accepted" papers have undergone full peer review and have been accepted for publication in <i>Radiology: Artificial Intelligence</i>. This article will undergo copyediting, layout, and proof review before it is published in its final version. Please note that during production of the final copyedited article, errors may be discovered which could affect the content.</i> Purpose To evaluate the predictive value of deep learning (DL)-based coronary artery disease (CAD) extent analysis for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in patients with acute chest pain presenting to the emergency department (ED). Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter observational study included consecutive patients with acute chest pain who underwent coronary CT angiography (CCTA) at three institutional EDs from January 2018 to December 2022. Patients were classified as having no CAD, nonobstructive CAD, or obstructive CAD using a DL model. The primary outcome was MACEs during follow-up, defined as a composite of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for unstable angina. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the predictors of MACEs. Results The study included 408 patients (224 male; mean age, 59.4 ± 14.6 years). The DL model classified 162 (39.7%) patients as having no CAD, 94 (23%) as having nonobstructive CAD, and 152 (37.3%) as having obstructive CAD. Sixty-three (15.4%) patients experienced MACEs during follow-up. Patients with MACEs had a higher prevalence of obstructive CAD than those without (<i>P</i> < .001). In multivariate analysis model 1 (clinical risk factors), dyslipidemia (Hazard ratio [HR], 2.15 and elevated Troponin-T (HR 2.13) predicted MACEs (all <i>P</i> < .05). In model 2 (clinical risk factors + DL-based CAD extent), obstructive CAD detected by the DL model was the most significant independent predictor of MACEs (HR, 88.07, <i>P</i> < .001). Harrell's C-statistic showed that DL-based CAD extent enhanced the risk stratification beyond clinical risk factors (Harrell's C-statistics: 0.94 versus 0.80, <i>P</i> < .001). Conclusion DL-based detection of obstructive CAD demonstrated stronger predictive value than clinical risk factors for MACEs in patients with acute chest pain presenting to the ED. ©RSNA, 2025.
40202416	Adaptive Dual-Task Deep Learning for Automated Thyroid Cancer Triaging at Screening US.	<i>"Just Accepted" papers have undergone full peer review and have been accepted for publication in <i>Radiology: Artificial Intelligence</i>. This article will undergo copyediting, layout, and proof review before it is published in its final version. Please note that during production of the final copyedited article, errors may be discovered which could affect the content.</i> Purpose To develop an adaptive dual-task deep learning model (ThyNet-S) for detection and classification of thyroid lesions at US screening. Materials and Methods The retrospective study used a multicenter dataset comprising 35008 thyroid US images of 23294 individual examinations (mean age, 40.4 years ± 13.1[SD], 17587 female) from 7 medical centers during January 2009 and December 2021. Of these, 29004 images were used for model development and 6004 images for validation. The model determined cancer risk for each image and automatically triaged images with normal thyroid and benign nodules by dynamically integrating lesion detection through pixel-level feature analysis and lesion classification through deep semantic features analysis. Diagnostic performance of screening assisted by the model (ThyNet-S triaged screening) and traditional screening (radiologists alone) was assessed by comparing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC using McNemar's test and Delong test. The influence of ThyNet-S on radiologist workload and clinical decision-making was also assessed. Results ThyNet-S-assisted triaged screening achieved higher AUC than original screening in six senior and six junior radiologists (0.93 versus 0.91, and 0.92 versus 0.88, respectively, all <i>P</i> < .001). The model improved sensitivity for junior radiologists (88.2% versus 86.8%, <i>P</i> <.001). Notably, the model reduced radiologists' workload by triaging 60.4% of cases as not potentially malignant, which did not require further interpretation. The model simultaneously decreased unnecessary fine needle aspiration rate from 38.7% to 14.9% and 11.5% when used independently or in combination with Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System, respectively. Conclusion ThyNet-S improved efficiency of thyroid cancer screening and optimized clinical decision-making. ©RSNA, 2025.
40202415	Theoretical Calculations in Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry: Applications and Insights.	Separation and enrichment are critical steps in analytical detection, necessitating advanced materials with high selectivity and adsorption capacity for target compounds. In order to improve separation efficiency and selectivity, computational simulation could elucidate interaction mechanisms and analyze potential adsorption/desorption processes, providing a theoretical foundation for the optimization and design of separation materials. Recently, computational simulation has become an indispensable and crucial mean in separation science for analytical chemistry. Using various simulation software, researchers could investigate the structures, properties, and performance of separation materials at multiple levels and scales. In this review, we summarize the applications of computational simulations in the field of separation science, focusing on the separation of polar molecules, geometric isomers, enantiomer compounds, and post-translationally modified peptides. These calculation methods include quantum chemistry, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, high-throughput screening, and machine learning. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and potential breakthroughs in computational simulation, aiming to offer valuable insights for researchers dedicated to computational simulation, material development, and separation applications.
40202414	The humanistic burden of atopic dermatitis in Greece: a cross-sectional study.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial burden in adult Greek patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) using validated tools and to investigate factors that influence AD's humanistic burden. This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in Greece (January-September 2023) with 150 adult members of the patient association "EPIDERMIA", all diagnosed with AD. Data was collected via a structured questionnaire, including socio-demographic details, clinical history, AD severity (using the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure [POEM]), QoL, sleep disorders, and psychological health. Based on POEM scores, 11% of participants had clear/almost clear skin, 27% had mild eczema, 51% had moderate eczema, and 12% had severe/very severe eczema. AD had a moderate or very/extremely large impact on QoL for 29% and 42% of participants, respectively. Insomnia affected 55%, while 31% had mild anxiety, 23% had moderate/severe anxiety, 10% had moderate depression, and 8% had moderately severe/severe depression. AD severity was associated with reduced QoL and higher rates of insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Our study highlights significant associations between AD severity, QoL, and psychosocial factors, emphasizing the need for comprehensive management strategies.
40202413	Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Approach for Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectra of Driven Systems.	Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers significant advantages in terms of high temporal and frequency resolutions and a signal-to-noise ratio. Until now, the response-function (RF) formalism has been the prevalent theoretical description. In this study, we compare the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) method with the RF formalism in a three-level system with a constant control field. We obtain the signals from both approaches and compare their population dynamics and 2DCS. We propose quasi-Green functions for the NHH method, which allows all dominant Liouville paths to be inferred. We further simulated the 2DCS of Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (RDC) dissolved in hexane with the NHH method, which is in good agreement with the previous experiments. Although the NHH method overestimates relaxations, it provides all important paths by analytical solutions, which are different from the four paths used in the RF formalism. Our results demonstrate that the NHH method is more suitable than the RF formalism for investigating the systems, including relaxation and control fields via the 2DCS.
40202406	Menopause, women and the workplace.	This invited review is a synthesis of a plenary lecture presented at International Menopause Society Conference in Melbourne 2024. The focus was to set the historic context within which research about women in the workplace must be approached. It is exciting for occupational health researchers to see expansion of the evidence about health and work but we urge menopause and work researchers to collaborate with occupational health colleagues. The growing literature suggests that most women do not experience problems coping with their menopause in the workplace. Most research, however, fails to consider any workplace factors or even the nature of the job women are needing to do. Where studies have focused on occupational groups, they have focused on nurses or other professional/leadership groups. So far, it appears that women's ability to cope is influenced by the number of symptoms, severity of symptoms, and workplace and personal psychosocial factors. However, the problems with coping may be greater for disadvantaged women doing less well-paid work with less flexibility and autonomy. The same women probably have less access to appropriate advice, treatment and support. Researchers must focus on women at highest risk and take a nuanced approach to optimize support without increasing gender-based discrimination.
40202404	Ratiometric luminescence sensing of bio-macromolecules <i>via</i> highly sensitive templated pyrene-based nanoGUMBOS.	A series of pyrene-based ionic liquids, comprises a group of uniform materials based on organic salts (GUMBOS), were synthesized by incorporating pyrene butyrate with quaternary alkyl phosphonium or ammonium cations <i>via</i> ion exchange reaction and by virtue of a variation in alkyl chain-length. Water-suspended crystalline pyrene-assimilated nanoparticles (nanoGUMBOS) were subsequently fabricated from the prepared GUMBOS <i>via</i> reprecipitation method. Photophysical and microscopic measurements were performed to confirm the crystalline molecular-level stacking of pyrene fluorophores inside the nanoparticles. The pyrene moieties within the nanoGUMBOS showed a tendency for enhanced self-association upon photo-excitation, resulting in a novel excited-state aggregation-induced emission (ESAIE). Due to the bathochromically-shifted strong aggregation-induced emission, these nanoGUMBOS are further employed in the sensitive and selective ratiometric detection of biomacromolecules in aqueous and serum albumin media. As the excessive use of some biomacromolecules (heparin and protamine) can lead to undesired side-effects in living systems, hence their detection can be very crucial. In most cases, interaction with biomacromolecules like heparin facilitates the formation of excimer species in pyrene systems, but to our utter surprise, here we observed the opposite phenomenon of excimer disintegration. This presents a convenient method for detecting heparin in aqueous and serum albumin media. Furthermore, using the nanoGUMBOS-heparin complex, we can also detect protamine. A detailed study of the detection mechanism is presented in this report.

A convenient route for the mechanochemical synthesis of fluorinated aromatic compounds, that is, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, and trifluoromethoxy arenes, has been developed via pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry-BF<sub>4</sub>)-mediated desulfonamidative cross-coupling of primary sulfonamides under the synergy of a piezoelectric material BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, and Ru-catalysis. This is the first-ever report on the selective transformation of sulfonamide (SO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) functionality to CF<sub>3</sub>/OCF<sub>3</sub>/F group in a single step under mechanochemical ball-milling conditions. Considering the importance of primary sulfonamides as the valuable pharmacophores, the present desulfonamidative cross-coupling approach could have potential to get synthetic utility in pharmaceutical industries for the late-stage functionalization of sulfonamide drugs and related active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
40202396	Appropriate compression values for the transtibial prosthesis using the AERO prosthetic liner.	Positive model rectification is a key factor in providing a comfortable and successful transtibial prosthetic socket fitting. This study aimed to assess whether a 4% compression value in 3- and 5-mm thickness affordable ethylene-vinyl acetate roll-on (AERO) liners yields acceptable comfort and pressure distribution for transtibial prosthetic users. Stump socks were used to adjust volume in the fitting process with a socket compressed to 4%, and pressure data were collected using 6 force-sensing resistor (FSR400) sensors placed in areas sensitive and tolerant to pressure. Peak pressure was collected from 40 steps, and pressure uniformity was calculated using the coefficient of variation in 2-min walking on the treadmill. The socket comfort score was collected after the trial. Appropriate compression values, pressure distribution, and socket comfort score were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and effect size was determined using Cliff's delta. The study found that a 4.95% compression was optimal for a 3-mm thickness liner, whereas a 4.5% compression suited a 5-mm liner better for comfort. Moreover, the study observed a small similarity in pressure distribution between liners, as indicated by Cliff's delta, with the 5-mm liner possibly providing more even pressure because of its thickness. Despite being made of the same material, liners with different thicknesses distribute pressure differently. Therefore, this study suggests that a 4% universal compression value in the affordable ethylene-vinyl acetate roll-on liner may be effective for use in a clinical setting. Future studies should include more participants to identify the appropriate compression for a variety of residual limbs.

Dynamic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risks is a cornerstone of patient-centered care in atrial fibrillation (AF) management. Unlike traditional approaches that evaluate these risks only at diagnosis or at initiation of oral anticoagulation, current evidence emphasizes periodic reassessment due to the evolving nature of risks.

40202393	Saikosaponin D, a triterpene saponin from <i>Bupleurum falcatum</i>, restores circadian rhythm and attenuates hepatic fibrosis via Esr1-Per2 axis.	Hepatic fibrosis, a precursor to chronic liver diseases, is linked to circadian rhythm disruptions. This study investigates the anti-fibrotic effects of saikosaponin D (SSd) from <i>Bupleurum falcatum L</i>. and its regulation of circadian genes. Transcriptomic and single-cell analyses revealed circadian gene dysregulation, particularly Period 2 (Per2), in liver fibrosis and hepatic stellate cells. SSd upregulated Per2 transcription via estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1), as confirmed by siRNA, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analyses. <i>In vivo</i>, SSd alleviated fibrosis and hepatitis, increasing Esr1 but not Per2 protein levels. These findings suggest SSd exerts anti-fibrotic effects by modulating Esr1-mediated Per2 transcription.
40202391	Comparing social media engagement between women with suicidal ideation and those who have attempted suicide.	This study examined differences in social media engagement between women with suicidal ideation only (SI-only) and those who had attempted suicide (SA). We used content, statistical, and time series analyses on 3,510 tweets from 41 women in South Korea who had ideated and/or attempted suicide. Most tweets focused on everyday life and interests (38.0%, 1,355 tweets), while others expressed mental health distress and challenges (0.6%, 22), school or work-related stress (3.4%, 120), social relationship stress (1.5%, 52), and explicit suicidal statements (0.6%, 22). SI-only users posted the most on Saturdays, while SA users peaked on Sundays. Closer to the time of suicide, SA users increasingly posted explicit suicidal content, whereas SI-only users expressed more negative emotions. Our findings could help identify individuals at risk of suicide on social media, distinguishing between SI-only and SA users to inform better interventions.
40202388	Engineered NK Exosomes Captured Antigens In Situ for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy.	Natural killer (NK) cells are widely involved in the field of tumor immunotherapy due to their unique killing ability. However, the durability and efficacy of NK-cell monotherapy are facing great challenges owing to the limitation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). NK cell-derived exosomes (Neo) not only play an innate immunomodulatory role similar to NK cells but also emerge as promising antitumor nanocarriers. In this study, an engineered Neo (R@Neo-MN) was designed that encapsulates the multifunctional antitumor drug (Raddeanin a, RA) and modified with maleimide (Mal, M) and mannose (Man, N). The obtained R@Neo-MN could not only exert NK cell-like antitumor function but also induce the immunogenic cell death of tumors to release tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Furthermore, R@Neo-MN activated the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator (cGAS/STING) to release type I interferons (IFN). Then, R@Neo-MN could capture TAAs through Mal and specifically target dendritic cells (DCs) through Man, thereby promoting the maturation of DCs and enhancing tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL)-mediated adaptive immunity. The released IFN further promoted the infiltration and activition of NK cells and CTLs at the tumor site. Our study suggested a novel strategy that harnesses both innate and adaptive immunity for enhanced tumor immunotherapy.
40202387	Influence of Magnetic Anisotropy on the Ground State of [CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>]Fe(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>: Insights into the Improper Modulated Magnetic Structure.	The hybrid perovskites [CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>]Co<i><sub>x</sub></i>Ni<sub><i>x</i>-1</sub>(HCOO)<sub>3</sub> with <i>x</i> = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 possess multiple phase transitions, including incommensurate structures. Notably, [CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>]Ni(HCOO)<sub>3</sub> features a proper magnetically incommensurate structure ground state. To explore similar behavior, we investigated the isomorphous [CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>]Fe(HCOO)<sub>3</sub> (<b>1</b>). A combination of magnetometry measurements, single crystal and powder neutron diffraction, and density functional theory calculations have been used to accurately determine and understand the sequence of nuclear and magnetic phases present in compound <b>1</b>. At room temperature, it crystallizes in the <i>Pnma</i> space group with a perovskite structure. Below 170 K, new satellite reflections indicate a transition to a modulated structure, refined in the <i>Pnma</i>(00γ)0<i>s</i>0 with <b>q<sub>1</sub></b> = 0.1662(2)<i>c</i>*. At 75 K, the satellite reflections become closer to the main reflections, indicating a second transition, which maintains the superspace group symmetry but decreases the modulation wave vector to <b>q<sub>2</sub></b> = 0.1425(2)<i>c</i>*, i.e., with a longer modulation period. This modulation persists to 2 K, overlapping with the onset of 3D antiferromagnetic order at 17 K, offering a unique opportunity to study magneto-structural coupling. Our results point to an improper magnetic modulated structure where, interestingly, the spins are perpendicular to those of previously reported compounds.
40202385	The reaction of sulfenic acids with OH and HO<sub>2</sub> radicals in different environments.	Sulfenic acids are involved in major chemical processes occurring in the atmosphere, in food chemistry and in biological systems. In these diverse environments, oxidation reactions caused by reactive oxygen species, especially hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO<sub>2</sub>) radicals, are very important, but their mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this question, in this paper we present high-level theoretical results on selected reactions in gas phase and in aqueous solution. The study shows that the abstraction of the acidic hydrogen by OH or HO<sub>2</sub> is the most important process in all cases. It leads to the formation of sulfinyl radicals and H<sub>2</sub>O or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively, following a proton-coupled electron transfer (pcet) mechanism. The associated rate constants depend on sulfenic acid derivative when the oxidizing species is HO<sub>2</sub>, but all processes are diffusion controlled in the case of reaction with OH. From structurally simple systems to a cysteine-derived model peptide, this work provides a systematic study that contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the reactivity of sulfenic acids with radicals.
40202384	Pilomatrix-like High-grade Endometrial Carcinoma: An Underdiagnosed Entity With Aggressive Clinicopathologic Features.	Pilomatrix-like high-grade endometrial carcinoma (PiMHEC) is a rare and aggressive variant of endometrial carcinoma often misdiagnosed due to overlapping features with other high-grade malignancies. This study characterizes its clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular features to establish key diagnostic criteria and propose a standardized terminology. Ten tumors were analyzed using histopathologic examination, immunohistochemistry, and next-generation sequencing. All but 1 tumor exhibited both low-grade endometrioid and high-grade basaloid components, the latter characterized by either geographic or comedo-type necrosis and shadow cells. Although shadow cells are a hallmark feature, they may be focal or absent, necessitating careful evaluation. High-grade areas consistently showed ER and PR negativity with diffuse nuclear β-catenin staining, correlating with CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations in all tumors. Identical CTNNB1 mutations in spatially distinct tumor components suggest a clonal progression from a low-grade precursor. Additional mutations in ARID1A, PTEN, and PIK3CA were identified. Clinically, PiMHEC exhibited aggressive behavior, with 7 patients experiencing recurrence and 1 succumbing to the disease within 9 months. Metastatic sites included the lungs, liver, lymph nodes, and abdominal wall. PD-L1 expression in 4 tumors suggests potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors, whereas low-level HER2 expression (1+ to 2+) in 5 tumors raises the possibility of HER2-targeted therapies. Folate receptor alpha was not expressed in any tumor. In conclusion, PiMHEC is a distinct and highly aggressive endometrial carcinoma with unique histopathologic and molecular features that differentiate it from high-grade endometrioid and other high-grade endometrial cancers including squamous cell carcinoma in rare situations. Its key diagnostic features include high-grade basaloid tumor cells associated with shadow cells, tumor necrosis, and diffuse nuclear β-catenin staining. To improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce ambiguity, we propose adopting "pilomatrix-like high-grade endometrial carcinoma" as a standardized term.
40202383	A Bench-stable Fluorophosphine Nickel(0) Complex and Its Catalytic Application.	We herein present a fluorophosphine-based nickel(0) complex [Ni(PFPh2)4] (1), which is highly stable in air and water. [Ni(PFPh2)4] can be obtained from a one-pot reaction of [Ni(MeCN)4](BF4)2 with Ph2P(=O)-PPh2, involving a unique in-situ reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0) and a simultaneous fluorination by the BF4- anion. This complex does not only incorporate a nickel centre in the zero-oxidation state, resulting from a Ni(II) precursor, but also includes fluorophosphine ligands, which typically disproportionate immediately in solution. The application of [Ni(PFPh2)4] as highly stable Ni(0) pre-catalyst in combination with additional phosphine ligands, such as dppf (1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene), in various coupling reactions uncovers its high catalytic activity and versatility, which is superior to [Ni(COD)2] (COD = cycloocta-1,5-diene) as conventional Ni(0) source.

40202379	Enhanced Luminance of Pentaazaphenalene-Based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters by Breaking Forbidden Transition.	1,3,4,6,9b-pentaazaphenalene (5AP) derivatives are of growing interest because of their potential for exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence and inverted singlet-triplet excited state properties. However, a major challenge has been the non-emissive nature of 5AP. This study reports a donor-5AP-acceptor-type molecular design for converting non-emissive 5AP into highly emissive molecules. The newly designed molecules, 2,5-di(1-pyrrolidino)-7,9-bis(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1,3,4,6,9b-pantaazaphenalene (Pyr-5AP-CF3) and 2,5-di(1-pyrrolidino)-7,9-bis(4-benzonitrile)-1,3,4,6,9b-pantaazaphenalene (Pyr-5AP-CN), exhibited delayed fluorescence and achieved high photoluminescence quantum yields of 83.5% and 90.6%, respectively, in solid films. These values dramatically exceed those of previously reported 5AP derivatives with only 8% or less. Furthermore, Pyr-5AP-CF3 and Pyr-5AP-CN exhibited the fastest radiative decays and the narrowest emission spectra among all the 5AP based materials reported to date. This study provides a promising solution to the non-emissive nature of 5AP, leading to the development of a class of highly luminescent materials for future organic light-emitting diodes.
40202378	Consensus in Oral Epithelial Dysplasia Classification: A Comparative Analysis of H&E-stained Sections With and Without p53/p16 Immunohistochemistry.	Diagnosis and classification of oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is critical to identifying and prognosticating patients at risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, conventional 3-tiered and 2-tiered grading systems suffer from poor inter-pathologist agreement, and SCC may arise from all grades of OED. This study evaluated pathologist agreement in OED classification as p53 wildtype, p53 abnormal, and HPV-associated based on recent evidence demonstrating the utility of p53/p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in this setting and increased risk of p53 abnormal OED progression to SCC, regardless of histologic grade. Fifty digital biopsy specimens were evaluated for diagnosis by 18 subspecialty-trained pathologists, with OED graded utilizing 3-tiered, 2-tiered, and p53 wildtype/p53 abnormal/HPV-associated schemata. Cases were reviewed first without and subsequently with p53/p16 IHC. The cohort consisted of 8 cases of p53 wildtype, 24 cases of p53 abnormal, and 18 cases of HPV-associated OED. Inter-pathologist agreement in OED grading according to 3-tiered (κ=0.32) and 2-tiered (κ=0.39) systems by H&E was poor, but fair-to-good (κ=0.59) in classification as p53 wildtype/p53 abnormal/HPV-associated by H&E and IHC. Classification of OED as p53 wildtype, p53 abnormal, or HPV-associated using p53/p16 IHC outperformed conventional grading in this cohort enriched for p53 abnormal OED, which required correct interpretation of p53 IHC, historically deemed challenging. Routine use of IHC also identifies a wider histologic spectrum of HPV-associated OED than is currently appreciated. More work is needed to determine the efficacy of this classification system in predicting patient outcomes and in guiding management decisions in real-world cohorts.
40202377	Self-Propelled MnO<sub>2</sub>-Based Colloidal Motors for Active Treatment of Periodontal Inflammation.	Chemically powered colloidal motors exhibit significant potential for applications in oral cleaning and antimicrobial treatment. The integration of MnO<sub>2</sub>-based colloidal motors with common mouth-rinsing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solutions for sterilization and disinfection via reactive oxygen species (ROS) represents an ideal approach. In this study, we fabricate uniform dumbbell-shaped (DS-MnO<sub>2</sub>-motor), spherical (S-MnO<sub>2</sub>-motor), and silver half-coated spherical Janus Ag-MnO<sub>2</sub> colloidal motors (JS-MnO<sub>2</sub>-motor) using hydrothermal, co-precipitation, and sputtering methods, respectively. These motors are propelled by O<sub>2</sub> bubble ejection generated from the catalytic decomposition of low-concentration H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by peroxidase-like MnO<sub>2</sub> components. Notably, the JS-MnO<sub>2</sub>-motors achieve a maximum speed of 146.4 µm s<sup>-1</sup> in gargle containing 1.5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial trials demonstrated that the JS-MnO<sub>2</sub>-motor gargle exhibits superior sterilization rates of 98.1% and 97.4% against both planktonic and biofilm-forming P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum. Consequently, it significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy in treating periodontitis in Wistar rats, as evidenced by a marked reduction in inflammatory cells. The mechanical force exerted by these colloidal motors, along with cation adhesion to bacterial membranes and the antimicrobial effects of ROS, collectively contribute to this enhanced performance. Our findings introduce a novel strategy for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.

40202372	Death, love, and evolution: Conceptions of death beyond terror.	Recent years have seen an influx in interest on the role of death anxiety in human behavior. Terror Management Theory prevails as the leading theoretical and empirical paradigm utilized in the literature; however emerging research has revealed serious shortcomings with the paradigm. In this paper we examine the concept of death anxiety from a socio-evolutionary perspective. We outline how the attachment system evolved to prevent death during an extended period of juvenile vulnerability and is further co-opted into adulthood to maintain survival. Through a broader understanding of contemporary evolutionary thinking, including attachment theory, we propose that the hitherto inconsistent and amorphous definition of death anxiety be more usefully re-conceptualized as a fear of premature death. We explore how this re-conceptualization can be used to help explicate phenomena that existing paradigms have until now struggled to explain.
40202371	Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Improve Rice Production in Zinc-Amended Soils by Altering Zinc Transport and Translocation Routes.	Human activities including industry and overcultivation resulted in marginal soils, unbalanced in nutrients or polluted with heavy metals. Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient and its nonoptimal soil bio-availability, negatively affects plant growth and production. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could improve Zn acquisition in limited conditions and prevent accumulation in plant tissue in contaminated soils. However, it is not clear how AMF impact host plant Zn uptake and transport routes. In this study we assessed the potential of commercial AMF inoculum to support rice growth and production in non-Zn-fertilised, Zn-fertilised and Zn-polluted soils alongside their impact on host plant nutrient balances and Zn uptake and translocation routes. The results demonstrated that AMF inoculation restores rice growth and grain production in Zn-amended soils and that Zn amendment improves root colonisation. Shoot ionomes were particularly sensitive to differences in Zn supply and differentially affected in AMF and mock-inoculated plants. When present in excess, AMF inoculation decreased accumulation of Zn in shoots and disturbed Zn-P (phosphorus) relationship. We could not detect a mycorrhiza-specific Zn transporter in rice but rather a modification of expression for Zn transporters in the direct uptake routes. AMF inoculation interacts with the Zn-dependent response of heavy metal ATPase (OsHMA) transporters involved in root-to-shoot translocation. All together, these data indicate a change in relative importance of different direct Zn transport routes upon AMF colonisation. These findings provide valuable insights into how AMF symbiosis influences Zn uptake and distribution in rice under varying Zn conditions, allowing for the development of plant-fungus bioremediation and biofortification technologies.

40202364	Planar, Twisted, or Curved Extended Tetrathiafulvalenes with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Cores Featuring Five-Membered Rings.	Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent two distinct classes of redox-active chromophores. By merging these two classes in so-called extended tetrathiafulvalenes, new physico-chemical characteristics emerge. Here in this study, we summarize the properties of such PAH-extended TTFs for which the PAH core incorporates five-membered carbo-cyclic rings together with six-, seven-, and/or eight-membered rings. A key structural motif of these molecules is the planar 2-(1H-inden-1-ylidene)-1,3-dithiole unit. Fusing two such units directly together or via various one- or two-dimensional PAH scaffolds has during the past decade provided a large selection of planar, twisted, or curved extended TTFs. Strong associations of radical cations are in some cases obtained, corresponding to redox-controlled self-assembly in solution, and these associations have allowed for the ready generation of semi-conducting salts by electrocrystallization. Some molecules exhibit remarkable multiredox behavior and can reversibly reach high cationic states, and, in some cases, also anionic states. Several structural examples also reveal how closed-shell versus open-shell characters of the dication states can be controlled by the nature of the PAH core, particularly by the number of Clar sextets within the core.
40202360	Efficient Semitransparent Organic Solar Modules with Exceptional Diurnal Stability through Asymmetric Interaction Induced by Symmetric Molecular Structure.	The symmetry-breaking design strategy of nonfullerene acceptor can improve the performance of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs). However, no report exists on the 'asymmetric molecular interaction' induced by symmetric molecular structure in nonfullerene acceptors. Herein, we showcase that 2D fluorophenyl outer groups in symmetric 4FY promote dipole-driven self-assembly through asymmetric molecular interactions, resulting in a tighter packed structure than Y6 with the same symmetric geometry. Such unique properties lead to high-performance layer-by-layer OSCs, accompanied by simultaneously reduced energy and recombination losses and improved charge-related characteristics. ST-OSCs based on PCE10-2F/4FY achieve notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.81%, average visible transmittance of 45.43%, and light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 4.91%. Moreover, exceptional diurnal cycling stability is observed in the ST-OSCs based on PCE10-2F/4FY with much prolonged T80 up to 134 h, which is about 17 times greater than the reference PCE10-2F/Y6. Lastly, we fabricate highly efficient semitransparent organic solar modules based on PCE10-2F/4FY (active area of 18 cm2), which shows PCE of 6.78% and the highest LUE of 3.10% to date for all-narrow bandgap semitransparent organic solar modules. This work demonstrates that asymmetry-driven molecular interactions can be leveraged to fabricate large-area ST-OSCs that are efficient and stable under realistic operating conditions.
40202359	Modeling the Superlattice Phase Diagram of Transition Metal Intercalation in Bilayer <i>2H</i>-TaS<sub>2</sub>.	Van-der-Waals hosts intercalated with transition-metal (TM) ions exhibit a range of magnetic properties strongly influenced by the structural order of the intercalants. However, predictive computational models for the intercalant ordering phase diagram are lacking, complicating experimental pursuits to target key structural phases. Here we use density functional theory (DFT) to construct a pairwise lattice model and Monte Carlo to determine its associated thermodynamic phase diagram. To circumvent the complexities of modeling magnetic effects, we use the diamagnetic ions Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Sc<sup>3+</sup> as computationally accessible proxies for divalent and trivalent species of interest (Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, V<sup>3+</sup> and Cr<sup>3+</sup>), which provide insights into the thermodynamic phase diagram well above the paramagnetic transition temperature. We find that electrostatic coupling between intercalants is almost entirely screened, so the pairwise lattice model represents a coarse-grained charge density reorganization. The resulting phase diagram reveals that entropically favored √3 × √3 ordering and coexisting locally ordered √3 × √3 and 2 × 2 domains persist across a range of temperatures and stoichiometries. This occurs even at quarter-filling of interstitial sites (corresponding to bulk stoichiometries of <i>M</i><sub>0.25</sub>TaS<sub>2</sub>; M = intercalant) where there are experimental reports of 2 × 2 and √3 × √3 coexistence but a thermodynamic preference for long-range 2 × 2 order is often assumed. Accompanying Raman spectra revealing quenching-induced √3 × √3 order in <i>2H</i>-V<sub>0.25</sub>NbS<sub>2</sub> supports that deficient √3 × √3 domains may dominate 2 × 2 at high temperatures in a range of TM-intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides.

Random-effect models were used to calculate pooled kappa coefficients for Lung-RADS categorization and pooled intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for nodule size measurements. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored using metaregression analyses. <b>Evidence Synthesis:</b> The analysis included 11 studies (1470 patients) for Lung-RADS categorization and five studies (617 patients) for nodule size measurement. Interreader agreement for Lung-RADS categorization was substantial (κ=0.72 [95% CI, 0.57-0.82]), and for nodule size measurement was almost perfect (ICC=0.97 [95% CI, 0.90-0.99]). Interreader agreement for Lung-RADS categorization was significantly associated with the method of nodule measurement (p=.005), with pooled kappa coefficients for studies using computer-aided detection (CAD)-based semiautomated volume measurements, using CAD-based semiautomated diameter measurements, and using manual diameter measurements of 0.95, 0.91, and 0.66, respectively. Interreader agreement for Lung-RADS categorization was also significantly associated with studies' nodule type distribution (p<.001), with pooled kappa coefficients for studies evaluating 100% solid nodules, 30-99% solid nodules, and <30% solid nodules of 0.85, 0.76, and 0.55, respectively. Interreader agreement for nodule size measurement was significantly associated with radiation dose (p<.001), with pooled ICCs for studies that used standard-dose CT, used low-dose CT, and used ultralow-dose CT of 0.97, 0.96, and 0.59, respectively. Interreader agreement for nodule size measurement was also significantly associated with the Lung-RADS version used (p=.02), with pooled ICCs for studies using Lung-RADS 1.1 and using Lung-RADS 1.0 of 0.99 and 0.93, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> While supporting the overall reliability of Lung-RADS, the findings indicate roles for CAD assistance as well as training and standardized approaches for nodule type characterization to further promote reproducible application. <b>Clinical Impact:</b> Consistent nodule assessments will be critical for Lung-RADS to optimally impact patient management and outcomes.
40202355	Management of Ascites: <i>AJR</i> Expert Panel Narrative Review.	Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

40202353	Time to Enhancement of Foci Relative to Background Parenchymal Enhancement on Ultrafast Breast MRI: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.	<b>BACKGROUND</b> - Breast MRI is a sensitive tool for detecting small cancers. However, differentiating benign and malignant lesions remains challenging, particularly for foci. Studies evaluating other lesion types have identified ultrafast MRI (UFMRI) parameters associated with malignancy. <b>OBJECTIVE</b> - The purpose of this study was to determine if kinetic features of UFMRI can differentiate malignant and nonmalignant foci. <b>METHODS</b> - In this single-center retrospective study, consecutive UFMRI examinations performed from July 2019 to April 2023 with subsequent MRI-guided biopsy of a focus were selected. Patient characteristics and lesion features were collected from the EMR, imaging reports, and imaging review. Focus and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) time to enhancement (TTE), and the difference between them was calculated. Associations with malignancy were assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression. <b>RESULTS</b> - A total of 124 patients (mean age, 53 years old; range, 29-78 years old) underwent biopsy of 124 foci. Sixty-four (51.6%) were postmenopausal, 71 (57.3%) had a personal history of breast cancer, 81 (65.3%) had a family history of breast cancer, and 33/94 (35.3%) had genetic mutations. Most examinations were performed for extent of disease evaluation (47.6%; 59/124), followed by screening (41.9%; 52/124). Patients predominantly had heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue (58.1%; 72/124) and mild BPE (57.3%; 71/124). Of 124 lesions, 21 (16.9%) were malignant, 16 were invasive, and five were ductal carcinoma in situ. Odds of malignancy increased 5% with each 1-second increase in the difference of lesion TTE and BPE TTE (95% CI: 2-9%, p = .006). Older age and lower BPE were associated with increased likelihood of malignancy (p = .005 and p = .02, respectively). Odds of malignancy for patients with minimal or mild BPE were 11.69 times the odds of those with moderate or marked BPE (95% CI: 1.51-90.67). No other demographic or lesion characteristics were predictive of malignancy. <b>CONCLUSION</b> - Earlier visualization of a focus relative to BPE on UFMRI was associated with increased likelihood of malignancy; morphologic features showed no association with malignancy. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT</b> - The difference of TTE of a focus compared with that of BPE may be a useful parameter for assessing malignancy, which could help reduce unnecessary biopsies.

40202351	GCKR Polymorphisms Increase the Risks of Low Bone Mineral Density in Young and Non-Obese Patients With MASLD and Hyperuricemia.	Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) encompasses common comorbidities including low bone mineral density (BMD) and hyperuricemia (HU), yet relevant genetic analyses are limited. This study aimed to investigate the genetic effects of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the occurrence of low BMD in patients with MASLD and HU, particularly focusing on relatively young or non-obese populations. We conducted a cross-sectional study utilizing data from the Taiwan Biobank, screening a total of 150,709 participants who were prospectively enrolled over a period of 13 years. The risk SNPs for MASLD were identified. Genotype analyses of HU and its effects on the occurrence of low BMD in the general population were evaluated, with further analyses of common SNPs focusing on patients with MASLD, including subgroup analyses on relatively young and non-obese populations. A total of 20,496 participants were eligible for analysis, including 7526 patients with MASLD. Several risk SNPs for MASLD were identified. Furthermore, MASLD patients carrying the PNPLA3-rs738409 C_C, PNPLA3-rs2896019 T_T, GCKR-rs780094 T_T, and GCKR-rs1260326 T_T genotypes exhibited an increased risk of comorbidity with HU. Trend analysis revealed that the T alleles in GCKR-rs780094 and GCKR-rs1260326 were associated with the occurrence of low BMD in MASLD individuals comorbid with HU, particularly among relatively young or non-obese populations. In relatively young, non-obese patients with MASLD and HU, genetic effects significantly increase the risk of occurrence of low BMD. Given the presence of genetic effects in these ostensibly low-risk groups, heightened awareness and close follow-up are recommended.
40202350	The <i>E. coli</i> CRISPR-Cas conundrum: are they functional immune systems or genomic singularities?	The discovery and subsequent characterization and applications of CRISPR-Cas is one of the most fascinating scientific stories from the past two decades. While first identified in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, this microbial workhorse often took a back seat to other bacteria during the early race to detail CRISPR-Cas function as an adaptive immune system. This was not a deliberate slight, but the result of early observations that the CRISPR-Cas systems found in <i>E. coli</i> were not robust phage defense systems as first described in <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>. This apparent lack of activity was discovered to result from transcriptional repression by the nucleoid protein H-NS. Despite extensive evidence arguing against such roles, some studies still present <i>E. coli</i> CRISPR-Cas systems in the context of anti-phage and/or anti-plasmid activities. Here, the studies that led to our understanding of its cryptic nature are highlighted, along with ongoing research to uncover potential alternative functions in <i>E. coli</i>.
40202349	Does the impact of economic inequality on maternal and child health inequality exhibit a threshold effect? Evidence from China.	When the economy (economic inequality) develops to a certain level, does the impact of economic inequality on health inequality change? Through threshold regression, this study analyses the impact of city-level economic inequality on the absolute and economic-related inequality in under-5 child mortality rate (U5MR) (2001-2012) and maternal mortality rate (MMR) (2001-2015), along with the threshold values for economic development stages and economic inequality. Findings show: For the relationship between economic inequality and absolute inequality in U5MR, as well as economic-related inequality, there exists an economic development threshold effect. For the relationship between economic inequality and absolute inequality in MMR, an economic inequality threshold effect is illustrated. The improvement of economic conditions contributes to alleviating inequality in U5MR. Economic development inequality has a significant impact on the equality of maternal health development, but for enhancing the equality of women's health, health promotion policies may be more feasible.
40202348	Investigating the gut bacteria structure and function of hibernating bats through 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and culturomics.	The gut microbiota of bats is vital for their roles in health and the ecosystem, yet studies on hibernating bats in southwest China, particularly in the unique karst landscape of Guizhou, are limited. We captured three hibernating bat species-Pipistrellus (PB), Rhinolophus (RB), and Myotis (MB)-in Liping County, collecting rectal samples for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Data processing involved Trimmomatic, Flash, and Qiime2 for operational taxonomic unit (OTU) standardization and species annotation via the Greengenes database. Differential abundance was analyzed using LEfSe, and diversity metrics were assessed through alpha and beta diversity analyses. The RB group was predominantly composed of <i>Proteobacteria</i> (80.99%), while MB and PB exhibited diverse compositions with significant OTU richness (729 in MB). Notable genera included <i>Hafnia</i> and <i>Yersinia</i> in RB and <i>Cosenzaea myxofaciens</i> in MB. High proportions of unclassified taxa were observed, particularly in RB (83.81%). Functional predictions indicated metabolic pathways, with a significant representation of human diseases in PB. Culturomics revealed the successful cultivation of <i>Huaxiibacter chinensis</i> and <i>Enterobacter chengduensis</i> from bats for the first time and appears to have identified a new bacterium that is likely closely related to <i>Clostridium paraputrificum</i>.IMPORTANCEOur research reveals significant differences in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota among three bat groups (PB, MB, and RB) from Guizhou. While Proteobacteria predominates in all groups, its abundance varies. Notably, the high richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the MB group suggests a more diverse microbial ecosystem, underscoring the complex interactions between species diversity, diet, gut microbiota, and overall ecological dynamics in bats. Furthermore, the substantial presence of unknown bacterial species in their intestines highlights the critical importance of cultivation-based approaches. The presence of specific taxa may have potential health implications for both bats and humans. These findings emphasize the need for further investigations into the functional roles of these microbiota and their contributions to host health. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to elucidate these intricate interactions.
40202347	Advancing Mn-Based Li-Ion Battery Cathodes via a Partially Cation-Disordered Zigzag-Type Li-Nb-Mn-O Framework.	Mn-based Li-ion battery cathodes encompass a great variety of materials structures. Decades of research effort have proven that developing a Mn-based structure featuring a high redox activity, stable cycling, and cost-effectiveness is a longstanding challenge. Motivated by such a need and inspired by the structural diversity of Mn-based cathodes, we develop a partially cation-disordered lithium niobium manganese oxide with a zigzag structure, filling the knowledge gap between zigzag-ordered and fully disordered Li-Mn-based oxides. Electrochemically, the partially disordered cathode greatly unlocks the redox activity of the zigzag lattice and maintains the cycling stability. Mechanism-wise, the partial disordering suppresses the disproportionation reaction of Mn(III) and facilitates a disordered λ-MnO<sub>2</sub>-tetragonal cation-disordered rock salt structural transformation. The work suggests the substantial opportunity of using partial disordering as the key strategy to revive locked-up redox activities and realize new energy storage mechanisms, for the pursuit of high-performance cost-effective battery materials.

40202344	Harnessing the effect of iron deprivation to attenuate the growth of opportunistic pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an opportunistic pathogen having high infectivity among immunocompromised patients. The bacteria are resistant to major first-line antibiotics and have become a serious concern in the aspect of nosocomial and community-acquired infections. To overcome this dire situation, the necessity of introducing new approaches is undeniable, which can bypass the need for conventional antibiotic therapy. In this article, we have pinpointed the importance of iron in <i>A. baumannii.</i> Iron is an essential micronutrient in all bacteria. Loss of iron acquisition leads to membrane destabilization, and change in the expression of iron-transporting or -metabolizing genes causes death of the bacteria. Iron scavenging was primarily mediated by different chelators, and β-thujaplicin showed the best antibacterial efficacy with respect to time killing assay and CFU analysis. When iron (Fe<i><sup>2+</sup></i>) was supplemented after initial deficiency, the growth of the bacteria was seen to be restored. Iron deprivation also disintegrates the biofilm matrix, a major cause of bacterial resistance against different types of antibiotics. Moreover, iron scavenging promotes inhibition of biofilm sessile persister cells, the root cause of recalcitrant and chronic infection. As a part of antimicrobial therapy, β-thujaplicin was treated alongside colistin and chloramphenicol at an amount significantly lower than its MIC value. Our results indicated that β-thujaplicin nicely complemented those antibiotics to potentiate their antimicrobial action. In a nutshell, iron chelating agents are potential alternative therapeutics that can be used alongside different antibiotics to circumvent the resistance of different nosocomial pathogens.
40202342	Ring-Opening Polymerization Enables Access to High-Performance Aliphatic-Aromatic Polyamides with Chemical Recyclability.	Although polyamides (PAs) have served as one of the most important engineering thermoplastics, it remains a long-standing challenge for chemical recycling of PAs to monomers. Herein, we report a facile approach to construct a series of benzo-fused caprolactams with various functionalities (BLMR). These BLMR monomers underwent robust and well-controlled ring-opening polymerization to afford P(BLMR) products with high thermal stability, enhanced water resistance, and tunable mechanical properties. Impressively, chemical recycling of P(BLMR) to monomer could be accomplished with excellent efficiency in dilute solution at 100-150 °C with a mixed catalyst of t-BuOK and La[N(SiMe3)2]3, thus establishing a closed-loop circularity. The precise control of the polymerization and the recyclability of these semi-aromatic polyamides promote a sustainable circular economy while offering the potential to access high-performance materials with tunable thermal and mechanical properties and enhanced water resistance.
40202341	Inhibitory effect of copper chelators on the budding in <i>Candida albicans</i>.	<i>Candida albicans</i> exhibits a unique dimorphic behavior, allowing it to switch between unicellular budding yeast and filamentous hyphal growth. This dimorphism is crucial for its pathogenicity, influencing processes such as adhesion, invasion, immune evasion, and host response. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing yeast and hyphal growth, as well as the switch between these forms, is crucial for the development of effective anticandidal therapies. In this study, we screened for small molecules that interfere with the dimorphism of <i>C. albicans</i> and identified the actinomycete metabolite RK-276A/SF2768 as a potent inhibitor of this process. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that SF2768 inhibited hyphal branching and lateral yeast budding during the hyphal-to-yeast transition. Interestingly, SF2768 also suppressed farnesol-induced yeast growth by inhibiting yeast bud formation. The effects of SF2768 were canceled with copper addition, and other copper chelators, such as trientine and d-penicillamine, induced similar phenotypes, indicating that the copper-chelating activity of SF2768 is crucial for its antifungal properties. Furthermore, copper ions induced both hyphal and yeast bud formation. These findings strongly suggest that copper ions play a role in <i>Candida</i> budding, and the copper chelators could be developed as novel antifungal agents against not only dimorphic <i>Candida</i> spp. but also non-dimorphic <i>Candida</i> spp.
40202340	Association of Upper Lip Length With Craniofacial Structures in Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Although studies have investigated the aesthetic standard of the lower third of the face and lips, few have examined the association between the upper lip and craniofacial structures. This study aims to evaluate the association between upper lip length (defined as the distance between the base of the nose and the upper lip) and craniofacial structures in adults.
40202339	Advances in Isotope Labeling for Solution Nucleic Acid NMR Spectroscopy.	The availability of nucleic acid structural biology methods still lags behind that of proteins, as evidenced by the significantly smaller number of structures deposited in the PDB. The highly skewed ratio of nucleic acid structures, relative to their protein counterparts (~1:50), is inverted with respect to the cellular output of RNA and proteins in higher organisms (~50:1). While nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an attractive biophysical tool to bridge this gap, the  conformational flexibility, line-broadening, and low chemical shift dispersion of nucleic acids have made the NMR method challenging, especially for nucleic acids larger than 35 nucleotides. The incorporation of NMR-active isotope labels is an effective strategy to combat these problems. Here, we review strides made to push the limits of nucleic acid structures solved by NMR using chemo-enzymatic DNA 13C-methyl and RNA aromatic 15N- and 19F-13C-labeling and evaluate some of the challenges and opportunities they present. We anticipate that the combination of these novel isotopic labeling patterns with superior NMR spectroscopic properties, with new emerging DNA/RNA synthesis methods (palindrome-nicking-dependent amplification and Segmental labeling and site-specific Modifications by Template-directed eXtension, may well stimulate advances in NMR studies of high-molecular-weight DNA/RNA and their complexes with important biological functions.
40202338	The <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> tellurium resistance gene <i>terC</i> contributes to both tellurite and zinc resistance.	<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> is widely recognized as a pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired infections and community-acquired invasive infections. It has rapidly become a significant global public health threat due to the emergence of hypervirulent and multidrug-resistant strains, which have increased the challenges associated with treating life-threatening infections. Tellurium resistance genes are widespread on virulence plasmids in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> isolates. However, the core function of the <i>ter</i> operon (<i>terZABCDEF</i>) in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> remains unclear. In this study, the multidrug-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> P1927 strain was isolated from the sputum of a hospitalized pneumonia patient. The <i>ter</i> operon, along with antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, was identified on a large hybrid plasmid in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> P1927. We generated a <i>terC</i> deletion mutant and demonstrated that this mutant exhibited reduced virulence in a <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larva infection model. Further physiological functional analysis revealed that <i>terC</i> is not only important for Te(IV) resistance but also for resistance to Zn(II), Mn(II), and phage infection. All genes of the <i>ter</i> operon were highly inducible by Zn(II), which is a stronger inducer than Te(IV), and the <i>terBCDE</i> genes were also induced by Mn(II). Collectively, our study demonstrates novel physiological functions of TerC in Zn(II) resistance and virulence in <i>K. pneumoniae</i>.IMPORTANCE<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> has rapidly become a global threat to public health. Although the <i>ter</i> operon is widely identified in clinical isolates, its physiological function remains unclear. It has been proposed that proteins encoded by the <i>ter</i> operon form a multi-site metal-binding complex, but its exact function is still unknown. TerC, a central component of the tellurium resistance determinant, was previously shown to interact with outer membrane proteins OmpA and KpsD in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, suggesting potential changes in outer membrane structure and properties. Here, we report that TerC confers resistance to Zn(II), Mn(II), and phage infection, and Zn(II) was shown to be a strong inducer of the <i>ter</i> operon. Furthermore, TerC was identified as a novel virulence factor. Taken together, our results expand our understanding of the physiological functions encoded by the <i>ter</i> operon and its role in the virulence of <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, providing deeper insights into the link between heavy metal(loid) resistance determinants and virulence in pathogenic bacteria.
40202337	<i>In vivo</i> evaluation of phage therapy against <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> using the <i>Galleria mellonella</i> model and molecular characterization of a novel <i>Drulisvirus</i> phage species.	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> is challenging to treat with conventional antibiotic regimens, posing a threat to healthcare systems. Phage therapy presents a promising alternative treatment strategy; however, characterization of its efficacy and safety is required. Here, we describe the microbiological and molecular characterization of a novel bacteriophage with activity against MDR <i>K. pneumoniae</i> using a greater wax moth (<i>Galleria mellonella</i>) model system. A bacteriophage was isolated from hospital wastewater. Viral kinetics and phage stability were evaluated under varied pH and temperature conditions. The therapeutic efficacy of the phage was evaluated using MDR <i>Klebsiella</i>-infected <i>G. mellonella</i> larvae as an <i>in vivo</i> model. Phage titers and larva survival were compared in phage-treated and control groups. Genomic sequencing (Nanopore and Illumina) was used to classify the bacteriophage and identify any resistance genes or virulence factors present in its genome. Functional characterization demonstrated effective lytic activity, favorable burst size (161 PFU/cell), and an optimal MOI of 0.1. The phage demonstrated stability across a wide range of temperatures (8°C-40°C) and pH levels (4-8). Experiments using the <i>G. mellonella</i> model showed improved larval survival with phage treatment. The novel bacteriophage was identified as a new species within the genus <i>Drulisvirus</i> with no lysogeny-associated, antimicrobial resistance, or virulence genes detected. The new <i>Drulisvirus</i> phage identified is a promising candidate for treatment of infections caused by MDR <i>K. pneumoniae</i>.IMPORTANCEThe study describes a bacteriophage with potential for use in phage therapy against <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, one of the most clinically significant bacterial pathogens today. Microbiological and genomic characterization of the phage revealed advantageous properties for therapeutic applications, while also identifying a novel species within the <i>Drulisvirus</i> genus. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of bacteriophage diversity and their utility in combating antibiotic-resistant infections. Moreover, the authors developed an <i>in vivo</i> preclinical model of MDR infection using <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae and successfully applied it to study the bacteriophage's therapeutic efficacy. This model offers a robust and efficient platform for preclinical testing.
40202336	Usnic acid impacts energy production and iron metabolism in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> H37Rv.	<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> has developed a wide array of response mechanisms to various stress factors. Usnic acid has been demonstrated to be a potent antimycobacterial agent that induces stress responses and growth inhibition in many mycobacterial species. Previous studies have shown that it alters the expression of stress-responsive sigma factors, as well as the metabolites and lipid profile in <i>M. tuberculosis</i> H37Ra. This study was designed to examine potential differences in the strain-specific susceptibility of the virulent H37Rv strain to usnic acid. By combining lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses, we uncovered the impact of usnic acid on bacterial metabolism. The observed downregulation of key lipid classes suggested reduced metabolic activity. The simultaneous elevation of mycobactins-siderophores used by members of the genus <i>Mycobacterium</i> to transport free extracellular iron ions into the cytoplasm-indicated the involvement of iron in the stress response generated by usnic acid. The repressed tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation were compensated by the upregulation of alternative energy production pathways, such as cytochrome P450 and the ferredoxin reductase system. This indicates that mycobacteria may switch to alternative electron transport mechanisms under usnic acid stress using iron-sulfur clusters to generate energy. From a therapeutic perspective, the study highlights iron metabolism as an essential drug target in mycobacteria. Simultaneously, the results confirm the strain-specific metabolic response of sister strains against the same stressing agent.
40202335	Phenotypic and genotypic resistance to bedaquiline in patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis-experiences from Armenia.	Risk factors for baseline bedaquiline (BDQ) resistance, amplification during treatment, and correlations with treatment outcomes are not fully understood. This cohort included Armenian patients with multidrug-resistant TB predominantly fluoroquinolone-resistant enrolled between 2013 and 2015 in a BDQ compassionate use program. BDQ resistance at baseline and during treatment was assessed using MGIT (pDST<sub>MGIT</sub>), minimal inhibitory concentration in 7H11 (MIC<sub>7H11</sub>), and whole-genome sequencing. Risk factors, such as treatment effectiveness or stage of the disease, were analyzed for association with baseline BDQ resistance, acquired BDQ resistance, and treatment outcome. Among 39 patients, baseline BDQ resistance was 6% (2/33) by pDST<sub>MGIT</sub> and 7% (2/29) by MIC<sub>7H11</sub>. All four baseline isolates with an <i>Rv0678</i> mutation were phenotypically resistant. During treatment, 48% of the patients acquired BDQ resistance by pDST<sub>MGIT</sub>, and 52% acquired mutations at various frequencies (97% in <i>Rv0678</i>). None of the factors significantly contributed to baseline or acquired BDQ resistance. Unfavorable treatment outcome (41%) was more frequent in the presence of acquired <i>Rv0678</i> mutations [odds ratio (OR) 132, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.43, 2375], phenotypic BDQ resistance (OR 176, 95% CI 6.48, 2423), or MIC increase above or below the critical concentration (both OR 84.3, 95% CI 2.93, 2423) during treatment. For these highly treatment-experienced patients, low baseline prevalence but high incidence of acquired BDQ resistance was observed. Acquisition of mutations in BDQ candidate resistance genes, regardless of their frequency, or increased MICs during treatment, even below the critical concentration, should be seen as a warning sign of resistance amplification and increased risk of unfavorable treatment outcome.
40202334	Transcriptional control of <i>C. albicans</i> white-opaque switching and modulation by environmental cues and strain background.	The opportunistic fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> can undergo cellular transitions in response to environmental cues that impact its lifestyle and its interactions with the human host. This is exemplified by the white-opaque switch, which is a heritable transition between two phenotypic states that is regulated by a highly interconnected network of transcription factors (TFs). To obtain greater understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the switch, we generated a genome-wide, tetracycline-inducible TF library in the WO-1 strain background and identified those TFs whose forced expression induces white cells to switch to the opaque state. This set of opaque-inducing TFs was also evaluated for their ability to induce switching in a second strain background, that of the standard reference strain SC5314, as well as during growth on different laboratory media. These experiments identify 14 TFs that can drive white-to-opaque switching when overexpressed but that do so in a highly strain- and media-specific manner. In particular, changes in pH, amino acids, and zinc concentrations had marked effects on the ability of TFs to drive phenotypic switching. These results provide insights into the complex transcriptional regulation of switching in <i>C. albicans</i> and reveal that an interplay between genetic and environmental factors determines TF function and cell fate.IMPORTANCEThe white-opaque switch in <i>Candida albicans</i> represents a model system for understanding an epigenetic switch in a eukaryotic pathogen. Here, we generated an inducible library of the set of transcription factors (TFs) present in <i>C. albicans</i> and identify 14 TFs that can drive the white-to-opaque transition when ectopically expressed. We demonstrate that several of these TFs induce the switch in a highly strain- and media-specific manner. This highlights that both strain background and changes in experimental conditions (including different water sources) can profoundly impact the phenotypic consequences of TF overexpression. Moreover, the inducible TF library provides an invaluable tool for the further analysis of TF function in this important human pathogen.
40202333	Clinicopathologic and Molecular Analysis of Malignant Neoplasms With Yolk Sac Tumor Differentiation in Women 40 Years of Age and Older.	Gynecologic yolk sac tumors (YSTs) are more commonly encountered in children and young women as pure or mixed germ cell tumors and are rarely observed in older women. YSTs in older women are sometimes accompanied by a Müllerian-type carcinoma component, indicating a likely somatic rather than germ-cell origin. Studies of YSTs of germ cell and somatic types in this age group are limited. Analysis of additional pure and mixed tumors with YST differentiation could elucidate differences between these tumor subtypes and the relationship between components in mixed tumors. Clinicopathologic features of 32 malignant neoplasms with YST differentiation in women aged 40+ were analyzed. There were 11 pure YSTs, 7 mixed germ cell tumors, and 14 YSTs with a malignant non-germ cell tumor component (somatically derived yolk sac tumor [SDYST]). Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed in 4/11 pure YSTs, 0/7 mixed germ cell tumors, and 4/14 SDYSTs. For the pure YSTs, alterations in DICER1 (1/4), PIK3R1 and PTPRT (1/4), PMS1 (1/4), and TP53 (2/4) were identified. One other pure YST had alterations in PTEN, ARID1A, ARID1B, FGFR2, and CTNNB1 (alterations common in endometrioid carcinoma). SDYSTs demonstrated shared alterations between both components including TP53, KRAS, FBXW7, and KMT2C, suggesting a common origin. The findings in the pure YSTs in older women suggest that for some, the origin could be germ cell as they harbor similar alterations as those described in pure YSTs in young women, whereas in other "pure" YSTs, the molecular profile aligns with previously described SDYSTs, which suggests a SDYST with an unsampled Müllerian carcinoma component rather than a germ cell origin. In SDYSTs, shared alterations are consistent with prior studies and suggest a somatic rather than germ-cell origin.
40202331	Clin-STAR Corner: Practice-Changing Advances at the Interface of Gastroenterology & Geriatrics.	With nearly 60 million Americans aged 65 and older, gastrointestinal (GI) conditions are a leading cause of healthcare utilization in this population. Despite this, older adults remain underrepresented in GI clinical trials and research, limiting evidence-based care. This review highlights three pivotal studies addressing this gap: (1) proton pump inhibitors, which are commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, are not associated with the later development of dementia; (2) undertreatment of chronic inflammation among older adults with inflammatory bowel disease is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared to treatment with anti-TNF therapy, a biologic agent; (3) the majority (85%) of surveillance colonoscopies among older adults with a life expectancy of ≥ 10 years did not yield colorectal cancer, advanced dysplasia, or ≥ 3 polyps.
40202329	A novel micronemal protein MP38 is involved in the invasion of merozoites into erythrocytes.	The absence of an <i>in vitro</i> cultivation system for <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> hinders the exploration of molecular targets for vaccine development. To address this, functional studies often rely on alternative models, such as <i>P. knowlesi</i>, due to its genetic similarity to <i>P. vivax</i>. This study investigated the role of a novel micronemal protein, PvMP38 (PVX_110945), in both <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. knowlesi</i> merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. The full-length ectodomain of PvMP38 was expressed, and polyclonal antibodies were generated to assess its function. PvMP38 was confirmed to localize on micronemal organelle in both <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. knowlesi</i> merozoites. <i>In vitro</i> protein-protein interaction assays revealed that PvMP38 binds to Pv12 with high-affinity interaction. A conserved novel complex of Pv12-Pv41-PvMP38 was identified by immunoprecipitation of <i>P. vivax</i> antibodies on <i>P. knowlesi</i> schizont lysates. Linear epitopes of PvMP38 with high and moderate antigenicity were identified in clinical isolates of both species. Invasion inhibition assays demonstrated that a triple antibody combination targeting the PvMP38, Pv12, and Pv41 significantly reduced <i>P. knowlesi</i> merozoite invasion of erythrocytes compared to a single antibody. In addition, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of <i>P. knowlesi mp38</i> markedly impaired parasite growth, underscoring its essential role during the asexual stage. These findings identify PvMP38 and its associated complex as promising targets for malaria interventions and highlight the utility of <i>P. knowlesi</i> as a model for investigating <i>P. vivax</i> erythrocyte invasion mechanisms.IMPORTANCEThis manuscript reported an effort in malaria eradication by identifying and functionally characterizing a novel <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> micronemal protein, PvMP38, involved in erythrocyte invasion. A narrow repertoire of an efficacious vaccine targeting <i>P. vivax</i> candidates is being developed due to the lack of continuous <i>in vitro</i> culture. This study addresses a gap in <i>P. vivax</i> research using <i>P. knowlesi</i> as a model for both genome editing and antibody functionality validation. By enhancing the protein-protein interaction screening framework, this study demonstrated that PvMP38 forms a complex with Pv12 and Pv41, opening the approaches to multi-antigen vaccines. The successful application of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques to disrupt its homolog, the <i>pkmp38</i> gene, further assesses the protein's significance in the growth and invasion of the parasite. These findings provided valuable insights into the biology of <i>P. vivax</i> and proposed PvMP38 as a promising candidate for malaria intervention strategies.
40202328	Potential Therapeutic Effects of Terahertz Radiation on Alzheimer's Disease-like Pathology in the Tau Transgenic <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Model.	The application of terahertz waves in the field of neurological disease research has gradually attracted attention in recent years. Prior studies have indicated that terahertz waves are capable of alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in mice, yet the underlying relevant mechanisms remain unclear. This study explores the therapeutic potential of terahertz (THz) radiation on AD using a transgenic <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model expressing human tau protein. The nematodes were subjected to 0.1 THz radiation at varying power levels, and its impact on locomotion, tau protein aggregation, and associative learning was evaluated. Results indicate that 0.1 THz irradiation significantly improved the locomotor performance and associative learning of the tau transgenic nematodes, reduced tau aggregation, and increased the expression of SKN-1 and DAF-16. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that THz waves inhibited the structural stability of tau protofibrils by reducing the protein compactness, altering the secondary structure, reducing hydrogen bond formation, and changing the hydrophobic interaction. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of low-frequency THz radiation as a nonpharmacological therapy for AD, highlighting its ability to modulate neuronal function and alleviate disease symptoms.

40202325	Attentional control dampens the effects of intolerance of uncertainty and uncertainty-related attentional bias on posttraumatic stress symptoms.	Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following trauma, and attentional biases for uncertainty stimuli (ABU) may be as well. Evidence suggests that better attentional control protects individuals who are vulnerable to several forms of psychopathology from developing such pathology. However, to our knowledge, the potential buffering effect of attentional control in relations between IU, ABU, and PTSS has yet to be examined. In the present study, 125 trauma-exposed undergraduate participants completed a battery of self-report measures and an eye-tracking visual-search task to assess ABU. The sample was primarily White (88.80%) and female (83.2%) with an average age of 19.70 years (<i>SD</i> = 2.60). A series of hierarchical regressions demonstrated that elevated IU and difficulties disengaging from uncertainty stimuli were associated with higher PTSS, but only among participants with lower scores on a measure of attentional control. For participants with relatively better attentional control, the associations between IU, ABU, and PTSS were non-significant. The non-clinical nature and relative homogeny of the current sample may limit generalizability of results, which warrant replication. Attentional control may protect trauma-exposed individuals from the negative effects of IU and ABU on PTSS.

Health care disparities are introduced at various points along the patient care continuum. This study explores disparities in initial health care access for patients with brain tumor (BT) in New York City (NYC) and New York State (NYS), comparing emergency department (ED) and elective admissions (EA).
40202323	The Effect of Immunocorrection on Reparative Osteogenesis in Mandibular Fracture: A Histomorphometric Study.	Fracture consolidation is a fundamental factor in understanding the biological process of bone healing in human. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of immunocorrection after trauma surgery on bone healing process in mandibular fracture in rabbits.
40202322	Polymer biodegradation by <i>Halanaerobium</i> promotes reservoir souring during hydraulic fracturing.	Hydraulically fractured shale reservoirs have facilitated studies of unexplored niches in the continental deep biosphere. In high-salinity North American shale systems, members of the genus <i>Halanaerobium</i> seem to be ubiquitous. Polymers like guar gum used as gelling agents in hydraulic fracturing fluids are known to be fermentable substrates, but metabolic pathways encoding these processes have not been characterized. To explore this, produced water samples from the Permian Basin were incubated both at 30°C to simulate above-ground storage conditions and at 60°C to simulate subsurface reservoir conditions. Guar metabolism coincided with <i>Halanaerobium</i> growing only at 30°C, revealing genes for polymer biodegradation through the mixed-acid fermentation pathway in different metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Whereas thiosulfate reduction to sulfide is often invoked to explain the dominance of <i>Halanaerobium</i> in these settings, genes for thiosulfate metabolism were lacking in <i>Halanaerobium</i> genomes with high estimated completeness. Sulfide production was observed in 60°C incubations, with corresponding enrichment of <i>Desulfohalobium</i> and <i>Desulfovibrionaceae</i> that possess complete pathways for coupling mannose and acetate oxidation to sulfate reduction. These findings outline how production of fermentation intermediates (mannose and acetate) by <i>Halanaerobium</i> in topside settings can result in reservoir souring when these metabolites are introduced into the subsurface through produced water reuse.
40202321	Cobalt modulates methanol turnover of the alcohol dehydrogenase in <i>Desulfofundulus kuznetsovii</i> strain TPOSR.	<i>Desulfofundulus kuznetsovii</i> strain 17<sup>T</sup> oxidizes methanol via a two-pathway system involving both alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) and a cobalt-dependent methanol methyltransferase (MT). In contrast, <i>D. kuznetsovii</i> strain TPOSR lacks the MT pathway, relying solely on ADH for growth on methanol. Despite the absence of the MT pathway, cobalt starvation resulted in lower methanol uptake rates and reduced growth rates in strain TPOSR, suggesting a critical role of cobalt in methanol metabolism outside of its role in the MT system. Given the often-crucial role of metal cofactors such as iron, zinc, and other metals in the active site of ADHs, we hypothesized that cobalt could influence the catalytic activity of the TPOSR ADHs. The gene encoding for the most abundant ADH during growth on methanol, Adh1, was heterologously expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and the enzyme was purified for kinetic studies. Adh1 exhibited optimal activity at 55°C and is oxygen tolerant. The methanol turnover rate increased from 1.76 (95% Cl [1.56, 1.99]) s⁻¹ to 3.5 (95% Cl [3.3, 3.72]) s⁻¹ with the addition of 2 µM CoSO<sub>4</sub>, while higher cobalt concentrations (>5 µM) inhibited Adh1 activity. Similarly, NiSO<sub>4</sub> addition (1-1000 µM) enhanced Adh1 activity, with a 75% improvement observed at an optimum concentration of 200 µM. Our findings suggest that the importance of cobalt for the methanol metabolism of sulfate-reducing organisms extends beyond its involvement in the MT system.IMPORTANCEMethanol is a ubiquitous compound in natural environments, where it is produced geothermally or from plant and microbial biomass. Its microbial metabolism is particularly important in low-nutrient, oxygen-free environments, such as the deep subsurface, where specialized microbes compete for methanol and play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Typically, microbes in these settings rely on a cobalt-dependent methanol methyltransferase (MT) pathway for methanol breakdown. However, <i>Desulfofundulus kuznetsovii</i> TPOSR deviates from this, lacking the MT pathway and instead relying solely on alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) to oxidize methanol. Despite the absence of the cobalt-dependent MT system, our study shows that cobalt strongly stimulates the activity of the most abundant ADH, revealing an unexpected, yet significant role for cobalt in this alternative methanol metabolism. Understanding these interactions not only sheds new light on methanol metabolism in nature but also opens up possibilities for developing more efficient and sustainable technologies for methanol conversion in industry.
40202320	Genome analysis reveals a biased distribution of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in the genus <i>Enterococcus</i> and an abundance of safe species.	Enterococci are lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that, as their name implies, often are found in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. Like many other gut-dwelling LAB, for example, various lactobacilli, they are frequently found in other niches as well, including plants and fermented foods from all over the world. In fermented foods, they contribute to flavor and other organoleptic properties, help extend shelf life, and some even possess probiotic properties. There are many positive attributes of enterococci; however, they have been overshadowed by the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant and virulent strains, often reported for the two species, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>. More than 40,000 whole-genome sequences covering 64 <i>Enterococcus</i> type species are currently available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information repository. Closer inspection of these sequences revealed that most represent the two gut-dwelling species <i>E. faecalis</i> and <i>E. faecium</i>. The remaining 62 species, many of which have been isolated from plants, are thus quite underrepresented. Of the latter species, we found that most carried no potential virulence and antibiotic resistance genes, an observation that is aligned with these species predominately occupying other niches. Thus, the culprits found in the <i>Enterococcus</i> genus mainly belong to <i>E. faecalis</i>, and a biased characterization has resulted in the opinion that enterococci do not belong in food. Since enterococci possess many industrially desirable traits and frequently are found in other niches besides the gut of animals, we suggest that their use as food fermentation microorganisms is reconsidered.IMPORTANCEWe have retrieved a large number of <i>Enterococcus</i> genome sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information repository and have scrutinized these for the presence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Our results show that such genes are prevalently found in the two species <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>. Most other species do not harbor any virulence and antibiotic resistance genes and display great potential for use as food fermentation microorganisms or as probiotics. The study contributes to the current debate on enterococci and goes against the mainstream perception of enterococci as potentially dangerous microorganisms that should not be associated with food and health.
40202319	Extracellular electron transfer proteins contribute to reduction of ferric minerals by <i>Geobacter</i> biofilms.	To investigate how the thickness and extracellular electron transfer (EET) capabilities of microbial biofilms influence the reduction of ferric iron [Fe(III)]-containing minerals, we utilized four strains of <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> with varying biofilm thicknesses and EET capabilities. These strains were engineered by modulating intracellular levels of dinucleotide second messengers. We systematically investigated the capacity of biofilms formed by four strains to reduce different Fe(III)-containing minerals including ferrihydrite, goethite, and lepidocrocite. By growing the <i>G. sulfurreducens</i> biofilm on the Fe(III) mineral-coated slides, our results showed that the strains forming thin biofilms on surfaces of Fe(III) minerals exhibited faster Fe(III) reduction rates compared to those with thick biofilms. Transcriptomic analyses revealed the upregulation of the genes encoding bacterial EET-involved proteins in the thin biofilms, highlighting the significant role of these proteins in reducing Fe(III)-containing minerals by <i>G. sulfurreducens</i> biofilms. Furthermore, genetic characterization identified the participation of two novel <i>c</i>-type cytochromes (<i>c</i>-Cyts), GSU1996 and GSU2513, in the reduction of Fe(III)-containing minerals by <i>G. sulfurreducens</i> biofilms. The results from this study provide an improved understanding of mineral-microbe interaction.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Geobacter</i> is a predominant species within biofilm communities that facilitate iron reduction, a process essential for the biogeochemical cycling of iron and other elements. However, the specific properties of <i>Geobacter</i> biofilms crucial for iron reduction remain unclear. By manipulating intracellular levels of dinucleotide second messengers to generate strains with varying biofilm properties, this research reveals that thinner biofilms exhibit superior rates of ferric iron [Fe(III)] mineral reduction compared to thicker biofilms. This finding highlights the vital role of proteins involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET) in enhancing the reduction of Fe(III)-containing minerals. The study further identifies two novel <i>c</i>-type cytochromes, GSU1996 and GSU2513, as important contributors to this process. These discoveries not only advance our understanding of microbial iron reduction but also offer new perspectives on the interactions between biofilms and mineral surfaces, potentially informing future research and applications in biogeochemical cycling and bioenergy.
40202318	Human cytomegalovirus gH/gL/gO binding to PDGFRα provides a regulatory signal activating the fusion protein gB that can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies.	Herpesviruses require membrane fusion for entry and spread, a process facilitated by the fusion glycoprotein B (gB) and the regulatory factor gH/gL. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gH/gL can be modified by the accessory protein gO, or the set of proteins UL128, UL130, and UL131. While the binding of the gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 complexes to cellular receptors, including PDGFRα and NRP2, has been well-characterized structurally, the specific role of receptor engagements by the gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 in regulation of fusion has remained unclear. We describe a cell-cell fusion assay that can quantitatively measure fusion on a timescale of minutes and demonstrate that binding of gH/gL/gO to PDGFRα dramatically enhances gB-mediated cell-cell fusion. In contrast, gH/gL/pUL128-131-regulated fusion is significantly slower, and gH/gL alone cannot promote gB fusion activity within this timescale. The genetic diversity of gO influenced the observed cell-cell fusion rates, correlating with previously reported effects on HCMV infectivity. Mutations in gL that had no effect on the formation of gH/gL/gO or binding to PDGFRa dramatically reduced the cell-cell fusion rate, suggesting that gL plays a critical role in linking the gH/gL/gO-PDGFRa receptor binding to activation of gB. Several neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies were found to potently block gH/gL/gO-PDGFRa-regulated cell-cell fusion, suggesting this mechanism as a therapeutic target.
40202317	Molecular cloning and host range analysis of three cytomegaloviruses from <i>Mastomys natalensis</i>.	Herpesvirus-based vectors are attractive for use as conventional or transmissible vaccines against emerging zoonoses in inaccessible animal populations. In both cases, cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) as members of the subfamily <i>Betaherpesvirinae</i> are particularly suitable for vaccine development as they are highly specific for their natural host species, infect a large proportion of their host population, and cause mild infections in healthy individuals. The Natal multimammate mouse (<i>Mastomys natalensis</i>) is the natural reservoir of Lassa virus, which causes deadly hemorrhagic fever in humans. <i>M. natalensis</i> was recently reported to harbor at least three different cytomegaloviruses (MnatCMV1, MnatCMV2, and MnatCMV3). Herein, we report the molecular cloning of three complete MnatCMV genomes in a yeast and bacterial artificial chromosome (YAC-BAC) hybrid vector. Purified viral genomes were cloned in yeast by single-step transformation-associated recombination (STAR cloning) and subsequently transferred to <i>Escherichia coli</i> for further genetic manipulation. The integrity of the complete cloned viral genomes was verified by sequencing, and the replication fitness of viruses reconstituted from these clones was analyzed by replication kinetics in <i>M. natalensis</i> fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells. We also found that neither parental nor cloned MnatCMVs replicated in mouse and rat fibroblasts, nor did they show sustained replication in baby hamster kidney cells, consistent with the expected narrow host range for these viruses. We further demonstrated that an exogenous sequence can be inserted by BAC-based mutagenesis between open reading frames M25 and m25.1 of MnatCMV2 without affecting replication fitness <i>in vitro</i>, identifying this site as potentially suitable for the insertion of vaccine target antigen genes.IMPORTANCECytomegaloviruses (CMVs) recently discovered in the Natal multimammate mouse (<i>Mastomys natalensis</i>) are widespread within the <i>M. natalensis</i> population. Since these rodents also serve as natural hosts of the human pathogen Lassa virus (LASV), we investigated the potential suitability of <i>M. natalensis</i> CMVs (MnatCMVs) as vaccine vectors. We describe the cloning of three different MnatCMV genomes as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). The replicative capacity and species specificity of these BAC-derived MnatCMVs were analyzed in multiple cell types. We also identified a transgene insertion site within one of the MnatCMV genomes suitable for the incorporation of vaccine target antigens. Together, this study provides a foundation for the development of MnatCMVs as transmissible MnatCMV-based LASV vaccines to reduce LASV prevalence in hard-to-reach <i>M. natalensis</i> populations and, thereby, zoonotic transmission to humans.
40202316	CPSF6 promotes HIV-1 preintegration complex function.	Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6) is part of the cellular cleavage factor I mammalian (CFIm) complex that regulates mRNA processing and polyadenylation. CPSF6 also functions as an HIV-1 capsid (CA) binding host factor to promote viral DNA integration targeting into gene-dense regions of the host genome. However, the effects of CPSF6 on the activity of the HIV-1 preintegration complex (PIC)-the sub-viral machinery that carries out viral DNA integration-are unknown. To study CPSF6's role in HIV-1 PIC function, we extracted PICs from cells that are either depleted of CPSF6 or express a mutant form that cannot bind to CA. These PICs exhibited significantly lower viral DNA integration activity when compared to the control PICs. The addition of purified recombinant CPSF6 restored the integration activity of PICs extracted from the CPSF6-mutant cells, suggesting a direct role of CPSF6 in PIC function. To solidify CPSF6's role in PIC function, we inoculated CPSF6-depleted and CPSF6-mutant cells with HIV-1 particles and measured viral DNA integration into the host genome. A significant reduction in integration in these cells was detected, and this reduction was not a consequence of lower reverse transcription or nuclear entry. Additionally, mutant viruses deficient in CA-CPSF6 binding showed no integration defect in CPSF6-mutant cells. Finally, sequencing analysis revealed that HIV-1 integration into CPSF6-mutant cell genomes was significantly redirected away from gene-dense regions of chromatin compared to the control cells. Collectively, these results suggest that the CPSF6-CA interaction promotes PIC function both <i>in vitro</i> and in infected cells.IMPORTANCEHIV-1 infection is dependent on the interaction of the virus with cellular host factors. However, the molecular details of HIV-host factor interactions are not fully understood. For instance, the HIV-1 capsid provides binding interfaces for several host factors. CPSF6 is one such capsid-binding host factor, whose cellular function is to regulate mRNA processing and polyadenylation. Initial work identified a truncated cytosolic form of CPSF6 to restrict HIV infection by blocking viral nuclear entry. However, it is now established that the full-length CPSF6 primarily promotes HIV-1 integration targeting into gene-dense regions of the host genome. Here, we provide evidence that CPSF6-CA interaction stimulates the activity of HIV-1 preintegration complexes (PICs). We also describe that disruption of CPSF6-CA binding in target cells significantly reduces viral DNA integration and redirects integration targeting away from gene-dense regions into regions of low transcriptional activity. These findings identify a critical role for the CPSF6-CA interaction in PIC function and integration targeting.
40202315	Characterization of quasispecies of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus.	Three specific amino acid variations have been identified in the quasispecies of the isolated YG1 strain of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV): Gn (Y328H), Gc (R624W), and L (N1891K). The Gn (Y328H) accounted for 26.9% of the viruses in the patient's blood. The other two mutations are less frequent, indicating that these mutations appeared during propagation in Vero E6 cells. To investigate the effects of each mutation on viral properties, we evaluated viruses with one to three mutations. Mutations Y328H and R624W in glycoprotein (GP) resulted in increased plaque size and cell fusion activity. Viruses with the N1891K mutation in L showed a notable cytopathic effect (CPE), which was inhibited by a pan-caspase inhibitor, suggesting that caspase-dependent cell death occurred. Programmed cell death-associated caspases were induced in both CPE-inducing and wild-type virus-infected cells. Furthermore, infection with the wild-type virus suppressed actinomycin D-induced cell death. These results suggest that SFTSV-infected cells initiate programmed cell death, whereas the wild-type virus inhibits cell death. Additionally, the recombinant single mutant virus outcompeted by a 10-fold lower amount of the wild-type virus in Vero E6 cells, indicating that the mutations were not advantageous for viral propagation in Vero E6 cells. These findings suggest that the quasispecies composition of SFTSV is influenced by the propagative environment.IMPORTANCEThis study presents findings on viral pathogenesis by analyzing quasispecies derived from a fatal case of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection. Analysis of recombinant SFTSV with mutations in Gn and Gc suggested that combinations of mutations may enhance the viability of mutant viruses, thereby selecting viruses to create a suitable population for propagation. The N1891K mutation in the L protein of SFTSV is associated with promoting cytopathic effects (CPE). Conversely, the wild-type virus, which is the predominant virus in infected patients, suppresses cell death. It has been suggested that SFTSV possesses a mechanism to evade cell death for prolonged viral propagation within the infected cells. Although the precise mechanism remains unknown, RNA virus polymerase may be involved in regulating cell death. This study contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the adaptation and survival of viruses as quasispecies.
40202314	Maxillary Distraction Osteogenesis Versus Conventional Orthognathic Surgery in Cleft Lip and Palate Patients: Systematic Review.	Cleft lip and palate (CLP) is a common congenital condition that often requires multiple surgeries to correct. However, these surgical procedures can lead to complications like midface hypoplasia, speech difficulties, and dental malocclusion. CLP individuals need orthognathic surgeries to correct these problems either with conventional Le Fort I (CO) or maxillary distraction osteogenesis (DO). The search of the articles was through 3 main electronic databases PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus. Clinical trials, prospectives, retrospective, and case series were included. A total of 30 articles were analyzed according to the type of orthognathic surgery and the outcomes relapse, soft tissue, velepharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), Speech, and morbidities. The results showed that there was no difference between CO and DO in terms of relapse rate, soft tissue changes, speech, and morbidities. However, DO showed less change on the veloparyngeal gap than CO.
40202313	Microbial communities on dry natural rocks are richer and less stressed than those on man-made playgrounds.	In modern urbanized societies, the incidence of major immune-mediated diseases is several times higher than before World War II. A potential explanation is that these diseases are triggered by limited possibilities to be exposed to rich environmental microbiota. This requires that the urban environment hosts less and poorer microbiota than the natural environment. The current study was designed to test the assumption that urban man-made environments host less and poorer environmental microbiota, compared to natural habitats. We selected two types of dry environments, natural rocks and playground rubber mats, both of which were used daily and extensively by children. In quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing, bacterial abundance and richness were higher on the natural rocks than the rubber mats. Altogether, 67 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging mostly to Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were indicative of rock microbiota, while three ASVs were indicative of rubber mats. Interestingly, bacteria formed more complex networks on rubber mats than natural rocks. Based on the literature, this indicates that the studied artificial dry environment is more challenging and stressful for bacterial communities than dry natural rocks. The results support the hypothesis that urban man-made environments host poor microbial communities, which is in accordance with the biodiversity hypothesis of immune-mediated diseases.IMPORTANCEThe current study provides new evidence that artificial urban play environments host poor microbial communities and provide a stressful environment for microbes, as compared to dry natural rocks. Through this, the current study underlines the need to enhance microbial diversity in urban areas, especially in outdoor play environments, which have a crucial role in providing essential microbial exposure for the development of children's immune system. This research can potentially offer guidance for urban planning and public health strategies that support planetary health.
40202312	Prognostic implications of the interaction between intratumoral microbiome and immune response in gastric cancer.	Gastric cancer (GC) prognosis is significantly influenced by intratumoral microbiomes, which modulate host-immune interactions. This study analyzed data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to identify immune genes associated with GC prognosis and conducted prognostic immune subtypes. GC patients were classified into two distinct prognostic immune phenotypes C1 and C2 based on the non-negative matrix factorization consensus clusters. Phenotype C2 exhibited a better prognosis and distinct immune characteristics, including enhanced presence of Th2 and Th17 cells and improved response to chemotherapy. In contrast, phenotype C1 showed higher expression levels of PDCD1LG2 and TLR9, which were critical immune factors involved in immune regulation. Both phenotypes were linked to immune genes influencing intratumoral microbiomes and GC immunotherapy responses. A prediction risk model was constructed using the LASSO regression analysis and showed great prognostic value for GC patients. The key genes were correlated with immune cells and suppressed the function of the host immune system. The intratumoral microbiomes were strongly associated with the hosts' immune infiltration and significantly interacted with host immune genes to influence GC outcomes. <i>Candidatus Nitrosotenuis</i> plays a significant role in predicting the prognosis of GC patients. This research underscores the pivotal role of intratumoral microbiomes in GC prognosis and supports the development of future personalized therapeutic approaches.IMPORTANCEIncreasing evidence confirms the presence of intratumoral microbiomes. However, the role of the intratumoral microbiomes in the progression of gastric cancer and their relationship with the immune microenvironment remain unclear. Our study classified gastric cancer patients into two immune prognostic subtypes, C1 and C2, using non-negative matrix factorization consensus clusters. The C2 subtype exhibited a better prognosis and more pronounced immune characteristics. Microbiome analyses revealed associations between both subtypes and immune genes that affect intratumoral microbiomes and their responses to immunotherapy. The intratumoral microbiomes were closely linked with host immune infiltration and significantly interacted with immune genes, which influence the prognosis of gastric cancer. Notably, <i>Candidatus Nitrosotenuis</i> showed a significant prognostic value in gastric cancer patients. Our findings highlight the critical role of the intratumoral microbiomes in affecting gastric cancer prognosis and its interaction with the immune microenvironment, supporting future personalized therapeutic approaches.
40202311	Multiplex PCR assay to identify clinically important <i>Aeromonas</i> species.	The genus <i>Aeromonas</i> is increasingly implicated in human infections. However, accurate species-level identification remains challenging, particularly in clinical microbiology laboratories. This study aimed to develop a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to identify four <i>Aeromonas</i> species-<i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i>, <i>Aeromonas caviae</i>, <i>Aeromonas veronii</i>, and <i>Aeromonas dhakensis-</i>most frequently associated with human infectious diseases. A total of 788 whole genome sequencing (WGS) data sets from 31 <i>Aeromonas</i> species were analyzed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) specifically present in <i>A. hydrophila</i>, <i>A. caviae</i>, <i>A. veronii</i>, and <i>A. dhakensis</i>. Primer sets were designed based on sequences of ORFs specific to each species to develop a multiplex PCR assay. To validate the efficacy of the assay, 256 clinical <i>Aeromonas</i> isolates were tested, and the results were compared with taxonomic affiliation inferred by WGS data, along with 19 type strains. The multiplex PCR successfully identified all strains of the four target species and produced no amplification in non-target species strains except the band for internal control. The multiplex PCR enables rapid and reliable identification of four <i>Aeromonas</i> spp. commonly involved in human infectious diseases.IMPORTANCEThe multiplex PCR assay facilitates accurate identification of clinically important <i>Aeromonas</i> spp. in clinical microbiology laboratories, providing crucial information to guide appropriate antimicrobial therapy and advance understanding of the epidemiology of <i>Aeromonas</i> spp.
40202310	<i>Salmonella enterica</i> serotypes causing infection in Kuwait during 2018-2021, determined by multi-locus sequence typing or whole genome sequencing.	Salmonellosis due to non-typhoidal <i>Salmonellae</i> (NTS) is a zoonotic infection that has epidemiological uniqueness in different settings. The current study aimed to determine the serotypes and the genetic diversity of human <i>Salmonella enterica</i> isolates causing infection in Kuwait. Isolates were obtained from feces of healthy adults and diarrheal patients between 2018 and 2021. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was used to study sequence types (STs) and infer serotypes. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate six selected isolates, which included two isolates from a foodborne outbreak and two isolates whose serotypes could not be determined. Antibiotic susceptibility was studied by E-test and interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. During the study period, 112/8,019 stool samples, 39/129,130 blood samples, 4/1,835 tissue samples, 3/1,209 pleural fluids, 3/9,388 pus samples, 4/80,799 urine samples, 1/7,053 endotracheal secretions, and 1/18 liver abscess samples were culture positive for <i>Salmonella</i>, yielding a total of 167 isolates with 30 different serotypes. <i>S</i>. Enteritidis (36.5%, <i>n</i> = 61), <i>S</i>. Typhimurium (14.97%, <i>n</i> = 25), <i>S</i>. Kentucky (5.9%, <i>n</i> = 10), and <i>S</i>. Newport (5.9%, <i>n</i> = 10) were the predominant serotypes. A new sequence type, ST 10217 corresponding to <i>S</i>. Schwarzengrund, was found by WGS. Two <i>S</i>. Enteritidis isolates from the foodborne outbreak showed a unique phylogenetic profile. In the phylogenetic analysis of serotypes, the number of clades was equal to the number of STs. No resistance to carbapenems was found among the isolates. This study provided data on the epidemiology of <i>Salmonella</i> serotypes causing infection in Kuwait.IMPORTANCEHuman salmonellosis due to nontyphoid <i>Salmonellae</i> is a major foodborne disease throughout the world. We determined the serotypes of isolates causing salmonellosis in Kuwait during the study period. We inferred the serotypes of isolates based on their sequence types as determined by multi-locus sequence typing, which is more amenable to laboratories than the traditional serotyping. By whole genome sequencing, we determined that the strain causing a foodborne outbreak was unique, and a new sequence type not in the serotyping scheme represented a rare serotype. We learnt the resistance pattern of isolates and lack of resistance to carbapenems that will be useful for treating multi-drug-resistant infection. Our data will contribute to planning strategies for treatment and control of salmonellosis and the epidemiology of salmonellosis in the Middle East.
40202309	CAMP-negative <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i> strains exhibited complete or partial chromosomal deletions of the CAMP-factor encoding gene <i>cfb</i>.	Universal antepartum group B streptococcus (GBS) screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) have effectively reduced early-onset GBS infections. However, GBS strains with chromosomal deletions affecting the <i>cfb</i> gene may produce false negatives in both the CAMP test and <i>cfb</i>-based molecular diagnostics, potentially increasing the risk of neonatal infections. Vaginal swabs were collected from pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation in our hospital and cultured on agar. Suspected GBS strains were initially identified using the CAMP test and then confirmed with the VITEK-2 system. CAMP-negative GBS strains underwent additional testing by qPCR, 16S rDNA, serotyping, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). PCR for the <i>cfb</i> gene and whole-genome sequencing were performed on CAMP-negative strains. From 5,794 samples, 526 (9.1%) GBS strains, including 19 (3.6%) CAMP-negative strains and 2 strains from the same patient, were isolated. All 19 CAMP-negative strains were serotypes III and ST862. Among these strains, only one strain was <i>cfb</i> positive by qPCR, whereas all tested positive with a multitarget qPCR kit for <i>cfb</i> and <i>cps</i>. PCR amplification upstream of the <i>cfb</i> gene produced a specific band in strain PP669713 only, suggesting N-terminal <i>cfb</i> gene retention in PP669713 and complete <i>cfb</i> loss in the other strains. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed a chromosomal deletion in PP669713. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed no resistance to penicillin. However, CAMP-positive strains presented a greater prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin than CAMP-negative strains did. Our study highlights the potential risk of missed GBS detection using CAMP tests and <i>cfb</i>-targeted molecular assays.
40202308	Mitomycin C eliminates cyanobacterial transcription without detectable prophage induction in a <i>Microcystis</i>-dominated harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie.	Although evidence indicates that viruses are important in the ecology of <i>Microcystis</i> spp., many questions remain. For example, how does <i>Microcystis</i> exist at high, bloom-associated cell concentrations in the presence of viruses that infect it? The phenomenon of lysogeny and associated homoimmunity offer possible explanations for this question. Virtually nothing is known about lysogeny in <i>Microcystis</i>, but a metatranscriptomic study suggests that widespread, transient lysogeny is active during blooms. These observations lead us to posit that lysogeny is important in modulating <i>Microcystis</i> blooms. Using a classic mitomycin C-based induction study, we tested for lysogeny in a <i>Microcystis</i>-dominated community in Lake Erie in 2019. Treated communities were incubated with 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> mitomycin C for 48 h alongside unamended controls. We compared direct counts of virus-like particles (VLPs) and examined community transcription for active infection by cyanophage. Mitomycin C treatment did not increase VLP count. Mitomycin C effectively eliminated transcription in the cyanobacterial community, while we detected no evidence of induction. Metatranscriptomic analysis demonstrated that the standard protocol of 1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> was highly toxic to the cyanobacterial population, which likely inhibited induction of any prophage present. Follow-up lab studies indicated that 0.1 mg L<sup>-1</sup> may be more appropriate for use in freshwater cyanobacterial studies. These findings will guide future efforts to detect lysogeny in <i>Microcystis</i> blooms.IMPORTANCEHarmful algal blooms dominated by <i>Microcystis</i> spp. occur throughout the world's freshwater ecosystems, leading to detrimental effects on ecosystem services that are well documented. After decades of research, the scientific community continues to struggle to understand the ecology of <i>Microcystis</i> blooms. The phenomenon of lysogeny offers an attractive potential explanation for several ecological questions surrounding blooms. However, almost nothing is known about lysogeny in <i>Microcystis</i>. We attempted to investigate lysogeny in a <i>Microcystis</i> bloom in Lake Erie and found that the standard protocols used to study lysogeny in aquatic communities are inappropriate for use in <i>Microcystis</i> studies, and perhaps freshwater cyanobacterial studies more broadly. This work can be used to design better methods to study the viral ecology of <i>Microcystis</i> blooms.
40202307	Brachial Plexus Lipoma Causing Neurological Impairment: A Case Series and Systematic Review.	Lipomas are benign adipocyte tumors that typically present as painless, firm nodules. In rare cases, lipomas may grow near the brachial plexus (BP) and compress various peripheral nerves. This can manifest as upper extremity motor and/or sensory deficits, numbness, tingling, or burning sensations. Surgical intervention of a brachial plexus lipoma (BPL) may be challenging because of variability in location and size. This study reviews previously reported cases of BPL causing neurological impairment and presents 5 additional cases, focusing on operative details and patient outcomes.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms and the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) remain prevalent after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), despite it being known to alleviate reflux. The physiological changes behind long-term GERD and hiatal hernia (HH) prevalence post-RYGB are not commonly investigated.
40202305	Organic Indium Halides with Near-Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yields for Highly Efficient Luminescent Inks and White Light Emitting Diodes.	Zero-dimensional (0D) organic indium halides have been emerged as promising broadband light emitters with wide application prospects, but most of the present halides suffer from low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and a high-power excitation light source is needed to obtain desirable performance. In this work, we elaborately select appropriate organic cations as crystal structural engineering and obtained a series of highly efficient 0D indium bromides. Under UV light excitation, these 0D indium halides display broadband yellow light emissions (550-600 nm) with near-unity PLQYs, which represents one of the highest values in all the previously reported indium halides. Benefiting from successful nanoscale engineering, highly luminescent inks based on these 0D indium halides are facilely prepared by dispersing nanocrystals into various organic solvents. The luminescent ink can be utilized to print various anticounterfeiting patterns, which displays photoreversible switching with visible/invisible transformation under the alternating irradiation of UV and visible light. Furthermore, white light emitting diodes can be fabricated with high color rendering index above 90 by using these 0D halides as down-conversion phosphors. This work not only promotes the development of indium halides but also significantly broadens the application in solid-state illumination and anticounterfeiting, etc.
40202304	Early identification of taboo words reveals a prominent role of semantic information in visual word recognition.	This research used the progressive demasking paradigm to investigate whether perceptual word identification is facilitated by semantic information. Experiment 1 revealed faster identification for taboo than neutral words. Experiment 2 revealed faster identification for taboo than emotionally-comparable non-taboo words, whereas the difference with respect to neutral words was possibly mitigated by list-wise factors related to list composition. Moreover, the facilitation for taboo words was impervious to habituation. The taboo connotation advantage seemingly originates from the attentional capture triggered by tabooness, a socio-culturally determined semantic feature that, under appropriate contextual conditions, modulates perceptual word identification. Our results suggest that (a) semantic processing is a pervasive component of any task involving word processing, and (b) when semantic information does not hinder the main task, it may influence even the earliest stages of word perceptual identification.

The global incidence of breast cancer is increasing, making the care of breast cancer survivors a priority for health services worldwide. Spouses are often the primary caregivers for breast cancer survivors, and understanding their caregiving experiences is essential for developing supportive programs aimed at reducing the burden on these caregivers.
40202302	A Commentary: Looking Back and Looking Sideways.	It has been said that "too much confidence cannot be placed on the lessons of history." We suggest that this declaration is particularly salient for the dynamic field of toxicology. The intersection of historical trends and technological developments within and outside the discipline is briefly considered as they have shaped what we study and what we do. Most importantly, perhaps, both individually and collectively, these elements also highlight cautions and define challenges that toxicology must embrace to continue to thrive and contribute to the scientific enterprise and public health.
40202301	From insect endosymbiont to phloem colonizer: comparative genomics unveils the lifestyle transition of phytopathogenic <i>Arsenophonus</i> strains.	Bacteria infecting the plant phloem represent a growing threat worldwide. While these organisms often resist <i>in vitro</i> culture, they multiply both in plant sieve elements and hemipteran vectors. Such cross-kingdom parasitic lifestyle has emerged in diverse taxa via distinct ecological routes. In the genus <i>Arsenophonus</i>, the phloem pathogens "<i>Candidatus</i> Arsenophonus phytopathogenicus" (Ap) and "<i>Ca</i>. Phlomobacter fragariae" (Pf) have evolved from insect endosymbionts, but the genetic mechanisms underlying this transition have not been explored. To fill this gap, we obtained the genomes of both strains from insect host metagenomes. The resulting assemblies are highly similar in size and functional repertoire, rich in viral sequences, and closely resemble the genomes of several facultative endosymbiotic <i>Arsenophonus</i> strains of sap-sucking hemipterans. However, a phylogenomic analysis demonstrated distinct origins, as Ap belongs to the "<i>Triatominarum</i>" clade, whereas Pf represents a distant species. We identified a set of orthologs encoded only by Ap and Pf in the genus, including hydrolytic enzymes likely targeting plant substrates. In particular, both bacteria encode putative plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and cysteine peptidases related to xylellain, a papain-like peptidase from <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, for which close homologs are found in diverse <i>Pseudomonadota</i> infecting the plant vasculature. <i>In silico</i> predictions and gene expression analyses further support a role during phloem colonization for several of the shared orthologs. We conclude that the double emergence of phytopathogenicity in <i>Arsenophonus</i> may have been mediated by a few horizontal gene transfer events, involving genes acquired from other <i>Pseudomonadota</i>, including phytopathogens.
40202300	Hypercoagulable state and gut microbiota dysbiosis as predictors of poor functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients.	Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients often exhibit hypercoagulable state and gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, the association between coagulation abnormalities and gut microbiota dysbiosis in AIS patients and their predictive value for poor functional outcomes in AIS has not been investigated. Our study enrolled 95 AIS patients and 81 healthy controls, using 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze gut microbiota composition. Baseline fibrinogen level was found to be an independent risk factor for poor functional outcomes at 90-day follow-up (odds ratio = 2.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-4.59, <i>P</i> = 0.044). AIS patients showed significant gut microbiota dysbiosis, with significantly increased <i>Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>, and decreased <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Roseburia</i>, associated with coagulation indices. Furthermore, compared with AIS patients with normal coagulation function, those in a hypercoagulable state exhibited a significant increase in <i>Alistipe</i>s and a decrease in <i>Prevotella</i>. We identified gut microbial biomarkers consisting of 15 bacteria that predicted poor functional outcome in AIS patients at 90-day follow-up. Coagulation indices improved the predictive performance of these biomarkers. In training and validation cohorts, area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.930 and 0.890 for microbial biomarkers alone, 0.691 and 0.751 for coagulation indices alone, and 0.943 and 0.944 for coagulation indices combined with gut microbial biomarkers. Our study showed that AIS patients with hypercoagulable state had gut microbiota dysbiosis, with <i>Alistipes</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> significantly associated with coagulation indices. A classification model based on coagulation indices and gut microbial biomarkers accurately predicted poor functional outcome in AIS patients at 90-day follow-up.
40202299	The Important Value of Nursing "Compassionate Care": A Phenomenological Study From the Perspective of Patients Living With a Cancer Diagnosis.

40202297	Integration of administrative claims and clinical data to advance real-world evidence generation in oncology.	The objective of this study is to evaluate capabilities of the Generating Evidence Excellence (GEx) research environment using Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) as a use-case.
40202296	The use of TENS for the treatment of back pain in the emergency department: A randomized controlled trial.	Back pain is one of the most common complaints in the emergency department (ED). Since current pharmacological treatments for back pain are often suboptimal, a multimodal approach that includes nonpharmacological modalities has promise to improve pain management. The objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) would be more effective at relieving back pain than sham TENS.
40202295	Other Primary Epithelial Neoplasms of the Liver.	Primary liver carcinoma (PLC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortalities. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent form of PLC, followed by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). In addition, there is a group of rarer PLCs that do not fit neatly into the HCC or iCCA categories. This review explores this heterogeneous group, including combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA), intermediate cell carcinoma (ICC), mixed hepatocellular-neuroendocrine carcinoma, and undifferentiated primary liver carcinoma. cHCC-CCA is a rare subtype of PLC, characterized by both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic differentiation within the same tumor. The latest WHO classification (2019, fifth edition) redefined cHCC-CCA by eliminating the "stem cell subtypes" and emphasized that diagnosis should primarily rely on morphologic features, supported by immunohistochemical staining to better define subtypes. Intermediate cell carcinoma is a subtype of cHCC-CCA and is comprised of monomorphic tumor cells that exhibit characteristics intermediate between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, with immunohistochemical expression of hepatocytic and cholangiocytic markers within the same cell. Another rare entity, combined HCC and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), contains an admixture of HCC and NEC components within the same tumor. Undifferentiated primary liver carcinoma, on the other hand, lacks definitive lineage differentiation beyond an epithelial phenotype. These heterogeneous PLCs pose diagnostic challenges owing to their mixed/unusual histologic features and overlapping immunohistochemical markers. They tend to have poor prognoses, highlighting the critical importance of accurate and timely diagnosis.
40202294	In the eye of the beholder - validating the visual social anxiety scale (VSAS) in social anxiety disorder.	The Visual Social Anxiety Scale (VSAS) is a novel picture-based self-report measure of social anxiety that shown promising psychometric properties among non-selected participants. The present study aimed to validate the VSAS among individuals with clinically diagnosed social anxiety disorder (SAD) and establish clinical cutoff scores. One-hundred-and-three adults with SAD completed the VSAS with a battery of additional self-report measures of social anxiety, depression, and general anxiety. Internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validities, were assessed. Clinical cutoff scores were established via a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis using a control group of individuals without any past or present psychopathology (<i>n</i> = 34). An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was performed to explore underlying thematic factors. The VSAS exhibited high internal consistency and adequate convergent and discriminant validities. The ROC analysis showed the area under the curve to be 0.95 and yielded an optimal cutoff score of 23.40, providing high accuracy (0.90), sensitivity (0.89), and specificity (0.91) for distinguishing SAD from non-SAD individuals. The EFA revealed a 3-factor structure representing the following themes: social interpersonal situations, formal interpersonal situations, and being the center of attention. The psychometric properties of the VSAS support its utility in assessing and identifying individuals with clinical SAD.
40202293	Exercise Capacity and Occupational Competence Sequelae in COVID-19 Survivors: A Longitudinal Study.	The Sars-Cov-2 infection disease (COVID-19) causes symptoms during both acute and post-COVID phases. This study assessed exercise capacity and occupational competence of 20 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, at discharge and three months later using the 6-Minute Step Test and Occupational Self-Assessment. Significant differences were found in both exercise capacity and occupational competence scores between discharge and three months later (<i>p</i> < 0.05). However, these measurements were not correlated (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Although patients show improvement after discharge, some symptoms persisted, affecting their exercise, and occupational performance. Further research is needed to explore long-term occupational outcomes of COVID-19 beyond one year.

40202291	Development of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Method for Determining Aluminium Levels in Animal Tissues following Exposure and its Distribution across Various Tissues.	In this study, an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) method was developed to determine the Al in rats' tissue (liver, kidneys, and testicles). The Mg II (280.270 nm)/Mg I (285.213 nm) ratio was used to achieve plasma robustness. The method was validated by detection and quantification limit, accuracy, precision, linearity and recovery. For the chosen analytical line of 308.215 nm, the correlation coefficient was 0.99998 in the checked interval. The limits of detection (0.067 μg/g) and quantification (0.225 μg/g), as a measure of the sensitivity of the method, were calculated. A total of 36 rats were treated with varying doses of AlCl3 for eight weeks, after which their tissues were analysed. The results obtained showed that the Al accumulation decreased in the order liver > kidneys > testicles. Also, liver and testicle samples treated with verapamil show lower aluminium accumulation than samples treated with the same aluminium concentration without verapamil. The recoveries in spiked samples were between 91.8-108.4%. Multivariate methods were used to differentiate samples based on aluminium contents. The results of the research show the protective effect of verapamil in chronic aluminum exposure and could be important in further medicinal (therapeutic) studies.
40202290	Lab-on-Robot: Unmanned Mass Spectrometry Robot for Direct Sample Analysis in Hazardous and Radioactive Environments.	Onsite, safe, and reliable mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of hazardous and radioactive samples plays a crucial role in timely chemical emergency management and response in real environments. The current study reports the development of a smart MS robot by integrating miniature MS, quadruped robot, switchable robotic arm sampler, and direct ionization for remote-controlled chemical analysis of complex samples in inaccessible hazardous and radioactive environments. High automation and excellent analytical performance have been achieved in the real-time analysis of volatile toxic substances in air and onsite detection of explosive particles in air aerosols. Successful detection of hazardous compounds has been performed from raw wastewater. The chemical analysis of radioactive ore samples has also been demonstrated. Low limits of detection at ng/g or ng/mL (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 3) and good relative standard deviation (RSD < 12.0%, <i>n</i> = 6) were obtained by the MS robot for analyzing different gaseous, aerosol, liquid, and solid samples. The remote detection results of the MS robot were further validated. The reported study encourages the future development of a smart lab-on-robot, which functions with smart operation to replace the traditional laboratory procedures for MS analysis of dangerous chemical and environmental samples.
40202288	The use of canonical dose-response models for benchmark dose analysis of continuous toxicological data.	The benchmark dose (BMD) approach employs dose-response modeling to determine the dose associated with a small change in response relative to the background response. Here, we introduce a conceptual framework for modeling continuous data that is based on key risk assessment principles and requirements. Based on this framework, we define a class of dose-response models sharing the same four biologically interpretable model parameters, while exhibiting five common properties that are essential from a risk assessment perspective: such models are denoted as "canonical" models. The first two canonical properties are straightforward: property 1. The models should predict positive values only (as measurements of continuous endpoints are typically positive) and property 2. the outcomes should not depend on the measurement unit. Canonical property 3 reflects the observation that toxicological dose-response data related to different subgroups (e.g. species, sexes, and exposure durations) are typically (at least approximately) parallel on a log-dose scale, which is at the same time an implicit assumption in defining fundamental toxicological concepts, such as extrapolation factors, relative potency factors (RPFs), and relative sensitivity factors (RSFs). Property 4 is needed to enable comparisons of the sensitivity of endpoints differing in maximum response. A fifth canonical property reflects our view that choices regarding the dose-response model expression, the assumed distribution for the within-group variation, and the benchmark response (BMR) that is being used should be internally consistent. The canonical models that we discuss are suitable to fit parallel dose-response curves to combined datasets related to different subgroups (e.g. species, sexes, and exposure durations). Doing so provides a tool to check canonical property 3 of the particular data analyzed. We provide a review of empirical evidence indicating that this property has general validity, which is highly fortunate, as this legitimizes the use of extrapolation factors and RPFs in risk assessment. We then evaluate to what extent the approaches in current BMD guidance by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) comply with the principles of canonical dose-response modeling, concluding that this is only partly the case. The latter can have unfavorable and sometimes far-reaching consequences. For instance, some of the recommended non-canonical models result in different BMDs when changing the measurement unit (e.g. µg to mg). As another example, the BMD tool recently developed by EFSA implements covariate analysis in such a way that canonical property 3 cannot possibly be represented by any of the models. As another disadvantage, non-canonical models preclude the effective development and use of prior distributions in a Bayesian approach. Finally, we argue that a concomitant but important advantage of only using canonical models is that BMD methodology will be more transparent, so that risk assessors will be better able to understand it, and BMDs with high societal impact can be more easily defended. The present paper may be a helpful tool for toxicologists and risk assessors to critically follow the developments in BMD methodology at the conceptual level.

40202285	Insights into the Pathogenic Role of Fusaric Acid in <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> Infection of <i>Brassica oleracea</i> through the Comparative Transcriptomic, Chemical, and Genetic Analyses.	Fusarium, a genus of fungi renowned for its plant-pathogenic capabilities, is capable of producing a myriad of structurally diverse secondary metabolites, among which are phytotoxins that play a significant role in the etiology of plant diseases. The particular strain <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>conglutinans</i> (FOC), known as the instigator of <i>Fusarium</i> wilt in cabbage (<i>Brassica oleracea</i>), has been found to secrete an array of toxins and the identities of which have largely remained elusive. In this study, we evaluated the phytotoxicity of crude extracts from the pathogenic FOC strain (FOCr1) and the nonpathogenic <i>F. oxysporum</i> strain (FOcs20) using the cabbage seed phytotoxicity bioassays. Results showed that the crude extract of FOCr1 significantly inhibited seed germination and seedling elongation. Comparative transcriptome analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) revealed higher expression levels of a mycotoxin fusaric acid (FA) biosynthetic gene cluster in FOCr1 under host-like conditions (cabbage medium). High-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis detected a higher yield FA in the crude extract of FOCr1 but is absent in the FOcs20 strain. Deleting the key gene <i>FUB8</i> in FOCr1's FA biosynthetic gene cluster delayed wilt symptoms. Moreover, FA treatment was correlated with an uptick in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels within seedlings, underscoring its potential as a virulence amplifier. These results suggest that FA acts as a positive virulence factor in FOC.

40202275	Adaptive sports in Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine across Europe: the forgotten therapeutic ally.	Physical and rehabilitation medicine (PRM) units promote health and autonomy. One way to achieve this is through physical activity (PA), yet research shows that individuals with physical impairments are not physically active. One way to motivate them is through adaptive sports (also named para sports), as this allows for a more enjoyable experience. Yet, it is unknown whether such activities are offered in PRM across Europe. The Special Interest Scientific Committees "Sports Affairs" of the European Society of PRM set out to fill this gap of knowledge.

40202271	Nanomaterials-Integrated CRISPR/Cas Systems: Expanding the Toolbox for Optical Detection.	Nanomaterials-integrated CRISPR/Cas systems have rapidly emerged as powerful next-generation platforms for optical biosensing. These integrated platforms harness the precision of CRISPR/Cas-mediated nucleic acid detection while leveraging the unique properties of nanomaterials to achieve enhanced sensitivity and expanded analytical capabilities, thereby broadening their diagnostic potential. By incorporating a diverse range of nanomaterials, these systems effectively expand the analytical toolbox for optical detection, offering adaptable solutions tailored to various diagnostic challenges. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the nanomaterials successfully integrated into CRISPR/Cas-based optical sensing systems. It examines multiple optical detection modalities, including fluorescence, electrochemiluminescence, colorimetry, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, highlighting how nanomaterials facilitate signal amplification, enable multiplexing, and support the development of point-of-care applications. Additionally, practical applications of these integrated systems in critical fields such as healthcare diagnostics and environmental monitoring are showcased. While these platforms offer considerable advantages, several real-world challenges such as the complexity of assay workflows, environmental impact of nanomaterials, cost, and regulatory hurdles must be addressed before widespread implementation can be achieved. By identifying these critical obstacles and proposing strategic solutions, we aim to pave the way for the continued advancement and adoption of nanomaterial-integrated CRISPR/Cas optical biosensing technologies.

40202269	Large Hyperfine Coupling Arising from Pseudo-<sup>2</sup>S Ground States in a Series of Lutetium(II) Metallocene Complexes.	The synthesis of molecules with strong coupling between electronic and nuclear spins represents an important challenge in molecular quantum information science. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of the divalent lutetium metallocene complexes Lu(Cp<sup>Me<sub>5</sub></sup>)(Cp<sup><i>i</i>Pr<sub>5</sub></sup>) (Cp<sup>Me<sub>5</sub></sup> = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; Cp<sup><i>i</i>Pr<sub>5</sub></sup> = pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyl), Lu(Cp<sup><i>i</i>Pr<sub>4</sub></sup><sup>Et</sup>)<sub>2</sub> (Cp<sup><i>i</i>Pr<sub>4</sub></sup><sup>Et</sup> = ethyltetraisopropylcyclopentadienyl), and Lu(Cp<sup><i>i</i>Pr</sup><sup><sub>4</sub></sup>)<sub>2</sub> (Cp<sup><i>i</i>Pr<sub>4</sub></sup> = tetraisopropylcyclopentadienyl). The molecular structures of these complexes, as determined through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, feature a common bent sandwich geometry, with average Cp-Lu-Cp angles ranging from 159.9° to 152.6°. Analysis of continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra for the complexes reveals nearly isotropic <i>g</i> tensors with only a slight deviation from that of a free electron. Moreover, an extremely large splitting of the eight-line spectra indicates the presence of strong hyperfine coupling, and simulations provide isotropic hyperfine coupling constants of <i>A</i><sub>iso</sub> = 4.38, 4.30, and 4.17 GHz across the series, where the value of <i>A</i><sub>iso</sub> is found to decrease as the Cp-Lu-Cp angle becomes more acute. Notably, these values are the largest yet observed for any lanthanide complex. Moreover, EPR and computational analysis show that the large values of <i>A</i><sub>iso</sub> stem from large s-orbital character─up to 41.2%─in the corresponding singly occupied molecular orbitals. To our knowledge, this degree of s-character in a molecular orbital is the largest yet reported for an open-shell isolable complex. These results outline a general strategy toward the isolation of paramagnetic molecules with strong hyperfine coupling and highly isotropic doublet electronic ground states.
40202266	Beyond Correlation: Establishing Causality in Protein Corona Formation for Nanomedicine.	In contemporary studies on the role of the protein corona in specific biological applications, identifying <i>correlation</i> is widely used to draw conclusions from observations and statistical methods, yet it merely identifies associations without establishing a direct influence between variables. This over reliance on observation can lead to spurious connections where co-occurrence does not imply causation. In contrast, a <i>causality</i>-focused approach asserts the direct impact of one variable on another, offering a more robust framework for inference and the drawing of scientific conclusions. This approach allows researchers to better predict how changes in a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties or biological conditions will affect protein corona composition and decoration, in turn affecting their safety and therapeutic/diagnostic efficacies. As a proof of concept, we explore the concept of "actual causality" (introduced by Halpern and Pearl) to mathematically prove how spiking small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on identical nanoparticles. This approach significantly enhances the depth of plasma proteome profiling. Our findings reveal that among the various spiked small molecules, phosphatidylcholine was the actual cause of the observed increase in the proteomic depth of the plasma sample. By considering the concept of causality in the field of protein coronas, the nanomedicine community can substantially improve the ability to design safer and more efficient nanoparticles for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

40202261	<i>In Situ</i> Generated Ti<sup>3+</sup> over Ag/TiO<sub>2</sub> Enables Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane in Flow Reactors.	Photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a promising sustainable technology for chemical and fuel synthesis, but current photocatalysts suffer from limited activity and selectivity. Here, we report a highly active Ag/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst for OCM in a flow reactor, achieving a C<sub>2</sub> hydrocarbon production rate of 1.9 mmol g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> and selectivity of up to 92% with enhanced stability exceeding 150 h. This performance surpasses that of most reported semiconductor-based photocatalysts. The enhanced performance is attributed to a synergistic effect between <i>in situ</i> photogenerated Ti<sup>3+</sup> and Ag on TiO<sub>2</sub>, where Ti<sup>3+</sup> acts as a hole trap promoting hole transfer and C-H activation, and Ag serves as an electron acceptor and catalytic center to accelerate electron transfer and C-C coupling. These findings not only provide valuable mechanistic insights into photocatalytic OCM but also demonstrate the utility of <i>in situ</i>/operando techniques for establishing the structure-activity relation of catalysts "at work".
40202260	Programmable Metamaterials with Perforated Shell Group Supporting Versatile Information Processing.	Mechanical metamaterials have emerged as promising tools for enabling mechanical intelligence in soft machines through interaction with the external environment. Note that most representative results in the literature focused on certain features of information processing with the designs of novel metamaterials. It remains challenging to design metamaterials with more integrated information processing capabilities toward comprehensive intelligence. In this work, a novel approach employing programmable multi-stability of perforated shells (PS) with staggered trapezoidal voids is proposed to develop transformable, information-processing metamaterials with high-density information. Multi-layer information storage, encoding, decoding, and reading are achieved by designing and arranging different types of PSs under mechanical compression or magnetic actuation. In addition, various application-oriented functionalities, such as information encryption, mechanical computing, wave amplification, and pressure transmission, are also demonstrated by taking advantage of the stable memory and tunable stiffness distributions of metamaterials. The proposed design strategy paves the way for multifunctional, miniaturized, and scalable information mechanical metamaterials, with significant potential for soft-material-based intelligent devices.

40202258	Cross-cultural adaptation, validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Cognitive Functioning Self-Assessment Scale (CFSS).	The Cognitive Functioning Self-Assessment Scale (CFSS) is a scale that enables individuals to assess their subjective cognitive performance. The study aimed to cross-culturally adapt the CFSS to Turkish (CFSS-TR) and prove its psychometric properties. The study included 180 community-dwelling adults over 18 years of age with no psychological or neurological disorders. Participants were assessed using the CFSS-TR, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) via online survey. Two weeks later, the CFSS-TR was taken from the participants for the second time. The mean age of the individuals was 41.06 ± 13.34 years. The CFSS-TR had good test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.84, CI 95%: 0.78-0.88) and good internal consistency (α = 0.88). The standard error of measurement (SEM) and the 95% confidence interval minimal detectable change (MDC95) values for the total score were 0.11 and 0.30, respectively. CFSS-TR had a strong correlation with CFQ, moderate correlation with HADS depression subscore, and weak correlation with HADS anxiety subscore (respectively r = 0.71, r = 0.52, r = 0.39, p < 0.001). CFSS-TR is a reliable and valid questionnaire for self-assessment of cognitive function in Turkish-speaking community-dwelling adults.
40202257	Urban effects on timing and variability of diel activity differ across passerine species and seasons.	Life on Earth is adapted to rhythmic cycles in environmental conditions throughout the day and year via diel patterns of behavioural activity. Urban conditions can disrupt such behavioural rhythms of activity. However, most studies so far have investigated urban effects on patterns of activity of single species in a single season. Additionally, we know little about the level of between- and within-individual variation in urban and non-urban populations, and whether they differ. Here, we use automated radio telemetry to record patterns of daily activity in six passerine species (blackbird, robin, great tit, blue tit, dunnock and chaffinch) across two urban and two forest populations during the pre-breeding and post-breeding seasons. We investigate urban effects on five activity-related traits: time of activity onset, time of activity end, duration of diurnal activity, level of diurnal activity and level of nocturnal activity. We employ statistical tools that allow us to estimate urban effects on mean phenotypic values but also quantify urban versus forest differences in between-individual and within-individual phenotypic variation. We found the strongest urban effects on time of activity onset in blackbirds and robins during both the pre- and post-breeding seasons: urban populations of blackbird and robin started their daily activity earlier than their forest counterparts. We did not find this effect in the other species. Urban populations of all species showed higher levels of nocturnal activity than forest populations, but this effect was not offset by lower diurnal activity, suggesting that urban birds may incur higher daily energetic demands. Lastly, our analysis revealed large and consistent differences in variation in the investigated timing traits. Onset and end of daily activity were more variable in urban birds between individuals, implying lower population synchronisation, and more variable within individuals, implying less consistent behaviour, than in their forest counterparts. Conversely, activity levels were more variable in forest birds. We conclude that, for birds, urban life is associated with less rest, less consistency and lower synchronicity, but that effect sizes depend on species and time of the year. Our results warn against generalising the effects of urbanisation on daily rhythms of birds and call for future studies to understand the mechanisms behind species and seasonal differences.
40202256	HPLC-DAD and HPLC-ELSD Profiling of Various Parts of Selected Ficus Species.	Due to the scarcity of chemical data related to some Ficus species, forty-three ethanolic extracts were obtained from various parts of twelve Ficus species encompassing understudied ones. Thus, these were analyzed by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-ELSD to explore their phytochemical profiles. Overall, most of the extracts contain predominantly compounds lacking chromophore visible only in HPLC-ELSD chromatograms. However, HPLC-DAD analyses revealed furanocoumarins psoralen and bergapten to be dominant in extracts of all parts of F. carica and F. pumila, together with the extract of the leaves of F. cyathistipula. Some extracts (e.g., those from F. microcarpa and F. lyrata) displayed only peaks corresponding to chlorogenic acid and its derivatives. Remarkably, the extract of the roots of F. cyathistipula is rich in prenylated isoflavones. This study brings an overview of dominant compounds present in selected Ficus species and points out huge differences in their phytochemical profiles.
40202255	Photo-crosslinkable organic materials for flexible and stretchable electronics.	As technology advances to enhance human perceptual experiences of the surrounding environment, significant research on stretchable electronics is actively progressing, spanning from the synthesis of materials to their applications in fully integrated devices. A critical challenge lies in developing materials that can maintain their electrical properties under substantial stretching. Photo-crosslinkable organic materials have emerged as a promising solution due to their ability to be precisely modified with light to achieve desired properties, such as enhanced durability, stable conductivity, and micropatterning. This review examines recent research on photo-crosslinkable organic materials, focusing on their components and integration within stretchable electronic devices. We explore the essential characteristics required for each device component (insulators, semiconductors, and conductors) and explain how photo-crosslinking technology addresses these needs through its principles and implementation. Additionally, we discuss the integration and utilization of these components in real-world applications, including physical sensors, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), and organic solar cells (OSCs). Finally, we offer a concise perspective on the future directions and potential challenges in ongoing research on photo-crosslinkable organic materials.
40202253	Cutaneous manifestations of WHIM syndrome.	Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is a rare immunodeficiency caused by gain-of-function mutations in the chemokine receptor CXCR4. While human papillomavirus (HPV) skin infection (warts) is the dermatological hallmark of the disease, individuals with WHIM have high rates of other skin manifestations that may aid early diagnosis and management. This study was a retrospective review of medical records from a United States National Institutes of Health natural history cohort of patients with WHIM syndrome seen between 2005 and 2024, including a cross-sectional analysis of cutaneous manifestations and CXCR4 variants. The cohort compromised 45 patients with genetically confirmed WHIM syndrome, 16 men and 29 women, with a mean age of 33.3 years (range, 0-69 years) and mean age at diagnosis of 20.4 years (range, 0-59 years). The cohort exhibited a range of skin manifestations which included cutaneous infections with HPV in 34 (76%) patients, bacteria in 32 (71%) patients, other viruses in 27 (60%) patients, and fungi in 25 (56%) patients. Inflammatory conditions included six (13%) patients with seborrheic dermatitis, five (11%) with contact dermatitis, four (9%) with psoriasis, three (7%) with nummular eczema, and 13 (29%) with other eczematous dermatitis. Despite the young median age, seven (16%) patients had skin cancer. All seven patients had CXCR4 truncation mutations, while those with a missense mutation (E343K) generally had fewer skin manifestations. Our study found that WHIM syndrome is associated with diverse infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic skin conditions beyond HPV skin infection.

40202250	Ricochet of 9-mm luger bullets off plywood, medium-density fiberboard, and melamine board: An empirical investigation in aid of shooting reconstruction.	Ricochet is the glancing rebound of fired bullets from surfaces and is regularly reported during shooting incidents worldwide. Although existing scientific literature presents many ricochet-related empirical works in aid of shooting incident reconstructions, studies focusing on commonly used bullets ricocheting off modern target surfaces found in contemporary urban environments are still limited and continuously in demand. This empirical-based ricochet study presents exciting findings about the ricochet behavior of 9-mm luger bullets with the three most popular engineered wood types present in modern society: plywood, melamine, and medium-density fiberboard (MDF). To evaluate the ricochet behavior and impact evidence, two different mounted firearms, each discharging 9-mm luger bullets, were used to fire at engineered wood targets held at low angles to the impacting bullets. This study reports the first documented observation of a strong statistical relationship between the angles of incidence and ricochet during 9-mm luger bullet ricochet on plywood, melamine, and MDF. Evidence is also provided of a relationship between a bullet's angle of incidence and its corresponding ricochet marks on tested wood targets, not previously highlighted in wood-based bullet ricochet studies, and the critical angles reported for these engineered wood types ranged between 14 and 18 degrees. Additionally, the first observation of "wood spalling" during a ricochet event is presented, offering important insight into the process of bullets ricocheting off layered structures and being of great forensic significance for future scene reconstructions.
40202249	Photocatalytic reductive incorporation of carbon dioxide into double bonds.	Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a challenging molecule to incorporate into olefins due to its inherent inert properties. Silanes have now been shown to rapidly react selectively with CO<sub>2</sub>, catalysed by the presence of a caesium base, to form formate salts which can undergo a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to give the desired CO<sub>2</sub>˙<sup>-</sup> adducts in the presence of activated olefins.

An acanthosphere-like PtRuRhPdAuIr high-entropy alloy (HEA) was fabricated for the first time by the electrochemical method in a deep eutectic solvent. Owing to the HEA structure characteristics and the synergistic effect of multimetallic sites, the as-synthesized acanthosphere-like PtRuRhPdAuIr HEA exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.

The osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap (OCRFFF) is used for the reconstruction of bony head and neck defects. Being a weight-bearing bone, precise harvesting of the radius is required to maintain structural integrity, postoperative forearm function, and to prevent postoperative fracture. A radius cutting guide may allow head and neck surgeons to be more precise and confident in performing bony harvest, and may improve allocation of orthopedic specialist resources.
40202246	An ultrathin all-dielectric terahertz metamaterial with quasi-BIC induced angular dispersion.	One typical characteristic of conventional all-dielectric terahertz metamaterials is their thickness, which is designed to be dozens of, or even one hundred microns, to reduce the leakage of the resonant field to the substrate. In the frequency range of 2 THz to 3 THz, we propose a substrate-free ultra-thin all-dielectric terahertz metamaterial (UATM) composed of a silicon (Si) dual-ellipse array and silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) supporting layer with thicknesses of 5 μm and 2 μm, respectively. The UATM exhibits quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC) modes related to the tilt angle and period parameters. Moreover, due to the strong electromagnetic field near the interfaces and large interaction area, the UATM exhibits a high refractive index sensitivity exceeding 1.00 THz per RIU. Furthermore, at oblique incident angles ranging from 0° to 25°, the resonant quality factor (Q-factor) of the UATM remains higher than 100, and the sensitivities to the incident angle are 22.53 and 26.17 GHz per degree with a linear range of 0.498 THz and 0.438 THz, respectively. These properties indicate the potential applications of the UATM in high sensitivity biochemical sensing and multifunctional narrowband filtering fields.
40202245	Current status and perspective of metal-free materials as catalysts in acetylene hydrochlorination: active site, dopant, and mechanism.	Acetylene hydrochlorination is one of the main catalytic routes for vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) production, in particular for coal-rich regions, with mercury or noble metal chlorides as conventional catalysts. In recent years, there is a fast-growing transition from metal-based catalysts to metal-free materials for acetylene hydrochlorination because of strict environmental regulation and strong motivation for sustainable development, and this trend is clearly exemplified in a series of studies on carbon, boron nitride, graphitic carbon nitride, and ionic liquids, which garnered significant interest as catalysts in acetylene hydrochlorination. In this review, the current status and development of these metal-free catalysts are summarized with a focus on the nature of active sites, doping effects, reaction mechanism, and optimization methods, in order to provide a timely account. For carbon materials, the essential role of nitrogen dopants in catalytic performance is elaborated and possible active nitrogen species are explored, and the dual dopant strategy is discussed in the frame of synergetic effects which could further boost the activity and stability. For the other metal-free materials, they exhibited a different pattern regarding reactant adsorption and reaction mechanism from the carbon catalysts, in particular a dual-site mechanism is found due to the balanced adsorption between HCl and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. For each metal-free material, a short discussion is provided at the end of the section to shed light on the unique property which uncovered the difference from not only conventional metal catalysts but also the other metal-free materials. In the end, the key issues preventing the further improvements of metal-free catalysts and the practical way to replace metal catalysts are discussed. Overall, the current work paves the way for the future development of metal-free catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination.

40202243	A Versatile High-Throughput Single-Cell Screening Platform for Profiling Antigen-Specific Long-Lived B Cells in Blood and Bone Marrow.	Antigen-specific B cells play a crucial role in the long-term immune response following infection or vaccination, differentiating into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and memory B cells (MBCs). However, profiling ASCs is challenging primarily due to their lack of membrane-bound surface B cell receptors. In this study, the Modular Superhydrophobic Microwell Array Chip (MoSMAR-chip) is introduced as a versatile, cost-effective, and high-throughput platform for identifying and characterizing individual antigen-specific ASCs and MBCs at the single-cell level within seven days. Using this platform, comprehensive analyses of single ASCs could be performed from bone marrows of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-immunized mice and a diverse set of antibodies capable of neutralizing the highly divergent JN1 variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified. These results demonstrate that the MoSMAR-chip facilitates efficient single-cell multi-omics and functional analyses of antigen-specific ASCs, offering a powerful tool for investigating complex long-term B cell immunity in diverse clinical conditions, such as infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and beyond.
40202242	Effects of climate change and El Niño anomalies on historical declines, extinctions, and disease emergence in Brazilian amphibians.	Amphibian declines, linked to climate change and disease, pose a global challenge, yet their primary drivers remain debated. We investigated the historical decline of Brazilian amphibians by assessing the influence of climate change, extreme weather events, and the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Our analysis encompassed 90 amphibian species over more than a century (1900-2014). We integrated historical climate data-including El Niño anomalies and Southern Hemisphere temperature records-with documented extreme weather events and amphibian population trends. We used Granger causality tests to assess the potential of various factors to forecast anuran population declines and extinctions in Brazil and structural equation models to evaluate the relationships between the variables of interest. We identified gradual climate change and extreme weather events, particularly El Niño-driven temperature anomalies, as the primary drivers of amphibian population declines in Brazil. The structural equation models supported these findings and showed that climate-driven stressors significantly contribute to population crashes and increase Bd infections. However, Bd infections peaked years after population declines, suggesting that the fungus acts as an opportunistic pathogen rather than a primary driver of amphibian losses in Brazil. These findings challenge the prevailing view that Bd is the main cause of declines, instead highlighting climate anomalies and extreme weather events as the predominant factors.
40202241	Cancer Nanovaccines: Mechanisms, Design Principles, and Clinical Translation.	Cancer immunotherapy has transformed the landscape of oncological treatment by employing various strategies to teach the immune system to eliminate tumors. Among these, cancer nanovaccines are an emerging strategy that utilizes nanotechnology to enhance immune activation in response to tumor antigens. This review addresses the principles behind the different technologies in this field aimed at generating a robust and effective immune response. The diversity of strategies adopted for the design of nanovaccines is discussed, including the types of active agents, nanocarriers, their functionalizations, and the incorporation of adjuvants. Furthermore, strategies to optimize nanoparticle formulations to enhance the antigen presentation, target immune cells, and organs and promote strong and durable antitumor responses are explored. Finally, we analyze the current state of clinical application, highlighting ongoing clinical trials and the future potential of cancer nanovaccines. The insights presented in this review aim to guide future research and development efforts in the field, contributing to the advancement of more effective and targeted nanovaccines in the fight against cancer.

Herein, palladium-catalyzed enantioselective cyanation is achieved via a ring-opening/cross-coupling process between aryl halide-tethered cyclobutanones and Zn(CN)<sub>2</sub>. This reaction is demonstrated to exhibit broad substrate scope and robust enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility is highlighted by converting the product into amide, carboxylic acid, and ester without racemization.

40202237	Development of magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction of Cd(II) ions from dairy products using an Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@ZIF-8@IIP nanocomposite sorbent.	Based on dispersive micro solid phase extraction, a magnetic ion imprinted polymer-metal organic framework (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@ZIF-8@IIP) nanocomposite was prepared in this work as a selective and effective sorbent to extract and preconcentrate cadmium(II) ions in dairy samples. An effective extraction process was made possible by the magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles, metal-organic framework's large specific surface area, and ion imprinted polymer's selectivity toward Cd(II) ions. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the produced sorbent. Effective optimization factors were examined and optimized, including the volume and type of desorption solvent, the type and duration of stirring, the pH of solution, and the quantity of the sorbent. The limits of detection and quantification under optimal extraction conditions were 0.09 and 0.30 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The linear range, which was 0.30-100 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, had a coefficient of determination of 0.9927. A satisfactory match was observed in the data collected after testing a certified reference material (NIST SRM 1549 powder milk) to verify the established procedure. When Cd(II) ions were determined at 10 μg L<sup>-1</sup> (<i>n</i> = 5), the approach produced relative standard deviation values of ≤3.1%. The developed technique was effectively used to determine Cd(II) ions concentration in several dairy products.
40202235	Controllable Reconstruction of β-Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> Composite for Highly Efficient and Durable Electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> Conversion.	The uncontrollable electrochemical reduction reconstruction, leading to the destruction of well-defined structure and subsequent low durability, is the main obstacle to the catalytic performance of Bi-based composites toward electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (eCO<sub>2</sub>RR). Herein, we address this issue through construction of a novel β-Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> composite, which can resist the reduction reconstruction of Bi-based materials to metallic Bi during the eCO<sub>2</sub>RR process by modulating a more alkaline microenvironment that facilitates the formation of new Bi-O bonds. The synergistic interactions and directional electron transfer between the β-Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> components, together with the stable composite structure, result in its superior activity and selectivity for formate production with high faradaic efficiencies (FEs) over 94% from -0.7 to -1.1 V, and remarkable durability with maintenance of 80% FE after continuous electrocatalysis of 720 h. This work sheds new light on designing advanced high-performance nanomaterials toward eCO<sub>2</sub>RR and other practical applications.

As the United States (U.S.) population continues to age, we need to promote a renewed perspective on oral health, helping policy makers understand the impact of poor oral health on older adults with chronic conditions. In this article we describe the issue of lack of oral health education in medical school curricula, the differences in dental school programs, and a brief history of Oral maxillofacial surgery DMD/MD programs in the U.S. In addition to an education focusing on technical skills, dental education should also address scientific, social, and health-related competencies. Not only should the lack of integration of oral health topics in medical curricula be addressed, we should also train future dental professionals on the systemic effects of oral conditions.

Reported herein is a novel ruthenium(II)-catalyzed [4 + 2] annulation of quinazolinones with 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), resulting in a myriad of isoquinolino[1,2-<i>b</i>]quinazolinone scaffolds. In this protocol, DCE serves not only as a solvent but also as an acetylene source. The fused quinazolinones undergo versatile transformations and provide a rapid and convenient way to access several important bioactive molecule analogues such as Rutecarpine, Euxylophoricine B and Euxylophoricine E. The potential reaction pathway was elucidated through detailed mechanistic studies and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
40202224	A 3D-To-2D Phase Transition Mediated by Argentophilic Bond Rearrangements in a Coordination Polymer.	When subjected to pressure, most materials typically either maintain their three-dimensional (3D) structure or undergo a transformation into high-dimensional configurations due to compacted spaces and shortened bond distances. Specifically, the formation of metallophilic interactions enhances the potential for increased structural dimensionality. In this study, we present a heterobimetallic coordination polymer, [Cu<sub>2</sub>(pa)<sub>2</sub>][Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O (pa = deprotonated propanolamine). The ambient pressure phase exhibits a 3D structure consisting of binuclear alkoxo-bridged nodes [Cu<sub>2</sub>(pa)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and linear [Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>-</sup> spacers, and Ag···Ag interactions exist as ligand-supported one-dimensional (1D) zigzag chains. Increasing the hydrostatic pressure to ∼3.55 GPa induces a first-order phase transformation to phase II, which features a two-dimensional (2D) pillared-like structure. In phase II, the argentophilic interactions undergo substantial reconstructions, resulting in the establishment of discrete silver-silver dimers and rendering the structure ligand-unsupported. Furthermore, the unprecedented structural transformation from 3D to 2D in this compound is accompanied by a color change, which coincides with the collapse of the energy band gap. This study proposes a new strategy for reducing structural dimensionality by utilizing pressure as a means to modify the connectivity modes of argentophilic interactions in coordination supramolecular systems.

Utilizing [14]dehydrobenzoannulene as an electron acceptor, four twisted donor-acceptor architectures were divergently synthesized. Intriguingly, the antiaromatic diazocine core could interrupt electron transfer in the π-frameworks. Benefiting from the junction of dehydrobenzoannulene and carbazoles, all displayed stunning fluorescence and electrochemiluminescence. Anomalously, blue-shifted fluorescence was observed in the electron-donating-group-substituted homologues. Finally, a molecular carbon-based sensor for dopamine detection was constructed. This work provides new insights into the construction and application of molecular carbons.

40202218	Solvation energies from atomic surface site interaction points.	The surface site interaction model for liquids at equilibrium (SSIMPLE) is a method for calculating thermodynamic properties in a fluid phase based on the use of surface site interaction points (SSIP) to represent all of the non-covalent interactions that molecules make with the environment. Interactions between the SSIPs of two different molecules are governed by a non-polar term and a polar term. Here the formulation originally made for room temperature liquids is generalized to any temperature. We show that the non-polar interaction term is temperature independent while the polar interaction term depends on temperature. This formulation was used to develop a description of the temperature dependence of fluid phase density in terms of an expansion energy, which is based on net intermolecular SSIP interactions. The method is shown to accurately model the temperature dependence of experimentally measured association constants for the formation of 1 : 1 H-bonded complexes in carbon tetrachloride. The atomic interaction point (AIP) version of the SSIP descripiton of 171 different compounds was used in SSIMPLE to calculate room temperature liquid densities that are in good agreement with experimental data. Since non-covalent interactions in the vapour phase can be treated in the same way as liquid phase interactions, SSIMPLE can also be used to calcuate vapour-liquid equilibria (VLE). Experimental VLE data for 196 binary mixtures of 30 miscible compounds was collected, and SSIMPLE was shown to reproduce the experimental behaviour well.
40202217	Retained Oxygen Regulation in Oxide-Derived Copper for Promoted CO2 Electroreduction towards Multi-Carbon Products.	Electrochemical CO2 reduction to multi-carbon products provides an attractive route to store intermittent renewable electricity as high value-added chemicals. Oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) has been widely investigated for its tunable selectivity towards multi-carbon (C2+) products; however, it still remains a challenge to understand and regulate the retained oxygen of OD-Cu in the complex reconstruction process. In this work, we investigate thickness determined residual oxygen in OD-Cu, using CuO nanosheets as prototype precatalysts. When the thickness of CuO precatalyst decreased to 1.6 nm, the enhancement of the ability to retain oxygen are achieved, leading to selective C2+ production with Faradaic efficiency of around 80% over a wide current density range of 300-700 mA cm-2 with a peak value of 84.6% at 700 mA cm-2. Long-time molecular dynamics simulations reveal the enhanced stability of the Cu-CuO structure with the layers of removed oxygen increased, favoring *CHO formation and *OC-CHO coupling towards C2+ products; structural characterizations and electrochemical results further demonstrate the reconstructed stacked nanosheets with high oxygen retention capacity and easily re-oxidized metallic Cu sites. This work underscores the crucial role of the retained oxygen for the OD-Cu performance and provides insights into designing OD-Cu with oxygen retention to enhance C2+ products formation.
40202216	Postulations for the Migration Behavior of Amino Acids as Cations in Capillary Zone Electrophoresis.	Amino acids (AAs) in their cationic form at pH 2.2 and usual ionic strength show a non-intuitive migration order in CZE. This is explained by setting up four postulates. The central points in these postulates are the influence of the AA side chain on the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi> <msub><mi>K</mi> <mi>a</mi></msub> </mrow> <annotation>${\rm p}K_{\rm a}$</annotation></semantics> </math> value and the adoption of a defined, preferred conformation to build up the different <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi> <msub><mi>K</mi> <mi>a</mi></msub> </mrow> <annotation>${\rm p}K_{\rm a}$</annotation></semantics> </math> values. This conformation then also influences the hydrodynamic radius. The rotational orientation of an AA in the electric field aligns it, which also affects the hydrodynamic radius. Overall a special electrophoretical hydrodynamic radius is postulated and distinguished from the hydrodynamic radius, which is determined by the translational diffusion constant. With the help of the four postulates, the migration order could be explained. Glutamic acid has a special feature in this study: due to its observed higher mobility than the smaller and even higher charged aspartic acid, the hypothesis is that it would deprotonate first at the C5 and not at the C1 carboxylic group as all other AAs. This has the consequence of a more streamlined conformation and by that a faster migration in capillary electrophoresis.

40202211	Knowledge Distillation for Molecular Property Prediction: A Scalability Analysis.	Knowledge distillation (KD) is a powerful model compression technique that transfers knowledge from complex teacher models to compact student models, reducing computational costs while preserving predictive accuracy. This study investigated KD's efficacy in molecular property prediction across domain-specific and cross-domain tasks, leveraging state-of-the-art graph neural networks (SchNet, DimeNet++, and TensorNet). In the domain-specific setting, KD improved regression performance across diverse quantum mechanical properties in the QM9 dataset, with DimeNet++ student models achieving up to an 90% improvement in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics><msup><mi>R</mi> <mn>2</mn></msup> <annotation>$R^{2}$</annotation></semantics> </math> compared to non-KD baselines. Notably, in certain cases, smaller student models achieved comparable or even superior <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <semantics><msup><mi>R</mi> <mn>2</mn></msup> <annotation>$R^{2}$</annotation></semantics> </math> improvements while being 2× smaller, highlighting KD's ability to enhance efficiency without sacrificing predictive performance. Cross-domain evaluations further demonstrated KD's adaptability, where embeddings from QM9-trained teacher models enhanced predictions for ESOL (logS) and FreeSolv (ΔG<sub>hyd</sub>), with SchNet exhibiting the highest gains of ≈65% in logS predictions. Embedding analysis revealed substantial student-teacher alignment gains, with the relative shift in cosine similarity distribution peaks reaching up to 1.0 across student models. These findings highlighted KD as a robust strategy for enhancing molecular representation learning, with implications for cheminformatics, materials science, and drug discovery.
40202210	Upper Airway Obstruction Trends in Craniofacial Syndromes: A Comparative Study.	Craniosynostosis is a congenital disorder marked by the early fusion of one or more cranial sutures, potentially leading to functional impairments, including airway obstruction. This is particularly common in syndromic craniosynostosis, such as in Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Saethre-Chotzen, and Muenke syndromes, where midface hypoplasia and retrusion are often present. Airway obstruction, including obstructive sleep apnea, affects up to 68% of individuals with syndromic craniosynostosis. Understanding the severity and variability of airway compromise across these syndromes is critical for guiding interventions, such as Le Fort advancements. This study retrospectively reviewed preoperative computed tomography scans from patients diagnosed with Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Saethre-Chotzen, Muenke, and craniofrontonasal dysplasia syndromes. Key airway metrics, including nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal anteroposterior diameter, volume, and minimal cross-sectional area, were measured and compared across syndromes. The analysis also explored age-related changes in airway parameters to assess how obstruction evolves over time. Significant variability in airway obstruction was observed across the syndromes. Pfeiffer syndrome exhibited the most severe obstruction, with a 50% to 70% reduction in airway dimensions. Apert syndrome showed milder obstruction, with a 30% to 40% reduction in younger individuals, improving to 15% to 20% with age. Saethre-Chotzen and Muenke syndromes demonstrated the mildest obstruction, with reductions of 10% to 25%. These findings highlight the diverse severity of airway obstruction across craniosynostosis syndromes. Pfeiffer syndrome shows the most significant early childhood obstruction, while Saethre-Chotzen and Muenke syndromes experience milder airway compromise. Surgical interventions, like Le Fort advancements, are essential in managing severe cases, emphasizing the importance of individualized surgical and airway management strategies.
40202209	Interfacial molecular layer induced by trace chlorogenic acid for highly stable zinc anodes.	Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is investigated as an electrolyte additive to achieve superior stability for zinc anodes. This trace molecular additive not only alters the solvation structure but also forms an interfacial molecular layer that continuously protects the zinc anode during repeated cycles. As a result, this leads to an extended cycle life (5340 h) and high coulombic efficiency (99.76%) in (a)symmetric zinc cells, while also enhancing the performance of full cells.
40202208	Iron deficiency should not be accepted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease - a Scandinavian expert opinion.	In this paper, we aim to explain the reason why iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), how to better apply diagnostic tools to uncover the state of ID as well as how to interpret the results, and not least, how to treat ID in this group of patients.
40202207	Comprehensive review of morphological diagnosis of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma.	Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a rare hematological malignancy associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Accurate diagnosis and classification of ATL clinical subtypes rely on the identification of abnormal lymphocytes in peripheral blood smears. However, the diverse morphology of ATL cells and lack of standardized evaluation criteria worldwide can pose challenges.
40202206	Bright White Upconversion Luminescence under Low Excitation Power Density with Sensitive Temperature Monitoring.	Generating white luminescence at the nanoscale is highly desirable for applications in cell imaging and optical sensing, where nanoscale photon sources are essential. However, achieving efficient white upconversion luminescence (UCL) remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we propose a method to achieve ultrastrong white UCL by spatially separating Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Er<sup>3+</sup> and Yb<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> ion pairs into distinct layers within a core/multishell nanoparticle (NaYF<sub>4</sub>@NaYbF<sub>4</sub>:1.375%Tm@NaYF<sub>4</sub>@NaYbF<sub>4</sub>:20%Er@NaYF<sub>4</sub>, denoted as C-SSSS). The introduction of an inert NaYF<sub>4</sub> interlayer (second shell) is critical, as it controls energy transfer between Er<sup>3+</sup> and Tm<sup>3+</sup> ions and suppresses nonradiative cross-relaxation. Under 980 nm excitation, the C-SSSS nanoparticles exhibit white emission intensity 37.1 times greater than that of core-only nanoparticles (NaYbF<sub>4</sub>:0.5%Tm, 0.5%Er). Furthermore, optimizing the inert core size to 85 nm maximizes the effective excitation volume of the Yb-Tm-doped active layer, enabling precise control of luminescence intensity and strong white light emission. The C-SSSS nanoparticles also demonstrate exceptional thermal sensitivity, with a thermometry sensitivity 2.5 times higher than that of core-only nanoparticles, attributed to lattice distortion at the NaYF<sub>4</sub>@NaYbF<sub>4</sub> interface. This work highlights the dual functionality of ultrastrong white UCL and high-performance luminescent thermometry in a single-nanomaterial system.
40202205	Phenyl-Substituted Thiaboranes─Linked 2D and 3D Aromatics as Noncovalent Organic Framework Materials.	A series of 12-phenyl-<i>closo</i>-thiaboranes (12-(4-X-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)-<i>closo</i>-1-SB<sub>11</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, where X = OMe (<b>2</b>), X = SMe (<b>3</b>), X = Ph (<b>4</b>), and X = NMe<sub>2</sub> (<b>5</b>)) has been prepared. Except for <b>2</b>, all compounds exhibit a chalcogen bond of thiaborane to the phenyl ring or the neighboring molecule as major supramolecular structural motif. <b>5</b>, having the strongest (-12.47 kcal/mol) structure-making intermolecular interaction via noncovalent S···π(phenyl) chalcogen bond, was crystallized from different solvents in the form of various solvatopolymorphs. <i>n</i>-Hexane and diethyl ether can be removed from <b>5</b> easily upon the formation of a porous material with large cavities (up to 20.5% of the unit cell). This first stable and useful noncovalently bound organic framework material with an ultramicroporous structure exhibits a molecular sieve effect. The selective and repeatable adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> to the material crystallized from <i>n</i>-hexane was explained on the basis of cooperative and consecutive machine-like molecular interactions of quadrupolar CO<sub>2</sub> molecule with B-H and amino groups inside rectangular cavities.
40202204	Imaging the Velopharyngeal Sphincter in the Unrepaired Cleft Palate-Unopposed Musculus Uvulae Activity.	In this report, the authors examine the case of a 28-year-old woman with an unrepaired isolated cleft palate, detailing her clinical evaluation and subsequent surgical management. Comprehensive evaluations included perceptual speech assessments, along with simultaneous nasendoscopy and lateral videofluoroscopy, allowing for a detailed analysis of the musculus uvulae and compensatory pharyngeal changes. The authors' findings revealed the unopposed action of the musculus uvulae, which, along with tongue positioning and a prominent Passavant's ridge, contributed to a compensatory adaptation in the velopharyngeal area. Subsequent surgical interventions improved speech outcomes, demonstrating the value of a multidisciplinary approach in managing complex cases of unrepaired cleft palate.

40202199	Enzyme-Mediated Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry Enables Large-Scale Synthesis of δ-Cyclodextrin.	α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins (CDs) are macrocycles formed from six, seven, and eight α-1,4-linked d-glucopyranose units and are industrially produced on ton scales for use as hosts for bioactive guests in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Large-ring cyclodextrins, with more than eight glucose units, have been known for decades but never isolated in more than milligram quantities. We report a scalable method to synthesize δ-CD, formed from nine glucose units, in high yield (>40%), high purity (>95% purity without chromatography), and unprecedented quantities (multigram scale). We exploit a superchaotropic dodecaborate template, B<sub>12</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub><sup>2-</sup>, to direct the selective synthesis of δ-CD from within an enzyme-mediated dynamic combinatorial library of interconverting cyclodextrins. Our single-step reaction uses a recyclable template, cheap starting materials, and a commercial 'food-grade' enzyme and can thus give access to large quantities of δ-CD. This work will enable the first large-scale investigations of the properties and applications of this little-known larger CD.
40202198	Long-Term Exposure to Environmentally Realistic Doses of Starch-Based Microplastics Suggests Widespread Health Effects.	There is a growing consensus on addressing the global plastic pollution problem by advocating for bioplastics. While starch-based plastics are prevalent, the potential health implications of starch-based microplastics (SMPs) remain largely unexplored. This is particularly concerning given their potential for accidental ingestion and subsequent interference with blood glucose metabolism. Our research provides the first investigation into the distribution and adverse effects of long-term exposure to environmentally relevant doses of SMPs in female mice, approximately 14-81 particles per mouse per day. After three months of exposure, SMPs were found to infiltrate the liver, intestine, and ovarian tissues, causing microstructural lesions. Exposure to SMPs also resulted in elevated blood glucose levels, increased hepatic oxidative stress, and disrupted lipid metabolism. A multiomics analysis further uncovered abnormalities in gene expression and microbiota, as well as enriched pathways related to insulin regulation and circadian rhythms in the exposed mice. Our results indicate that prolonged exposure to environmentally relevant doses of SMPs can have widespread health effects in mice, potentially disrupting circadian rhythms by inducing insulin resistance. This suggests that the safety of bioplastics requires further evaluation before their large-scale application in food packages.
40202197	Social media listening study to understand the journey and unmet needs of patients living with post-stroke spasticity.	Stroke survivors may develop spasticity (post-stroke spasticity [PSS]) that can challenge activity and participation. Recognising the needs and expectations of people with PSS is crucial for enhancing care. This study is the first to employ social media listening to explore the experiences, unmet needs, and quality of life (QoL) of people with PSS.
40202196	The Impact of Follow-up Colonoscopy on Survival in a Fecal Immunochemical Test-Based Colorectal Cancer Screening Program: A Nationwide Study.	Various colorectal cancer screening programs are thought to be responsible for the decline in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in developed countries. Few recently published studies indicate that a lot of patients do not fully complete the pre-planned colorectal cancer screening. Currently, there is a lack of high-volume data examining patient compliance and its impact on the screening program results.
40202195	Dental anxiety and empathy among undergraduate oral health students in Norway, South Africa and Namibia.	Dental anxiety is a common type of fear that can complicate dental treatment. The dental practitioner is crucial in both treating dental fear and anxiety as well as prevent it from arising. The ability to feel empathy is important in that matter. The dental practitioner's own level of dental anxiety can possibly affect his or her ability to treat patients in an empathetic manner. The aim of this study was to assess and examine the relationship between level of empathy and dental anxiety in undergraduate oral healthcare students from Namibia, South Africa and Norway.
40202194	Optimization of Steroid Photochemistry and Its Application in the Synthesis of 5,6-dihydro-ophiopogonol A.	The photoreactivity of steroids represented a hot topic in the middle of the last century and in this project we "rediscover" it through the exploration of the photochemical behavior of D1-3-keto-steroids. In terms of number of products obtained, the photochemistry of D1-3-keto-steroids is less complicated than that of D4-3-keto- and D1,4-3-keto-steroids, furnishing an efficient and tuneable method to remodel the classic steroid 6/6/6/5 ring system. In this scenario, this approach can represent a simple strategy to interconvert a class of easily available steroids to another difficult to access from natural sources. As a proof of concept, the synthesis 5,6-dihydro-ophiopogonol A (11), a very closed analogue of natural ophiopogonol A (7), was accomplished in just four steps starting from easily available diosgenin (8).
40202190	Adverse predictive value of ASPM on lung adenocarcinoma overall survival depended on chemotherapy status.	Transcriptome and proteome analyses may yield inconsistent predictions regarding tumor prognosis. The clinical and pathological significance of ASPM expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. This study investigates the expression and prognostic value of ASPM, focusing on its role in chemotherapy outcomes.
40202188	Molecular Regulation and Intermolecular Chemistry in Gel Polymer Electrolytes for High-Voltage Lithium Batteries.	Gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) has garnered widespread attention in the field of lithium batteries because of its low interfacial impedance, high thermal stability, and flexibility. However, the high-voltage compatibility and Li<sup>+</sup> transport kinetics of GPE have yet to meet the requirements of future high-energy secondary battery systems. In this regard, a comprehensive and insightful review of high-voltage lithium batteries with GPE has attracted significant attention, focusing on molecular design and intermolecular interactions. Molecular regulation involves customizing the polymer matrix, solvent, additive, and Li salt, while intermolecular interactions encompass hydrogen bond interactions, Lewis acid-base interactions, electrostatic interactions, and π-π stacking interactions. Besides, strategies to enhance the stability of the cathode electrolyte interphase and Li<sup>+</sup> transport kinetics are summarized. It is hoped that this review will provide a deeper understanding of the direct regulation of GPE at the molecular level, further accelerating the commercialization of GPE in high-energy secondary lithium batteries.
40202187	Lexical and Information Structure Functions of Prosody and Their Relevance for Spoken Communication: Evidence from Psychometric and EEG Data.	Prosody not only distinguishes "lexical" meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, "focus" information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations-whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies-using psychometric and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350-550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600-900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.
40202186	Chemometrical assessment of adverse effects in lung cells induced by vehicle engine emissions.	Vehicle engine exhausts contain complex mixtures of gaseous and particulate pollutants, which are known to affect lung functions adversely. Many in vitro studies have shown that exposure to engine exhaust can induce oxidative stress in lung cells, leading to cellular inflammation and cytotoxicity. However, it remains challenging to identify key harmful components and their specific adverse effects via traditional toxicological assessments. Machine learning (ML) methods offer new ways of analyzing such complex datasets and have gained attention in predicting toxicity outcomes and identifying key pollutants in mixtures responsible for adverse effects in a non-biased way. This study aims to understand the contribution of exhaust components to lung cell toxicity using ML techniques. Data were reanalyzed from previous studies (2015-2018), where a 3D human epithelial airway tissue model was exposed to gasoline and diesel engine exhausts under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions with different fuels and exhaust after-treatment systems. This dataset included exhaust characteristics (particle number (PN), carbon monoxide (CO), total gaseous hydrocarbons (THC), and nitrogen oxides (NO<i>x</i>) levels) and corresponding biological responses (cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses). The relationships between pollutants and biological responses were explored using ML techniques, including hierarchical and nonhierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. The findings reveal both gaseous (CO, THC, and NO<i>x</i>) and particulate pollutants contribute to oxidative stress, inflammation, and cytotoxicity in lung cells, highlighting the significant role of each gaseous component. In addition, unmeasured factors beyond CO, THC, NO<i>x</i>, and PN likely contribute to biological effects, indicating the need for a more detailed characterization of exhaust parameters in ML analysis. By successfully integrating ML techniques, this study shows the potential of ML in identifying pollutant-specific contributions to cell toxicity. These insights can guide the analysis of complex exposure scenarios and inform regulatory measures and technical developments in emission control.
40202185	A comprehensive all-in-one CRISPR toolbox for large-scale screens in plants.	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) technologies facilitate routine genome engineering of one or a few genes at a time. However, large-scale CRISPR screens with guide RNA libraries remain challenging in plants. Here, we have developed a comprehensive all-in-one CRISPR toolbox for Cas9-based genome editing, cytosine base editing (CBE), adenine base editing (ABE), Cas12a-based genome editing and ABE, and CRISPR-Act3.0-based gene activation in both monocot and dicot plants. We evaluated all-in-one T-DNA expression vectors in rice (Oryza sativa, monocot) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, dicot) protoplasts, demonstrating their broad and reliable applicability. To showcase the applications of these vectors in CRISPR screens, we constructed single guide RNA (sgRNA) pools for testing in rice protoplasts, establishing a high-throughput approach to select high-activity sgRNAs. Additionally, we demonstrated the efficacy of sgRNA library screening for targeted mutagenesis of ACETOLACTATE SYNTHASE in rice, recovering novel candidate alleles for herbicide resistance. Furthermore, we carried out a CRISPR activation screen in Arabidopsis thaliana, rapidly identifying potent sgRNAs for FLOWERING LOCUS T activation that confer an early flowering phenotype. This toolbox contains 61 versatile all-in-one vectors encompassing nearly all commonly used CRISPR technologies. It will facilitate large-scale genetic screens for loss-of-function or gain-of-function studies, presenting numerous promising applications in plants.
40202184	Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An EEG Study.	A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.
40202183	Distribution of Troy (Tnfrsf19) in the Gastric Gland During Postnatal Development: Effects of Early Weaning.	This study investigates the distribution and role of the stem cell marker Troy (Tnfrsf19) in the gastric mucosa of rats during postnatal development and the effects of early weaning. Troy, previously identified as a reserve stem cell marker in adult gastric tissues, is examined across various developmental stages from birth to adulthood. We showed that Troy+ cells are scattered throughout the gastric gland in early postnatal stages, but they become concentrated in the basal portion of the gland as the rats mature. Additionally, early weaning affects Troy expression at its gene and protein levels, altering its distribution in the gastric mucosa. This suggests that early dietary changes may disrupt the organization and function of the secondary stem cell niche in the stomach, potentially impacting gastric gland homeostasis. We also used in silico analysis to compare the molecular functions of Troy+ zymogenic and parietal cells, finding distinct roles in proliferation and secretion. The results underscore the importance of Troy in gastric development and highlight the long-term impact of early weaning on gastric tissue organization and cell proliferation dynamics.
40202182	Oxidative rearrangements of the alkaloid intermediate geissoschizine.	Plants can generate structural diversity by enzymatic rearrangement of a central intermediate. 19E-geissoschizine is one such chemically versatile intermediate that plays a central role in the biosynthesis of monoterpene indole alkaloids such as strychnine, ibogaine and vinblastine. Here we report how 19E-geissoschizine undergoes oxidative transformations to generate four distinct alkaloid scaffolds through the action of three biosynthetic enzymes. Using in vitro enzymatic assays and gene silencing, we demonstrate how these three cytochrome P450 enzymes in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus transform 19E-geissoschizine into strychnos, sarpagan, akuammiline-type, and mavacurane-type alkaloids. We use mutational analysis to show how minimal changes to the active site of these similar enzymes modulate product specificity. This work highlights how substrate reactivity and enzyme mutations work synergistically to generate chemical diversity.
40202181	Development of bio-nano-herbicide using Eucalyptus citriodora essential oil against a notorious weed Echinochloa crus-galli.	Weeds are a menace in agriculture causing crop yield reductions to the tune of 40-50%. To overcome the problems of weeds, herbicides have been used excessively to the extent that they have caused resistance in weeds, in addition to the environmental hazards. Nano-herbicides are intended to exploit botanicals to develop novel bio-nano-herbicide formulations. Bio-nano herbicide was developed using Eucalyptus citriodora essential oil combined high-energy approaches such as ultra-sonication and high-pressure homogenization. The formulation has hydrodynamic and physical sizes of 95.5 and 32.3-57.7 nm, respectively. The product was tested for their pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicidal activity against Echinochloa crus-galli.
40202179	Non-Precious Metal Catalysts with Gradient Oxidative Dual Sites Boost Bimolecular Activation for Catalytic Oxidation Reactions.	Catalytic oxidation emerges as a highly promising and cost-effective approach for eliminating gaseous pollutants, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from industrial exhaust streams. However, achieving the simultaneous activation of O2 and substrate molecules at low temperatures using non-precious metal catalysts remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce gradient oxidative Cu-O-Ti/Cu-O-Cu dual sites that enhance bimolecular activation for catalytic oxidation reactions. The catalyst, Ti-doped CuO, is synthesized on a TiO2 support through the immobilization of Cu2+ on NO3--grafted TiO2, followed by thermal treatment. The resulting gradient oxidative Cu-O-Ti/Cu-O-Cu sites exhibit exceptional catalytic oxidation activity for NH3 and various VOCs at low temperatures, matching the performance of precious metal-based catalysts. Notably, during NH3 oxidation, Cu-O-Ti sites enhance the activation of both O2 and NH3. HNO intermediates formed on Cu-O-Ti sites react with NH intermediates on neighboring Cu-O-Cu sites - producing N2 and H2O via an imide mechanism - which effectively lowers the reaction barrier for catalytic NH3 oxidation. As such, dual sites in non-precious metal catalysts show promising results for advancing future catalytic oxidation technologies.
40202178	Computation of Protein-Ligand Binding Free Energies with a Quantum Mechanics-Based Mining Minima Algorithm.	A new method, protein-ligand QM-VM2 (PLQM-VM2), to calculate protein-ligand binding free energies by combining mining minima, a statistical mechanics end-point-based approach, with quantum mechanical potentials is presented. PLQM-VM2 is described in terms of a highly flexible workflow that is initiated from a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file and a chemical structure data file (SD file) containing two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) ligand series coordinates. The workflow utilizes the previously developed molecular mechanics (MM) implementation of the second-generation mining minima method, MM-VM2, to provide ensembles of protein, free ligand, and protein-ligand conformers, which are postprocessed at chosen levels of QM theory, via the quantum chemistry software package GAMESS, to correct MM-based conformer geometries and electronic energies. The corrected energies are used in the calculation of configuration integrals, which on summation over the conformer ensembles give QM-corrected chemical potentials and ultimately QM-corrected binding free energies. In this work, PLQM-VM2 is applied to three benchmark protein-ligand series: HIV-1 protease/38 ligands, c-Met/24 ligands, and TNKS2/27 ligands. QM corrections are carried out at the semiempirical third-order density functional tight-binding level of theory, augmented with dispersion and damping corrections (DFTB3-D3(BJ)H). Bulk solvation effects are accounted for with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (PCM). DFTB3-D3(BJ)H/PCM single-point energy-only and geometry optimization QM corrections are carried out in conjunction with two different models that address the large computational scaling associated with protein-sized molecular systems. One is a protein cutout model, whereby a set of protein atoms in and around the binding site are carved out, dangling bonds are capped with hydrogens, and only atoms directly in the protein binding site are mobile along with the ligand atoms. The other model is the Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) method, which includes the whole protein system but again only allows the binding site and ligand atoms to be mobile. All four of these methodological approaches to QM corrections provide significant improvement over MM-VM2 in terms of rank order and parametric linear correlation with experimentally determined binding affinities. Overall, FMO with geometry optimizations performed the best, but the much cheaper cutout single-point energy approach still provides a good level of accuracy. Furthermore, a clear result is that the PLQM-VM2 calculated binding free energies for the three diverse test systems in this work are, in contrast to those calculated using MM-VM2, directly comparable in energy scale. This suggests a basis for future development of a PLQM-VM2-based multiprotein screening capability to check for off-target activity of ligand series. Benchmark timings on a single compute node (32 CPU cores) for PLQM-VM2 calculation of the chemical potential of a protein-ligand complex range from ca. 30-45 min for the single-point energy approaches to ∼5 h for the cutout approach with geometry optimization and to ∼35 h for the full protein FMO approach with geometry optimization.
40202176	Multispectrum ModiFinder Site Localization Performance.	Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a powerful technique for structural identification of small molecules, yet a significant portion of MS/MS spectra from untargeted experiments remain unidentifiable through spectrum library matching. ModiFinder, a computational tool, tackles this issue by predicting the site of chemical modifications on known analogs of the unidentified compounds using MS/MS data. However, ModiFinder's performance is limited by insufficient peak data and fragmentation annotation ambiguities. In this study, we investigate how incorporating MS/MS spectra from multiple collision energies and mass spectrometry adducts can enhance ModiFinder's localization accuracy. Using a data set from Agilent Technologies comprising 2150 data-rich compounds (five times larger than previously available data sets), we evaluated the impact of complementary spectral information. Our results show that combining spectra from different adducts and collision energies expands ModiFinder's localization abilities to more compounds and improves the overall performance.
40202175	Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Alkenes via a Tandem Aldol/<i>N</i>-Acyloxyphthalimide-Assisted Decarboxylation Sequence.	We have developed a metal-free approach for synthesizing <i>E</i>-trifluoromethylated alkenes from readily available aldehydes and the <i>N</i>-hydroxyphtalimide ester of trifluoropropionic acid. To address the challenge of defluorination, we conducted high-throughput screening of reaction conditions. We discovered that acid-base co-catalysis effectively suppresses defluorination, thereby enhancing product yields. A key advantage of our method is its reliance on inexpensive, commercially available starting materials and straightforward reaction conditions.

40202173	Overlapping functions between <i>Lamp2a</i> and <i>Lamp2b</i> in cardiac autophagy.	LAMP2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein critical for autophagy. Alternative splicing gives rise to three isoforms. However, the roles of major LAMP2 isoforms in the heart are not known. To address this knowledge gap, we generated <i>lamp2a</i> and <i>lamp2b</i> knockout (KO) mice to investigate the role of these isoforms in heart function and autophagy. Deletion of either <i>Lamp2a</i> or <i>Lamp2b</i> did not alter cardiac structure or function. Lack of all LAMP2 isoforms led to increased cardiac fibrosis and reduced survival during pressure overload, which were not observed in <i>lamp2a</i> or <i>lamp2b</i> KO mice. Also, LAMP2B loss did not affect levels of the autophagy markers LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62. Conversely, LAMP2A was upregulated in hearts lacking LAMP2B, potentially preserving autophagy and cardiac function. Reintroducing LAMP2A in <i>lamp2</i> KO mice effectively reduced autophagosome accumulation and improved cardiac function. Overall, these data support LAMP2 isoform functional redundancy in the myocardium under pathological conditions.<b>Abbreviations</b>: AAV: adeno-associated virus; ACTA2: actin alpha 2, smooth muscle, aorta; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; KO: knockout; LAMP2: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2; LV: Left ventricle; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; NPPA: natriuretic peptide type A; NPPB: natriuretic peptide type B; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; TAC: transverse aortic constriction; WT: wild type.
40202172	A PD-L1/CD3 BISPECIFIC ANTIBODY ENHANCES THE ANTI-TUMOR EFFECTS OF REGORAFENIB AGAINST COLON CANCER.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The current standard of care for patients may involve surgery, chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but these approaches typically fail to secure durable responses against late-stage disease. Regorafenib (REG) is an FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor with immunomodulating properties for CRC patients who progress on standard care, but 5-year relative survival rates for individuals dosed with the drug as a monotherapy are poor. We hypothesize that REG may be more appropriately leveraged alongside immunotherapeutic agents that specifically stimulate T cell infiltration and activation within the tumor microenvironment (TME). We engineered a PD-L1/CD3 bispecific antibody (bsAb) that simultaneously binds PD-L1-expressing CRC cells and stimulates activated T cells in order to investigate combination strategies with REG in pre-clinical models of CRC. Combined REG + bsAb therapy safely initiated and sustained inhibition against MC38 and CT26 progression in vivo, and these effects correlated to improved CD8+ T cell infiltration and activity within a Type-1-prone TME. Additionally, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells from REG + bsAb-sensitized mice exhibited heightened tumor cell reactivity compared to animals treated with either agent alone. Therefore, the immunomodulatory benefits of REG can be effectively paired with a bsAb that anchors to CRC cells, diminishes immunosuppression (through PD-L1 blockade), and activates/sustains antigen-specific CD8+ T cells within the TME. Our newly described REG + bsAb regimen led to improved anti-tumor outcomes pre-clinically and may represent a promising future approach for CRC patients.

40202165	Gpa2 detects potato cyst nematode effector RBP-1 in the cytoplasm yet requires a nucleocytoplasmic balance for cell death.	The potato immune receptor Gpa2 confers host-specific resistance to the cyst nematode Globodera pallida. When transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana it triggers cell death upon recognition of the matching effector GpRBP-1. Effector-triggered immunity by Gpa2 depends on the host factor RanGAP2, which is known to regulate the nucleocytoplasmic distribution and functioning of the highly homologous potato immune receptor Rx1. However, the subcellular localisation of Gpa2 and the role of RanGAP2 in determining the subcellular localisation of Gpa2 is yet unknown. Moreover, cellular mechanisms underlying nematode effector detection by Gpa2 and subsequent cell death activation remain unknown. Here, we co-expressed Gpa2 fused to nuclear localisation signals and its matching effector GpRBP-1 as a model to address these questions. We show that both the nuclear and cytoplasmic pool of Gpa2 contribute to effector-triggered cell death which depends on complex formation with RanGAP2 as a cytoplasmic retention and stabilising factor. However, using nuclear and cytoplasmic targeting signals, we demonstrate that GpRBP-1 detection by Gpa2 occurs specifically in the cytoplasm. From these data, a picture emerges in which RanGAP2 retains Gpa2 in the cytoplasm to form a pre-activation complex, which aids in GpRBP-1 detection and the activation of immune responses in a compartment-specific manner.
40202163	Impact of Static Myoblast Loading on Protein Secretion Linked to Tenocyte Migration.	Exercise has been shown to promote wound healing, including tendon repair. Myokines released from the exercised muscles are believed to play a significant role in this process. In our previous study, we used an in vitro coculture and loading model to demonstrate that 2% static loading of myoblasts increased the migration and proliferation of cocultured tenocytes─two crucial aspects of wound healing. IGF-1, released from myoblasts in response to 2% static loading, was identified as a contributor to the increased proliferation. However, the factors responsible for the enhanced migration remained unknown. In the current study, we subjected myoblasts in single culture conditions to 2, 5, and 10% static loading and performed proteomic analysis of the cell supernatants. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that 2% static loading induced the secretion of NBL1, C5, and EFEMP1, which is associated with cell migration and motility. Further investigation by adding exogenous recombinant proteins to human tenocytes showed that NBL1 increased tenocyte migration but not proliferation. This effect was not observed with treatments using C5 and EFEMP1.
40202162	Participants in the FDA's Biomarker Qualification Program.	The US FDA's Biomarker Qualification Program (BQP) aims to validate biomarkers for use in the therapeutic development process. Applicants to this program are not restricted to just pharmaceutical firms and a variety of incentives may underlie applicants' decision to participate. Of the 80 biomarker qualification programs that were initiated through February 2025, we find that academic organizations (70.0%) are the most common applicants, followed by pharmaceuticals-related industries (55%), government entities (51.25%), and pharmaceutical firms (50%), although much of this activity is in the context of multi-party consortia. With respect to stage of development, all phase-I-related biomarkers are developed in some form of partnership, while academic institutions alone and foundations devote slightly more attention to trial endpoints as a total share of BQP activities. These findings shed light on the incentives at play and the types of stakeholders that have been active in the development of these tools to date.
40202161	Prospective Observational Study of Emergency Department Point-of-Care Ultrasound to Differentiate Between Complicated and Uncomplicated Appendicitis.	Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children. Prior radiology studies have described Puylaert staging on ultrasound to determine the severity of appendicitis. We investigated the feasibility and utility of assessing Puylaert staging on emergency department (ED) point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to differentiate uncomplicated from complicated appendicitis in children.
40202160	Human circulatory proteome interaction, oxidative stress-associated signalling and cardiovascular implications during titanium dioxide nanoparticle (TiO<sub>2</sub>-NP) exposure.	The increasing exposure to nanoparticles raises a concern over their toxicity. Incidentally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as a result of the nanoparticle's physicochemical characteristics and interactions with intracellular elements, primarily enzymes, leading to oxidative stress. In this context, the extent of oxidative stress resulting from the toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs) on the cardiovascular system has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Initially, the gel/label-free proteomics (nLC-HRMS/MS) method was used to examine human serum protein interaction and corona composition. Furthermore, different oxidative stress assays (superoxide, total ROS, mitochondrial ROS, and lipid peroxidation) and cell stress assays (apoptosis, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy, and hypertrophy) were performed in conjunction with endothelial (rat aortic cells) and cardiomyoblast (H9c2) cell cultures. In addition, expression studies (RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence), kinase signalling, and siRNA-mediated gene knockout (NOX2 and XO) studies were conducted. Alongside, in ovo effects on the heart's antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) and metabolomic pathways (1H NMR) confirmed the involvement of oxidative stress in cardiotoxicity. The present results demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity <i>via</i> the activation of caspase 3 and 9. The dose-dependent increase and its synergistic relationship with cardiovascular stress signalling (ET-1 and Ang-II) highlight the significant role of oxidative stress in nanoparticle toxicity. In summary, this study expands our understanding of the precise health risks associated with human exposure by establishing a connection between the role of the redox system and molecular stress pathways in TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs-induced cardiotoxicity.
40202159	Biomimetic Nanoparticles Enhance Recovery of Movement Disorders in Parkinson's Disease by Improving Microglial Mitochondrial Homeostasis and Suppressing Neuroinflammation.	Neuroinflammation is a key risk factor for cognitive impairment, and microglia are the main drivers. Metformin has been shown to suppress inflammation and reduce microglial activation, protecting neurons from damage. However, its clinical efficacy is limited by low bioavailability and metabolic challenges, especially in terms of precise delivery to specific targets. To overcome this problem, we developed biomimetic microglial nanoparticles (MePN@BM) to enhance the targeted delivery and bioavailability of metformin. Through homologous targeting, the delivery efficiency of drugs in the inflammatory site of Parkinson's disease was enhanced to improve the therapeutic effect. The results showed that MePN@BM effectively delivers metformin to the brain, promotes autophagy, restores mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduces oxidative stress. In a Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model, MePN@BM improved motor function, repaired dopaminergic neurons, and cleared α-synuclein aggregates. Notably, transcriptome analysis revealed enriched inflammation-related pathways, and immunofluorescence showed that PD mice treated with MePN@BM had higher levels of anti-inflammatory factors and lower levels of pro-inflammatory factors. Therefore, it provides a promising strategy for the treatment of inflammation-mediated motor dysfunction.
40202157	Development of 3D training models for the identification and classification of colorectal polyps.	Colorectal cancers develop from pre-malignant polyps that can be removed during colonoscopy. Detection, assessment, and removal of polyps has a major role in bowel cancer prevention and is an important part of bowel cancer screening programmes. Trainee colonoscopists must acquire skills to recognise and classify colorectal polyps. Accurate classification is based on morphology, surface pit and capillary patterns. It is difficult to teach assessment skills because static polyp images are often of poor quality and cannot show all areas of interest. Based on anonymised, endoscopic reference images, 3D polyp models were created in ZBrush, demonstrating a variety of morphological forms. The models had detailed pit patterns to show the capillary structure, a key predictor of pathology. The models were subsequently uploaded to the online 3D repository and model viewer, Sketchfab, to create an interactive training resource for trainee colonoscopists. The digital models were evaluated by a panel of expert colonoscopists who scored them for realism and potential as aids for training. There was agreement that the digital polyp models would be useful for teaching. Polyp morphology was rated as realistic however representation of pit patterns received a mixed response, highlighting areas for further development.
40202156	Clearance of Amlodipine, Fentanyl, Fluconazole, Methylprednisolone, and Midazolam by Continuous Renal Replacement Circuits.	Critically ill pediatric patients on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) have high mortality rates ranging from 30% to 70%, due in part to altered drug exposure from drug-CRRT circuit interactions. Drug loss within CRRT circuits can occur through both clearance by the hemofilter and adsorption to circuit components. Although these interactions are known to exist, their impact on the pharmacokinetics of most drugs is unknown, resulting in limited drug dosing guidance and increased risk for suboptimal drug exposure. In this study, we administered amlodipine, fentanyl, fluconazole, methylprednisolone, and midazolam individually and in combination with ex vivo, closed-loop, blood-primed CRRT circuits to quantify drug-circuit interactions. Circuits were dosed to drug-specific therapeutic concentrations, and drug concentrations in both plasma and effluent were measured over time. For all drugs administered individually, variable extraction by the CRRT circuit was observed (mean plasma recovery 0.4-49%). For drugs coadministered into a circuit, significant decreases in extraction and increases in drug recovery (2.5-109%) were found, suggesting dosing adjustments may be needed. This study highlights the need for additional studies of drug coadministration within CRRT circuits to describe complex drug-circuit and drug-drug interactions to provide dosing guidance in pediatric CRRT patients.

40202139	The Readability of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Patient Education Materials.	The National Institute of Health (NIH) recommends that healthcare education material be written at a 6th-7th grade reading level. There are yet to be studies that investigate the readability of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) educational materials. Educational materials published by Extracorporeal Life Support Organization's platinum, gold, and silver centers of excellence in the United States were included. Each material was analyzed for content related to ECMO. These topics were also input into Google and the top 20 results were included in this study. Readability was measured using the Measure of Gobbledygook Readability Formula (SMOG), Coleman-Liau index, and Flesch-Kincaid grade level (FKGL). The average reading level for the educational material from the platinum centers was 8.54 for SMOG, 11.38 for Coleman-Liau, and 9.44 for FKGL. The average reading level of the gold centers' material was 9.11 for SMOG, 11.62 for Coleman-Liau, and 10.21 for FKGL. The average reading level of the silver centers' material was 8.82 for SMOG, 11.61 for Coleman-Liau, and 11.53 for FKGL. The average reading level of the internet search results was 9.11 for SMOG, 10.92 for Coleman-Liau, and 9.77 for FKGL. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation education material had a readability level above the NIH's recommendation.

40202132	Analysis of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Morphology, Composition and Health Risk in a Multi-Chair Dental Clinic.	Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) at high concentrations in dental clinics poses significant health risks to healthcare professionals. However, the morphology and chemical composition of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in specific environments are not yet fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the concentration, morphology, chemical composition, and health assessment of PM<sub>2.5</sub> collected in a multi-chair dental clinic in Shanghai, China. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed to observe the morphology and elemental composition of indoor and outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Chemicals were measured for their concentrations using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF). In the dental clinic, the indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration ranged from 2.01 to 114.59 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, with a mean of 23.31 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, while the outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration ranged from 2.88 to 157.4 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, with a mean of 30.98 μg/m<sup>3</sup>. Indoor particles showed more rough, irregular mineralization, which was confirmed as the dominant elements of Ca, P, Si, and zirconia (Zr) by EDS. The average concentrations of Ca, P, Cu, Sr, and Sb indoors were lower than those outdoors (p < 0.05). We also found that Cd, As, and Ni exceeded the annual limits of the Ambient Air Quality Standards of WHO. For the health assessment, the carcinogenic risks of Cd, As, and Cr were higher than the minimum acceptable level (1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), with values of 3.68 × 10<sup>-5</sup>, 1.10 × 10,<sup>-5</sup> and 5.52 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, respectively, and the non-carcinogenic risk of Cd was the highest, as illustrated by the Hazard Quotient of 2.04. These findings indicate that dental healthcare professionals may be exposed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> containing high concentrations of toxic metals and carcinogenic elements over the long term. This study highlights the importance of protective measures (e.g., the adoption of efficient air purification systems) to minimize the risk of particle inhalation for both patients and professionals.
40202131	Numb provides a fail-safe mechanism for intestinal stem cell self-renewal in adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut.	Stem cell self-renewal often relies on asymmetric fate determination governed by niche signals and/or cell-intrinsic factors but how these regulatory mechanisms cooperate to promote asymmetric fate decision remains poorly understood. In adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut, asymmetric Notch (N) signaling inhibits intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal by promoting ISC differentiation into enteroblast (EB). We have previously shown that epithelium-derived Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) promotes ISC self-renewal by antagonizing N pathway activity (Tian and Jiang, 2014). Here, we show that loss of BMP signaling results in ectopic N pathway activity even when the N ligand Delta (Dl) is depleted, and that the N inhibitor Numb acts in parallel with BMP signaling to ensure a robust ISC self-renewal program. Although Numb is asymmetrically segregated in about 80% of dividing ISCs, its activity is largely dispensable for ISC fate determination under normal homeostasis. However, Numb becomes crucial for ISC self-renewal when BMP signaling is compromised. Whereas neither Mad RNA interference nor its hypomorphic mutation led to ISC loss, inactivation of Numb in these backgrounds resulted in stem cell loss due to precocious ISC-to-EB differentiation. Furthermore, we find that <i>numb</i> mutations resulted in stem cell loss during midgut regeneration in response to epithelial damage that causes fluctuation in BMP pathway activity, suggesting that the asymmetrical segregation of Numb into the future ISC may provide a fail-save mechanism for ISC self-renewal by offsetting BMP pathway fluctuation, which is important for ISC maintenance in regenerative guts.
40202129	Catch-to-Amplify Nanoparticles with Bacteria Surface for Sequential Mucosal Immune Activation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Therapy.	Mucosal-mediated immune deficiency is associated with immune evasion and poor clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we describe the elicitation of mucosal and systemic immune response by oral delivery of MDP-modified PEG-lipid (MDP-PEG-DSPE) and polylactic acid-polyhistidine (PLA-PHis) copolymer constructed nanosystem (mPOD) into Peyer's patches. To protect against gastrointestinal degradation, enteric-soluble capsules are utilized for encapsulating mPOD to promote penetration across intestinal mucus and engender robust Peyer's patch targeting initiated by MDP-PEG-DSPE. Compared with intravenous and intramuscular administration, the oral delivery of MDP-PEG-DSPE and 5'-triphosphate-modified RNA (ppp-RNA) into gut-associated lymphoid tissues reinforces dendritic cell maturation and migration, amplifies mucosal immune response, and boosts the production of secretory immunoglobulin A via retinoic acid-inducible gene I/nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (RIG-I/NOD2) signaling activation. In the AML murine model, the provoked mucosal immunity positively regulates the systemic cytotoxic immune reactions, which, in turn, eradicate disseminated malignant leukemic cells and provide defense against leukemia attacks.
40202128	Reversible transformations of sulfamethoxazole and its submoieties by manganese-oxidizing bacteria and biogenic manganese oxides in the presence of humic substances.	Manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB) and biogenic manganese oxides (BioMnOx) play key roles in the breakdown of organic matter (including pollutants) in water and soil environments. The degradation of some organic compounds (such as sulfonamides selected in this study) by BioMnOx in the presence of active MnOB is poorly understood. Thus far, it has been shown that the transformation of sulfonamides by either BioMnOx or MnOB (but thus far not studied in a binary system) can be modulated using naturally occurring redox mediators, such as humic substances, leading to the formation of coupling products of unknown stability. The co-occurrence of sulfonamides, MnOB, BioMnOx, and humic constituents is pertinent to many natural and engineered settings. This study used syringaldehyde, which is a model humic constituent, to investigate the nature of modulation in a binary system of BioMnOx and MnOB for the first time. The MnOB strain <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> MnB6 was cultivated and used in batch degradation tests. Initial tests with eight sulfonamides showed comparably poor degradation. In the next step of this study, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and two SMX submoieties (sulfanilamide (SNM) and 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole (ISX)) were examined. After 48-60 hours in active cultures with BioMnOx, the degradation of all the three substances was negligible. However, syringaldehyde increased the degradation efficiency by 26% for SMX, 58% for SNM, and 27% for ISX. The active culture and BioMnOx synergistically improved degradation, highlighting the importance of BioMnOx regeneration. Removal was partially reversible (10-30%) owing to the retransformation of the reaction products into parent compounds, which was induced by syringaldehyde depletion. Unstable reaction products were conjugates of SMX, SNM, and ISX with syringaldehyde or its oxidation product DMBQ (2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone). This deconjugation likely contributes to process reversibility, potentially negatively impacting the environment and the safety of water and wastewater treatment systems.
40202127	Isotope-Enriched Cubic Boron Arsenide with Ultrahigh Thermal Conductivity.	High thermal conductivity materials are critical for advanced thermal management applications. The semiconductor cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has drawn significant attention due to its ultrahigh thermal conductivity. In this study, high-quality isotope-enriched cubic boron arsenide (c-<sup>10</sup>BAs and c-<sup>11</sup>BAs) crystals are synthesized to further enhance the thermal conductivity of c-BAs and measured a room temperature thermal conductivity of 1500 W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> for the c-<sup>11</sup>BAs. This value is the highest thermal conductivity for isotope-enriched c-BAs reported so far. The experimental study, together with ab initio calculation, verifies the high quality with reproducibility of the crystals. The exceptionally high thermal conductivity of the isotope-enriched BAs, combined with their semiconductor properties, holds significant potential for improving thermal management in semiconductor devices and electronics packaging applications.

Large trials and meta-analyses in adults suggest a similar efficacy and safety of a single dose of peg-filgrastim compared with daily filgrastim in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. However, there is no large prospective data in the pediatric population. This trial was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of peg-filgrastim in children.
40202125	Engineering a ZnO/Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/Ag<sub>2</sub>O Ternary Heterojunction: Dual Z-Scheme Photocatalytic Pathway for Enhanced Pollutants Degradation.	As the widespread discharge of antibiotics, pesticides, and dyes exacerbates water pollution, the development of efficient photocatalytic materials has become crucial for addressing this challenge. In this study, a new paradigm of n-p-p ternary heterojunction photocatalyst composed of ZnO nanospindle, Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and Ag<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles was synthesized via a hydrothermal and coprecipitation method followed by calcination. By adjusting the calcination time, the phase transition from Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> to Ag<sub>2</sub>O was precisely controlled, leading to enhanced charge separation, transition, and improved light absorption properties. The prepared ZnO/Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/Ag<sub>2</sub>O (Z/AC/A) photocatalyst exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance for the degradation of typical water pollutants, including 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-D), tetracycline (TC), and malachite green (MG) under simulated sunlight irradiation. And the photocatalytic efficiencies reached 90.8, 94.8, and 97.4%, respectively, with the ZnO/Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/Ag<sub>2</sub>O photocatalyst, which was calcined at 195 °C for 12 min, abbreviated as Z/AC/A-3, demonstrating the highest activity. Radical scavenging experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) tests revealed that superoxide radicals (•O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) serve as the dominant active species, while holes (h<sup>+</sup>) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) play secondary roles in the photocatalytic process. Additionally, the photocatalytic degradation mechanism was confirmed to follow a dual Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, which effectively enhanced the charge separation and photocatalytic performance. The photocatalyst also exhibited excellent structural stability and reusability over five consecutive cycles. These results suggest that the Z/AC/A n-p-p ternary heterojunction holds promising potential for practical photocatalytic applications in environmental remediation.

40202123	Concentration-Dependent CsrA Regulation of the <i>uxuB</i> Transcript Leads to Development of a Post-Transcriptional Bandpass Filter.	Post-transcriptional control systems offer new avenues for designing synthetic circuits that provide reduced burden and fewer synthetic regulatory components compared to transcriptionally based tools. Herein, we repurpose a newly identified post-transcriptional interaction between the <i>uxuB</i> mRNA transcript, specifically the 5' UTR + 100 nucleotides of coding sequence (100 nt CDS), and the <i>E. coli</i> Carbon Storage Regulatory A (CsrA) protein to design a biological post-transcriptional bandpass filter. In this work, we characterize <i>the uxuB</i> mRNA as a heterogeneous target of CsrA, where the protein can both activate and repress <i>uxuB</i> activity depending on its intracellular concentration. We leverage this interaction to implement a novel strategy of regulation within the 5' UTR of an mRNA. Specifically, we report a hierarchical binding strategy that may be leveraged by CsrA within <i>uxuB</i> to produce a dose-dependent response in regulatory outcomes. In our semisynthetic circuit, the <i>uxuB</i> 5' UTR + 100 nt CDS sequence is used as a scaffold that is fused to a gene of interest, which allows the circuit to transition between ON/OFF states based on the concentration range of free natively expressed CsrA. Notably, this system exerts regulation comparable to previously developed transcriptional bandpass filters while reducing the number of synthetic circuit components and can be used in concert with additional post-transcriptionally controlled circuits to achieve complex multi-signal control. We anticipate that future characterization of native regulatory RNA-protein systems will enable the development of more complex RNP-based circuits for synthetic biology applications.

Double-blinded placebo-controlled trials have revealed the efficacy of mepolizumab and omalizumab in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). However, real-world efficacy (RWE) data, data on therapeutic response and level of disease control for both biologicals are lacking.
40202119	A Porphyrin Nanomaterial for Photoimmunotherapy for Treatment of Melanoma.	The incidence of melanoma, the third most common skin cancer, has been on the rise in recent years. In addition, it has a high mortality rate due to its high aggressiveness. Phototherapy, as a promising treatment method, can effectively kill tumor cells, but it is incapable of the treatment of tumor metastasis. Herein, a nanomaterial (TPC@OVA NPs) is developed for phototherapy in conjunction with immunotherapy against melanoma. TPC, as a derivative of porphyrin, is used as a photosensitizer with excellent biosafety and photostability. After assembly with ovalbumin (OVA), TPC@OVA NPs with vaccine properties is formed, which can not only ablate the primary tumor but also induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). In addition, DC cells can be stimulated to mature by exogenous OVA, enhancing the immune response against tumors by further activating T lymphocytes. Combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor aPD-1, the immune microenvironment is reshaped, and the increased activity of immunotherapy are validated. This work highlights the potential of combining phototherapy and immunotherapy against metastasis.

40202117	Fluorescent Cell Barcoding of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells for High-Throughput Assessment of Vaccine-Induced T Cell Responses in Low-Volume Research Samples.	T cell responses are rarely measured in large-scale human vaccine studies due to the sample volumes required, as well as the logistical, technical, and financial challenges associated with available assays. Fluorescent cell barcoding has been proposed in other contexts to allow for more high-throughput flow cytometry-based assays. Here, we aimed to expand on existing barcoding approaches to develop a reagent and sample-sparing assay for in-depth assessment of T cell responses to vaccine antigens. By using various concentrations of two fixable viability dyes in a matrix format, up to 25 samples that were pooled and acquired together could be successfully deconvoluted based on their unique fluorescent signature. This fluorescent cell barcoding approach was then combined with extracellular and intracellular staining to identify functional (i.e., producing at least one cytokine) and polyfunctional (i.e., producing multiple cytokines) T cells in response to vaccine antigen stimulation. As a proof-of-concept, we plated just 200,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) per condition, and by staining and acquiring only two pooled samples, we were able to detect rare antigen-specific T cell responses in eight donors to four stimulants each. The frequencies of antigen-induced cytokine-positive cells detected in barcoded samples with 200,000 input PBMC were strongly correlated with those detected in non-barcoded samples from the same donors with 1 million input PBMC, demonstrating the validity of this approach. In conclusion, by reducing the number of PBMC needed by five-fold, and the volume of staining reagents needed by 25-fold, this assay has widespread potential applications to human vaccine studies.

40202115	Ethylene-Activated E3 Ubiquitin Ligase MdEAEL1 Promotes Apple Fruit Softening by Facilitating the Dissociation of Transcriptional Repressor Complexes.	Fruit of most apple varieties soften after harvest, and although the hormone ethylene is known to induce softening, the associated pathway is not well resolved. In this study, it is determined that MdEAEL1 (Ethylene-activated E3 ubiquitin Like 1) is specifically expressed during apple fruit postharvest storage, activated by ethylene, and interacts with the transcription factor MdZFP3 (zinc finger protein3). MdZFP3 is found to rely on an EAR (ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression) motif to form a transcriptional repression complex with MdTPL4 (TOPLESS4)-MdHDA19 (histone deacetylase19), thereby downregulating the histone acetylation levels of the promoters of a range of cell wall degradation-related genes and inhibiting their transcription. MdEAEL1 ubiquitinates and degrades MdZFP3, leading to the disassembly of the MdZFP3-MdTPL4-MdHDA19 transcriptional repression complex. This process promotes the transcription of cell wall degradation-related genes, resulting in fruit softening during storage. Furthermore, the disassembly of the MdZFP3-MdTPL4-MdHDA19 transcriptional repression complex, mediated by MdEAEL1, upregulates the transcription of MdEAEL1 itself, creating a feedback loop that further promotes softening. This study elucidates the interplay between post-translational modifications of a transcription factor and its epigenetic modification to regulate fruit softening, and highlights the complexity of ethylene-induced softening.
40202112	Identification of RNAi efficiency-related gene in the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Hemiptera), based on comparative transcriptomics.	RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising strategy for aphid control; however, its practical application has been limited by low efficiency in aphids. To address this, we combined transcriptomic analysis with an 'RNAi of RNAi' approach to identify genes associated with RNAi efficiency in green peach aphid Myzus persicae.
40202111	Transfer of the Slip Plane in Lipid Bilayer Lubrication.	Lipid bilayers are commonly found in articular cartilage and cell membranes, playing a key role in biological lubrication, which is attributed to the hydration lubrication mechanism of the headgroups. In physiological environments, lipid bilayers inevitably interact with ions, but their exact effect on lubrication is currently unclear. Here, through molecular dynamics simulations, we discover an ion-induced slip plane transfer behavior. Ions weaken the hydration lubrication effect at the headgroup-headgroup interface between bilayers, forcing the slip plane to partially shift to the acyl tail-tail interface within the bilayer and increasing friction. However, the above behavior is not observed under high hydration levels. Extensive comparison and analysis show that the transfer of the slip plane is determined by the lubrication state of two types of interfaces, with sliding always occurring at the interface with a lower dissipation at the current moment. This maximizes lubrication efficiency while providing lubrication assurance, even under high load, low hydration, and ion influence, maintaining a good lubrication performance. Our results provide valuable insights into the efficient and robust lubrication of lipid bilayers.
40202110	Causal Analysis Between Gut Microbes, Aging Indicator, and Age-Related Disease, Involving the Discovery and Validation of Biomarkers.	The influence of gut microbes on aging has been reported in several studies, but the mediating pathways of gut microbiota, whether there is a causal relationship between the two, and biomarker screening and validation have not been fully discussed. In this study, Mendelian Randomization (MR) and Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) are used to systematically investigate the associations between gut microbiota, three aging indicators, and 14 age-related diseases. Additionally, this study integrates machine learning algorithms to explore the potential of MR and LDSC methods for biomarker screening. Gut microbiota is found to be a potential risk factor for 14 age-related diseases. The causal effects of gut microbiota on chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, and heart failure are partially mediated by aging indicators. Additionally, gut microbiota identified through MR and LDSC methods exhibit biomarker properties for disease prediction (average AUC = 0.731). These methods can serve as auxiliary tools for conventional biomarker screening, effectively enhancing the performance of disease models (average AUC increased from 0.808 to 0.832). This study provides evidence that supports the association between the gut microbiota and aging and highlights the potential of genetic correlation and causal relationship analysis in biomarker discovery. These findings may help to develop new approaches for healthy aging detection and intervention.
40202109	Adsorption of Mercury in Aqueous Solutions by Functionalized Cellulose Extracted from Soybean Hulls.	The presence of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in drinking water and the food chain is a well-known hazard to human health. Among PTEs, mercury is particularly dangerous for humans and other living organisms due to its wider effects on internal organs. Hg contamination is a critical issue for water bodies used for aquaculture, making its elimination mandatory. Among the techniques proposed for Hg removal, adsorption is advantageous because of its versatility, absence of secondary pollution, and relatively low cost, especially when adsorbents can be obtained from waste materials. In this article, adsorbent materials are synthesized by introducing thiols and primary amino groups into cellulose fibers isolated from soybean hulls. After characterization, the ability of the materials to remove mercury from both ultrapure and aquaculture water solutions is tested. The results confirm the affinity of Hg for thiol groups, leading to the adsorption of 44 mg(Hg)/g in a wide pH range. The amino-modified material adsorbs ≈50% Hg less than the thiol-functionalized one. Test in real water shows that organic matter and salts influence the Hg adsorption process, without affecting the overall efficiency. Finally, in real water, a final concentration below the Hg legal limit for human consumption (1 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) is found.

We introduce an updated non-redundant protein-RNA docking benchmark version 3.0 (PRDBv3.0) containing 197 test cases curated from 288 unique protein-RNA complexes available in the Protein Data Bank until July 2024. Among these, 27 are unbound-unbound (UU) type where both the binding partners are available in their unbound states, 160 are unbound-bound (UB) type where only the protein is available in unbound state and remaining 10 are bound-unbound (BU) type where only the RNA is available in unbound state. The benchmark is categorized into three classes based on the conformational flexibility of the protein interface: 117 rigid-body (R) complexes with minimal structural changes, 41 semi-flexible (S) complexes showing moderate conformational changes and 29 full-flexible (F) complexes with significant conformational changes. The current benchmark represents a 62% increase in the number of test cases compared to its previous version. Binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) values for a subset of 105 protein-RNA complexes from PRDBv3.0 are catalogued along with additional experimental details to develop a comprehensive protein-RNA affinity benchmark. Moreover, a total of 255 unique RNA-binding domains, present in RNA-binding proteins, are also catalogued in this updated benchmark. PRDBv3.0 will facilitate the evaluation of both rigid-body and flexible docking methods as well as the methods that aim to predict binding affinity. The updated benchmark is freely available at http://www.csb.iitkgp.ac.in/applications/PRDBv3/PRDBv3.php.
40202107	BRCA1 Promoter Methylation in Ovarian Cancer: Clinical Relevance and a Novel Diagnostic Approach Using Fragment Analysis.	Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) tests, including MyChoice CDx, are companion diagnostics for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation, a major HRD cause, may correlate with poorer prognosis. This study aimed to develop a simple, accurate method for detecting BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation and elucidate the characteristics of such cases. BRCA1 promoter methylation was analyzed using bisulfite sequencing (BIS-seq) in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma specimens. We developed a newly developed BRCA1 methylation assay, BRCA1-Fragment Analysis of Methylation (BRCA1-FAM), which combines restriction enzyme digestion with fragment analysis. The accuracy of this assay was compared to the results of BIS-seq. We evaluated the relationship between BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation and prognosis and examined its association with BRCA1 expression and loss of heterozygosity. BRCA1 mutations and promoter methylation were mutually exclusive in the analyzed cases, with methylation observed in 28.9% (22/76) of primary debulking surgery cases. The BRCA1-FAM showed high sensitivity (91.3%) and specificity (100%) for detecting BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation, comparable to BIS-seq. Cases with BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation had significantly poorer progression-free survival (log-rank test, p = 0.048). Among these cases, 86.4% displayed abnormal BRCA1 immunostaining, with lower frequencies of BRCA1 loss of heterozygosity compared to those of other groups. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation is associated with poor prognosis, underscoring the importance of its identification for HRD stratification. BRCA1-FAM is a simple and highly accurate method for evaluating BRCA1 promoter methylation. This approach may potentially enhance the precision of personalized therapies for ovarian cancer.
40202104	Macrophage WEE1 Directly Binds to and Phosphorylates NF-κB p65 Subunit to Induce Inflammatory Response and Drive Atherosclerosis.	Atherosclerosis has an urgent need for new therapeutic targets. Protein kinases orchestrate multiple cellular events in atherosclerosis and may provide new therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis. Here, a protein kinase, WEE1 G2 checkpoint kinase (WEE1), promoting inflammation in atherosclerosis is identified. Kinase enrichment analysis and experimental evidences reveal macrophage WEE1 phosphorylation at S642 in human and mouse atherosclerotic tissues. RNA-seq analysis, combined with experiment studies using mutant WEE1 plasmids, shows that WEE1 phosphorylation, rather than WEE1 expression, mediated oxLDL-induced inflammation in macrophages. Macrophage-specific deletion of WEE1 or pharmacological inhibition of WEE1 kinase activity attenuates atherosclerosis by reducing inflammation in mice. Mechanistically, RNA-seq and co-immunoprecipitation followed by proteomics analysis are used to explore the mechanism and substrate of WEE1. p-WEE1 promoted inflammatory response through activating NF-κB shown and further revealed that WEE1 can directly bind to the p65 subunit. It is confirmed that p-WEE1 directly interacts with the RHD domain of p65 and phosphorylates p65 at S536, thereby facilitating subsequent NF-κB activation and inflammatory response in macrophages. The findings demonstrate that macrophage WEE1 drives NF-κB activation and atherosclerosis by directly phosphorylating p65 at S536. This study identifies WEE1 as a new upstream kinase of p65 and a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.
40202103	Classical Preoptimization Approach for ADAPT-VQE: Maximizing the Potential of High-Performance Computing Resources to Improve Quantum Simulation of Chemical Applications.	The ADAPT-VQE algorithm is a promising method for generating a compact ansatz based on derivatives of the underlying cost function, and it yields accurate predictions of electronic energies for molecules. In this work, we report the implementation and performance of ADAPT-VQE with our recently developed sparse wave function circuit solver (SWCS) in terms of accuracy and efficiency for molecular systems with up to 52 spin orbitals. The SWCS can be tuned to balance computational cost and accuracy, which extends the application of ADAPT-VQE for molecular electronic structure calculations to larger basis sets and a larger number of qubits. Using this tunable feature of the SWCS, we propose an alternative optimization procedure for ADAPT-VQE to reduce the computational cost of the optimization. By preoptimizing a quantum simulation with a parametrized ansatz generated with ADAPT-VQE/SWCS, we aim to utilize the power of classical high-performance computing in order to minimize the work required on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, which offers a promising path toward demonstrating quantum advantage for chemical applications.
40202102	Dual-Function SERS Microdroplet Sensor for Rapid Differentiation of Influenza a and SARS-CoV-2.	This study presents the development of a dual-function microdroplet sensor utilizing surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technology to identify and quantify Influenza A and COVID-19 viruses. The proposed microfluidic device incorporates compartments for two-phase segmented droplet generation, merging, splitting, and detection. Both viral strains were identified by isolating magnetic antibody-antigen complexes from the liquid medium using a magnetized bar embedded in the microfluidic channel. Concurrent Raman spectroscopic readings were obtained as suspended droplets containing residual SERS-active nanoparticles traversed the interrogation zone of the focused laser beam. Precise quantitative analysis was accomplished by correcting characteristic Raman peak intensities for both viruses with internal standards, while ensemble averaging Raman signals from multiple droplets ensured high reproducibility. This dual-function SERS microdroplet sensor represents a novel in vitro diagnostic approach capable of rapidly distinguishing between COVID-19 and Influenza A with high sensitivity and reproducibility. When coupled with a portable Raman spectrophotometer, the device shows significant potential as a diagnostic tool for swift and in situ detection of both viral pathogens.
40202101	On-chip colorimetric assay for determining serum lithium concentration from whole blood.	Lithium is the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. However, the narrow therapeutic window of serum (s-)lithium is near its toxicity range, necessitating continuous monitoring of patients, a process involving regular hospital visits. On-demand home sampling could allow for more frequent testing, possibly resulting in safer patient outcomes, further dosage optimization, and increased compliance. This article presents a device that measures the s-lithium concentration from whole blood. The device consists of a single-use cartridge able to conduct on-chip serum filtration, volume-metering and an on-chip colorimetric assay. Spiked whole blood shows good linearity (Pearson's <i>r</i> = 0.96, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.92), a limit-of-detection of 0.3 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>, and an average deviation of 0.05 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> (±6%) compared to atomic absorption spectroscopy. The on-chip colorimetric assay has shown to be a promising technique for measuring s-lithium concentration from whole blood and could allow patients to assess lithium levels at home and make the treatment available for new patient groups.
40202100	Highly Efficient Calibration-Free Color Compensation Algorithm for Imaging Flow Cytometry.	As an emerging platform gaining significant attention from the biomedical community, multiplexed fluorescent imaging from imaging flow cytometry enables simultaneous detection of numerous biological targets within a single cell. Due to the spectral overlap, signals from one fluorophore can bleed into other detection channels, leading to spillover artifacts, which cause erroneous results and false discoveries. Existing color compensation algorithms use special samples to calibrate the fluorophores individually, a time-consuming and laborious process that is cumbersome and hard to scale. While recent developments in calibration-free algorithms produce promising results in multi-color microscope images, these algorithms, when applied to single-cell images with all the fluorophores within a small and constrained area, tend to cause overcorrection by treating real signals as crosstalk and triggering stability problems during the iterative computation process. Here we demonstrate a simple and intuitive algorithm that greatly reduces overcorrection and is computationally efficient. While designed for imaging flow cytometers, our calibration-free crosstalk removal algorithm can be readily applied to microscopy as well. We have validated its effectiveness on various datasets, including simulated cell images, 2D and 3D imaging flow cytometry images, and microscopic images. Our algorithm offers an effective solution for multi-parameter single-cell images where channels are often both spectrally and spatially overlapped within the limited area of a single cell.

40202097	First-line treatment of osteoporosis with osteoanabolic therapy: a new opportunity.	Osteoporosis is a national health priority, and over six million Australians over the age of 50 years have poor bone health. Fragility fractures due to osteoporosis are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality risk and a high economic cost to the community. It is a chronic condition requiring long-term management. Despite notable advances in pharmacotherapy, large treatment gaps remain. Antiresorptive drugs have been the foundation of treatment; however, their efficacy wanes and rare adverse effects accumulate with prolonged use. Osteoanabolic drugs form new bone and can also restore deteriorated bone microarchitecture, in addition to increasing bone mineral density. Currently, antiresorptive drugs are used as first-line drugs for osteoporosis. However, recent studies have highlighted the superiority of anabolic drugs for fracture reduction over antiresorptives. Furthermore, for patients at very high risk or imminent risk of fracture, the use of sequential therapy with an osteoanabolic medication followed by an antiresorptive is superior to achieving optimal long-term bone health outcomes. This article will discuss the evidence supporting the anti-fracture benefits of osteoanabolic drugs, emphasising their benefits as first-line agents for osteoporosis. Challenges surrounding transitions between osteoanabolic and antiresorptive medications are also discussed, highlighting considerations for the optimal treatment sequence with a focus on recent updates to Australian prescribing recommendations and PBS requirements.

The advent of variant-specific disease-modifying drugs into clinical practice has provided remarkable benefits for people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF), a multi-organ life-limiting inherited disease. However, further efforts are needed to maximize therapeutic benefits as well as to increase the number of PwCF taking CFTR modulators.
40202088	High-strength bone polyurethane adhesive with rapid curing for bone tissue injury repair.	Bone tissue adhesives have advantages such as preventing stress shielding and secondary surgical infections, fixing small bone fragments, easing operations, and enhancing wound adaptability. These methods can be applied for the traumatic repair of comminuted fractures. Currently, commercial tissue adhesives fail to meet the biological safety and mechanical strength requirements of bone tissue adhesives. To address this situation, we developed and screened a rapidly cured high-strength polyurethane bone adhesive. Research has shown that polyurethane bone adhesives have shorter curing times (236 s to 273 s), higher tensile moduli (425.88 MPa to 666.38 MPa), compressive moduli (214.67 MPa to 450.66 MPa), and adhesive strengths (0.92 MPa to 5.86 MPa). It can withstand cyclic stresses ranging from 0.01 MPa to 1 MPa for 1000 cycles. Polyurethane bone adhesive surpasses the inadequate adhesive performance and <i>in vivo</i> repair functionality of existing commercial bone cements, achieving effective repair of bone tissue injuries. Furthermore, we developed an unsaturated ester-modified secondary amine curing agent based on the Michael addition reaction, enabling rapid and safe curing of bone polyurethane adhesives and thereby providing a novel and effective repair solution for bone tissue injuries.
40202087	Traditional herbal medicine in the treatment of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis: a systematic review.

The aim of this study is to review the literature to evaluate scientific evidence regarding the use of herbal preparations in the treatment of rhinosinusitis.
40202086	Chromatin Landscape is Associated with Sex-biased Expression and Drosophila-like Dosage Compensation in Artemia franciscana.	The males and females of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana are highly dimorphic, and this dimorphism is associated with substantial sex-biased gene expression in heads and gonads. How these sex-specific patterns of expression are regulated at the molecular level is unknown. A. franciscana also has differentiated ZW sex chromosomes, with complete dosage compensation, but the molecular mechanism through which compensation is achieved is unknown. Here, we conducted CUT&TAG assays targeting seven post-translational histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me3 and H4K16ac) in heads and gonads of A. franciscana, allowing us to divide the genome into 12 chromatin states. We further defined functional chromatin signatures for all genes, which were correlated with transcript level abundances. Differences in the occupancy of the profiled epigenetic marks between sexes were associated with differential gene expression between males and females. Finally, we found a significant enrichment of the permissive H4K16ac histone mark in the Z-specific region in both tissues of females but not males, supporting a role of this histone mark in mediating dosage compensation of the Z chromosome.

40202083	Non-Mosaic Trisomy 9: Further Delineation of the Clinical Phenotype.	Non-mosaic trisomy 9 (NMTS9) is a rarely described chromosomal abnormality because most affected pregnancies result in first trimester spontaneous abortions, although survival to delivery is possible. In contrast, the phenotypic features of mosaic trisomy 9 have been well described in the literature as these individuals can survive to birth and beyond. Therefore, a better understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of NMTS9 is needed to provide appropriate perinatal counseling. The phenotype from three fetal and one neonatal case of NMTS9, as defined by chromosome analysis in multiple tissues, is consistent with the existing literature and includes narrow forehead, midface hypoplasia, microphthalmia, clouded corneas, blepharophimosis, rounded nasal tip, broad/prominent nasal bridge, low-set ears with and without malformations, short and broad neck, cerebellar abnormalities, a wide range of cardiac anomalies including ventricular and atrial septal defects as well as valve dysplasia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, hydronephrosis, and hypoplastic genitalia, multiple contractures, multiple dislocations, and talipes equinovarus. We also report an expansion of the cardiac, genitourinary, and renal phenotypes. This combined phenotype based on prenatal imaging and fetal/postnatal autopsy further delineates the clinical phenotype of NMTS9.
40202081	The State of Surgical Care Access in America: Current Challenges, Disparities, and Emerging Solutions.	Access to surgical care represents a significant and widespread issue that impacts millions of Americans across varying demographics. It is estimated that nearly 100 million Americans-approximately 1 in 3-lack access to quality surgical care. Additionally, the financial implications of this lack of access lead to an estimated annual cost of $1 billion in preventable healthcare spending, coupled with increased morbidity and mortality rates. Reliable access to care includes sufficient and affordable health insurance and the ability to easily locate and receive care that meets the patient's health needs. The barriers to timely, affordable, quality surgical care are complex and multifaceted. They include population-based factors such as rural geography, the repercussions of hospital closures, access challenges faced by justice-involved individuals, LGBTQ+ patients, and other marginalized groups, language and cultural barriers as well as the impact of natural disasters on supply and health system infrastructure, bias and discrimination, and policy.
40202080	Investigating Bubble Formation and Evolution in Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries via Synchrotron X-Ray Imaging.	The parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hinders electrolyte transport. It reduces the effective electrochemical surface area in the negative half-cell of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), resulting in substantial efficiency losses. We investigated the formation and evolution of hydrogen bubbles within VRFB electrodes through comprehensive experimental characterization and a detailed analysis of the resolved bubbles. The electrode was imaged using synchrotron X-ray tomography, and gas bubbles in the images were identified and characterized using a deep learning model combined with a morphological analysis tool. The HER intensity increases at more negative working electrode potentials, causing residual bubbles to grow and fuse in the electrode central region. In contrast, independent bubbles predominantly form at the electrode edges. Furthermore, the bubble growth leads to the gradual development of irregular shapes. These observations provide insights into bubble formation and evolution rules, contributing to a better understanding of the system.
40202079	When hospital harms more than helps: Iatrogenic processes in adolescent inpatient settings.	More adolescents than ever are being hospitalised in mental health units. As with all forms of clinical intervention, psychiatric inpatient admission poses its own risks of harm resulting from treatment (iatrogenesis), of which there is minimal literature. In this article we explore the factors that contribute to iatrogenic processes in the adolescent inpatient environment. Of note, the socialization of unsafe behaviours in these environments can contribute to poorer treatment outcomes as well as the harmful effects of experiencing, or witnessing, coercive and traumatising clinical practices. Inpatient admissions also have a systemic impact on family and community ecosystems that can detrimentally influence young people while they are in hospital and even after returning to the community. Recommendations for minimizing and preventing iatrogenic harm for adolescents in inpatient environments are outlined, as well as the patient characteristics that might make young people more vulnerable to these deleterious processes.
40202078	Graphene-based materials are not skin sensitizers: adoption of the <i>in chemico</i>/<i>in vitro</i> OECD test guidelines.	The boost in the market size of graphene-based materials (GBMs) requires a careful evaluation of their impact on human health, acquiring robust and reliable data, also suitable for regulatory purposes. Considering cutaneous contact as one of the most relevant GBM exposure routes, this study is focused on skin sensitization, aimed at assessing the possibility to adopt the three <i>in chemico</i>/<i>in vitro</i> test guidelines (TGs) defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (442C, D and E) to predict the first three phases of the skin sensitization adverse outcome pathway. Being originally validated for chemicals, modifications allowing their adoption for GBMs were evaluated. TG 442C was found to be not suitable for testing GBMs due to their reactivity, leading to possible misclassifications. In contrast, TG 442D and E can generally be applied for GBMs. However, protocol adjustments were required to assess cell viability reducing interferences for TG 442D, whereas caution should be exercised regarding dose-finding selection and GBM dispersion stability for TG 442E. When applying these modifications, GBMs were found to be unable to activate keratinocytes and promote dendritic cell differentiation, so they can be considered non-sensitizers. Overall, these results significantly contribute to understanding the safety profiles of GBMs and to improve testing methodologies to obtain reliable toxicological data.
40202076	Dynamics of Transition Metal Ion Transport in High-Gradient Magnetic Fields.	Magnetic separation has emerged as an eco-friendly and sustainable technique with applications in water purification, chemical separation, biochemistry, medicine, and mining. In this study, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the transport of transition metal ions using high-gradient magnetic fields. Experiments were conducted on aqueous solutions containing either paramagnetic manganese chloride (MnCl<sub>2</sub>) or diamagnetic zinc chloride (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) ions, with concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mM under a non-uniform magnetic field of an electromagnet. Our results demonstrate that while paramagnetic MnCl<sub>2</sub> is captured by the mesh wool in the magnetic field, diamagnetic ZnCl<sub>2</sub> remains unaffected by the presence of a magnetic field. The capture efficiency of paramagnetic MnCl<sub>2</sub> increases with both the initial ion concentration and the applied magnetic field strength. Furthermore, in binary mixtures, the capture rate of MnCl<sub>2</sub> is reduced compared with single-ion solutions, highlighting the role of ion interactions in magnetic separation. Our theoretical modeling indicates that magnetic capture is governed by a balance between magnetic forces and viscous forces. Additionally, the magnetic separation process is enhanced by the field-induced cluster formation of paramagnetic metal ions, which are predicted to be 2 orders of magnitude larger than individual hydrated ion units. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of magnetic transport of metal ions and offer potential pathways for improving separation efficiency in complex ion mixtures that contain critical materials.
40202075	Novel Enteric Microsphere of Beclomethasone Dipropionate With Colon Delivery and Enhancement of Anti-Inflammatory Effects.	The present study aimed to develop a novel colon-targeting microsphere of beclomethasone dipropionate (cMS/BDP) with enhanced pharmacological effect of BDP in the colon. cMS/BDP was prepared using Eudragit<sup>®</sup> S-100 by the emulsion solvent diffusion method, and its physicochemical properties were characterized. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted to assess systemic exposure and colon distribution of BDP after oral administration of cMS/BDP to rats. A pharmacodynamic study was carried out to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of cMS/BDP after its oral administration to ulcerative colitis model rats. The particle size of cMS/BDP was calculated to be ca. 20 μm, and most BDP in cMS/BDP might be in an amorphous state. In dissolution tests, cMS/BDP showed pH-dependent release behavior of BDP and marked BDP release at pH 7.4. After oral administration of cMS/BDP (5 mg-BDP/kg) to rats, BDP was rapidly metabolized to beclomethasone 17-monopropionate (17-BMP, a BDP metabolite) in the gastrointestinal tract and liver, and relative oral bioavailability of 17-BMP in the cMS/BDP group was calculated to be ca. 4.8% compared with that in the BDP solution group. The tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient value, an index of colon distribution, for cMS/BDP was found to be 15-fold higher than that for BDP solution. In the cMS/BDP (50 μg/kg) group, colonic myeloperoxidase activity and hyperplasia of the submucosa were negligibly elevated. From these findings, the cMS approach for BDP would be a promising dosage option for strategic colon delivery, leading to an improved therapeutic potential of BDP with a wide safety margin.

40202071	Carbonization of Manchurian Nut Shell in the Synthesis of Microporous Carbon-Based Adsorbents: an EPR, Thermal Analysis and Nitrogen Adsorption Study.	Carbonization of Manchurian nut shells (MNS) in argon medium at 400-700°C was studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and thermal analysis. Thermal treatment of MNS leads to the formation of radicals stabilized in the solid matrix, the concentration of which decreases with an increase in temperature from 400 to 700°C. Simultaneous increase in EPR signals intensity of paramagnetic species in the structure of carbon materials is observed. Activation of carbonized MNS with CO2 leads to the formation of microporous adsorbent. The texture of adsorbent depends on the concentration of radicals in the carbonization products: radical concentration of 4.2-4.7×1020 spin/g leads to the formation of material with specific surface area (SBET) of ​​760-800 m2/g, total pore volume (Vads) of 0.32-0.34 cm3/g and micropore volume (Vmicro) of 0.26-0.27 cm3/g; a decrease in radicals concentration to 0-4×1018 spin/g also reduces SBET to 670-700 m2/g, Vads to 0.28 cm3/g and Vmicro to 0.24 cm3/g.
40202069	Erasable fluorescence imaging technology enables continuous tracking for identical living cells.	Subtle molecular events may trigger a cascade of "butterfly effects" to reverse cell fate, so dynamic tracking of relevant markers can provide crucial clues to decipher the unknown. However, existing analytical techniques are still at static-analysis level, and cutting-edge fluorescence imaging is limited by signal interference at adjacent time, failing to realize continuous observation for identical live cells. Herein, we develop a new temperature-controlled imaging technology, where melamine-mediated reversible DNA self-assembly drives the fluorescence illuminating and extinguishing at any time, achieving repeated erasable imaging for identical living cells. This method can track cell behaviors by taking dynamic monitoring of cell differentiation as an example, and timely fluorescence erasing guarantees authenticity for imaging results and minimizes interference with cellular activities. Thanks to high feasibility in fundamental experimental scenarios, this method hopefully provides a powerful preliminary screening tool for exploring new biological mechanisms in cell interactions, developmental transformations, downstream response inquiry, etc.
40202067	Exploring room-temperature anti-ferromagnetism in a newly predicted 2D MBene M<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub> (M: Cr, Mn, Fe) monolayer using first-principles calculations.	The search for two-dimensional (2D) materials is rapidly expanding. Here, we predict a new series of 2D MBene M<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub> monolayers composed of transition metal (M: Cr, Mn, Fe) and boron (B) atoms, thereby extending the family of MBenes. Detailed first-principles calculations demonstrate that the new MBene materials have stable hexagonal crystal structures and an antiferromagnetic ground state. The average magnetic moment per magnetic ion in the antiferromagnetic state is calculated as 2.10<i>μ</i><sub>B</sub> per atom, 2.60<i>μ</i><sub>B</sub> per atom, and 1.38<i>μ</i><sub>B</sub> per atom for Cr<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub>, Mn<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub>, and Fe<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub> monolayers, respectively. The calculated spin-polarized electronic band structures show the narrow gap semiconducting character in the Cr and Mn-based MBene monolayers under consideration. Furthermore, the stability of magnetization against thermal fluctuations is confirmed by the energy barrier created by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE), which is as high as 0.822 meV per cell with respect to hard axes for the Mn<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub> monolayer. The high value of MAE indicated that the spin moments will be aligned out of the plane in a 2D Ising Model fashion. The Néel temperatures for the Cr<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub>, Mn<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub>, and Fe<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub> MBene monolayers are estimated to be 302.09 K, 393.05 K, and 233.62 K, respectively, by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. These results indicate that the newly predicted 2D MBene M<sub>4</sub>B<sub>6</sub> monolayers are promising materials for spintronic nanodevices at room temperature.
40202066	Salt-Based Electrolyte Additives for Regulating the Interface Chemistry of Zinc Metal Anodes in High-Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries.	Aqueous zinc-metal batteries (AZMBs) are emerging as a promising green and low-cost energy storage solution, distinguished by their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the industrialization of AZMBs is currently hindered by significant challenges, particularly uncontrollable dendritic growth and side reactions at the zinc metal anode interface, which severely limit their large-scale application. To address these issues, salt-based electrolyte additives have emerged as a straightforward, economical, and practical solution. This review systematically classifies and analyzes the working mechanisms of inorganic, organic, and ammonium salt-based additives, elucidating their roles in regulating solvation structures, hydrogen bond networks, pH levels, interfacial protective layers, electric fields, and Zn2+ deposition behaviors. These additives enhance anode stability and mitigate side reactions, thereby improving overall electrochemical performance. Additionally, the review offers valuable insights into future directions for the development of salt-based electrolyte additives, providing essential guidance for advancing research in this field.
40202065	The burden and risk factors of chronic musculoskeletal disorders among artisanal and small-scale miners in rural Rwanda.	<i>Objectives.</i> In sub-Saharan Africa, mining employment continues to expose workers to a dangerous physical and psychosocial occupational environment. This study explored the prevalence of chronic musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and their risk factors among artisanal and small-scale miners. <i>Methods</i>. A cross-sectional study was conducted in eastern Rwanda in November 2022. Self-reported MSDs were assessed using the modified Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire. The study used <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> or <i>t</i> tests and multivariate analysis with backward stepwise selection for logistic regression to determine independent risk factors for chronic MSDs (lasting >3 months). <i>Results</i>. The prevalence of self-reported MSDs in the past week and chronic MSDs were 78.83% (<i>n</i> = 808 out of 1025) and 64.10% (<i>n</i> = 657), respectively. Higher odds of chronic MSD was significantly associated with employment length longer than 5 years, working in a high or very high intensity vibration and rock-drilling tasks. Rock-blasting tasks were associated with 38% lower odds for chronic MSDs. <i>Discussion</i>. Nearly 8 out of 10 artisanal and small-scale miners experienced MSDs. High-risk occupational characteristics increased the odds of chronic MSDs. Adoption of proper health and safety management systems, high standard mechanization, ergonomic training and better health-seeking behaviors may mitigate risks for MSDs in Rwanda and sub-Saharan Africa.
40202063	High-Impact Participation? Social Activities, Activity Frequency, and Older Adult Cognition.	ObjectivesThere is growing recognition that social participation may help attenuate cognitive decline in older ages. Unfortunately, previous research often relies on participation index measures, which may obfuscate associations among cognition, specific activities, and the frequency of partaking in those activities.MethodsData are from six waves of the Health and Retirement Study (<i>N</i> = 20,696). Regression models test how associations between social participation and cognition vary by social activity and by multiple specifications of activity frequency.ResultsUsing a participation index, any new activity or increase in activity frequency was positively associated with cognition. When segregating activities, only three activities had positive associations: meeting friends, volunteering, and being a part of community organizations. We find limited evidence that activity frequency is an important moderator.DiscussionSocial activities likely have heterogeneous associations with older adult cognition. The frequency threshold linking social participation to cognition may be "any" regular participation in select activities.
40202061	N-/Si-co-doped nanocrystalline diamonds as highly sensitive luminescent thermometers.	Diamonds can host a variety of luminescent point defects, such as nitrogen vacancies and silicon vacancies, making them remarkably promising materials for luminescence nanothermometry. They also exhibit desirable characteristics, including low cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility and the benefits of carbon chemistry for tuneable surface functionalization with target molecules. In this work, N-/Si co-doped nanocrystalline diamonds were synthesized <i>via</i> microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition under varying methane flow and temperature conditions, aiming for maximum photoluminescence intensity. In-depth analysis of the luminescence characteristics of NV<sup>-</sup> and SiV<sup>-</sup> emitting point defects with temperature, based on both experiments and <i>ab initio</i> calculations, suggested the existence of thermal coupling between their states. This coupling enabled ratiometric approaches to be exploited for more sensitive luminescent thermometry. A maximum thermal relative sensitivity of 5.5% K<sup>-1</sup> was achieved. This is remarkable for <i>in vitro</i> temperature measurements of biological tissues.
40202060	Glofitamab results in cost savings versus epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a total cost of care analysis<sup>‡</sup>.	Fixed-treatment duration glofitamab and treat-to-progression epcoritamab are approved in the US for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after ≥2 prior therapies. An economic model was developed to estimate the per-patient total cost of care (TCC) for glofitamab versus epcoritamab from a US healthcare perspective. Treatment costs were based on time-to-off-treatment (glofitamab, NCT03075696) and progression-free survival (epcoritamab, NCT03625037). Per-patient cost savings, adjusted to 2023 US dollars, were observed with glofitamab versus epcoritamab across cycles 1-3 (-$56,275), and over 6 months (-$37,982), 1 year (-$68,195), 5 years (-$223,692), 10 years (-$325,175), and lifetime (-$503,075). While adverse event ($364) and treatment administration ($8,398) costs were higher for glofitamab versus epcoritamab, these were offset by consistently lower glofitamab treatment costs across all time horizons. Glofitamab showed per-patient TCC savings versus epcoritamab at every cumulative cycle and across all time horizons investigated, offering greater budget predictability and cost savings at the healthcare system and population levels.
40202059	Spatial Confinement of Pd Nanoclusters in Pyrene-Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction.	Photocatalytic CO2 reduction offers a promising strategy to mitigate the greenhouse effect, yet it remains a challenging process due to the high energy barrier associated with the high stability of CO2. In this study, we synthesized Py-bTDC, a pyrene-based covalent organic framework (COF) enriched with nitrogen and sulfur atoms, and anchored palladium nanoclusters (Pd NCs) onto its structure to enhance CO2 reduction efficiency. The confined Pd NCs amplify the built-in electric field (IEF), enabling efficient photogenerated carrier migration and suppressing electron-hole recombination. Simultaneously, Pd NCs serve as catalytic active sites, optimizing CO2 adsorption and activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Pd reduces the energy barrier for forming the critical intermediate (*COOH), thereby accelerating CO production. Under visible-light irradiation in a gas-solid system using water as a proton donor, the Pd3/Py-bTDC composite achieved a CO evolution rate of 17.75 μmol·h-1·g-1 with 86.0% selectivity. This study advances the design of COF-based photocatalysts by synergistically modulating IEF and the engineering active sites for efficient CO2 reduction.
40202058	Biodegradable Piezoelectric Janus Membrane Enabling Dual Antibacterial and Osteogenic Functions for Periodontitis Therapy.	Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) using barrier membranes is a common clinical approach for treating periodontitis-induced alveolar bone loss. However, conventional GTR membranes lack antibacterial and osteoinductive properties, limiting their effectiveness. Piezoelectric materials, which generate electrical outputs under chewing forces, offer antibacterial and bone-regenerative potential due to their oppositely charged surfaces. Inspired by this, a piezoelectric Janus membrane was developed for dual-function GTR therapy. Biodegradable poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) and PLLA/gelatin membranes were electrospun, annealed, and polarized to create the A-P(+)/PG(-) piezoelectric Janus membrane. Notably, in this Janus membrane, the outer surface of the PLLA side (A-P(+)) carries positive charges and is positioned toward the gingival tissue to kill bacteria via charge interactions; the inner surface of the PG side (PG(-)) holds negative charges and faces the alveolar bone defect, promoting bone growth through immunomodulation and enhanced mineralization. In a mouse model of periodontitis, the Janus membrane A-P(+)/PG(-) demonstrated dual functionality, effectively reducing inflammation, inhibiting bone resorption. The bone mineral density of A-P(+)/PG(-) reached 1637 ± 37 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> at 8 weeks after surgery, which was superior to commercial collagen membranes lacking antibacterial properties. Overall, this study introduces an innovative approach, leveraging biodegradable piezoelectric PLLA to construct a versatile Janus GTR membrane with enhanced antibacterial and osteogenic activity for periodontitis treatment.

40202053	Association between systemic immune inflammation index and serum testosterone and free testosterone in middle-aged and elderly men.	Chronic inflammation is a pervasive feature of aging and may be associated with testosterone in middle-aged and older men. Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a novel inflammatory biomarker. We aimed to assess the association between SII and serum testosterone and free testosterone (FT) in middle-aged and older men.
40202051	High-resolution deep mutational scanning of the melanocortin-4 receptor enables target characterization for drug discovery.	Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) is an emerging method to systematically test the functional consequences of thousands of sequence changes to a protein target in a single experiment. Because of its utility in interpreting both human variant effects and protein structure-function relationships, it holds substantial promise to improve drug discovery and clinical development. However, applications in this domain require improved experimental and analytical methods. To address this need, we report novel DMS methods to precisely and quantitatively interrogate disease-relevant mechanisms, protein-ligand interactions, and assess predicted response to drug treatment. Using these methods, we performed a DMS of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) implicated in obesity and an active target of drug development efforts. We assessed the effects of >6600 single amino acid substitutions on MC4R's function across 18 distinct experimental conditions, resulting in >20 million unique measurements. From this, we identified variants that have unique effects on MC4R-mediated Gα<sub>s</sub>- and Gα<sub>q</sub>-signaling pathways, which could be used to design drugs that selectively bias MC4R's activity. We also identified pathogenic variants that are likely amenable to a corrector therapy. Finally, we functionally characterized structural relationships that distinguish the binding of peptide versus small molecule ligands, which could guide compound optimization. Collectively, these results demonstrate that DMS is a powerful method to empower drug discovery and development.
40202050	Children With 22.Q.11.2 Deletion Syndrome: Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Management.	Patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are predisposed to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to an abnormal craniofacial anatomy with pharyngeal hypotonia, retrognathia, micrognathia, and glossoptosis. The aim of the study was to describe the prevalence and management of OSA in a cohort of children with 22q11DS. All patients with 22q11DS seen at the national reference center of craniofacial anomalies at Necker-Enfants malades hospital (Paris, France) between April 2014 and April 2024 had a systematic respiratory polygraphy (PG) in room air. Clinical data, PGs, and subsequent OSA management were retrospectively analyzed. The data of 52 patients were analyzed. Associated disorders were common, with 79% of the patients having an upper airway anomaly, 58% a cardiopathy, and 30% a pulmonary disease. Mean age at baseline PG was 6.6 ± 4.6 (0.1-18) years. Twelve (23%) patients had an adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy, and 10 (19%) patients a posterior flap pharyngoplasty prior to baseline PG. Four patients were treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and 2 patients with a cardiopathy were treated with long-term oxygen therapy prior to baseline PG. Mean AHI was 4.0 ± 9.1 (0-43) events/h, with 24 (46%) patients having OSA, with 15 (29%) having mild OSA, 5 (9%) moderate OSA, and 4 (8%) severe OSA. A young age (p = 0.003), an immune deficiency (p = 0.018) and a pulmonary disease (p = 0.028) were more common in patients with OSA as compared to those without OSA. On follow-up, OSA improved after upper airway surgery in 4 patients or spontaneously, with only 2 patients requiring CPAP for persistent moderate OSA. In conclusion, the prevalence of OSA in children with 22q11DS is high. OSA severity is mainly mild except in infants aged < 1 year with an immune deficiency and a pulmonary disease being more common in patients with OSA as compared to those without OSA.

40202047	Grand Challenges on HIV/AIDS in China-The 5<sup>th</sup> Symposium, Yunnan 2024.	HIV-1 infection has led to 1.329 million people living with the virus and 0.474 millions of deaths by the middle of 2024 in China. Achieving the goal of ending HIV/AIDS in China by 2030 has faced several grand challenges including currently less than 85% diagnostic rate, an estimated annual cost burden of 6.3 billion RMB for antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone, and the lack of therapeutic cure and preventive vaccine and so on. To address these challenges, Chinese scientists initiated the program of <i>Grand Challenges on HIV/AIDS in China</i> (GCC) in 2017. The inauguration symposium was held from November 30 to December 1, 2017 in Hong Kong-Asia's World City-to commemorate the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of AIDS Institute at The University of Hong Kong and Comprehensive AIDS Research Center at Tsinghua University. The mission of the GCHAC is to advance HIV/AIDS prevention, prioritize research on therapeutic cure and vaccine, disseminate new scientific findings, and foster broader collaborations. Following the inaugural event, subsequent symposia were held at Fudan University in 2018, Sun Yat-Sen University in 2019, Tsinghua University in 2023, and Dali University in 2024. This review reports the scientific presentations and progresses made by the GCC scientists, highlighting efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in China.
40202045	Extracellular Vesicles in Aging and Age-Related Diseases. How Important Are They?	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipid bilayer-bound particles secreted by cells, have attracted significant research attention for their roles in aging-related disorders, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Research shows that EV cargo and function are influenced by factors including age, disease state, exercise, nutrition and sleep, and they may modulate various aging-associated processes such as stem cell renewal, nutrient sensing, cell senescence, mitochondrial function, and insulin resistance. This perspective highlights, for a general audience, a selection of studies of EVs in aging and age-related diseases, and their diverse roles in organ crosstalk. While current evidence indicates that EVs play multiple roles in aging, there are numerous challenges including methodological challenges and limitations, heterogeneous reports of EV cargo, limited reproducibility, and apparent context-dependent effects of EVs and their cargo. Together, this limits the interpretation of these studies. This is proposed that EVs may act as fine-tuners of cellular communication within the broader aging-associated secretome and the importance of standardizing methods are emphasized. Last, future directions for EV research are suggested.
40202044	Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma With TCR-γδ Expression: A Case Series of Eleven Patients of a Rare Immunophenotypic Variant.	Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) are indolent CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders that rarely express TCR-γδ. However, primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma (pcGDTCL), characterized by TCR-γδ expression on neoplastic cells, is a rare, aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with a poor prognosis. Accurate differentiation is essential due to distinct clinical behavior and treatment.
40202043	Indirect plant defense may provide economically important pest suppression in sorghum.	A promising strategy to optimize biological control of insect pests is selecting crop varieties with indirect defense traits. Indirect plant defenses recruit natural enemies to kill pests and include chemical attractants like herbivore-induced plant volatiles. In prior laboratory assays, we found sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) cultivar ATx3409/RTx436 infested with sorghum aphid (Melanaphis sorghi Theobald) was attractive to natural enemies and emitted more chemical attractants than two other cultivars. In this field study, we manually infested 9-week-old sorghum plants with aphids and quantified differences in natural enemy and aphid densities among cultivars throughout the growing season. We also used field cages to control access of natural enemies to plants and estimate their effects on aphid suppression.

40202032	Food Environment Lens: Exploring Mothers' Perspectives and the Dietary Landscape of (Agro)-Pastoral Children in Kenya's Drylands.	This study compared the dietary diversity and food variety scores of children under 5 years of age from different ethnic groups in Marsabit County, Northern Kenya. Mothers' explanations for their children's food choices related to characteristics of their personal food environment, such as accessibility, affordability, convenience, healthiness and food acceptance. Their reasons for choosing or not choosing certain foods differed markedly between the Saku highlands and Laisamis lowlands. This highlights the importance of contextual factors in determining their practices. Such knowledge is essential when designing interventions to improve sustainable and healthy diets, so that they are truly applicable by the targeted communities.
40202031	Electrochemical Amination of Aryl Halides with NH3.	Primary arylamines are the most pivotal class of organic motifs in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, ligands and natural products. Ammonia (NH3) is an ideal nitrogen source in terms of reactivity, atom economy, and environmental compatibility. Despite significant progress in the synthesis of primary arylamines, the development of a general method for rapid access to diversely functionalized primary arylamines is still urgent and necessary. Herein, we developed a method for the direct synthesis of primary arylamines through electrochemical amination of aryl halides with NH3. Notably, the weak nucleophilic reagent NH3 was directly used as an ammonia surrogate, allowing for efficient conversion of carbon-halogen bonds to diverse primary arylamines with good functional group tolerance. A broad scope of functionalized primary arylamines has been achieved in moderate to excellent yields.
40202030	Dihydromyricetin ameliorates hyperuricemia through inhibiting uric acid reabsorption.	Hyperuricemia (HUA) is a chronic disease caused by abnormal purine metabolism with high prevalence. Dihydromyricetin (DMY) is a natural flavonoid that is abundant in plants, such as vine tea, grapes and bayberry. DMY has been shown to possess multiple biological properties, but its anti-HUA effect remains underexplored. In the present study, the regulatory effects of DMY on HUA and its complications and mechanism were investigated.
40202029	Reconfigurable multiwavelength nanophotonic circuit based on a low-voltage, optically readable engineered resistive switch.	Nanoscale optical functionalities show promise for unconventional computing, including neuromorphic and quantum information processing. Resistive switching devices with optical readability have drawn significant research interest for high-density non-volatile memory and unconventional computing. We proposed a multiwavelength nanophotonic circuit consisting of resistive switches based on Ag-SiO<sub>2</sub>-ITO on a silicon rib structure, with the capability to electrically remove any wavelength channel(s) at will. The device featured a four-layered structure with a SiO<sub>2</sub> region positioned between an Ag top electrode and an ITO bottom electrode on p-Si, confining the hybrid plasmonic mode within the SiO<sub>2</sub> region. The application of an external voltage caused the formation/rupture of conductive filaments in the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer, affecting optical absorption through hybrid mode interactions. Experimental results showed a 27 dB extinction ratio for a 10 μm × 500 nm active device operated at ±2 V. Additionally, the circuit achieved multiwavelength functionality using identical sources and 2 × 1 couplers, enhancing reconfigurability. The higher work function of ITO helped in reducing the energy barrier for ion migration, overcoming the intrinsic resistance of the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer. This engineered nanophotonic circuit, with its high extinction ratio, excellent retention, low-voltage operation, and rapid switching speed, is suitable for advanced memory devices, high-speed optical communication, neuromorphic and quantum computation, and programmable photonic circuits.

40202023	Cross-variant immune shield: computational multiepitope vaccine design against B.617.2 to Omicron sub-lineages in SARS-CoV-2.	The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on global health. This study focuses on an in-depth analysis of the structural proteins (Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), Membrane (M), and Envelope (E) protein) of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, aiming to develop a multiepitope vaccine construct that targets the virus independently of its variants. The analysis began by examining genetic variations in viral proteins relative to the reference strain Wuhan-Hu2, particularly in the S, M, N, and E proteins. T-cell epitope predictions for MHC Class-I and Class-II binding were conducted, shedding light on potential cytotoxic and helper T lymphocyte recognition. Identification of linear B-cell epitopes laid the groundwork for antibody-based humoral immune responses. The safety and efficacy of these epitopes were assessed for antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, immunogenicity, and conservancy. Population coverage analysis indicated promising global effectiveness of the designed vaccine construct. By incorporating 28 epitopes, we validated that was designed vaccine construct for stability through structural analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations and docking studies revealed its robust interaction with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Immune simulation studies suggested that the vaccine construct could induce a potent immune response by enhancing antibody titers, B-cell proliferation, memory cell development, and activation of T cells and natural killer cells upon administration. This comprehensive approach offers a promising multiepitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, with the potential for broad global coverage and strong immunogenicity. Further experimental validation holds the prospect of introducing a novel candidate vaccine to aid in the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.
40202022	The vascular neck restraint of mixed martial arts: understanding the pathophysiology, Hemodynamics, and long-term consequences.	B Mixed martial arts (MMA) brings various forms of martial art disciplines together as a unified sport. Sportive 'choking,' also known as vascular neck compression, vascular neck restraint (VNR), or carotid restraints are utilized in MMA to apply jugular and carotid compression and subdue one's opponent. Few studies have explored the long-term consequences of VNRs, as well as the underlying pathophysiology and hemodynamics of the restraint. A narrative review was conducted in order to explore the long-term consequences of VNRs, as well as the underlying pathophysiology and hemodynamics of the restraint.
40202021	Effects of Hydration Level and Hydrogen Bonds on Hydroxide Transport Mechanisms in Anion Exchange Membranes.	The transport of hydroxide in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is generally determined by multiple factors, including hydration levels, pore morphologies, and the hydration shells of cationic groups and hydroxides. Thus, clarifying the working mechanisms would benefit the proposal of strategies for enhancing the hydroxide transport, thereby enabling a rational design of high-performance AEMs. Herein, by using ReaxFF MD simulations and RDAnalyzer, we explored the straightforward but effective correlations for steric hindrance versus hydration shell, hydration level versus Free/Associated diffusion, and strong (short) hydrogen bond (SHB) versus Vehicular/Grotthuss diffusion. Our theoretical investigations indicate that higher steric hindrance of cationic groups results in less water in the first hydration shell of cationic groups in AEMs. Meanwhile, a higher hydration level facilitates wider hydrophilic pores of AEMs and increases the ratio of the Free diffusion mechanism of hydroxides. Interestingly, we found a strong correlation between the number of SHBs and the Grotthuss diffusion, thereby enhancing the understanding of the high conductivity of COF-based AEMs that contain obvious SHBs. This work provides a theoretical view for fine-tuning the Free/Associated and Vehicular/Grotthuss transport of hydroxide in AEMs.

40202019	Bat Tongues and Foraging: Linking Morphology to Hunting Strategies.	On their dorsal surface, bat tongues show a raised muscular structure called mediodorsal lobe (MDL) or lingual prominence. It exhibits different mechanical papillae across species, which we hypothesized are linked to foraging strategies. We predicted that tall MDLs and prominent papillae pointing frontward would effectively trap prey items caught on the wing by aerial hawkers. We examined 904 high-resolution, close-up images of 239 individual bats from 24 European species, focusing on MDL height and morphology and arrangement of MDL papillae. Aerial hawkers such as Tadarida teniotis, Nyctalus lasiopterus, Miniopterus schreibersii, and pipistrelles displayed prominent forward-pointing papillae and taller MDLs, adaptations suited to high-speed aerial foraging. These traits may be part of a broader "ecomorphological syndrome", facilitating efficient prey capture in open-space foragers. In contrast, gleaning and trawling species lacked these specializations, exhibiting flatter MDLs and less prominent papillae. Phylogenetic analysis indicated evolutionary convergence in MDL morphology among aerial hawkers, with M. schreibersii showing similarities to vespertilionids despite its phylogenetic distance. This convergence highlights the influence of evolutionary pressures arising from foraging requirements on tongue morphology. Although possessing tall MDLs, rhinolophids are outliers, possibly reflecting their unique perch-hunting strategy or echolocation. If the patterns we found are confirmed for a larger number of species, MDL morphology could predict foraging style across bat species and be included in future descriptions of foraging guilds.
40202018	Impact of <i>TP53</i> mutation on survival outcomes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia at a tertiary center.	Mutations in <i>TP53</i> in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) predict poor outcomes, however, the literature in adults remains limited. In a retrospective study at Cleveland Clinic, we investigated the outcomes of 72 patients with next-generation sequencing (NGS) at baseline out of 161 patients from January 2017 to August 2023. Eleven patients had TP53 mutations (muTP53-ALL) (15.3%). Patients with muTP53-ALL were older (65 vs 56 years), had more high-risk cytogenetics (45% vs 16%), and no BCR-ABL1 rearrangements (34% vs 0) compared to wild-type TP53 (wt<i>TP53</i>). The muTP53-ALL group had lower flow-cytometry measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative responses (odds ratio: 0.1, 95%CI 0.01-0.47.8, <i>p</i> = .003) and worse 12-month overall survival (OS) compared to wtTP53 ALL (62% vs 90%, <i>p</i> = 0.023). The muTP53-ALL patients are less likely to achieve deep responses to first-line therapy and have worse long-term OS. Future studies should explore early transplants or the use of front-line immunotherapies to improve outcomes.
40202017	A New Explicit Solver for MODFLOW Enabling Small Time Step Simulations.	Surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) models, such as MODFLOW and HEC-RAS, have been explored to simulate the complexities of SW-GW interactions. However, individual models are not capable of capturing the full complexity of these interactions. To overcome individual models' shortcomings, researchers introduced the model coupling concept. This concept helps compensate for each individual model's shortcomings and incorporates the models' advantages. However, challenges arise from temporal scale disparities between SW and GW models. To tackle the temporal scale issue, this study introduces the novel explicit solver (EXP1) for MODFLOW 2005, enabling GW modeling using small time steps matching SW models (i.e., 15 min) by reducing runtime and computational burden. The EXP1 solver incorporates an integrated stability criterion to ensure the stability of explicit schemes, and it was systematically evaluated against the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) solver across various scenarios, including a 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, and a vast 3-dimensional model. Results demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of EXP1 in predicting groundwater heads and water budget, along with considerably reduced runtimes of up to 33% compared with the PCG solver, with less than 0.4% discrepancy in the water budget. These findings underscore the effectiveness of EXP1 in facilitating groundwater small time step simulations and bridging the temporal scale gap between SW and GW models.
40202016	Photoperiod insensitivity in crops.	Photoperiod, the length of daylight within a 24-hour cycle, serves as the most consistent signal for seasonal changes. Plants have developed mechanisms to adapt to these cycles, displaying well-established photoperiodic responses in traits like flowering time. The desynchronization of flowering time from photoperiod has been a pivotal factor in the global expansion of several major crops consumed today. This review provides an overview of current insights into how plants perceive photoperiod signals at the molecular level, how these signals interact with the circadian clock, and how they drive global responses, particularly through variations in flowering time. Furthermore, the review compiles known mutations that have influenced photoperiodism in crops and explores their contributions to agricultural expansion worldwide. Finally, it highlights physiological effects of photoperiodism mutations beyond flowering time, offering insights in the potential drawbacks of developing crops with improved photoperiodic adaptability.

40202011	Enhanced transdermal permeation of caffeine through a skin model using electric field-induced lipid vesicles: a novel approach for drug transport.	Caffeine is a highly beneficial compound for human health, known for its anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, particularly in protecting the skin from UVB radiation damage. Although caffeine shows excellent potential for transdermal delivery, its hydrophilic nature often requires a chemical enhancer for effective transport. Traditional methods like iontophoresis and electroporation utilize external electric fields to create micro-pores in the skin, enhancing the delivery of hydrophilic molecules. While electroporation is well understood, the molecular mechanisms of iontophoresis are unclear. This investigation presents an innovative mechanism for caffeine transport from an aqueous solution without chemical enhancers using lipid vesicles generated by external electric fields. To investigate the caffeine transdermal transport process, we combined our iontophoresis methodology with molecular dynamics simulations using Gromacs and the Martini force field alongside a practical custom experiment. Our approach employed a constant electric field of 22-25 mV nm<sup>-1</sup>, successfully generating lipid vesicles that transport caffeine molecules. Notably, alternating electric fields at 306 K (physiological skin temperature) increased caffeine transport by 20%, and at 323 K, we achieved an impressive 300% increase compared to scenarios without electric fields. Our homemade Franz cell setup showed a permeation rate dependent on the electric field correlated with vesicle formation. Additionally, hyperspectral Raman mapping identified unsaturated carbon and C-N groups as key contributors to vesicle and pore instability. This groundbreaking approach offers significant potential for enhancing transdermal drug delivery systems.
40202010	Integrating religion and spirituality with psychotherapy in a religiously diverse nation-A mixed methods study on client attitudes and experiences in Singapore.	<b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to investigate clients' perspectives on the integration of religion/spirituality (R/S) with psychotherapy in Singapore, a religiously diverse nation. It was hypothesized that clients would report R/S integration to have a positive impact (H1), initiate R/S discussions (H2), and their R/S and perception of the religious context would be associated with their attitudes towards R/S integrated psychotherapy (H3). A cross-sectional mixed-methods design was employed. <b>Methods:</b> Participants were 275 Singapore psychotherapy clients (52.3% male, 46.9% female, 8% non-binary/third gender). Mean age was 34.93 years (<i>SD</i> = 9.95). Participants completed a questionnaire comprised of demographical items, psychotherapy experiences, various R/S-related measures and qualitative questions on considerations and opinions on R/S integrated psychotherapy. <b>Results:</b> Clients reported that R/S integrated psychotherapy (RSIP) had a positive impact and that they were the main initiator. Considering R/S as supportive during adversity and perceptions of the religious context were associated with attitudes towards integration. Unexpectedly, R/S diversity appeared to have a facilitatory effect on RSIP. Qualitative findings revealed client's experiences and perspectives, including their expectations towards therapists. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings highlight the importance of therapists' R/S competency. In R/S diverse contexts, therapists may require greater sensitivity, openness, and the ability to work with clients holding diverse R/S beliefs.

40202007	Applications of spatial transcriptomics in studying spermatogenesis.	Spermatogenesis is a complex differentiation process that is facilitated by a series of cellular and molecular events. High-throughput genomics approaches, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, have begun to enable the systematic characterization of these events. However, the loss of tissue context because of tissue disassociations in the single-cell isolation protocols limits our ability to understand the regulation of spermatogenesis and how defects in spermatogenesis lead to infertility. The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics technologies enables the studying of the molecular signatures of various cell types and their interactions in the native tissue context. In this review, we discuss how spatial transcriptomics has been leveraged to identify spatially variable genes, characterize cellular neighborhood, delineate cell‒cell communications, and detect molecular changes under pathological conditions in the mammalian testis. We believe that spatial transcriptomics, along with other emerging spatially resolved omics assays, can be utilized to further our understanding of the underlying causes of male infertility, and to facilitate the development of new treatment approaches.

Vegetable oils are used to generate various biobased functional polymers like polyester, polyamide, poly(ester amide)s, polyurethane, and photocurable resins. These polymers have demonstrated a wide range of applications, including coating materials, fire retardants, and adhesives, and have also been explored in biomedical research. This review provides a comprehensive discussion on developing various polymers derived from vegetable oils, which show promise in biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, antimicrobial, tissue adhesives, and biosensor applications. Additionally, the review highlights the challenges and future opportunities associated with these sustainably sourced biobased polymers.
40201985	Role of noncontrast enhanced abdominal ultrasound in the diagnostic assessment of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.	Assessment of small bowel involvement when diagnosing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) delineates clinical subtype and disease extension. The gold standard for small bowel assessment is magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), but MRE is not always feasible for children. Standard, non-contrast enhanced abdominal ultrasound is an acceptable alternative. The study aimed to evaluate the utility of ultrasound in the diagnostic work-up of pediatric IBD to identify small bowel involvement.
40201984	Rh(III)-Catalyzed Indole Dearomative 1,2-Alkoxyl Shift Rearrangement.	A Rh(III)-catalyzed dearomative C3 alkoxylation of indoles via cascade C(sp<sup>2</sup>)-H activation and 1,2-alkoxyl shift rearrangement has been developed. This method provides an efficient strategy to rapidly assemble 3-alkoxyindolin-2-one scaffolds using alcohols as alkoxyl sources. Mechanistic studies indicate that indolyl C2 alkoxylation followed by Ag(I)/Cu(II)-mediated 1,2-alkoxyl migration is involved in this transformation.

40201980	Impact of Targeted Outreach to Increase Linkage to Preventative Services for Patients Tested for Mpox.	Early in the Mpox outbreak, individuals presenting for Mpox testing often did not receive comprehensive sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening upon presentation. This study aims to assess the impact of targeted outreach on linkage to STI and HIV screening and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) counseling for individuals presenting for Mpox testing. Individuals who had tested for Mpox were contacted via an existing STI outreach team in Dallas, Texas, to engage in STI/HIV screening and other preventive services between June 2022 and March 2023. On retrospective chart review, 414 individuals were tested for Mpox with 203 PCR-confirmed cases. 238/414 (58%) were previously diagnosed with HIV. 76/176 (43%) of individuals with unknown HIV status were screened for HIV, and six new cases of HIV were identified. One-third (136/414) were also tested for other STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis), with 45 new cases identified. 94/414 (23%) individuals were contacted for outreach after initial Mpox testing. Patients who received outreach were more likely to be tested for HIV (10/26 [38.4%]) compared with those who did not receive outreach (19/144 [13.3%]) (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and more likely to undergo additional STI testing (58/94 [62%] vs. 109/320 [34%]) (<i>p</i> < 0.001). More individuals in the outreach group were counseled on starting PrEP than in the non-outreach group (14/26 [53.8%] vs. 8/144 [5.6%]) (<i>p</i> = 0.0016). Targeted outreach increased screening for HIV and other STIs and counseling for PrEP among patients presenting for Mpox testing. Strategies to increase linkage to preventive services are needed to reduce coinfections of Mpox, HIV, and other STIs.
40201979	Feasibility of a Mobile Exergame for Patients with Heart Failure.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> Physical activity is beneficial and recommended to improve outcomes for patients with heart failure (HF). Exergaming combines gaming technology with physical activity. Therefore, we developed a mobile exergame in a co-design process, the exergame would engage participants in physical activity anywhere and anytime. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a newly developed mobile exergame, heart farming, for patients with HF. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A total of 14 participants with HF used the exergame on their smartphones for one month (9 Swedish and 5 Spanish participants; 9 males, mean 72 years, range 61-82 years). Participants were provided an introduction to the exergame, and follow-up was carried out regularly by telephone. Participants were advised to increase the daily walking duration by 10 minutes a day, based on the number of meters walked in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Areas of feasibility identified were acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality, which were examined during telephone follow-ups and interviews, and data downloaded from the exergame. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Participants found the farming theme appealing, and coaching encouraged them to perform the exergame on a regular basis (acceptability). Based on the 6MWT, the personal goal for daily walking was set (mean of 704 meters, range 250-900 meters). Participants reported that daily goals and tasks were manageable. The exergame was perceived as appropriate to decrease sedentary time, and participants reported improved physical health (demand). The exergame was perceived as easy to learn and use, and adjustable to individual needs (implementation). Exergaming while walking and conversing with others was described as less convenient (practicality). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Participants with HF valued personalized support and the exergame's farming theme was appealing. The goal to increase walking by 10 minutes a day was seen as a realistic way to reduce sedentary behavior. When introducing the exergame, it is essential to emphasize the importance of proper lighting, so meters walked are accurately recorded.
40201978	FT-GNN Tool for Bridging HRMS Features and Bioactivity: Uncovering Unidentified Estrogen Receptor Agonists in Sewage.	Identifying primary estrogen receptor (ER) agonists in municipal sewage is essential for ensuring the health of aquatic environments. Given the complex and variable chemical composition of sewage, the predominant ER agonists remain unclear. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based models have been developed to predict compound bioactivity in complex matrices, but further optimization is needed to effectively bridge HRMS features with ER agonists. To address this challenge, an FT-GNN (fragmentation tree-based graph neural network) model was proposed. Given limited data and class imbalance, data augmentation was performed using model predictions within the applicability domain (AD) and oversampling technique (OTE). Model development results demonstrated that integrating the FT-GNN with data augmentation improved the balanced accuracy (bACC) value by 6%-31%. The developed model, with a high bACC to identify more true ER agonists, efficiently classified tens of thousands of unidentified HRMS features in sewage, reducing postprocessing workload in nontargeted screening. Analysis of ER agonist transformation during sewage treatment revealed the anaerobic stage as key to both their removal and formation. Estrogenic effect balance analysis suggests that α-E2 and 9,11-didehydroestriol may be two previously overlooked key ER agonists. Collectively, the development and application of the FT-GNN model are crucial advancements toward credible tracking and efficient control of estrogenic risks in water.

40201976	Nanoscale warriors against viral invaders: a comprehensive review of Nanobodies as potential antiviral therapeutics.	Viral infections remain a significant global health threat, with emerging and reemerging viruses causing epidemics and pandemics. Despite advancements in antiviral therapies, the development of effective treatments is often hindered by challenges, such as viral resistance and the emergence of new strains. In this context, the development of novel therapeutic modalities is essential to combat notorious viruses. While traditional monoclonal antibodies are widely used for the treatment of several diseases, nanobodies derived from heavy chain-only antibodies have emerged as promising "nanoscale warriors" against viral infections. Nanobodies possess unique structural properties that enhance their ability to recognize diverse epitopes. Their small size also imparts properties, such as improved bioavailability, solubility, stability, and proteolytic resistance, making them an ideal class of therapeutics for viral infections. In this review, we discuss the role of nanobodies as antivirals against various viruses. Techniques used for developing nanobodies, delivery strategies are covered, and the challenges and opportunities associated with their use as antiviral therapies are discussed. We also offer insights into the future of nanobody-based antiviral research to support the development of new strategies for managing viral infections.

40201973	The role of resource defensibility in facilitating sexually-selected weapon evolution: An experimental evolution test.	Animal weapons have evolved multiple times primarily for battling for access to mates. Despite intra-sexual selection being common, exaggerated weapons have evolved relatively rarely. So why do exaggerated weapons not evolve more commonly? It has been hypothesized that three conditions are necessary for evolution of exaggerated weapons: high variance in reproductive success, patchy, high-value resources, and spatial environments conducive to one-on-one competition. Here, we test this hypothesis by performing experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster, utilizing heterogeneous environments where conditions facilitating territorial defense and opportunities for competitive interactions vary. We examine changes in sexually dimorphic morphology and male aggression that are predicted to occur, based on this model. We also examine whether condition dependence for sexual dimorphism has evolved after 35 and 75 generations of experimental evolution. Aggression did increase, albeit modestly, in environments that facilitate resource defense. Morphological changes are modest although with some trait specific changes to allometry, generally in the opposite direction of our predictions. Condition dependence trends in the opposite direction from those predicted by our hypothesis as well. We discuss our results in the context of the necessary conditions for the evolution of exaggerated weapons, and if, and when condition dependence may evolve.
40201972	In intercalation and an Si-containing protective layer enhance the electrochemical performance of NaNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for sodium-ion batteries.	To enhance the electrochemical performance of NaNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NM) cathode material for sodium-ion batteries, a novel indium-intercalated NaNi<sub>0.5-<i>x</i></sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>In<sub><i>x</i></sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathode material enriched with oxygen vacancies was first synthesized <i>via</i> a high-shear co-precipitation method. Subsequently, a thin Si-containing protective layer was produced on the surface through the interfacial reaction between oxygen vacancies and tetraethyl orthosilicate. Results of performance evaluation and characterization tests, including <i>in situ</i> XRD, Ar<sup>+</sup> sputtering XPS, and HAADF-STEM, indicated that the optimal sample Si<sub><i>y</i></sub>@NaNi<sub>0.497</sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>In<sub>0.003</sub>O<sub>2-<i>y</i></sub> exhibited superior initial discharge capacity of 125.0 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> (0.1 C) and excellent capacity retention of 98.4% after 100 cycles at 1 C. In particular, the Si<i>@</i>In-doped sample offered larger lattice spacing, higher Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion rate and better conductivity than the In-intercalated sample and pristine NM. DFT calculations illustrated that In preferentially substituted the Mn site, while Si preferred to substitute the Ni site closer to the In-intercalating location. The Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion energy barrier was greatly reduced with In intercalation and Si doping. Such a facile strategy to augment the lattice spacing of the O3-layer cathode while producing a thin protective layer using the oxygen vacancies on the surface has promising applications to explore new cathode materials with high electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries.
40201965	A Sensorized Mechanically Self-Guided Suction Cup for Improved Adhesion in Complex Environments.	Octopuses can effectively interact with environments using their agile suction cups, in which abundant neuroreceptors are embodied inside. Inspired by this, we proposed an electronics-integrated self-guided adhesive suction cup (E-SGAS) capable of environmental sensing and adaptively adhesion on diverse surfaces. E-SGAS features an inflatable adhesive membrane and an under-actuated design, enabling it to adapt to various angles and surface roughness under low preloads. A theoretical model is presented to predict self-guided adhesion outcomes. The integrated multilayer stretchable liquid metal sensory circuit (with a maximum deformation rate of 186%) in the adhesive membrane allows for detecting expansion, contact, suction, leakage, and surface roughness. E-SGAS can also process the sensory information to guide intelligent gripping in various complex environments. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of E-SGAS to autonomously grip under a preload force of 0.11 N, a maximum adhesion force of 57.9N, and a detachment force of only 0.34 N. It can adhere to surfaces up to 60-grit roughness and accommodate a surface with a relative angle of 90°. We also show that E-SGAS can capture flying objects or work in a confined space. The proposed adhesion and sensing strategies aim to enhance the performance and expand the application range of suction cup-like grippers. E-SGAS's results can provide design insights into creating stretchable electronics-integrated bioinspired adhesive systems that can interact with unconstructed environments.
40201964	Stepwise transformation of a redox-active tetradentate ONNO ligand in the coordination sphere of tin(IV).	New diorganotin(IV) complexes based on a redox-active tetradentate ONNO ligand, namely <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>'-bis(3,5-di-<i>tert</i>-butyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-phenylenediamine (LH<sub>4</sub>), were synthesized. A methodology for the stepwise oxidation of tin(IV)-ONNO derivatives with a stoichiometric amount of <i>p</i>-benzoquinone was developed. This allowed the preparation of tin(IV) complexes containing the ligand in the tetraanionic doubly deprotonated form, in the dianionic state, and a controlled intraligand cyclization to be carried out. It has been found that the diorganotin(IV) compounds with the dianionic form of the ONNO ligand have a ground singlet spin state, but an increase in temperature leads to partial populating of the triplet state and a transition from the diamagnetic form of these complexes to the paramagnetic biradical ones. The UV-vis-NIR spectrum of L<sup>2-</sup>SnPh<sub>2</sub> shows an intense absorption band in the range of 600-1400 nm, corresponding to the intraligand charge transfer (ILCT). The coordination ability of the solvent strongly influences the position of this solvatochromic band. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that this compound undergoes two sequential reversible single-electron oxidations and two sequential reversible single-electron reductions. This cyclic voltammetry remains unchanged even after 100 cycles have been performed.
40201963	Loss of diurnal oscillatory rhythms in gut microbiota correlates with progression of atherosclerosis.	Circadian rhythms in gut microbiota composition are crucial for metabolic function and disease progression, yet the diurnal oscillation patterns of gut microbiota in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and their role in disease progression remain unknown. Here, we investigated gut bacterial dynamics in <i>Apoe</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice over 24 hours and elucidated dynamic changes in fecal microbiota composition and function among C57BL/6 and <i>Apoe</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice with standard chow diet or high-fat/high-cholesterol diet under <i>ad libitum</i> conditions. Compared with C57BL/6 mice, <i>Apoe</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited significant differences in fecal microbial composition. Rhythmicity analysis revealed that the temporal dynamics of fecal microbiota composition and function in <i>Apoe</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice differed significantly from those in C57BL/6 mice, particularly in <i>B. coccoides</i>-dominated oscillatory modules. Functional annotation showed that rhythmic <i>B. coccoides</i> strains inhibited ASCVD progression by enhancing intestinal and endothelial barrier functions. These findings demonstrate that diurnal oscillations in gut microbiota are closely associated with ASCVD progression and provide new insights for microbiota-targeted precision therapies.

40201961	Paper and cloth-based microfluidic chips for rapid cysteine detection in deep-sea cold seeps.	In this study, we developed a simple and cost-effective paper and cloth-based microfluidic fluorescence sensing device for the selective and quantitative detection of L-cysteine (L-Cys) in deep-sea water, addressing the need for efficient monitoring of this critical metabolite of deep-sea creatures which acts as a biomarker for tracking these organisms. The device employs gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) immobilized on a cloth-based substrate and rhodamine B (Rh B) molecules. In the presence of L-Cys, strong interactions between L-Cys and the Au NPs release Rh B molecules, restoring fluorescence proportional to the cysteine concentration. The device achieves a low detection limit of 0.52 nM with a dynamic range of 1-100 nM. It demonstrates excellent selectivity over other amino acids, stability over 30 days, and reproducibility. Its practical applicability was confirmed using deep-sea cold seep water samples, yielding recoveries of 98.07%-102.62%. Compared to existing methods, this platform offers enhanced portability, lower cost, and faster response, making it suitable for <i>in situ</i> environmental monitoring.
40201960	Shear Viscosity of Quasi-Two-Dimensional Ionic Liquids.	The shear viscosity (η) and kinetic friction coefficient (μ) of highly confined, quasi-two-dimensional ionic liquids (2D ILs) subject to stationary linear flow at constant temperature are studied in this work through coarse-grained numerical simulations. Using stationary state linear flow under increasing shear rate (γ̇), η and μ are predicted as functions of γ̇ for growing coupling constant values (Γ*). The structural changes of the fluid due to the increasing coupling of the charged particles are found to yield increasing shear viscosity and friction coefficient. Shear-thinning is found in all systems, regardless of the value of Γ*. Additionally, it is shown that η and μ obey universal scaling laws, η ∼ γ̇<sup>ζ</sup> and μ ∼ γ̇<sup>κ</sup>, respectively, with the exponents fulfilling the relationship κ - ζ = 1, in agreement with previous reports by other groups. The implications of our predictions are discussed, in the context of current applications.
40201959	Global Prevalence and Distribution of H9 Subtype of Avian Influenza Viruses in Wild Birds: Literature Review with Meta-Analysis.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> As a natural accelerator of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds, the H9 subtype of avian influenza poses a substantial threat to both humans and the poultry industry. A comprehensive meta-analysis is necessary to assess the current status of the global H9 outbreak. In this research, a literature review and meta-analysis are presented on the surveillance studies of the H9 subtype of avian influenza in wild birds worldwide up to 2024. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A comprehensive search strategy was employed, utilizing the China Science and Technology Journal Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scientific Direct databases. The exclusion criteria for this study included duplicate studies, reviews, other host studies, as well as research with inconsistent or insufficient data. An analysis was conducted on data obtained from a total of 31 publications. The rate-conversion analyses were conducted using a random-effects model in the "meta" package of the "R" software, with the PFT method implemented. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In the meta-analysis, the prevalence of wild bird H9 avian influenza virus (AIV) was found to be 0.02% (193 out of 365,972). Statistically significant higher prevalences of wild bird influenza A virus were observed in Norway and South Africa (0.87%, 21/2417 and 0.44%, 10/1155, respectively) in comparison with other regions. Within the <i>Anseriformes</i> family, the prevalence rate was much greater (0.17%, 80 out of 90,014) compared with other species. In addition, we performed subgroup analyses that included geographical variables. These assessments showed a higher prevalence of H9 in wild birds in cold regions (0.08%, 30/100,691). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> In summary, our results suggest that the occurrence of H9 AIV in avian populations differs among different geographical areas and species. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further surveillance on the prevalence of AIV in wild birds to guide the creation of strong and efficient regulatory strategies targeted at eradicating the transmission of AIV across different species.
40201957	Advancements in microfluidic technology for rapid bacterial detection and inflammation-driven diseases.	Bacterial detection is pivotal for the timely diagnosis and effective treatment of infectious diseases. Microfluidic platforms offer advantages over traditional methods, including heightened sensitivity, rapid analysis, and minimal sample volume requirements. Traditional clinical methods for bacterial identification often involve extended processing times and necessitate high pathogen concentrations, resulting in delayed diagnoses and missed treatment opportunities. Microfluidic technology overcomes these limitations by facilitating rapid bacterial identification at lower biomass levels, thus ensuring prompt and precise treatment interventions. Additionally, bacteria-driven inflammation has been associated with the development and progression of various diseases, including cancer. Elucidating the complex interplay between bacteria, inflammation, and disease is essential for devising effective disease models and therapeutic strategies. Microfluidic platforms have been used to construct <i>in vitro</i> disease models that accurately replicate the intricate microenvironment that bacteria-driven inflammation affects. These models offer valuable insights into bacteria-driven inflammation and its impact on disease progression, such as cancer metastasis and therapeutic responses. This review examines recent advancements in bacterial detection using microfluidics and assesses the potential of this technology as a robust tool for exploring bacteria-driven inflammation in the context of cancer.
40201956	Salinity tolerance in wheat: rethinking the targets.	Wheat is the major staple food in the human diet but its production under current climate scenarios is problematic, giving the predicted extent of land salinization and the fact that wheat is highly sensitive to soil salinity. This work aims to critically assess previous breeding efforts and pros- and cons- of targeting SOS1 and HKT1 genes to improve salinity stress tolerance in wheat. We argue that overexpressing SOS1 genes encoding Na+/H+ exchangers for Na+ removal from root to the rhizosphere may come with a caveat of increased loading of Na+ into the xylem and its delivery to the shoot, as well as numerous pleiotropic effects. Similarly, targeting HKT1 transporters for removing Na+ from the shoot comes with significant yield penalties due to the high carbon cost for osmotic adjustment; this strategy is also limited by the relatively small capacity of the root to store excessive Na+ without experiencing toxicity symptoms. We suggest that targeting tissue tolerance traits such as K+ retention in mesophyll and vacuolar Na+ sequestration in the shoot will be able to deliver better outcomes. We also call for a better understanding of the structure-function relationships of various isoforms for key genes involved in maintenance of Na+ and K+ homeostasis and a need for more in-depth physiological studies of wheat species with DD genome; a key contributor to tissue tolerance traits. Our arguments are supported by the bioinformatic analysis of the number of orthologs for some key gene between hexaploidy (AABBDD) and tetraploid (AABB) wheats and their structural differences.

In previous adeno-associated viral gene therapy trials, <50% of ventricular myocytes have generally been transduced.
40201953	How to reflect critically on your clinical practice in older people nursing.	Critical reflection increases nurses' competence by providing them with a method for analysing complex situations and learning from them. Reflecting critically on their practice enables nurses to recognise and question their values, beliefs and assumptions. This is essential when caring for older people because unconscious bias increases the risk of ageism and can lead to decisions that negatively affect the care provided - for example, decisions that reduce patients' autonomy and agency. This article outlines the steps nurses can take to reflect critically on their clinical practice in older people nursing, using a reflective model constructed around three key questions: 'What?', 'So what?' and 'Now what?' • Critical reflection is an essential aspect of the nurse's role that supports the continuous improvement of practice. • Critical reflection involves examining one's thoughts, feelings and actions to better understand oneself and reduce the risk of unconscious bias. • Reflecting on clinical practice can support nurses to find a balance between managing the challenges of work and maintaining their emotional well-being. REFLECTIVE ACTIVITY: 'How to' articles can help to update your practice and ensure it remains evidence based. Apply this article to your practice. Reflect on and write a short account of: • How this article might improve your critical reflection on clinical practice in older people nursing. • How you could use this information to educate nursing students or your colleagues on reflecting critically on clinical practice in older people nursing.
40201952	High-Entropy Spinel Oxide Nanostructures as Stable Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.	Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) represent a promising clean energy technology for efficient chemical-to-electrical energy conversion with minimal environmental impact. However, the development of cathode materials that can maintain both high performance and long-term stability remains challenging, particularly due to the degradation of nanostructured cathodes caused by particle coarsening. This study employs an impregnation method to fabricate high-entropy spinel oxide (Mg<sub>0.2</sub>Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>Ni<sub>0.2</sub>Cu<sub>0.2</sub>)Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (MFCNCF) nanoparticles with varying loadings on a porous Ce<sub>0.9</sub>Gd<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>1.95</sub> (GDC) skeleton. The optimized cathode with 30 wt % MFCNCF loading achieves a remarkably low polarization resistance of 0.12 Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> and maximum power density of 1063.94 mW·cm<sup>-2</sup> at 800 °C. Most significantly, the entropy stabilization effect enables the high-entropy spinel oxide nanoparticles to maintain their microstructure throughout 240 h of operation with negligible performance degradation. The study introduces a novel strategy combining high-entropy design with nanostructure engineering to develop stable and high-performance cathode materials for SOFCs.
40201951	Mining and validating quorum sensing interference molecules from food-derived compounds for <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium.	Food-derived compounds represent a promising reservoir for developing novel therapeutic agents against pathogenic infections such as <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium. In this study, we integrated computational biology with experimental validation to identify and characterize quorum sensing interference molecules (QSIMs) from food-derived compounds. Through structure-based virtual screening of more than 8000 compounds in the FooDB database, we identified the potential candidates (such as skatole, 2-aminoquinoline, tricarballylic acid, and L-3-phenyllactic acid) demonstrating high affinity binding to the LsrB receptor, as validated by surface plasmon resonance analysis. We further evaluated the performances of the aforementioned QSIMs on strain growth, biofilm formation, and motility. Furthermore, we have also deciphered the corresponding mechanisms and verified the effectiveness of the obtained QSIMs. Finally, we discussed the opportunities and challenges in the development of food-derived QSIMs for weakening virulence, reducing infection and relieving drug resistance of some other pathogens.

The structural and electronic properties of iron carbide clusters Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>-/0</sup> (<i>n</i> = 2-6) were investigated using size-selected anion photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The adiabatic and vertical detachment energies of Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>-</sup> (<i>n</i> = 2-6) were obtained from their photoelectron spectra. The ground state structures of Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>-</sup> (<i>n</i> = 2-6) were determined by comparing the theoretical results with the experimental data. The most stable isomers of Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>-</sup> adopt planar structures, except for Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub>5</sub><sup>-</sup>, in which the carbon atoms deviate slightly from the plane. The ground state structures of neutral Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub><i>n</i></sub> clusters are generally similar to their corresponding anions, except for Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>, which adopts a planar cyclic structure containing a <i>C</i><sub>3</sub> unit. The magnetic moments of the Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>-</sup> clusters are 7<i>μ</i><sub>B</sub> for even sizes and 5<i>μ</i><sub>B</sub> for odd sizes, whereas those of neutral Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub><i>n</i></sub> are 8<i>μ</i><sub>B</sub> (6<i>μ</i><sub>B</sub> for <i>n</i> = 2) for even sizes and 6<i>μ</i><sub>B</sub> for odd sizes. The magnetic moments primarily originate from Fe atoms. The Fe-Fe bond lengths increase gradually with the growth of the cluster size, resulting in the transition from double-bond to single-bond character. The spin multiplicities and relative stabilities of Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>-</sup> exhibit odd-even alternations.
40201949	Persistence of the ecological niche in pond damselflies underlies a stable adaptive zone despite varying selection.	Following the development of regression-based methods to estimate natural and sexual selection, evolutionary biologists have quantified the strength, mode and direction of selection in natural populations. Although this approach has been successful, its limitations include the lack of replication across species, which compromises the generality of the inferences beyond microevolutionary time scales. Here, we carried out a comparative study of selection on wing shape and body size across multiple populations of two closely related pond damselflies: Enallagma cyathigerum and Ischnura elegans (Odonata: Coenagrionidae). We found weak stabilizing selection on wing shape in both sexes, and no evidence that selection on this trait differed between the species. In contrast, selection on body size was curvilinear in males and directional in females, with differences in form (males) and intensity (females) between the species. By analyzing selection in each local pond, we found that selection on male body size was shaped by various population characteristics that reflect local mating systems. Furthermore, the relationship between mating system characteristics and directional selection was remarkably consistent across these species. Finally, we present a graphical model that links contemporary selection with macroevolution. Based on this model, we conclude that the persistence of ecological modes of life in pond damselflies explains why varying selection in nature may still result in a stable adaptive zone lasting millions of years.
40201948	<i>In situ</i> SEIRAS analysis of enhanced photocatalytic carrier transfer to a Pt cocatalyst induced by sacrificial reagents.	<i>In situ</i> SEIRAS analyses revealed a peak shift of adsorbed CO on Pt cocatalysts supported on TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts in the presence of sacrificial reagents. This observation suggests that charge separation from the photocatalysts to the cocatalysts was enhanced, leading to negative potential shifts that promote hydrogen evolution.
40201947	Efficient prediction of the local electronic structure of ionic liquids from low-cost calculations.	Understanding and predicting ionic liquid (IL) electronic structure is crucial for their development, as local, atomic-scale electrostatic interactions control both the ion-ion and ion-dipole interactions that underpin all applications of ILs. Core-level binding energies, <i>E</i><sub>B</sub>(core), from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments capture the electrostatic potentials at nuclei, thus offering significant insight into IL local electronic structure. However, our ability to measure XPS for the many thousands of possible ILs is limited. Here we use an extensive experimental XPS dataset comprised of 44 ILs to comprehensively validate the ability of a very low-cost and technically accessible calculation method, lone-ion-SMD (solvation model based on density) density functional theory (DFT), to produce high quality <i>E</i><sub>B</sub>(core) for 14 cations and 30 anions. Our method removes the need for expensive and technically challenging calculation methods to obtain <i>E</i><sub>B</sub>(core), thus giving the possibility to efficiently predict local electronic structure and understand electrostatic interactions at the atomic scale. We demonstrate the ability of the lone-ion SMD method to predict the speciation of halometallate anions in ILs.
40201946	Unilateral thermosensitive Janus hemostatic dressing for matching coagulation physiological processes.	Hemostatic dressings are a simple and effective method for managing bleeding emergencies. Based on the blood coagulation process, hemostatic dressings work optimally by aggregating hemocytes and releasing coagulation factors, sealing blood in a sequential manner. Janus materials, which have different compartmentalized components, have the ability to independently perform multiple functions. In this study, a Janus nonwoven fabric with thermo-sensitivity on one side, is designed to be consistent with the physiological process of coagulation. When utilized for hemostasis, the poly(<i>N</i>-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) side of the Janus material undergoes a phase transition within 1 minute. Prior to this, it adsorbs blood at the injured site and aggregates hemocytes to form a primary thrombus; afterwards, it helps sealing the site to decrease blood loss. During this process, the bioactive glass (BG) side continuously releases SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>4-</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> to activate coagulation factors and accelerate the cascade reaction. The phase transition and hydrophilic/hydrophobic transition of the material are triggered by body temperature and are rapidly completed, just like clicking a switch. In a rat femoral artery model, the blood loss using Janus BG-PNIPAM was only 0.15 g, which is 17.4% and 20.0% the blood loss level achieved by CN and QuikClot® gauze, respectively. Furthermore, the biosafety profile of Janus BG-PNIPAM provides assurance for potential clinical applications.

Gas sensors are essential tools for safeguarding public health and safety because they allow the detection of hazardous gases. To advance gas-sensing technologies, novel sensing materials with distinct properties are needed. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great potential because of their extensive surface areas, high porosity, unique chemical properties, and capabilities for preconcentration and molecular sieving. These attributes make MOFs highly suitable for designing and creating innovative resistive gas sensors. This review article examines resistive gas sensors made from pristine, doped, decorated, and composite MOFs. The first part of the review focuses on the synthesis strategies of MOFs, while the second part discusses MOF-based resistive gas sensors that operate based on changes in resistance.
40201944	<i>Schisandra Chinensis</i> Polysaccharide Ameliorates Renal Dysfunction by Inhibiting Inflammatory Reactions and Oxidative Stress in Diabetic Rats.	<i>Schisandra chinensis</i> (<i>S. chinensis</i>) polysaccharide (SCP) is an active ingredient from <i>S. chinensis</i> used mainly for the treatment of diabetes, owing to its antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and lipidemic-modulating activities. A rat type II diabetes mellitus model was established by giving rats a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) to investigate the protective effect of SCP against renal injury in diabetic rats. It was found in this study that fasting blood glucose, serum lipids, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels were decreased, the insulin sensitivity was increased, and pathological injuries of the kidney were alleviated in SCP-treated groups, indicating that SCP should have a protective effect against renal injury in diabetic rats. SCP treatment reduced serum C-reactive protein and inhibited the expression of nuclear factors-κB and related inflammatory factors in the renal tissue of diabetic rats. SCP treatment also regulated the expression of Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) like-2, heme oxygenase-1, and kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1, reduced serum malondialdehyde content, and increased superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, SCP down-regulated the expression of fibronectin, α-SMA, transforming growth factor β1, and p-Smad3, up-regulated Smad7 expression, and mitigated the collagen fiber deposition in the renal interstitium in diabetic rats. It can be concluded that the mechanism of SCP in alleviating renal injury may be related to inhibiting inflammation, increasing antioxidant stress capacity, and improving renal fibrosis in diabetic rats.
40201943	Semiclassical Approach to Computing Vibrationally Resolved Ionization Cross Sections for Molecular Nitrogen.	A semiclassical model based on the Gryzinski theory is used to compute vibrationally resolved electron-impact ionization cross sections for molecular nitrogen. This model extends the approach used by Wünderlich for molecular hydrogen and its isotopomeres. The multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method in Molpro is used with complete active space self-consistent field reference wave functions to compute potential energy curves (PECs) and electronic wave functions for several states of interest. Nuclear wave functions and vibrational energy levels are computed from the MRCI PECs using the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method. The target orbital electron kinetic energies, Franck-Condon factors, and transition energies are parameters for the semiclassical model and are calculated directly from the computed electronic and nuclear wave functions and vibrational energy levels. The target electron kinetic energies are computed as the expectation value of the one-electron kinetic energy operator for the product of the appropriate nuclear vibrational wave function and the MRCI natural orbital for a particular state-to-state ionization process. From the fully vibrationally resolved ionization cross sections, lumped and total cross sections are calculated by summing the partial cross sections over the closure relationship of the Franck-Condon theory.
40201942	Atomic Hydrogen Promotes Polyparaphenylene Fusion into Graphene Nanoribbons on Au(111).	Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) hold significant potential for applications in semiconductor electronics. Compared to precursor design, the lateral fusion of polymers offers a versatile and flexible approach to producing GNRs with desirable properties. Developing effective methods to enhance lateral fusion is therefore highly desirable. In this study, the beneficial effects of atomic hydrogen (AH) are reported in promoting the lateral fusion of polyparaphenylene (PPP) chains into GNRs on Au(111). When PPP chains are treated with AH at 570 K, the threshold temperature for GNR formation by lateral fusion is reduced to 590 K, a substantial decrease from the 650 K required for the formation of GNR by postannealing without AH. The promoting effect of AH is attributed to the superhydrogenation of PPP chains at 570 K, which 1) locally disrupts π-aromaticity, and 2) facilitates closer proximity of PPP chains. Both effects aid in the dehydrogenative C-C coupling of PPP chains. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES) are used to identify reaction products and monitor reaction pathways. The demonstrated role of AH in this study may be extended to other systems involving the lateral fusion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-based polymers.
40201941	Dynamics of Spatial Organization of Bacterial Communities in a Tunable Flow Gut Microbiome-on-a-Chip.	The human intestine, a biomechanically active organ, generates cyclic mechanical forces crucial for maintaining its health and functions. Yet, the physiological impact of these forces on gut microbiota dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate how cyclic intestinal motility influences the dynamics of gut microbial communities within a 3D gut-like structure (µGut). To enable the study, a tunable flow Gut Microbiome-on-a-Chip (tfGMoC) is developed that recapitulates the cyclic expansion and compression of intestinal motility while allowing high-magnification imaging of microbial communities within a 3D stratified, biomimetic gut epithelium. Using deep learning-based microbial analysis, it is found that hydrodynamic forces organize microbial communities by promoting distinct spatial exploration behaviors in microorganisms with varying motility characteristics. Empirical evidence demonstrates the impact of gut motility forces in maintaining a balanced gut microbial composition, enhancing both the diversity and stability of the community - key factors for a healthy microbiome. This study, leveraging the new tfGMoC platform, uncovers previously unknown effects of intestinal motility on modulating gut microbial behaviors and community organizations. This will be critical for a deeper understanding of host-microbiome interactions in the emerging field of microbiome therapeutics.

40201937	Granular flow-solid wall interaction: investigation of the teapot effect.	The evolution of granular flows generally involves solid boundaries, which add complexity to their dynamics and pose challenges to understand relevant natural and industrial phenomena. While an interesting "teapot effect" has been observed for liquid flowing over the solid surface of a teapot's spout, a similar phenomenon for discrete particles receives far less attention. In this work, we experimentally investigated the interactions between granular flows and a wedge-shaped solid edge (spout), showing that the trailing edge of the solid boundary plays a key role in causing velocity non-uniformity and splitting the flow into "dispersed" and "uniform" regions. Tuning the parameters (inclination angle, particle diameter, radii and surface roughness of the trailing edge) of the granular flow, a dimensionless number was summarized and successfully predicted the dispersion of the granular flows. Moreover, we also proved that introducing stronger cohesive forces between particles could harness the granular flows from heterogenous structures to grain clusters, which can be employed to switch between different flow regimes and regulate the dispersion behavior of particle flows. This study reveals the interaction of granular flow over complex solid boundaries, potentially offering new insights into particle-dominated flow dynamics.
40201936	Organic Radiosensitizer with Aggregation-Induced Emission Characteristics for Tumor Ablation through Synergistic Apoptosis and Immunogenic Cell Death.	Inspired by the clinical application of thermotherapy to promote the efficacy of radiotherapy, this study demonstrates the multimodal diagnostic application of pure organic nanoparticles in the combined treatment of tumors through imaging and photothermal properties. The nanoparticles developed in this study demonstrated unique properties and multiple functionalities, including excellent photostability and thermostability, strong fluorescence emission in the near-infrared-II (NIR-II) region, extremely high photothermal conversion efficiency, good biocompatibility, significant radiosensitizing properties, and effective tumor site accumulation. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> evaluations demonstrated that these nanoparticles are ideal candidates for synergistic photothermal radiotherapy guided by NIR-II fluorescence, NIR-I photoacoustic, and photothermal trimodal imaging. They act as radiosensitizers by alleviating the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, modulating the cell cycle, and inducing apoptosis and immunogenic cell death during radiotherapy, which may provide a potential approach for the clinical treatment of tumors.
40201935	The mechanism of EZH2/H3K27me3 downregulating CXCL10 to affect CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion to participate in the transformation from myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukaemia.	Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) link to unfavourable prognoses. We explored the mechanism of enhancer of zeste homologue 2/histone H3 of lysine 27 (EZH2/H3K27me3) downregulating C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) to affect CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion, participating in MDS-to-AML transformation. NHD13 mice were treated with GSK126 (EZH2 inhibitor) and CXCL10 neutralizing antibody, with transformation time, blood cell counts and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell determined. SKM-1 cells treated with short hairpin-EZH2, overexpressing-EZH2, GSK126 and CXCL10 were co-cultured with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. EZH2, CXCL10, H3K27me3 and EZH2 levels and EZH2 enzyme activity were assessed. CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell cytotoxicity, exhaustion, apoptosis and SKM-1 cell malignant behaviours were evaluated. In vivo, EZH2 inhibition upregulated CXCL10, decelerating MDS to AML transformation and delaying CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion. EZH2 inhibition elevated peripheral blood cells, alleviated splenomegaly, reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, elevated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cytotoxicity and abated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion in NHD13 mice. CXCL10 neutralizing antibody accelerated AML transformation by inhibiting CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion via EZH2. In vitro, EZH2 overexpression facilitated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion and SKM-1 cell malignant behaviours. EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 curbed CXCL10 transcription and secretion. Collectively, EZH2/H3K27me3 downregulates CXCL10 to facilitate CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion, accelerating transformation from MDS to AML.
40201934	Inverse Design of an All-Dielectric Nonlinear Polaritonic Metasurface.	Nonlinear metasurfaces offer the ability to realize optical nonlinear devices with unparalleled properties compared to nonlinear crystals, due to the interplay between photonic resonances and materials properties. The complicated interdependency between efficiency and emission directionality of the nonlinear optical signal on the existence, localization, and lifetimes of photonic resonances, as well as on the nonlinear susceptibility, makes it extremely difficult to design optimal metasurfaces using conventional materials and geometries. Inverse design using topology optimization is a powerful design tool for photonic structures, but traditional approaches developed for linear photonics are not suitable for such high dimensional nonlinear problems. Here, we use a topology optimization approach to inverse-design a fabrication-robust nonlinear metasurface that includes quantum-engineered resonant nonlinearities in semiconductor heterostructures for efficient and directional second harmonic generation. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that under practical constraints, among all the parameters, the nonlinear modal overlap emerges as the dominant parameter that enhances conversion efficiency, a finding that contrasts with intuition-driven studies that often emphasize Purcell enhancement. Our results demonstrate an efficient approach for optimizing nonlinear processes in nanophotonic structures for classical and quantum light sources, quantum information applications, and communication.
40201933	Systematic Optimization of the Synthesis of Confined Carbyne.	Confined carbyne, an sp<sup>1</sup>-hybridized linear carbon chain inside a carbon nanotube, is a novel material with remarkable properties and potential applications. Among its currently successful synthesis methods, high temperature high vacuum annealing is prevalent. Further optimization could be achieved by tuning the synthesis pathway. Here, a systematic analysis of key synthesis parameters including precursor filling, annealing step sequences, and temperature conditions during high temperature vacuum processing is performed. A novel yield determination model that overcomes previous limitations related to the irregular resonance Raman behavior of carbyne is applied to evaluate bulk yield and realized growth potential. With this refined model, it is possible to make a quantitative assessment of bulk yield optimization potential in multi-step annealing processes. These results provide crucial insights into the fundamental formation mechanisms of confined carbyne, advancing our understanding of this promising hybrid nanomaterial system. It is therefore possible to establish improved protocols for maximizing confined carbyne yields through precise control of synthesis conditions.
40200915	Density functional benchmark for quadruple hydrogen bonds.	Hydrogen bonding is an important non-covalent interaction that plays a major role in molecular self-organization and supramolecular structures. It can be described accurately with <i>ab initio</i> quantum chemical wave function methods, which become computationally expensive for large molecular assemblies. Density functional theory (DFT) offers a better balance between accuracy and computational cost, and can be routinely applied to large systems. A large number of density functional approximations (DFAs) has been developed, but their accuracy depend on the application, necessitating benchmark studies to guide their selection for use in applications. Some of us have recently determined highly accurate hydrogen bonding energies of 14 quadruply hydrogen-bonded dimers by extrapolating coupled-cluster energies to the complete basis set limit as well as extrapolating electron correlation contributions with a continued-fraction approach [U. Ahmed <i>et al.</i>, <i>Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.</i>, 2024, <b>26</b>, 24470-24476]. In this work, we study the reproduction of these bonding energies at the DFT level using 152 DFAs. The top ten density functional approximations are composed of eight variants of the Berkeley functionals both with and without dispersion corrections, and two Minnesota 2011 functionals augmented with a further dispersion correction. We find the B97M-V functional with the non-local correlation functional replaced by an empirical D3BJ dispersion correction to be the best DFA, while changes to the dispersion part in other Berkeley functionals lead to poorer performance in our study.
40200914	Straightforward Approach Toward Thermo-Sensitive Hydrogel Coating on Polyethersulfone Membranes with Controlled Drug Delivery for Significant Inhibition of Thrombocytopenia During Hemodialysis.	Thrombocytopenia is a potential complication associated with hemodialysis due to the unsatisfactory hemocompatibility of current dialysis membranes, which leads to excessive platelet destruction, accelerates organ failure, and threatens the patients' life safety in severe cases. In the clinical application of hemodialysis, there are a proportion of patients suffer thrombocytopenia. For these patients, heparin combined with tirofiban can be used during dialysis to suppress the occurrence of thrombocytopenia, but the medication requires intravenous injection and continuous infusion. To optimize the application of hemodialysis membranes, a dialysis membrane composed of polyethersulfone (PES) base membrane and a temperature-sensitive hydrogel coating poly (N-acryloyl glycinamide) (PNAGA) is designed, and prepared that can continuously release tirofiban through temperature control to reduce the burden of medication on patients and significantly inhibit the occurrence of thrombocytopenia. The resulting membrane exhibits an encapsulation efficiency of 36.2% (72.4 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>) for tirofiban, with drug release rates of 54.83% at 37 °C and 31.4% at 4 °C after 1 h. Additionally, the membrane shows excellent hydrophilicity and dialysis performance. It also effectively inhibits platelet adhesion (reduced by 92.3%), activation (reduced by 92.8%) and aggregation, and albumin adsorption (reduced by 84.7%). In summary, the work provides a new solution for the preparation of dialysis membranes that can prevent thrombocytopenia, which has potential applications in the safer hemodialysis membrane manufacturing sector.

40200909	Highly Selective Oxygen Electroreduction to Hydrogen Peroxide on Sulfur-doped Mesoporous Carbon.	As a paradigm-shifting material platform in energy catalysis, precisely engineered ordered mesoporous carbon spheres emerge as supreme metal-free electrocatalysts, outperforming conventional carbon-based counterparts through synergistic structural and electronic innovations. Herein, we architecturally design vertically aligned cylindrical mesoporous carbon spheres with atomic-level sulfur doping (S-mC) that establish unprecedented performance benchmarks in the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e--ORR) to hydrogen peroxide. Systematic comparative studies reveal that the S-mC catalysts achieve exceptional H2O2 selectivity (> 99%) and activity at current density of -3.5 mA cm-2, surpassing state-of-the-art metal-free catalysts in current density. Impressively, the optimized S-mC electrocatalyst in a flow cell device achieves an exceptional H2O2 yield of 25 mol gcatalyst-1 h-1. The carbon matrix's unique sp2/sp3 hybrid network coupled with S-induced charge redistribution generates electron-deficient hotspots that selectively stabilize *OOH intermediates, as evidenced by in situ spectroscopic characterization and DFT calculations. This structural-electronic synergy endows the carbon framework with metal-like catalytic efficiency while maintaining inherent advantages of chemical robustness and cost-effectiveness. The marriage of S-doping engineering with mesoscopic pore architecture control opens a new way for developing efficient carbon-based electrocatalyst for oxygen selective reduction to H2O2.
40200908	Theoretical investigation of a tunable vanadium dioxide-based metastructure for ultra-wideband absorption and linear-to-circular polarization conversion across triple-octave frequencies.	An ultra-wideband absorption and tripling octave frequency linear-to-circular polarization conversion tunable metastructure (MS) is proposed, utilizing the phase transition property of vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>). In its metallic state, the MS is demonstrated to function as a polarization-insensitive ultra-wideband MS absorber, achieving an absorption value exceeding 90% within a frequency range of 2.37 THz to 4.56 THz. The absorption mechanism is elucidated through an equivalent circuit model, impedance matching theory, and electric field distribution analysis. In the insulating state of VO<sub>2</sub>, the MS is shown to operate as a converter tripling the octave frequency in linear-to-circular polarization, with an axial ratio below 3 dB across the frequency ranges of 0.95-1.68 THz and 2.25-4.49 THz, corresponding to relative bandwidths of 55.51% and 66.27%. Remarkably, the polarization conversion in the insulating state exhibits tripling octave frequency characteristics, with a fundamental bandwidth spanning 0.95-1.49 THz and a tripling octave frequency bandwidth spanning 2.85-4.48 THz. The MS can switch between distinct functionalities within the terahertz regime, offering significant potential for applications such as spectral analysis, signal encryption, stealth material preparation, and other advanced terahertz technologies.
40200907	Efficient Blue Perovskite LEDs via Bottom-Up Charge Manipulation for Solution-Processed Active-Matrix Displays.	Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are emerging as strong candidates for next-generation displays due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, solution processability, and cost-effectiveness. However, the development of highly efficient blue PeLEDs remains a significant challenge. Here, a bottom-up strategy is introduced for precise charge manipulation in blue perovskites to enhance radiative recombination efficiency. By employing 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene as an inserted hole transport layer, improved hole injection efficiency is achieved while effectively suppressing reverse electron transport and exciton quenching. Additionally, a fluorinated ester additive is incorporated to control perovskite crystallization, facilitating the formation of well-aligned reduced-dimensional phases to reduce nonradiative recombination losses. The resulting blue PeLEDs exhibit a record-breaking external quantum efficiency of 25.87%, the highest reported for one-step-prepared blue perovskite films. Furthermore, integration with thin-film transistor circuits enables solution-processed active-matrix perovskite displays with sharp and uniform patterning. This work provides a comprehensive pathway for advancing blue PeLEDs toward high-performance display applications.
40200906	Computational insights of deucravacitinib's selectivity for TYK2 pseudokinase vs. JAK kinase domain via molecular modeling studies.	Deucravacitinib (Sotyktu) stands out as a novel and highly specific oral inhibitor targeting tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). Its mechanism of action involves an allosteric binding, to catalytically inactive pseudokinase domain of TYK2, this stabilizes an inhibitory contact between the catalytic and regulatory domains. This inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) is associated with suppression of cytokine signaling using diverse molecules defining wide importance in current research. In our recent investigation, we examined the selectivity of the TYK2JH2 inhibitor, deucravacitinib, against four JAK kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) and TYK2 pseudokinases utilizing a merged approach involving molecular docking, molecular dynamics analysis (300 ns), and binding free energy calculation through the molecular mechanics Poisson - Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) scheme. The results obtained indicate that deucravacitinib effectively interacts with the ATP-binding site of four JAK kinases and TYK2 pseudokinase through hydrogen bond formation, electrostatic attraction, and notably, van der Waals interaction. We found the calculated binding affinity demonstrates a reduction in the TYK2JH2-deucravacitinib complex due to an increased favorable intermolecular electrostatic contribution. Consequently, deucravacitinib exhibits greater selectivity for the TYK2 pseudokinase domain compared to the other four JAKs. Moreover, the interaction with DPG motif residues and the hinge region contributed to the stabilization of deucravacitinib through robustly formed hydrogen bonds. The interaction with the hydrophobic catalytic region caused the ATP-binding site to adopt a closed conformation, thereby minimizing protein movement at the glycine loop of the JAK pseudokinase protein. In summary, our study holds significant potential for informing the strategic design of TYK2 inhibitors with enhanced affinity.
40200904	Design of New Anti-Influenza Structures Based on 3D-QSAR, Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Studies.	This study aims to design novel inhibitors against influenza A virus by integrating 3D-QSAR modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. The dataset, consisting of 38 compounds, was divided into training and test sets using hierarchical clustering. The most active compound was used as a reference for molecular alignment. CoMFA, CoMFA-Focus, and CoMSIA models were developed and validated using the partial least squares method. Among them, the CoMSIA model, incorporating steric, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond donor descriptors, demonstrated the highest predictive performance (q2LOO = 0.681, r2training = 0.847). Contour maps identified key regions for structural modifications to enhance inhibitory activity. Molecular docking confirmed these findings by highlighting crucial ligand-receptor interactions. Further validation through MD simulations revealed stable ligand binding with hemagglutinin, supported by RMSD and RMSF analyses. The radius of gyration analysis indicated a compact ligand conformation, reinforcing its stability and strong binding affinity. Additionally, binding free energy calculations suggested favorable ligand-receptor interactions. Based on these insights, nine novel compounds were designed, showing promising potential for experimental validation and further development as anti-influenza A agents.
40200903	Advances in endovascular thrombectomy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.	Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the second leading cause of death and one of the leading causes of long-term disability globally. Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has revolutionized treatment for large vessel occlusion (LVO), providing 20% increase in post-stroke functional independence compared to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone. Despite its proven efficacy, EVT is underutilized. While it is suitable for at least 15-20% of AIS patients, its mean adoption ranges from less than 1% to 7% in different areas.
40200902	Diagnostics of brain tumor in the early stage: current status and future perspectives.	Early diagnosis of brain tumors is challenging due to their complexity and delicate structure. Conventional imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET are unable to provide detailed visualization of early-stage brain tumors. Early-stage detection of brain tumors is vital for enhancing patient outcomes and survival rates. So far, several scientists have dedicated their efforts to innovating advanced diagnostic probes to efficiently cross the BBB and selectively target brain tumors for optimal imaging. The integration of these techniques presents a viable pathway for non-invasive, accurate, and early-stage tumor identification. Herein, we provide a timely update on the various imaging probes and potential challenges for the diagnosis of early-stage brain tumors. Furthermore, this review highlights the significance of integrating advanced imaging probes for improving the early detection of brain tumors, ultimately enhancing treatment outcomes. Hopefully, this review will stimulate the interest of researchers to accelerate the development of new imaging probes and even their clinical translation for improving the early diagnosis of brain tumors.
40200901	MpmiR319 promotes gemma/gemma cup formation in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were initially detected as approximately 20-22 nt sequences in plants. For decades miRNA-mediated regulation of target gene expression was characterized in many cases. The sequences of miR159/319 family miRNAs are conserved among land plants. The roles of miR159/319 have been comprehensively characterized in development of dicot and monocot plants. However, its biological function in bryophytes remain enigmatic. A model bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha also encodes miR319 at two loci and expresses the miRNA. We used a CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit genome sequences at MpMIR319a and/or MpMIR319b loci. The mutant lines developed relatively few gemma cups and gemmae, suggesting that MpmiR319 targets MpRKD or MpR2R3-MYB21 transcripts and suppresses its expression. We constructed miR319-resistant MpRKD (mMpRKD) and MpR2R3-MYB21 (mMpR2R3-MYB21) by decreasing the complementarity to miR319. Introduction of mMpRKD resulted in gemma/gemma cup-less liverwort mutants, but mMpR2R3-MYB21 did not. Transcription-fusion constructs between MpRKD promoter andβglucuronidase showed the gene is expressed in the rim and bottom of gemma cups. We found that the mir319a/mir319b double mutant could form gemma cups but of different sizes in a unpredictable arrangement when planted on vermiculite. These results together suggest that miR319 guides the formation of gemma cups/gemmae in standard positions collaborating with MpRKD.

Efficient microwave absorbers are needed to address the electromagnetic pollution caused by the proliferation of new radio technologies and equipment. Excellent microwave absorption performance can be achieved by controlling the dielectric constant. Heteroatom-doped bimetallic materials are promising electromagnetic wave absorption (EMA) materials due to their tunable structures and low cost. In particular, the presence of anionic sites significantly affects their dielectric constant and electrical conductivity. Herein, a 1D carbon nanofiber material is prepared by encapsulating FeCo nanoparticles in a fiber cavity by electrostatic spinning. Subsequently, tellurization, vulcanization, and selenization processes are carried out. FeTe<sub>2</sub>/ CoTe<sub>2</sub>@C exhibits stronger conductivity and dielectric loss due to the lower electronegativity of Te. The clever configuration of FeTe<sub>2</sub>, CoTe<sub>2</sub>, and C heterostructures obtained by Te doping generates multi-heterogeneous interfaces that facilitate charge migration and enhance interfacial polarization, obtaining excellent EMA performance. FeTe<sub>2</sub>/CoTe<sub>2</sub>@C exhibits an optimum minimum reflection loss (RL<sub>min</sub>) of -51.1 dB with a matching thickness of 2.0 mm, and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) reaches 4.2 GHz. Radar cross-section (RCS) calculations show the great potential of FeTe<sub>2</sub>/CoTe<sub>2</sub>@C for practical military stealth technology. This study offers novel guidance for improving the EMA properties of transition metal matrix composites via anionic coordination modulation.
40200899	Linking Symptom Inventories Using Semantic Textual Similarity.	An extensive library of symptom inventories has been developed over time to measure clinical symptoms of traumatic brain injury (TBI), but this variety has led to several long-standing issues. Most notably, results drawn from different settings and studies are not comparable. This creates a fundamental problem in TBI diagnostics and outcome prediction, namely that it is not possible to equate results drawn from distinct tools and symptom inventories. Here, we present an approach using semantic textual similarity (STS) to link symptoms and scores across previously incongruous symptom inventories by ranking item text similarities according to their conceptual likeness. We tested the ability of four pretrained deep learning models to screen thousands of symptom description pairs for related content-a challenging task typically requiring expert panels. Models were tasked to predict symptom severity across four different inventories for 6,607 participants drawn from 16 international data sources. The STS approach achieved 74.8% accuracy across five tasks, outperforming other models tested. Correlation and factor analysis found the properties of the scales were broadly preserved under conversion. This work suggests that incorporating contextual, semantic information can assist expert decision-making processes, yielding broad gains for the harmonization of TBI assessment.
40200898	Reversible Interconversion of Nitrate and Nitrite Catalyzed by Periplasmic Nitrate Reductase from <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>.	The periplasmic nitrate reductase catalytic subunit (NapA) belongs to the DMSO reductase (DMSOR) family of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) containing enzymes and catalyzes nitrate reduction to nitrite. Some members of the DMSOR family (e.g., DMSO reductase, formate dehydrogenase, nitrite oxidoreductase, and arsenate reductase) catalyze the reversible interconversion of the substrate and product with varying efficiency. Here, we demonstrate that NapA not only can reduce nitrate to nitrite but also can also oxidize nitrite to nitrate. At least three mechanisms involving the oxygen atom transfer (OAT) process have been proposed for NapA-catalyzed nitrate reduction. NapA can also oxidize nitrite via an OAT process. However, there is no experimental evidence for any of these OAT processes using isolated pure enzymes so far. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for OAT reactions in both forward (i.e., nitrate reduction) and backward (i.e., nitrite oxidation) reactions catalyzed by NapA using isotope labeling, mass spectrometry, and NMR experiments. Finally, we propose a mechanistic scheme supported by experiment and computation consistent with atom transfer as the rate-limiting step.
40200897	Light/Ultrasound Dual Responsive Carbon Dots-Based Nanovaccines for Multimodal Activation Tumor Immunotherapy of Melanoma.	Melanoma is a highly aggressive and metastatic tumor, and immunotherapy has become the current solution. However, conventional nanovaccines do not strongly activate T cell immune responses. Therefore, development of effective therapeutic nanovaccines to activate systemic antitumor immunity is urgently required. Herein, light/ultrasound (US) dual-responsive carbon dot-based nanovaccines (Cu-N-CDs@OVA) are designed using copper-nitrogen-coordinated carbon dots composited with ovalbumin. Under 650-nm laser irradiation, Cu-N-CDs@OVA exhibited superior photothermal ablation of primary tumors, induced immunogenic cell death and released antigens by phototherapy, facilitating the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). More importantly, Cu-N-CDs@OVA stably penetrated and diffused upon US treatment, eradicating metastatic tumors and generating low-dose reactive oxygen species to activate DCs. By integrating with the model antigen OVA, the combined multimodal treatment promotes DC maturation to activate systematic antitumor immunity. This is the first example of a light/US dual-responsive therapeutic nanovaccine that provides a paradigm for the production of personalized nanovaccines against malignant tumors.
40200896	Traumatic Brain Injury Diagnostic Interview: Development, Interrater Reliability, and 2-Week Post-Injury Clinical Profiles.	Because most traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) do not present with objective indicators (e.g., neuroimaging findings) to confirm the diagnosis, clinicians often rely on self- or observer-reporting of alteration of consciousness (AOC; e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, other signs of altered mental status), and symptoms to make diagnoses. Moreover, there is no universal agreement on signs and symptoms to sufficiently diagnose TBI, which leads to variability and ambiguity in how TBI is diagnosed in clinical and research settings. The lack of standardized procedures for the diagnosis of acute TBI is a major challenge that hampers the ability to evaluate and compare TBI studies and advance the science and treatment of TBI. We present a new semi-structured TBI Diagnostic Interview (TBI-DI), developed for prospective TBI research to collect injury information important to verifying eligibility for the diagnosis of TBI. Specifically, the TBI-DI collects patient (and/or witness) reports of head trauma, AOC (including LOC and amnesia), and TBI-related symptomology. We describe the protocol, interrater reliability of the TBI-DI items to the same audio-recorded interview, and observed injury characteristics for interviews conducted at 2 weeks post-injury. The sample comprised 335 interviews (320 self-reported, 10 informant-reported, and 5 both) collected on individuals with TBI who were prospectively recruited from 4 U.S. level 1 trauma centers from 2019 to 2023. Cohen's kappa was calculated to summarize interrater reliability <i>n</i> = 288 interviews. UpSet plots were created to illustrate the prevalence of distinct profiles of signs of AOC and symptom reporting. Overall, there was a near-perfect agreement between raters for all AOC descriptors (<i>κ</i> = 0.85-0.92) and symptom items (<i>κ</i> ranging from 0.92 to 0.99). We observed diverse profiles of AOC, with 45% manifesting witnessed LOC, post-traumatic amnesia, or other altered mental status. Patients (<i>n</i> = 325) self-reported 256 different combinations of the 14 acute symptoms included in the interview (most commonly experiencing headache, dizziness, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating). The TBI-DI and associated SOP appear well-suited for use in a multicenter prospective study of TBI. Future research should examine the stability of reporting by respondents and the alignment between interview and objective clinical information. The TBI-DI solicits diverse acute diagnostic information that, when combined with clinical information (including confounding factors) and objective injury indicators, may inform more rigorous scientific reporting and evidence-based TBI diagnostic practices.
40200895	Heparin Doped Polyaniline for Anticoagulation Supercapacitors.	With the rapid development of implantable electronic medical devices, supercapacitors have gained significant attention as implantable energy storage devices due to their inherent advantages. However, these devices inevitably direct contact with blood and trigger coagulation or thrombus formation when implanted in the body. In severe cases, these negative effects compromise the functionality of the implantable energy storage system and even jeopardize human health. Herein, a biocompatible electrode material with high anticoagulant activity is designed by doping polyaniline with anticoagulant macromolecule heparin under neutral conditions, which macromolecules as dopants under neutral conditions not only avoids the toxicity of acids to biological tissues and de-doping caused by small molecules, but also imparts high anticoagulant properties to the material. Based on the electrode material and in situ polymerization approach, an all-in-one anticoagulation supercapacitor is employed to manufacture and exhibits good electrochemical performance (energy density of 18.89 µWh cm<sup>-2</sup> and a power density of 197.8 µW cm<sup>-2</sup>), cycling stability (capacitance retention of 70.23% after 2, 000 cycles), anticoagulant performance (APTT is 15.47 s, PT is 16.57 s, TT is 49.47 s, and FIB is 1.12 g L<sup>-1</sup>), and tissue compatibility. The doping strategy provides a valuable reference for energy supply in implantable bioelectronics.
40200894	Implicit and Explicit Attitudes Toward Shyness Among Mothers of Young Children in Mainland China.	This study examines both implicit and explicit attitudes toward shyness among mothers of young children in mainland China. The participants were 391 mothers (<i>M<sub>ag</sub></i><sub>e</sub> = 35 years, <i>SD</i> = 3.84 years) of preschool-aged children from one kindergarten in Shanghai, China. At two time points separated by eight months, participants completed the online version of the Implicit Association Test-Shy (IAT-Shy), self-assessed their own shyness and their explicit attitudes about shyness, and rated their children's shyness. Over the eight-month period, Chinese mothers displayed more negative implicit attitudes toward shyness compared with their attitudes toward non-shyness (sociability). Implicit attitudes toward shyness were significantly related to explicit attitudes about shyness but were not significantly associated with maternal or child shyness.

40200886	Meta-Analysis and Optimization of the <i>In Vitro</i> Immortalization Assay for Safety Assessment of Retroviral Vectors in Gene Therapy.	The underlying risk of retroviral vector-induced insertional oncogenesis in gene therapies requires a reliable preclinical safety assessment. Dysregulation of genes neighboring the vector's integration sites has triggered hematopoietic malignancies in patients treated with different vector genera and designs. With ca. 18 years in practical use, the <i>in vitro</i> immortalization (IVIM) assay can quantify this mutagenic potential and is actively requested by regulatory authorities during preclinical stages. Here, we present a thorough meta-analysis of IVIM data alongside a step-by-step cell culture protocol. On this basis, we propose clonal outgrowth as the single indicator of mutagenicity, simplifying the IVIM assay cost- and time-wise.
40200885	Design, Synthesis, Characterization and In Vitro Evaluation of Anticholinesterase and Antioxidant Activities of Thiazole-Piperazine Sulfonamide Hybrids.	A series of thiazole-piperazine sulfonamide hybrids (8a-k) were synthesized, characterized and subsequently tested on Alzheimer's disease (AD) targets, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and the ABTS radical, to assess their effectiveness. Three of the target analogues 8c, 8e and 8g exhibited augmented inhibition on AChE with IC50 values of 2.52±0.92, 2.99±0.01 and 2.14±0.02 µM, respectively. These analogues also showed strong inhibition selectivity against AChE over BChE. Furthermore, the congeners 8d, 8f, 8h and 8i had remarkable ABTS radical scavenging properties as their IC50 values were in the range of 0.05±0.07 to 0.99±0.12 µM. A study of the kinetics of inhibition of AChE for active analogue 8g revealed a mixed type of inhibition. From the molecular docking experiments, it was clear that the compounds 8c, 8e and 8g were placed optimally within the active site of AChE. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of these docked complexes indicated that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the complexes stabilized below 4 Å.  Furthermore, in silico ADMET prediction studies revealed that the targeted analogs satisfied all the characteristics of CNS acting drugs. Finally, these active compounds are determined to be non-toxic and highly neuroprotective against H2O2-induced cell death in SK-N-SH cell lines.
40200884	Co-Translational mRNA Decay in Plants: Recent advances and future directions.	Tight regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability is essential to ensure accurate gene expression in response to developmental and environmental cues. mRNA stability is controlled by mRNA decay pathways, which have traditionally been proposed to occur independently of translation. However, the recent discovery of a co-translational mRNA decay pathway (also known as CTRD) reveals that mRNA translation and decay can be coupled. While being translated, a mRNA can be targeted for degradation. This pathway was first described in yeast and rapidly identified in several plant species. This review explores recent advances in our understanding of CTRD in plants, emphasizing its regulation and its importance for development and stress response. The different metrics used to assess CTRD activity are also presented. Furthermore, this review outlines future directions to explore the importance of mRNA decay in maintaining mRNA homeostasis in plants.
40200868	Contribution of Extracranial Injuries to GOSE Scores after Traumatic Brain Injury TBI: A TRACK-Traumatic Brain Injury Study.	The Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) is the most widely used outcome measure for hospital-based studies of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The GOSE may be administered several ways, the choice depending on the purpose of the research. In this investigation, we evaluated the effect of administering the GOSE to collect functional disability attributed to all injuries sustained (GOSE-All) or excluding the impact of extracranial injuries (GOSE-TBI). We examined the differences in reported disability between the two administration methods at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after injury. Data are summarized from 2288 individuals who were enrolled in the prospective observational Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) cohort study. The distribution of scores is summarized by time after injury, brain injury severity, and extracranial injury severity. Dichotomizing the GOSE varying ways, differences in the prevalence of unfavorable outcomes for GOSE-All versus GOSE-TBI range from none to 42 percentage points. Discrepancies in disability captured by GOSE-All and GOSE-TBI decrease with greater TBI severity, no serious extracranial injuries, and longer time post-injury. It is important for researchers, given the aims of their studies, to decide in advance whether GOSE classification should be based on the effects of all injuries sustained or excluding the effects of extracranial injuries so as to emphasize the effects of the brain injury, as well as how disability due to emotional consequences of injury and other circumstances will be scored. Instructions to the respondent and outcomes examiner need to be clear about what causes of disability are to be included. The TBI Common Data Elements should include information that reflects the method that was used to collect the GOSE data and data repositories should disclose which data collection method was used for a given study.

40200866	The sunflower transcription factor HaHB11 increases soybean grain number and heat tolerance across multi-season field trials.	Soybean is one of the primary sources of vegetable oil and protein worldwide. However, its yield improvement has lagged behind the other major crops. This study explored the potential of the sunflower transcription factor HaHB11 to enhance soybean yield and heat stress tolerance. We generated transgenic soybean plants expressing HaHB11 and evaluated their performance across four field trials. The HaHB11 plants showed a significant increase in grain number per plant compared to controls, which can be related to an increased number of nodes and pods per plant. Flowering dynamics analysis revealed delayed blooming and an increased number of flowers per node, leading to a higher pod set, particularly between nodes four and six. Principal component analysis across field trials identified temperature as a crucial factor influencing grain number, enhancing the differences exhibited by HaHB11 plants. The pollen from transgenic plants germinated better, and tubes were longer than controls under heat stress. Carbohydrate distribution analyses indicated differential allocation of nutrients, which could support the increased pod and grain set in HaHB11 plants. Additionally, vegetation indices can distinguish HaHB11 plants from controls in several developmental stages. These results indicated that HaHB11 enhances soybean yield under heat stress, becoming a promising technology for soybean improvement.
40200865	Twelve tips to optimize group decision-making in medical education: 'Tipping' the scales toward wisdom of the crowd and minimizing groupthink.	Group decision-making is now common in medical education, often used for decisions that are both complex and high stakes, such as determining whether to promote or remediate a trainee. In this context, it is often assumed that group decision making is superior to that of an individual, resulting in high quality decision outcomes through the pooling of collective knowledge and experience. Yet, while groups can outperform individuals, this is not guaranteed. In fact, groups are vulnerable to several cognitive biases and process issues that individuals are not subject to and these can lead to poor quality decision outcomes if not managed. As educational leaders who participate in group decision-making, we believe it is our responsibility to ensure the quality of these complex and high-stakes decisions. In this article, we discuss both the potential benefits and vulnerabilities of group decision-making by introducing the concepts of wisdom of the crowd and groupthink, respectively. With this foundation, we then offer twelve evidence-based tips that can be easily implemented in educational group decision-making to minimize groupthink and leverage the wisdom of the crowd.
40200863	Advanced Nanoenabled Microalgae Systems: Integrating Oxidative Stress-Induced Metabolic Reprogramming and Enhanced Lipid Biosynthesis for Next-Generation Biofuel Production.	The growing demand for renewable energy has positioned microalgae, such as <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>, as a promising feedstock for sustainable biofuel production. Leveraging nanotechnology, this study explores the multifaceted impacts of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) on <i>C. vulgaris</i>, focusing on lipid biosynthesis, oxidative stress, biomass productivity, and photosynthetic pigment retention. The morphology of NPs and algae and their interactions were extensively studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The ZnO NP-enabled microalgae system enhanced lipid accumulation to as high as 48% at 50 mg/L. Biomass production and pigment content remained stable within the applied dose of NPs (20-50 mg/L), highlighting the resilience of <i>C. vulgaris</i> under NP exposure. However, at 100 mg/L, photosynthetic efficiency was disrupted, pigment content was reduced, and lipid yield declined to 30%. The enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT) revealed significant upregulation at higher ZnO NP concentrations, further corroborating the stress-induced metabolic shifts. This study also introduced a model for the Biofuel Suitability Score (BSS), which integrates lipid content, biomass productivity, oxidative stress levels, and pigment retention to identify the optimal conditions for biofuel production. The BSS peaked at moderate ZnO NP concentrations (30-50 mg/L), indicating a balance between lipid biosynthesis and cellular integrity. Beyond this threshold, oxidative damage compromises the biofuel potential, emphasizing the critical need for precise control of NP exposure. These findings highlight the potential of ZnO NPs to induce lipid accumulation through targeted stress modulation while maintaining biomass quality, advancing the application of nanotechnology in sustainable bioenergy systems. This study provides a scalable framework for integrating nanotechnology into renewable energy.
40200862	Fish Swim Bladder-Derived ECM Hydrogels Effectively Treat Myocardial Ischemic Injury through Immunomodulation and Angiogenesis.	Injectable hydrogel implants represent a promising therapeutic approach for ischemic heart failure; but their efficacy is often limited by low bioactivity, poor durability, and inadequate injection techniques. Herein, a unique hydrogel incorporating extracellular matrix from fish swim bladder (FSB-ECM), which has distinct advantages over mammalian derived ECM, such as low antigenicity, bioactivity, and source safety, is developed. It consists of collagen, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, including 13 proteins common in the myocardial matrix and three specific proteins: HSPG, Col12a1, and vWF. This hydrogel enhances cardiac cell adhesion and stretching while promoting angiogenesis and M2 macrophage polarization. In addition, its storage modulus (G') increases over time, reaching about 1000 Pa after 5 min, which facilitates transcatheter delivery and in situ gelling. Furthermore, this hydrogel provides sustained support for cardiac contractions, exhibiting superior longevity. In a rat model of ischemic heart failure, the ejection fraction significantly improves with FSB-ECM treatment, accompanied by increased angiogenesis, reduced inflammation, and decreased infarct size. Finally, RNA sequencing combined with in vitro assays identifies ANGPTL4 as a key protein involved in mediating the effects of FSB-ECM treatment. Overall, this new injectable hydrogel based on FSB-ECM is suitable for transcatheter delivery and possesses remarkable reparative capabilities for treating heart failure.
40200861	Theoretical computation of C-C coupling reactions by different C<sub>1</sub> intermediates at Cu<sub><i>n</i></sub> and Cu<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>Ag clusters supported on TiO<sub>2</sub>.	*CO dimerization is a well-known pathway for C-C bond formation, producing C<sub>2+</sub> products. However, the mechanisms of C-C coupling between other C<sub>1</sub> intermediates remain less explored. In this study, we investigate C-C bond formation involving *CO, *CHO, *COH, and other C<sub>1</sub> intermediates on Cu<sub><i>n</i></sub> and Cu<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>Ag clusters supported on TiO<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, our results reveal that the activation energy for *CO dimerization is not the lowest, indicating that it is not the dominant pathway for C-C bond formation. Coupling reactions involving *CHO, *COH, and other C<sub>1</sub> intermediates exhibit lower activation energies. Furthermore, the activation energy for the same reaction varies across different Cu<sub><i>n</i></sub> clusters, emphasizing the role of cluster selection in C-C coupling. Notably, on certain clusters, such as Cu<sub>8</sub>, the activation energy for C-C bond formation at the Ag site is lower than that at the Cu site, suggesting that Ag doping can enhance C-C coupling. However, in larger clusters like Cu<sub>13</sub>, the activation energy at the Ag site exceeds that at the Cu site, highlighting that the effect of Ag doping is cluster size dependent. This study provides new insights into C-C bond formation, offering guidance for designing efficient co-catalysts to produce high-value C<sub>2+</sub> products.

This study aims to characterize the effect of climate change on the epidemiology of AR in adult and pediatric populations globally.
40200857	Greater prevalence of anaemia and heavy menstrual bleeding reported in women of reproductive age in the United Kingdom compared to Australia.	Heavy periods are a common cause of anaemia in women of reproductive age. We compare the prevalence of anaemia and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) among women in the United Kingdom and Australia. Women aged 15-50 years were recruited through screening events conducted in the United Kingdom and Australia from 2016 to 2024. In these cross-sectional studies, self-report questionnaires screened for HMB and finger prick haemoglobin concentration (Hb) identified anaemia (Hb < 120 g/L). Of 1937 women (United Kingdom = 333, Australia = 1604), the mean age was 28.5 ± 9.2 years and 33.7% reported HMB. In the United Kingdom, the mean Hb was 129.2 ± 12.0 g/L and 19.2% were anaemic, of which 59.4% had HMB. In Australia, the mean Hb was higher (134.4 ± 12.2 g/L; p < 0.001), with fewer women being anaemic (9.7%; p < 0.001), and fewer anaemic women had HMB (30.3%; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis found that women in the United Kingdom were at a greater risk of being anaemic (AOR: 2.144; 95%CI:1.545, 2.946; p < 0.001). HMB was more common in the United Kingdom (45.9% vs. 31.2%; p < 0.001). In Australia, 24.7% (299/1211) reported receiving intravenous iron; while those with prior intravenous iron treatment were less likely to be anaemic (AOR: 0.616; 95%CI: 0.372, 0.982; p = 0.0496). Women in the United Kingdom are more likely to have anaemia and HMB than women in Australia, with HMB presenting a greater risk for anaemia development in the United Kingdom.
40200856	Halichondria panicea (Porifera, Demospongiae) Reparative Regeneration: An Integrative Approach to Better Understand Wound Healing.	Sponges have a remarkable capacity to rapidly regenerate in response to injury. In addition, sponges rapidly renew their aquiferous system to maintain a healthy. This study describes the reparative regeneration in the cold-water demosponge Halichondria panicea. The wide range of methods allow us to make a comprehensive analysis of mechanisms, which contribute to the regeneration in this species, including morphogenetic process, cell proliferation, apoptosis and cytotoxicity. The regeneration in H. panicea includes three main stages: internal milieu isolation, wound healing - epithelization, and restoration of damaged structures. The main morphogenetical mechanisms of regeneration are epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during the first 12 h post operation (hpo) followed by blastema formation and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transformation leading to the restoration of damaged structures. These processes can be explained by active cell dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation, participation of resident pluripotent cells (archaeocyte-like cells and choanocytes), by migration of pluripotent cells (archaeocyte-like cells), and by activation of proliferation and apoptosis. The rate of apoptosis becomes homogeneous in regeneration area and in intact tissues at 12 hpo at a significantly higher rate than at 0 hpo. The reduction of sponge toxicity at 6 hpo looks like a necessary step for activation of repair processes. However, after 24 hpo, the toxicity exceeded the initial (0 hpo) level. At 96 hpo, the aquiferous system is completely restored. The ability for rapid wound epithelialization, as well as the morphological and functional restoration of damaged tissues, can be considered as a form of sponge's adaptation to extreme conditions in cold shallow water, acquired in the course of evolution.
40200855	Defect Passivation and Stress Regulation via Bidentate Anchoring of Lewis Base for High-Efficiency CsPbI<sub>3</sub> Solar Cells.	All-inorganic CsPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskites film prepared via the low-temperature solution method often suffers from numerous defects during the crystallization process. Passivators used for surface passivation typically contain monofunctional groups, including sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. These monodentate groups bind to uncoordinated Pb<sup>2+</sup> by sharing electron pairs, thereby reducing surface defects. However, the monodentate anchoring formed is relatively weak and susceptible to be damage due to its low bond strength. Herein, a bidentate Lewis base, 2-(2-pyridyl)ethylamine (2-PyEA), containing a pyridine ring and an alkyl amine, is employed to passivate surface defects and stabilize CsPbI<sub>3</sub> crystal structure. Compared to monodentate ligands, 2-PyEA displays significantly enhanced coordination ability. In particular, the bidentate anchoring of 2-PyEA introduces lattice distortion and transforms tensile stress into compressive stress within the CsPbI<sub>3</sub> film, improving the structural stability of the perovskite material. As a result, the perovskite solar cells treated with 2-PyEA achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.35% and 17.19% for active areas of 0.09 and 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Notably, the device achieves an even higher PCE of 39.95% under indoor illumination conditions. The devices exhibit higher stability under ambient conditions with 5% relative humidity.

40200850	Origin of Lithium Dendrite Formation in Sulfide-based Electrolyte.	The Li dendrite growth during battery cycles is a well-known obstacle to the practical application of sulfide-based electrolytes (SEs), notably Li3PS4 (LPS), in lithium metal batteries. However, there remains a significant gap in understanding the mechanism for Li dendrites penetration through SEs exhibiting high shear modulus. Herein, we investigate the optimum deposition sites for Li0 atoms within typical LPS configurations, encompassing crystalline, lithiated, and degraded structures, with their ionization levels employed as descriptors to determine the preferential state (Li0/Li+) of the interstitial Li. Our results suggest that both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer are predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li0 deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including crack and grain boundaries (GBs), exhibit a marked propensity to promote the electrochemical deposition of Li0 atoms. Once Li dendrites initiate, the electronic conductivities of those defects undergo a significant surge, catalyzing electron transport and facilitating Li dendrite penetration through the SEs, ultimately driving dendrite growth. Furthermore, we underscore the synergistic interaction between Li dendrite propagation and crack formation within SEs, offering deeper insights into the electrochemical-mechanical degradation mechanism in SEs. These findings present novel methodologies for predicting Li dendrite growth and open up alternative perspectives in SE engineering.

Familial adult myoclonus epilepsy (FAME) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by the same intronic TTTTA/TTTCA repeat expansion in seven distinct genes. TTTTA-only expansions are benign, whereas those containing TTTCA insertions are pathogenic.
40200847	Effect of heterozygosity, ploidy and incubation temperature on post-cranial axial skeletal meristics and deformities in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).	The teleostean post-cranial axial skeleton is a highly specialized structure for an aquatic mode of life. However, there is limited knowledge regarding parental contributions, early-life environmental impacts on its meristic variation and if reduced heterozygosity challenges its development. To address this, the present study used isogenic homozygous and heterozygous lines of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) combined with ploidy manipulation (triploidization) to manipulate parental contributions, and incubation temperature (4 vs. 8°C) as an early-life variable, and reared the fish to ~150 g for a detailed radiological examination. Genetically identical fish incubated at 4°C, but not 8°C, segregated into two size modes (upper/lower), which differed in dorsal and tail fin lepidotrich counts as well as anal-fin pterygiophore counts. Incubation temperature did not impact on vertebrae counts, whereas 8°C incubation produced more supraneurals than 4°C incubation. After 8°C incubation, homozygous diploids (100% maternal chromosomes) and heterozygous triploids (67% maternal chromosomes) developed lower total vertebrae and dorsal- and anal-fin pterygiophore counts than heterozygous diploids (50% maternal chromosomes). For tail fin lepidotrichs, the same groups showed the following pattern: diploid heterozygous > triploid heterozygous > diploid homozygous. Homozygous diploids developed a high level of complete fusions in the vertebral column. The result of the present study indicates that the ability to enter different growth modes is dependent on embryo incubation temperature and may be controlled by epigenetic mechanisms. Further, the results show a strong maternal dosage effect on tail fin lepidotrich counts, whereas for other post-cranial skeletal parts, the presence of extra maternal chromosomes seems to overrule the paternal contribution. The findings may reflect evolutionary adaptations for the shaping of offspring phenotypes. Such mechanisms would impact on important fitness-related traits, such as swimming ability and fecundity, which are relevant for conservation and evolutionary biology and ecological and aquaculture sciences. Vertebral deformities developing in homozygous fish seem to be supported by active repair mechanisms, which may reflect an organism's ability to reduce the cost of inbreeding.
40200846	Insights into the Versatile and Efficient Characteristics, Classifications, and Rational Design of Surface-Grafted Smart Hydrogels.	Hydrogels have emerged as flexible biomaterials with enormous potential in biomedical applications due to their outstanding biocompatibility and ability to hold a high water concentration. Hydrogels have low toxicity and are biodegradable. This review begins with a look at the various riveting characteristics and classifications of hydrogel nanocomposites reinforced with various metallic and ceramic components. A distinct focus is offered on thoroughly deliberating surface modification techniques with special attention on fabrication, patterning, and their applications in biomedical fields.

40200845	Ultrafast, cytocompatible mineralization of calcium phosphate in the formation of stratified nanoshells of artificial spores.	Spatially controlled confinement of catalytic enzymes within nanoshells holds substantial potential for applications in bioreactors, synthetic cells, and artificial spores. The utilization of amorphous calcium phosphate (CaP) precursors enables the extremely rapid (<5 seconds) construction of thick (∼400 nm) CaP nanoshells, stratified with distinct enzymes, on various tannic acid-primed substrates. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells are nanoencapsulated with enzyme-embedded, multilayered CaP nanoshells in a cytocompatible manner, providing an advanced chemical tool for interfacing living cells with functional entities in a spatially controlled configuration.
40200844	Quantifying and understanding the tilt of a Pt Janus active colloid near solid walls.	Active colloids powered by self-generated gradients are influenced by nearby solid boundaries, leading to their reorientation. In this study, the tilt angles (the angle between where an active colloid moves and where it faces) were measured to be 13.3° and -33.9° for 5 μm polystyrene microspheres half coated with 10 nm Pt caps moving in 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> along the bottom and top glass wall, respectively, indicating that the colloids moved with their PS (forward) caps tilted slightly toward the wall. The speeds and tilt angles of Pt Janus colloids increased consistently with increasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration (0.5 to 10 v/v%) and Pt cap thickness (5 to 50 nm). We propose that the tilt results from a balance between gravitational torque (caused by the Pt cap's weight) and chemical activity-induced torque (from self-generated chemical gradients), qualitatively supported by finite element simulations based on self-electrophoresis. Our findings are useful for understanding how chemically active colloids move in, and interact with, their environment.
40200843	Recent discussions and proposals on challenging the 3-tier immunogenicity testing strategies from the European bioanalysis forum.	The European Bioanalysis Forum, in discussions with cross-industry experts from pharmaceutical, biotech, and contract research organizations, is continuing the challenge of the traditional 3-Tier immunogenicity testing strategy, proposing a simpler, context-driven 1-Tier approach, a recent paradigm shift that emphasizes clinical relevance and the impact of anti-drug antibodies over mere incidence. In a workshop at the 17<sup>th</sup> annual Open Symposium, the meeting highlighted using signal-to-noise ratios to assess low-level ADA responses and addressed challenges such as nonspecific binding and assay reliability. Participants debated the need for continued confirmatory testing, and that it should be performed on a case-by-case basis. The shift aims to improve clinical testing strategies while reducing complexity, promoting data-driven decisions. Case studies, particularly from high-risk molecules, will guide implementation. Overall, there's strong support for the 1-Tier approach, but its success depends on robust data, industry collaboration, and regulatory approval.
40200842	Synthesis and electronic structure of atomically thin 2H-MoTe<sub>2</sub>.	An in-depth understanding of the electronic structure of 2H-MoTe<sub>2</sub> at the atomic layer limit is a crucial step towards its exploitation in nanoscale devices. Here, we show that millimeter-sized monolayer (ML) MoTe<sub>2</sub> samples, as well as smaller sized bilayer (BL) samples, can be obtained using the mechanical exfoliation technique. The electronic structure of these materials is investigated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) for the first time and by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The comparison between experiments and theory allows us to describe ML MoTe<sub>2</sub> as a semiconductor with a direct gap at the K point. This scenario is reinforced by the experimental observation of the conduction band minimum at K in Rb-doped ML MoTe<sub>2</sub>, resulting in a gap of at least 0.924 eV. In the BL MoTe<sub>2</sub> system, the maxima of the bands at Γ and K show very similar energies, thus leaving the door open to a direct gap scenario, in analogy to WSe<sub>2</sub>. The monotonic increase in the separation between spin-split bands at K while moving from ML to BL and bulk-like MoTe<sub>2</sub> is attributed to interlayer coupling. Our findings can be considered as a reference to understand quantum anomalous and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects recently discovered in ML and BL MoTe<sub>2</sub> based moiré heterostructures.

40200840	A new species of Characidium (Characiformes: Crenuchidae) from the Iguaçu National Park, Rio Iguaçu basin, Paraná, Brazil.	A new species of Characidium is described from the Iguaçu National Park, Brazil. The new species can be diagnosed from the congeners by the absence of conspicuous vertical bars, blotches and spots along the sides of the body, the presence of a scaled isthmus and adipose fin, a series of scales below lateral line and the presence of a thin dark midlateral stripe. The reticulated colour pattern of melanophores along the posterior edge of scales found in the new species is similar to that found in C. xanthopterum, with which it presents 4.2% of genetic distance. Morphological and molecular analyses showed that it is a new species, supported by multiple species delimitation methods (Assemble Species by Automatic Partitioning, the General Mixed Yule Coalescent method, and the Poisson Tree Process and its Bayesian implementation). The new species is a sister group of C. itarare, a species that occurs in the Paranapanema river basin (upper Paraná river). Despite being located within a conservation unit, the new species is known from only two creeks, raising concerns about its long-term conservation.
40200839	Design and Evaluation of Bivalent K-Ras Inhibitors that Target the CAAX Binding Site and the Acidic Surface of Farnesyltransferase and Geranylgeranyltransferase I.	Mutant K-Ras drives cancer through its membrane localization, which requires post-translational modification by farnesyltransferase (FTase). FTase attaches farnesyl to the K-Ras C-terminal CVIM tetrapeptide, enabling membrane binding. However, K-Ras can also undergo compensatory geranylgeranylation by geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I), making FTase inhibition alone ineffective. Dual inhibition of FTase and GGTase I is necessary to fully block K-Ras localization and its cancer activity. We developed bivalent inhibitors targeting both FTase and GGTase I by binding to the CVIM site and an adjacent acidic surface. A non-thiol CVIM peptidomimetic based on a piperidine scaffold showed potent FTase inhibition (Ki = 2.1 nM) with less effect on GGTase I (Ki = 210 nM). Adding cationic modules to this compound produced dual inhibitors with enhanced potency (Ki = 2-5 nM), significantly improving upon previous agents. These bivalent inhibitors effectively reduced mutant K-Ras cancer cell viability and inhibited K-Ras farnesylation and geranylgeranylation in cells. This dual-targeting approach shows promise for treating K-Ras-driven cancers.
40200838	Comorbidities of overweight and obesity associated risk factor in Saudi Arabia: a population-based analysis.	Obesity is a significant public health challenge in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), with profound impacts on individual well-being and the healthcare system. Recent epidemiological studies have reported variable trends in obesity prevalence within the country. This population-based study aimed to estimate the prevalence, identify behavioral risk factors, and assess comorbidities associated with overweight and obesity using a nationally representative sample in KSA. Findings will inform targeted public health policies, optimize healthcare resource allocation, and support Saudi Vision 2030 goals by promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing chronic diseases.
40200837	Alternative splicing engineering modulation of thermal/electrical transmission properties in low-dimensional nanodevices based on five-carbon ring structures.	Alternative splicing engineering is a potential strategy to improve the thermoelectric conversion efficiency of low-dimensional nanodevices. The unique thermal/electrical transport properties of 5-carbon ring-based structures can significantly improve thermoelectric performance. The thermoelectric properties of three carbon nanomaterials and devices containing five-carbon ring structures, namely, penta-graphene (PG), penta-octa-penta-graphene (POPG) and Θ-graphene (ΘG), were investigated using density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function methods. The results demonstrated that the folded structure of PG gave rise to ring-like electrical transport properties, which greatly reduced effective conductance. POPG exhibited smooth charge transport behavior without scattering loops, leading to relatively higher conductance compared to PG. Meanwhile, embedded 8-carbon ring structures effectively flattened the folded structure of PG and significantly reduced vertical oscillation behavior, resulting in an increase in thermal conductance. For ΘG, the addition of distorted 6-carbon ring structures excited reverse charge transport paths, resulting in lower conductance compared to POPG. The splicing geometry between the 5-carbon ring and 6-carbon ring structure disrupted the original grain boundaries, leading to enhanced phonon scattering and more localized vibrational modes. As a result, ΘG achieved a <i>ZT</i> value of 0.54 near the Fermi energy level at room temperature (300 K).
40200836	Ultrasound-Energized OX40L-Expressing Biohybrid for Multidimensional Mobilization of Sustained T Cell-Mediated Antitumor Immunity and Potent Sono-Immunotherapy.	Harnessing immunostimulation to reinvigorate antitumor effector immune cells represents a promising strategy for tumor eradication. However, achieving durable clinical outcomes necessitates multidimensional activation to sustain robust immune responses. Here, we present an ultrasound-empowered living biohybrid that strategically mobilizes T-cell-mediated immunity for potent tumor sono-immunotherapy. Through synthetic biology, we engineer bacteria to express a fusion protein encoding the costimulatory OX40 ligand (OX40L), and further functionalize them with a high-performance polymer sonosensitizer tethered via a reactive oxygen species-cleavable linker. Upon ultrasound irradiation, the sono-activated nanocargoes detach from the bacterial surface, facilitating cellular entry and exposing immune-stimulating OX40L. The potent sonodynamic effects, coupled with the native immunogenicity of bacteria, promotes tumor-associated antigen release, fosters a proinflammatory microenvironment, and drives dendritic cell maturation, thereby priming cytotoxic T-cell activation. The OX40L expressed by the engineered bacteria amplifies and sustains T-cell activity, orchestrating a robust and durable antitumor response. This cascade-amplified immune activation effectively suppresses tumor growth, induces long-lasting immune memory, and provides protection against tumor metastasis and recurrence, significantly enhancing survival outcomes. By integrating ultrasound-energized nanoadjuvants with costimulatory immune boosters, this hybrid living biotherapeutic platform offers a versatile and powerful strategy for multidimensional immune activation, advancing the frontier of cancer sono-immunotherapy.
40200835	Engineering Trap Distribution by Doping Rare Earth Ion for Mechanoluminescence Enhancement.	Mechanoluminescence materials exhibit fascinating optical properties due to their energy harvesting and controllable release capabilities. SrAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>2+</sup> (SAOE) has been extensively studied as a traditional mechanoluminescence material, however, the luminescence intensity enhancement and the luminescence mechanism of its mechanoluminescence remain an unresolved issue, which hinders the development and widespread application of excellent phosphors. Herein, a promising rare earth (Re<sup>3+</sup> = Sm<sup>3+</sup>, Dy<sup>3+</sup>, Er<sup>3+</sup>, and Tm<sup>3+</sup>) doping strategy was proposed to achieve intense mechanoluminescence of SAOE. By introducing different Re<sup>3+</sup> ions to manipulate the energy level positions in SAOE phosphors, the depth and density of electron and hole traps can be tuned, resulting in the maximum mechanoluminescence intensity of SrAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>2+</sup>, Tm<sup>3+</sup> is about 11-fold higher than that of SAOE. The mechanism governing trap distribution has been unveiled through thermoluminescence glow curve analysis and density functional theory calculations. Our research provides valuable guidance for designing high-performance phosphors and opens up new opportunities for multifunctional applications.
40200834	Signatures in Vibrational and Vibronic Spectra of Benzene Molecular Clusters.	The photoabsorption and infrared spectra (IR) of molecular systems are heavily influenced by aggregation. In the electronic spectra, the vibronic coupling effect is of utmost importance. Although treating both effects simultaneously can be challenging, it is often the only way to explain the experimental spectrum of molecular clusters. In this work, we study IR spectra and the vibronic coupling effect in the electronic photoabsorption spectra in molecular systems composed of benzene (monomer, dimers, and crystal). Photoabsorption spectra were generated using the direct vibronic coupling method at the density functional theory (DFT) level. We also simulated the spectra with the Liouville-Lanczos approach by calculating the electronic transitions along the main inducing modes for two forbidden transitions (<sup>1</sup>A<sub>1g</sub> → <sup>1</sup>B<sub>2u</sub> and <sup>1</sup>A<sub>1g</sub> → <sup>1</sup>B<sub>1u</sub>). DFT was also applied to simulate IR spectra. For the monomer, vibronic coupling was crucial to induce the first and second forbidden transitions. On the other hand, molecular aggregation was sufficient to induce the first and second forbidden transitions in almost all dimers. However, when the vibronic coupling is evaluated for the clusters, the band in the energy range of the <sup>1</sup>A<sub>1g</sub> → <sup>1</sup>B<sub>1u</sub> transition is affected both by the aggregation itself and the inducing modes. Moreover, some inducing modes drastically change the allowed <sup>1</sup>A<sub>1g</sub> → <sup>1</sup>E<sub>1u</sub> transition, depending on the dimer under study due to symmetry breaking. In terms of IR spectra, clear signatures are present. For instance, the intensities of the C-H stretching modes decrease as aggregation increases. This work shows that aggregation impacts the band shapes differently in relation to the benzene aggregate structure and the excitation under analysis.
40200833	Making the negative positive - fluorination of indole as an efficient strategy to improve guanidinium-containing gene carriers.	The balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic components plays an important role in polymeric delivery of nucleic acids. Besides using hydrophobic moieties in the polymer design, fluorination is a promising method to increase the hydrophobicity of polymers. To systematically investigate this effect, <i>N</i>-(2-(1<i>H</i>-indol-3-yl)ethyl)methacrylamide and three fluorinated analogues have been synthesized and copolymerized with 3-guanidinopropyl methacrylamide and 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylamide <i>via</i> an aqueous reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (aRAFT) polymerization. A library of eight terpolymers with 5 to 23 mol% of an indole analogue and molar mass about 20 kg mol<sup>-1</sup> showed comparably strong DNA binding starting at N/P 2 and formed polyplexes with hydrodynamic diameters around 100 nm. Additionally, no negative impact on biocompatibility was observed. Heparin release studies showed increased DNA binding strength with higher amounts of hydrophobic moieties, while fluorination exhibited similar effects as increasing the indole content. This was also important for pDNA transfection efficiency, where an optimum for DNA binding strength was unveiled. The rapid release and the excessive binding of DNA were identified as factors that negatively impacted transfection efficiency, both influenced by the amount of indole moieties and fluorination. On the other hand, the right degree of hydrophobicity was able to increase the transfection efficiency of the modified polymer by more than threefold. These findings highlight the role of hydrophobic moieties in nucleic acid delivery and provide valuable insights for future polymer design, suggesting that the strategic incorporation of fluorinated monomers can effectively fine-tune DNA interactions.
40200832	Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Molecular Subtypes of Ovarian Cancer and Constructs Prognostic Models.	Ovarian cancer (OV) remains the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The aim of this study was to identify molecular subtypes of OV through integrative multi-omics analysis and construct machine learning-based prognostic models for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy. In here, the mutation, copy number variation, RNA sequencing expression profiles, and clinical information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Multi-omics data were stratified using the MOVICS package, identifying different molecular subtypes. Our analysis identified 2 molecular subtypes (CS1 and CS2) with significant survival differences. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis revealed differential activation of transcription factors such as FOXA1 and GATA3 in CS1, whereas AR and ESR2 were enriched in CS2. A robust prognostic signature comprising 5 key genes was developed through the integration of 10 machine learning algorithms, demonstrating high predictive power across data sets. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that anti-tumor immune cells were more abundant in low-risk groups, whereas pro-tumor immune cells predominated in high-risk groups. Furthermore, low-risk patients exhibited better immunotherapy responses and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). In conclusion, our findings underscore the potential of multi-omics integration in unveiling novel OV subtypes and constructing predictive models that inform personalized treatment strategies. Future research should focus on validating these findings in larger cohorts to enhance OV management through targeted therapeutic approaches.
40200831	Feasibility and impact of a patient support group care model on diabetes and hypertension care in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya: a quasi-experimental study.

40200829	Vertical DNA Nanostructure Arrays: Facilitating Functionalization on Macro-Scale Surfaces.	The capability for varied functionalization and precise control at the nanoscale are significant advantages of DNA nanostructures. In the assembly of DNA nanostructure, the surface-assisted growth method utilizing double-crossover (DX) tile structures facilitates nucleation at relatively low concentrations on the surface based on electrostatic interactions, thereby enabling crystal growth over large areas. However, in surface-assisted growth, the geometrical hindrance of vertical structures on the DX tile structure surface makes it challenging to conjugate DNA nanostructures into fabricated surfaces. Here, the surface-assisted growth method was employed to extend the DX tile growth for forming vertical structure arrays on the substrate, providing attachment sites for functionalization on uniformly covered substrates at the macroscopic scale. Additionally, the spacing of the vertical structure arrays was demonstrated to be controllable through the strategic design of the repeating unit tiles that construct the DX crystals.
40200827	Frogs in a Hurry: Morphological and Physiological Correlates of Inter-Site Movement Success in an Aquatic Invader.	Movement is a key driver of population dynamics. Movement ability and propensity often vary among populations and individuals. These differences may be particularly strong in aquatic species, where the ability to move within a site is not necessarily correlated to the ability to move between sites. In periods of range expansion, these differences can lead to non-equilibrium dynamics, whereby more mobile phenotypes arrange themselves spatially. This can be even more pronounced when dispersal success is nonrandom with respect to a heritable trait, thus acting as an agent of selection. This process-dubbed spatial sorting-can be particularly pronounced in non-native species, often hastening the speed of invasion spread. However, before spatial sorting occurring, there must first be individual differences in traits that confer greater movement success. Recently, a high-density breeding and expanding population of the non-native pipid frog, Xenopus tropicalis, in west-central Florida, offering a great opportunity to test whether movement success is predicted by individual differences in morphology or locomotor capacity. To test this, we compared the morphology, maximal exertion capacity, and jumping performance of movers and residents. We found that relative to residents, movers had longer hindlimbs, wider ilia, and traveled for greater time intervals before reaching exhaustion. These results suggest functional morphological and physiological traits are important in determining inter-site movement success.
40200825	Is Uncertainty in the Eyes or in Parents' Talk? Linking an Eye-Tracking Measure of Toddlers' Core Metacognition to Parental Metacognitive Talk.	Recent studies have established that even preverbal infants can monitor and regulate their mental states, raising the question of the variables involved in this early metacognitive development. Here, the metacognition of fifty-five 18-month-old (27 females; mostly White; data collection: 2023) was assessed using an eye-tracking paradigm designed to capture children's ability to seek information (i.e., a cue) under uncertainty. Moreover, the relations between toddlers' metacognition and parental (52 mothers) metacognitive talk during a 10-min play session were also examined. Beyond replicating previous data showing metacognitive accuracy in toddlerhood, our results indicated that the frequency of parental utterances referring to metacognitive monitoring-but not metacognitive regulation-was related to toddlers' metacognition (OR = 1.3). Implications for sociocultural models of metacognitive development are discussed.
40200824	Dual-Mode Sensor Based on a Single-Atom Cobalt Catalyst for Simultaneous Electrochemical and Colorimetric Detection of Bioactive Small Molecules.	The design of single-atom catalysts with dual functions has emerged as a promising strategy for developing high-performance sensing platforms. Herein, we reported a facile host-guest strategy for synthesizing an atomically dispersed Co catalyst (Co-N-C), where Co atoms were uniformly anchored on the N-doped carbon matrix derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8. The as-prepared Co-N-C exhibits both excellent electrochemical sensing and peroxidase-like colorimetric activities toward the detection of three important bioactive small molecules, ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA). The electrochemical sensor demonstrated ultrahigh sensitivity with detection limits of 4.83, 1.36, and 0.371 μM for AA, DA, and UA, respectively, along with outstanding selectivity against common interferents and stable performance. Meanwhile, the colorimetric method also showed analytical performance with detection limits of 2.24 μM (AA), 3.09 μM (DA), and 2.97 μM (UA). The results indicate that the electronic modulation of Co through precise nitrogen coordination enhances the affinity of Co-N<sub><i>x</i></sub> for target reactants, thereby promoting adsorption and electron transfer throughout the reaction. This improves catalytic efficiency and selectivity, establishing Co-N-C with dual-catalytic functionality as a promising material for biosensing applications.
40200823	Serotonin-Induced Sperm Hyper-Motility In Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea Gigas) Associates With K<sup>+</sup> Efflux and Membrane Hyperpolarization.	Serotonin (5-HT) induces sperm hyper-motility in bivalves. This process has been suggested to be associated with K<sup>+</sup> efflux due to higher concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> ions in testicular fluid compared to that of seawater. This hypothesis was supported by inhibition of 5-HT-induced sperm hyper-motility in artificial seawater (ASW) containing high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> ions or in the presence of a voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker (4-AP). Here, we studied changes of sperm membrane potential to elucidate 5-HT-induced sperm hyper-motility signaling in Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Sperm motility was partially initiated (48.34 ± 7.80%) in ASW, and decreased at 5 min post-activation (p < 0.05). In the presence of 10<sup>-5</sup> M 5-HT, sperm motility was recorded 81.63 ± 3.55%, which remained unchanged within 60 min post-activation. After sperm activation in ASW with or without 5-HT, fluorescence intensity of membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent (DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5)) was decreased to lower than that of the resting stage, indicating membrane hyperpolarization. Induction of membrane hyperpolarization, using valinomycin or in K<sup>+</sup>-free ASW (KF-ASW) could not trigger sperm hyper-motility, suggesting that hyperpolarization itself did not induce sperm hyper-motility. Next, we showed that membrane hyperpolarization was due to K<sup>+</sup> efflux. The fluorescence intensity of DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5) was increased in ASW or KF-ASW containing 4-AP, suggesting membrane depolarization due to inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> efflux. The valinomycin-induced membrane hyperpolarization was changed to depolarization by subsequent additions of KCl, suggesting that changes in the electrochemical gradient of K<sup>+</sup> ions resulted in the retention of intracellular K<sup>+</sup> ions. Observed membrane depolarization in the presence of 4-AP or high K<sup>+</sup> ions was associated with inhibition of 5-HT-induced sperm hyper-motility. Taken together, this study shows that 5-HT-induced sperm hyper-motility was associated with membrane hyperpolarization due to K<sup>+</sup> efflux.
40200822	Surface Stress Engineering of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells.	Inorganic CsPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) demonstrate high potential for new-generation photovoltaics, but the imbalanced surface stress of PQDs induced by ligand deficiency and incompatibility significantly deteriorates their optoelectronic properties and phase stability, restricting their photovoltaic performance. Herein, a surface lattice regularization strategy is proposed for the surface stress engineering of PQDs, in which a series of onium cations with appropriate dimensions and good affinity with the surface lattice of PQDs are introduced into the surface lattice of PQDs, resulting in substantially ameliorated optoelectronic properties and phase stability of PQDs. Meanwhile, with surface stress engineering, the PQD solid with enhanced stacking orientation is constructed, facilitating charge carrier transport. Consequently, the PQD solar cell with an efficiency of up to 17.01% is obtained, which is one of the highest values of inorganic PQD solar cells. Such a strategy provides feasible access to maximize the optoelectronic properties of PQDs for high-performance optoelectronics.
40200821	Carrier-generation mechanism in Zn-doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> transparent conductors.	Zn-doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (IZO) has been extensively studied as a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) due to its favorable optical and electrical characteristics. In this work, to uncover the origin of degenerate n-type doping in IZO, we investigated point defects using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Among the two possible configurations of Zn dopants, namely interstitial (Zn<sub>i</sub>) and substitutional Zn(Zn<sub>In</sub>), Zn<sub>In</sub> is found to be energetically more favorable. While Zn<sub>In</sub> acts as an acceptor, potentially compensating for n-type doping, it readily forms a defect complex, Zn<sub>In</sub>-V<sub>O</sub>, by combining with oxygen vacancies (V<sub>O</sub>s), the dominant intrinsic defects in In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. This defect complex exhibits a substantial binding energy of approximately 1 eV and functions as a shallow donor. By evaluating carrier concentrations that can occur in IZO films, we demonstrate that the formation of Zn<sub>In</sub>-V<sub>O</sub> is critical to maintaining or even enhancing significant n-type conductivities of IZO. By elucidating the doping behavior of IZO, this work provides critical insights to optimize its properties, thereby helping the advancement of optoelectronic and energy devices where IZO serves as a vital TCO.
40200819	Efficient synthesis of cleavable CPP-cargo conjugate via low-equivalent of CPP activated by 2,2'-dithiodipyridine.	Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are favored for protein delivery due to their efficiency, rapidity, and low toxicity. However, conjugation of CPPs to proteins often requires significant amounts of CPPs to ensure yields, which also may result in increased proteins dimer formation. Here, we report that the use of low equivalents 2,2'-dithiodipyridine (DPDS)-activated CPP for conjugation cargo allows for high-conversion-rate CPP-cargo conjugates. Using this strategy, we obtained high-conversion-rate conjugates of cyclic deca-arginine peptide (cR10) with ubiquitin (Ub) and UbcH7 using only low equivalents of cR10. Furthermore, we successfully conjugate three CPPs to cargo via DPDS and confirmed its successful cytosolic delivery through fluorescence imaging.
40200817	Development of cysteine-sensitive bimodal probes for <i>in situ</i> monitoring of early-stage pulmonary fibrosis progression and therapeutic effects.	Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and lung scarring, leading to impaired lung function, severe respiratory distress, and potentially fatal outcomes. Early diagnosis of PF is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies to improve patient prognosis. However, an activated near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) bimodal probe for non-invasive <i>in situ</i> imaging of PF is still lacking. In this study, we developed a novel cysteine-sensitive NIRF/PA dual-modal probe, MR-Cys, for <i>in situ</i> monitoring of early progression and the therapeutic response in a mouse model of PF. The probe MR-Cys selectively detects cysteine (Cys) levels <i>in vivo</i>, thereby activating both NIRF and PA signals. Using NIRF/PA dual-modal imaging technology, MR-Cys successfully tracked fluctuations in Cys levels within the PF mouse model. After treatment with nintedanib (OFEV), a notable decrease in both PA and NIRF signal intensities was observed in the treated mice, indicating that MR-Cys can be used to assess the therapeutic efficacy for PF. Therefore, MR-Cys not only holds great promise for early detection of pulmonary fibrosis progression, but also offers a precise monitoring tool for the optimization of personalized treatment plans.
40200816	Molluscan Shells, Spicules, and Gladii Are Evolutionarily Deeply Conserved.	Shells, spicules, and chaetae are diverse among extant and extinct spiralians such as mollusks, annelids, or brachiopods. These hard parts serve different functions, but their formation process and evolutionary interrelationships are still contentious. We investigated the expression of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor encoding genes as well as the structural genes chitin synthase and ferritin in cells giving rise to shells and spicules of aculiferans, i.e. the polyplacophoran Acanthochitona fascicularis and the neomeniomorph Wirenia argentea, as well as the conchiferan cephalopod Xipholeptos notoides and the scaphopod Antalis entalis. Polyplacophorans and neomeniomorphs express hox1 (only neomeniomorphs), goosecoid, grainyhead, and chitin-synthase in their spicules. Grainyhead, notch, delta, and zic are expressed in the polyplacophoran shell fields and spicule-bearing cells. In conchiferans, hox1 (scaphopods and cephalopods), goosecoid, and grainyhead (scaphopods) are expressed in the shell fields. Ferritin, is a gene that has been shown to be expressed in the gastropod shell field; however, it is not expressed in the shell fields or by the spicule-bearing cells of the studied species. Our study shows that all candidate genes are expressed in epithelia that give rise to spicules and shells, revealing a close relationship between spicule-bearing cells and shell fields. In contrast, ferritin expression in the shell field appears to be a gastropod innovation. Building on previous research involving brachiopod and annelid chaetal sacs, our results suggest that spicules may have predated molluscan shells and may be homologous to brachiopod and annelid chaetae. If this were true, then conchiferan mollusks would have secondarily lost spicules.
40200815	Dimerization effects on the electronic properties of candidate OLED materials for optimized performance: a quantum DFT study.	In recent years, there has been growing interest in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) materials, highlighting the importance of a thorough understanding of the key factors that influence their electronic and non-linear optical (NLO) properties. To achieve this objective, we considered five candidate OLED compounds: dibenzothio-phen-sulfone-3-yl-9-phenyl-9<i>H</i>-carbazole (DBTS-CzP), 9<i>H</i>-thioxanthene-9-one-dibenzothiophene-sulfone (TXO-CzP), spiro[fluorene-9,9-thioxanthene]-10,10-dioxide (SpDBTS-CzP), 9-[4-(diphenylphosphoryl)-2,2-dimethyl-4-biphenylyl]-9<i>H</i>-carbazole (mCBPPO), and <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-bis[2-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl]-<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-di(<i>n</i>-butyl)phenylamine (DPA-2Py). We employed density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods to investigate how dimerization can affect their electronic and NLO characteristics. The results of electronic structure analysis, including HOMO-LUMO gaps and NLO characteristics, reveal that dimerization enhances dipole moments and polarizabilities, facilitating improved charge transfer and electronic transitions. Among the studied compounds, TXO-CzP demonstrates stable electronic properties and exhibits enhanced NLO characteristics post-dimerization-such as efficient charge mobility and superior color purity-positioning it as a promising candidate for advanced OLED applications. These findings underscore dimerized structures' potential to enhance optoelectronic device performance.

40200813	Prevalence and relevance of neurocognitive challenges in patients admitted to a secondary mental health outpatient clinic.	Knowledge on factors affecting mental health is pivotal to offer the appropriate help for patients referred to mental health services. Neurocognitive challenges affect a person's capacity to cope in life. If underlying issues with cognitive functioning rather than psychiatric pathology cause suffering and failure to function, other measures than merely psychiatric treatment may be needed. However, there is a lack of knowledge on occurrence of neurocognitive challenges in the general psychiatric outpatient population.

40200807	Advanced GeTe-Based Thermoelectrics: Charting the Path from Performance Optimization to Devices.	Thermoelectric (TE) materials can interconvert electricity into heat, rendering them versatile for refrigeration and power generation. GeTe as a distinguished TE material has attracted considerable focus owing to its excellent TE performance. Herein, the milestones of research progress on GeTe are reviewed. The intrinsic potentials of GeTe are elaborated, mainly focusing on crystal structure, band structure and microstructures. The path of GeTe-based thermoelectrics from performance optimization to the devices is attempted to chart, referring to its shortcomings and characteristics. Primarily, optimization of the synthesis process is implemented to inhibit the generation of Ge precipitates and phonon migration. Furthermore, the thermoelectric performance of GeTe is enhanced through its features, including phase transition, multiple valence bands, and various microstructures via doping and alloying. Subsequently, the advancements of GeTe thermoelectric devices are presented from the aspect of device integration. Eventually, the prospect and challenges for the future direction of GeTe-based materials are proposed, offering a roadmap to inject vitality into further developments.
40200806	Carbon-Supported Nano-Dispersed Metallic Copper Derived From Carbonization of MOF-199 for Electrocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction.	CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and accumulation in the ecosystem have exacerbated climate change and increased the global temperature. This study focused on the activation of hydrothermally synthesized Cu metal-organic framework (MOF-199) with potassium citrate (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>K<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) to produce MOF-derived carbon incorporated with nano-dispersed metallic Cu and oxidative Cu species to facilitate electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Among all MOF samples, the resulting MOF-derived carbon, activated by C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>K<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, demonstrated the highest electrocatalytic current and lowest charge transfer resistance, achieving a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 50% for the production of acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) at an applied potential of - 1.1 V (vs RHE). The addition of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>K<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> during preparation endowed the MOF-derived C with a mesoporous structure, thereby enhancing CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and activation. A proposed reaction pathway suggested that the generation of nano-dispersed metallic Cu is critical for forming Cu─C bonds for producing CH<sub>3</sub>COOH. This study indicates that Cu-containing MOF-derived carbon with beneficial properties for electrocatalytic applications owing to its nanoispersed Cu features could be readily synthesized.
40200805	The Influence of Different Morphologies of Black TiO<sub>2</sub> Supported Pt Catalysts on the Catalytic Oxidation of Glycerol.	The increased production of biodiesel has resulted in a corresponding rise in glycerol (GLY) production. The glycerol oxidation reaction is characterized by mild reaction conditions and relatively simple products, making it a widely utilized method for glycerol conversion and one of the most promising industrial approaches. In this study, we prepared black titanium dioxide-supported platinum catalysts with different morphology. Different catalysts were synthesized by altering the morphology of the support and the reduction temperature of the support, which exhibited distinct activities and performance in the catalytic oxidation of glycerol to glyceric acid under alkali-free conditions. The evaluation of the catalysts revealed that when flaky black titanium dioxide (F-B-TiO<sub>2</sub>) is employed as a support, the catalyst Pt/F-B-TiO<sub>2</sub> (600 °C), reduced at 600 °C, demonstrates the best catalytic performance. Characterization results indicate that the Ti<sup>3+</sup> content in the flaky (F-B-TiO<sub>2</sub>) support is higher compared to other morphologies. Additionally, at a calcination temperature of 600 °C, the Pt° content is maximized among the synthesized catalysts. Based on the experimental and characterization results, the catalytic performance is collaboratively influenced by the presence of Ti<sup>3+</sup> and Pt<sup>0</sup>.
40200804	Nanomaterials for bacterial enrichment and detection in healthcare.	Bacterial infections in the blood (sepsis) have been recognized as a leading cause of mortality in the clinical field due to limitations in the detection of bacteria at low concentration and their resistance to antibiotics by excessive misuse. Some of the common symptoms are fever, chills, rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, confusion, and changes in mental status with occasionally pale, clammy, and mottled skin. Early diagnosis and identification are the keys to a successful treatment for sepsis patients. Researchers have developed nanoparticles to enrich bacterial populations followed by detection and applied them to conventional methods such as phenotypic and molecular diagnostics to enhance different detectors' responses toward pathogens. This short review systematically overviews steps that are followed in clinical labs for bacterial detection, identification, and their drawbacks. In this context, we discuss the role that nanoparticles can play in overcoming the limits of traditional microbiology methods in terms of turnaround times (TATs) and accuracy. We believe that this short review will provide up-to-date information about the applications of nanoparticles in the enrichment, separation, and identification of bacterial infection in the clinical field and, therefore, a way of rapid treatment.
40200803	Ectopic gene conversion causing quantitative trait variation.	Why is there so much non-neutral genetic variation segregating in natural populations? We dissect function and evolution of a near-cryptic quantitative trait locus (QTL) for defense metabolites in Arabidopsis using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and nucleotide polymorphism patterns. The QTL is explained by genetic variation in a family of four tightly linked indole-glucosinolate O-methyltransferase genes. Some of this variation appears to be maintained by balancing selection, some appears to be generated by non-reciprocal transfer of sequence, also known as ectopic gene conversion (EGC), between functionally diverged gene copies. Here we elucidate how EGC, as an inevitable consequence of gene duplication, could be a general mechanism for generating genetic variation for fitness traits.

Infants under one year are vulnerable due to immature gut flora, with IB potentially causing severe symptoms, such as respiratory failure. Despite global awareness, cultural beliefs influenced caregivers' practices in Palestine. This study evaluated Palestinian parents' knowledge, beliefs, and feeding practices regarding honey to guide targeted interventions.
40200801	Micro-mechanism of the size effect on the deformation homogeneity of Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> semiconductors.	Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> based semiconductors are state-of-the-art commercial thermoelectric (TE) materials at room temperature. To improve the performance stability of Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> TE semiconductors and relevant applications in wearable devices, it is necessary to enhance their deformability. Although Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> easily fractures along the weakly bonded Van der Waals (VdW) layers, the dislocation slip process on these layers can be facilitated by modulating the weak but reversible VdW bonds, implying the potential for improvement of the plastic deformation capacity. Here, taking structural homogeneity as the characteristic evaluation criterion of the whole deformation process, the size effect of Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals on the evolution of lattice defects and plastic deformation capacity is investigated by shear deformation in molecular dynamics. The results show that the influence of lattice distortion at the boundaries is weakened with the increasing structural size, which promotes the ordered breaking-reforming process of VdW bonds and alternating dislocation slips on VdW-coupled atomic layers. It reveals a close relationship between VdW bonds and defects during structural evolution, and therefore a microscale manner of energy dissipation and deformation coordination that is conducive to strain delocalization and fracture strain enhancement. This simulation work provides new insights into the plastic deformation mechanism of inorganic semiconductors given the effect of surface and crystal size, which will improve the defect engineering strategy for designing advanced TE semiconductors.

40200798	Strategies for Enhancing Stability in Electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction.	The electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR) holds significant promise as a sustainable approach to address global energy challenges and reduce carbon emissions. However, achieving long-term stability in terms of catalytic performance remains a critical hurdle for large-scale commercial deployment. This mini-review provides a comprehensive exploration of the key factors influencing CO<sub>2</sub>RR stability, encompassing catalyst design, electrode architecture, electrolyzer optimization, and operational conditions. We examine how catalyst degradation occurs through mechanisms such as valence changes, elemental dissolution, structural reconfiguration, and active site poisoning and propose targeted strategies for improvement, including doping, alloying, and substrate engineering. Additionally, advancements in electrode design, such as structural modifications and membrane enhancements, are highlighted for their role in improving stability. Operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, and electrolyte composition also play crucial roles in extending the lifespan of the reaction. By addressing these diverse factors, this review aims to offer a deeper understanding of the determinants of long-term stability in the CO<sub>2</sub>RR, laying the groundwork for the development of robust, scalable technologies for efficient carbon dioxide conversion.

The as-prepared catalyst exhibits a low overpotential and Tafel slope, and the design approach presented here represents a promising method to design electrocatalysts for water splitting.
40200793	Neonatal trauma resuscitation: Successful use of low-titer O+ whole blood in a 4-day-old infant with hemorrhagic shock.	Neonatal trauma resuscitation is particularly challenging in cases of profound hemorrhagic shock. Low-titer group O+ whole blood (LTOWB+) has emerged as a potentially effective option in pediatric trauma, but its use in neonates is debated due to risks such as D-alloimmunization. In life-threatening emergencies, decisions must carefully balance immediate survival benefits against long-term risks.
40200791	Flexible Tunable-Plasticity Synaptic Transistors for Mimicking Dynamic Cognition and Reservoir Computing.	Inspired by biological systems, neuromorphic computing can process extensive data and complex tasks more efficiently than traditional architectures. Artificial synaptic devices, serving as fundamental components in neuromorphic computing, needto closely mimic synaptic characteristics and construct neural network computing systems. However, most existing multifunctional synapse devices are structurally complex and lack tunability, making them unsuitable for building smarter computing systems. In this work, a flexible tunable-plasticity synaptic transistor (TST) is realized with memory modulation and neuromorphic computing capabilities by using indium gallium zinc oxide as channel and a hybrid layer of polyimide and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as dielectric. The TST exhibits a novel transition from short-term plasticity to long-term one by adjusting stimulus amplitude, mirroring dynamic human memory and forgetting behaviors across various scenarios. A neural network system with low non-linearity and a wide range of conductance variations is constructed, and it demonstrates a 94.1% recognition rate on classical datasets. A reservoir computing system for 4-bit coding is also developed, which significantly reduces computational complexity and network size without sacrificing recognition accuracy. The devices and the system work as the foundation of more intelligent and more efficient computing systems.
40200790	The Regulation of Trace Metal Elements in Cancer Ferroptosis.	Ferroptosis, as novel type of regulated cell death that has garnered widespread attention over the past decade, has witnessed the continuous discovery of an increasing number of regulatory mechanisms. Trace metal elements play a multifaceted and crucial role in oncology. Interestingly, it has been increasingly evident that these elements, such as copper, are involved in the regulation of iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation and antiferroptotic systems, suggesting the existence of "nonferrous" mechanisms in ferroptosis. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the composition and mechanism of ferroptosis is provided. The interaction between copper metabolism (including cuproptosis) and ferroptosis in cancer, as well as the roles of other trace metal elements (such as zinc, manganese, cobalt, and molybdenum) in ferroptosis are specifically focused. Furthermore, the applications of nanomaterials based on these metals in cancer therapy are also reviewed and potential strategies for co-targeting ferroptosis and cuproptosis are explored. Nevertheless, in light of the intricate and ambiguous nature of these interactions, ongoing research is essential to further elucidate the "nonferrous" mechanisms of ferroptosis, thereby facilitating the development of novel therapeutic targets and approaches for cancer treatment.
40200789	Molecular Reconstruction for the High-Performance Recycled Fluororubbers.	To address the challenges associated with the difficult recycling of fluorinated specialty materials and the subpar performance of recycled products, a molecular reconstruction strategy of oxidative degradation, fluorination addition is reported, and end-group transformation, which upcycled waste fluororubber into high-performance, chemically awakenable amino-terminated low-molecular-weight fluoropolymer (ATLF-Boc). Leveraging the chemical properties of the vinylidene fluoride structure in the waste fluororubber, carboxyl-terminated low-molecular-weight fluoropolymer (CTLF) with controlled molecular weight and end-group content are synthesized. Further, the whole chain is structurally strengthened at the molecular scale to achieve higher fluorine content and thermal stability, and saturated carboxyl-terminated low-molecular-weight fluoropolymer (SCTLF) is synthesized. Subsequently, to balance high reactivity and stable storage, high-performance ATLF-Boc is synthesized, realizing the upcycling of waste fluororubber. After upcycling, the awakened ATLF exhibits a high fluorine content (66.95%), and the cured ATLF shows the regulation of surface hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (between 43° and 114°), a high tensile strength of 13.3 MPa, an excellent thermal stability (T<sub>10%</sub> = 359 °C). In this study, a novel solution for the upcycling of waste fluororubbers for fabricating functional materials is offered, which is of great significance in the field of fluorinated specialty materials.

40200765	Nutrition issues in adult hematopoietic cell transplantation: A narrative review of latest advances.	Patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are a highly heterogenous population with respect to their unique nutrient requirements and need for nutrition support. Dose-intensive conditioning regimens in addition to the debilitating effects of graft-vs-host disease impact and adversely affect the transplant recipient's nutrition status. Decreased oral intake, increased nutrient requirements, and impaired nutrient absorption and utilization often necessitate specialized nutrition support. The use of parenteral nutrition and enteral nutrition support, as well as dietary intervention strategies for immunocompromised patients, have varied over the past five decades and are highly dependent on the type of transplant used. This review highlights adult nutrition assessment components, nutrition support practices, and management of complex nutrition consequences associated with HCT.
40200763	Disentangling Carrier-Transport and Interfacial Carrier-Recombination by Mitigating Na Interstitials for 11.9% Efficient Cd-Free Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub> Solar Cells.	High-performance photovoltaic (PV) devices require optimal carrier-transport properties and minimized carrier recombination. However, these two factors are found entangled in Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub> (CZTS) solar cells due to the unintentionally introduced Na interstitial defects. The Na interstitials behave as shallow donors which can charge-passivate the acceptor-like interfacial defects but reduce the hole density and electron mobility-suppressing interfacial recombination whilst hampering carrier transport in the bulk of CZTS. Herein, we demonstrate that Na interstitials can be reduced by a device annealing process at ≈220 °C for 5 min in open air based on the strong interaction between Na and O, thus successfully disentangling the carrier-transport and junction interface carrier-recombination, leading to increased hole density from 1.3 × 10<sup>15</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> to 9.8 × 10<sup>15</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> and electron diffusion length from 0.25 to 0.35 µm. This strategy not only yields a champion 11.9% efficiency of Cd-free CZTS solar cells but also advances the understanding of carrier transport in kesterite and other emerging PV materials.
40200758	Highly Sensitive Thianthrene Covalent Trimer Room-Temperature Phosphorescent Materials for Low-Concentration Oxygen Detection.	Oxygen is ubiquitous and vital to life, industry, and environmental safety, so accurate and reliable oxygen sensing and detection is of great significance, especially for oxygen in the low concentration range. Herein, two pure organic metal-free room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials were developed using a covalent trimerization strategy of thianthrene (TA), which exhibit high oxygen sensitivity and fluorescence-RTP separated dual emission due to the moderate spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Compared with traditional metal-organic complexes, the oxygen sensitivity of RTP is improved by about two orders of magnitude, especially facilitating accurate quantitative detection of low concentration oxygen. Leveraging oxygen quenching-induced changes in emission color and intensity, coupled with computer-assisted image processing, a simple oxygen monitoring device was established to realize real-time and accurate detection of low-concentration oxygen, promoting the industrial practical application in many related fields.

Programmable ion migration in artificial ion channels constructed from two-dimensional (2D) materials represents a significant advancement in the development of bioinspired materials and technologies. Here, we achieve programmable cation migration in unipolar 2D ion channels by tuning the Debye length. These unipolar channels are engineered in a graphene oxide (GO) membrane composed of parallel-stacked, negatively charged laminae. This work provides a strategy for controlled ion transport, offering insights for biomimetic iontronics, ion-based memory, and advanced sensing applications.
40200756	Synergistic Potential of Boenninghausenia albiflora (Hook.) Rchb. ex Meisn. Essential oil Blends Against Meloidogyne incognita and Spodoptera litura: A Natural Approach to Pest Management.	This study explored the chemical composition and synergistic interactions of essential oils (EOs) from Boenninghausenia albiflora collected from four locations (Boenninghausenia albiflora Harinagar EOs, BAHEO; Boenninghausenia albiflora Bhowali EOs, BABEO; Boenninghausenia albiflora Dunagiri EOs, BADEO and Boenninghausenia albiflora Munsyari EOs, BAMEO) in Uttarakhand, India which focus on their pesticidal properties. To assess synergistic effects in pesticidal activities, EOs were combined in binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures at equivalent ratios. The major compounds present in the EOs were identified. Myrcene emerged as the most abundant component with 39.3%, in BABEO followed by 28.8% in BAMEO, 25.0% in BAHEO, and 23.0% in BADEO. β-pinene was identified in BAHEO with significant amount (11.3%). The nematicidal and antifeedant activities of EOs and their combinations were evaluated. BAHEO, BABEO, BADEO and BAMEO (1:1:1:1) synergistically catalysed the highest egg hatching inhibition and juvenile mortality against Meloidogyne incognita. Similarly, antifeedant activity against Spodoptera litura was strongest in BAHEO, BABEO, BADEO and BAMEO (1:1:1:1). The novelty of this research lies in its pioneering exploration of the pesticidal properties of essential oils derived from Boenninghausenia albiflora. By evaluating the pesticidal activity of these selected Rutaceae herb, this study aims to fill a significant gap in the current scientific knowledge.
40200755	Utilization of polygenic risk scores in drug development protocols.	The development of polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which make use of genetic testing to assess an individual's risk of developing certain diseases or conditions based on collective genetic variant information, can be applied in drug development to enrich clinical trials or predict response to treatment. From querying documents submitted to the Food & Drug Administration, the landscape of use of PRSs across time shows increased use in guiding clinical trials. Of the clinical trial protocols submitted, most were in the therapeutic areas of neurology, radiology (imaging and diagnostic pharmaceuticals), psychiatry, and oncology. Use of PRSs in clinical trials is most frequent in early drug development (phase 1, phase 1/2, or phase 3) and generally supports secondary or exploratory analyses. Additionally, about half of the protocols developed novel PRSs, and the other half used preexisting PRSs. As researchers, regulators, and clinicians aim to understand the results and implications of PRSs in clinical trials, the continued use of PRSs, despite being less common, reinforces the need for further exploration.
40200754	Suppression of oocyte glycine transporter activity in mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes before resumption of meiosis†.	Glycine is a key regulator of cell volume in early preimplantation mouse embryos and supports embryo viability. Its accumulation is initiated when the GLYT1 glycine transporter (SLC6A9) is activated in oocytes at about the same time the oocyte is released from meiotic arrest at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage. The mechanism by which GLYT1 is maintained in an inactive state before ovulation is triggered is unknown. Here, we have shown that GLYT1 activity can remain suppressed in isolated cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) under defined culture conditions that include keeping COCs physically separated and using the physiological mediator of GV arrest, Natriuretic Peptide Precursor C (NPPC). When GV arrest is instead maintained in oocytes within COCs by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) or cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), GLYT1 similarly remains inactive. However, GLYT1 becomes activated in isolated GV oocytes similarly maintained in GV arrest, indicating that cumulus cells are required for suppressing GLYT1 activity. This implied that meiotic arrest was necessary but not sufficient for preventing GLYT1 activation and that an inhibitory factor likely arising from the cumulus was also required. Finally, we found that pyrrophenone, a selective inhibitor of arachidonic acid production by cytoplasmic phospholipase A alpha (cPLAα), caused GLYT1 to become activated in oocytes within COCs despite maintenance of meiotic arrest of the oocyte. Since arachidonic acid levels decrease in oocytes after release from GV arrest, we propose that arachidonic acid may be a candidate for the inhibitory factor in COCs that regulates GLYT1 activity.
40200753	Identification of stress-alleviating strains from the core drought-responsive microbiome of Arabidopsis ecotypes.	Plant genetic and metabolic cues are involved in assembling their "core microbiome" under normal growth conditions. However, whether there is a core "stress responsive microbiome" among natural plant ecotypes remains elusive. Drought is the most significant abiotic stress worldwide. Characterizing conserved core root microbiome changes upon drought stress has the potential to increase plant resistance and resilience in agriculture. We screened the drought tolerance of 130 worldwide Arabidopsis ecotypes and chose the extremely drought tolerant and sensitive ecotypes for comparative microbiome studies. We detected diverse shared differentially abundant ASVs, network driver taxa among ecotypes, suggesting the existence of core drought-responsive microbiome changes. We previously identified 1479 microorganisms through high-throughput culturing, and successfully matched diverse core drought responsive ASVs. Our phenotypic assays validated that only those core drought responsive ASVs with higher fold changes in drought tolerant ecotypes were more likely to protect plants from stress. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that a keystone strain, Massilia sp. 22G3, can broadly reshape osmotic stress responses in roots, such as enhancing the expression of water up-taking, ROS scavenging, and immune genes. Our work reveals the existence of a core drought-responsive microbiome and demonstrates its potential role in enhancing plant stress tolerance. This approach helps characterize keystone "core drought responsive" microbes, and we further provided potential mechanisms underlying Massilia sp. 22G3 mediated stress protection. This work also provided a research paradigm for guiding the discovery of core stress-alleviating microbiomes in crops using natural ecotypes (cultivars).

40200749	Phototunable Rayleigh 3D Soft Self-Oscillator Enabling Versatile Biomimetic Tubular Peristaltic Pumping.	Living tubular organs can spatiotemporally and cyclically deform their muscular walls to implement adaptable and sustainable peristaltic pumping applicable to broad matter, achieved via asymmetric and non-equilibrium self-oscillating deformations of muscular walls. However, man-made tubular soft actuators have been limited to pumping a few simple matters, because of their reciprocal and monotonic wall motions that cannot break time-reversal symmetry and system equilibrium to gain adaptable and sustainable pumping. Here, a phototunable Rayleigh 3D soft self-oscillator (PR3DSSO) capable of multimodal, nonreciprocal, self-sustainable wall deformations is presented. PR3DSSO's design leverages two direction-and-dimension-phototunable tubular instabilities: snapping and postbuckling. The post-buckling instability can generate local-wall origami which cannot only fold local walls into multimodal shape-mode waves, but also break wall-motion symmetry; snapping instabilities help break equilibrium in wall motions to initiate autonomous wall motions. These phototunable-instabilities-driven wall deformations unprecedentedly create Rayleigh-like 3D wall motions, which allow for versatile biomimetic tubular peristaltic pumping adapt to broad matter. Our PR3DSSO would spur creative life-like active-material designs and novel pumping functions.

This short research analysis presents a new perspective on the problem and introduces a future potential solution via measuring the mechanical properties of insulin and discusses the challenges foreseen in the feasibility of this proposed solution.
40200745	Transition-metal-free arene C-H functionalization for the synthesis of sulfoximines.	A transition-metal-free C-H functionalization method has been developed for the synthesis of aryl sulfoximines. This two-step protocol involves the 3,5-dimethyl-4-isoxazolyliodonium salt as an intermediate. The iodonium salt is obtained with high site selectivity from arenes <i>via</i> C-H activation, and is then converted into sulfoximines through a ligand coupling at the hypervalent iodine center with sulfinamides. The process is mild and does not require transition metals, enabling the late-stage incorporation of chiral sulfonimidoyl groups into drug candidates.
40200744	Recent Developments in Heterogeneous Catalyzed Epoxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Oxide.	Epoxidation of ethylene to produce ethylene oxide (EO) is a vital heterogeneous catalytic chemical process in industry, as EO is an important intermediate for the synthesis of fine chemicals including ethylene glycol, ethoxylates, plastics and polyester. EO is commercially produced by the silver-catalyzed partial oxidation of ethylene with air or oxygen. However, it remains challenging to understand its chemical behavior under reaction conditions. To overcome this challenge, a series of catalysts with well-defined structures have been developed. The present review is devoted to summarizing the recent advances in the exploitation of novel catalytic materials for the epoxidation of ethylene, such as metal nanoparticles, clusters, single atoms, and bimetal. The role of promoters in selectivity enhancement will be discussed. A deep understanding of the active species, oxygen species, active structures, activity-structure relationship, and mechanisms contributing to epoxidation process are highlighted. The integration with other advanced technologies such as electrocatalytic and photocatalytic is also reviewed. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects are provided so as to give guidance for the design of efficient catalysts for heterogeneous epoxidation of ethylene to EO, and to improve the fundamental understanding of the underlying catalytic chemistry.

The heme/Cu sulfite reductase bears a distal Cu metal coordinated to two cysteines. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to H<sub>2</sub>S. Very little is known about the electronic structure and reactivity of this enzyme. Synthetic modelling can allow access to the properties of the active site. However, installing thiolates on porphyrin rings is not adequately represented in the literature. In this paper, we describe a synthetic methodology to install multiple thiolates on porphyrin rings which can be used to bind a second metal. In addition, to the complexity of keeping several thiols adjacent to each other, this work also reports unprecedented demetallation of iron porphyrin in the presence of multiple thiol functional groups in the vicinity.

40200732	Co-expression of HSV-1 ICP34.5 enhances the expression of gene delivered by self-amplifying RNA and mitigates its immunogenicity.	Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vectors have garnered significant attention for their potential in transient recombinant protein expression and vaccination strategies. These vectors are notable for their safety and the ability to produce high levels of protein from minimal input templates, offering a promising avenue for gene therapy applications. Despite their advantages, saRNA vectors face a critical challenge in their propensity to trigger a robust innate immune response. The presence of double-stranded RNA intermediates during saRNA replication activates pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to the activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and interferon (IFN) signaling, which can result in a general translational shutdown within the host cell. To mitigate the stimulatory effects on PRRs and enhance the translation efficiency of saRNA, this study employs the saRNA-encoding HSV-1 neurovirulence protein ICP34.5, which is known for its ability to counteract the effects of PKR activation, potentially improving the translation efficiency of saRNA. It was shown that saRNA-encoding ICP34.5 clearly mediated the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha subunit (eIF2α) dephosphorylation and significant suppression of innate immune responses in vitro, leading to enhanced expression of saRNA-encoded genes. The application of ICP34.5 incorporating saRNA vectors offers a more efficient and cost-effective solution for the production of proteins and the development of vaccines. This strategy could revolutionize the fields where saRNA utilization is envisioned, particularly in neurotropic disease applications where HSV-1 proteins may offer additional benefits.
40200731	Buried Interface Regulation with a Supramolecular Assembled Template Enables High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cells for Minimizing the V<sub>OC</sub> Deficit.	Despite the rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the past decade, the open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) of PSCs still lags behind the theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit. Energy-level mismatch and unwanted nonradiative recombination at key interfaces are the main factors detrimental to V<sub>OC</sub>. Herein, a perovskite crystallization-driven template is constructed at the SnO<sub>2</sub>/perovskite buried interface through a self-assembled amphiphilic phosphonate derivative. The highly oriented supramolecular template grows from an evolutionary selection growth via solid-solid phase transition. This strategy induces perovskite crystallization into a highly preferred (100) orientation toward out-of-plane direction and facilitated carrier extraction and transfer due to the elimination of energy barrier. This self-assembly process positively passivates the intrinsic surface defects at the SnO<sub>2</sub>/perovskite interface through the functionalized moieties, a marked contrast to the passive effect achieved via incidental contacts in conventional passivation methods. As a result, PSCs with buried interface modification exhibit a promising PCE of 25.34%, with a maximum V<sub>OC</sub> of 1.23 V, corresponding to a mere 0.306 V deficit (for perovskite bandgap of 1.536 eV), reaching 97.2% of the theoretical V<sub>OC</sub> limit. This strategy spontaneously improves the long-term operational stability of PSCs under thermal and moisture stress (ISOS-L-3: MPP, 65 °C, 50% RH, T<sub>92</sub> lifetime exceeding 1200 h).
40200730	Effect of the delayed wash (deglycerolisation) on the red blood cell morphology: Comparison of AFM and optical profilometry.	The morphological characterisation is crucial for analysing cell states, especially for red blood cells (RBCs), which are used in transfusions. This study compared the applicability of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal optical profilometry in the accurate characterisation of the RBC morphological parameters. The imaging of RBCs thawed after cryopreservation with immediate and delayed washing steps (deglycerolisation) was performed, and the morphological data obtained with AFM and optical profilometry were compared with the clinical laboratory studies. Both techniques provided close data on the morphological parameters, but optical profilometry allowed a faster and more convenient data acquisition. However, the membrane roughness analysis on discocytes and the submembrane cytoskeleton analysis on RBC ghosts was only possible with AFM due to its higher spatial resolution. Both techniques confirmed that delayed washing did not have negative effects on cells compared to immediate washing. Additional 3-day storage of both types of RBCs resulted in increased haemolysis. A decrease in the fraction of area occupied by pores in the submembrane cytoskeleton with the storage time was observed, possibly associated with the cytoskeleton deterioration. The studied conditions model the transportation of thawed RBCs in a cryoprotectant solution to medical facilities that have technical conditions to wash thawed RBCs and confirm its feasibility.
40200729	EXPRESS: TRIM14-NF-κB pathway in the anterior cingulate cortex modulates comorbid depressive symptoms in chronic pain.	Depression is commonly observed in individuals suffering from chronic pain, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind these symptoms are still not fully understood. This study highlights the important role of the TRIM14-NF-κB pathway in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in regulating comorbid depressive symptoms associated with chronic pain. Our results show that the CFA model induces both chronic pain and depression-like behaviors in mice, with significant activation of the ACC brain regions. Specifically, the protein expression of TRIM14 was notably elevated in the ACC of CFA mice. Furthermore, reducing TRIM14 expression alleviated both chronic pain and depression-like behaviors in these mice. In addition, we also discovered that NF-κB may act as a downstream target of TRIM14, as silencing TRIM14 expression led to a reduction in the levels of phosphorylated NF-κB. Notably, inhibiting NF-κB produced similar improvements in chronic pain and depression-like behaviors, mirroring the effects observed with TRIM14 knockdown. In summary, our findings emphasize the critical role of the TRIM14-NF-κB pathway in regulating chronic pain and depression-like behaviors in the CFA mouse model. These insights provide a foundation for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic pain and depression, and may guide the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

40200726	Optimizing SiO<sub>2</sub> Nanoparticle Structures to Enhance Drought Resistance in Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> L.): Insights into Nanoparticle Dissolution and Plant Stress Response.	Drought stress significantly limits crop productivity and poses a critical threat to global food security. Silica nanoparticles (SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs) have shown a potential to mitigate drought stress, but the role of the nanostructure on overall efficacy remains unclear. This study evaluated solid (SSiO<sub>2</sub>NPs), porous (PSiO<sub>2</sub>NPs), and hollow (HSiO<sub>2</sub>NPs) SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs for their effects on drought-stressed tomatoes (<i><i>Solanum lycopersicum</i></i> L.). Silicic acid release rates followed the order: HSiO<sub>2</sub>NPs > PSiO<sub>2</sub>NPs > SSiO<sub>2</sub>NPs > Bulk-SiO<sub>2</sub>. Compared to untreated controls, foliar application of PSiO<sub>2</sub>NPs and HSiO<sub>2</sub>NPs under drought stress significantly improved shoot Si concentrations and plants' dry weight. These treatments also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) and phytohormone-targeted metabolome levels (jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and auxin), contributing to greater drought tolerance. Conversely, SSiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, silicic acid, and Bulk-SiO<sub>2</sub> had minimal impact on plant dry weight or physiological responses. These results highlight the importance of nanoparticles architecture in alleviating drought stress and promoting sustainable agriculture.

40200718	Raman spectral band imaging for the diagnostics and classification of canine and feline cutaneous tumors.	This study introduces Raman imaging technique for diagnosing skin cancer in veterinary oncology patients (dogs and cats). Initially, Raman spectral bands (with specificity to certain molecular structures and functional groups) were identified in formalin-fixed samples of mast cell tumors and soft tissue sarcomas, obtained through routine veterinary biopsy submissions. Then, a custom-built Raman macro-imaging system featuring an intensified CCD camera (iXon Ultra 888, Andor, UK), tunable narrow-band Semrock (USA) optical filter compartment was used to map the spectral features at 1437 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1655 cm<sup>-1</sup> in <i>ex vivo</i> tissue. This approach enabled wide-field (cm<sup>2</sup>), rapid (within seconds), and safe (< 400 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) imaging conditions, supporting accurate diagnosis of tissue state. The findings indicate that machine learning classifiers - particularly support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) - effectively distinguished between soft tissue sarcoma, mastocytoma and benign tissues using Raman spectral band imaging data. Additionally, combining Raman macro-imaging with residual near-infrared (NIR) autofluorescence as a bimodal imaging technique enhanced diagnostic performance, reaching 85 - 95% in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision - even with a single spectral band (1437 cm<sup>-1</sup> or 1655 cm<sup>-1</sup>). In conclusion, the proposed bi-modal imaging is a pioneering method for veterinary oncology science, offering to improve the diagnostic accuracy of malignant tumors.

40200711	Heme-Aβ compound 0: a common intermediate in ROS generation and peroxidase activity.	Oxidative stress is a key factor in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is the leading cause of dementia. A hallmark of AD is the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, along with redox-active metal ions and heme cofactors, all of which significantly contribute to disease progression. When heme binds to Aβ, it can drive oxidative stress through two primary pathways: firstly, reduced high-spin ferrous heme-Aβ active sites may generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through oxygen reduction, leading to the oxidation of biomolecules and lipid membranes; secondly, this H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can react with the oxidised form of high-spin ferric heme-Aβ, initiating peroxidase-like activity that can catalyse the oxidation of neurotransmitters. These pathways converge at a crucial intermediate <i>i.e.</i> the heme-Aβ-peroxo complex, which serves as the final intermediate in the ROS cycle and the first in the peroxidase cycle. Although, we have previously characterized other intermediates in these pathways, compound 0 resulting from the reaction of a high-spin heme-Aβ species with peroxides has remained elusive due to its rapid hydrolysis in an aqueous environment. In this study, we report the oxidation of dopamine by peroxides catalyzed by ferric heme-Aβ species and successfully stabilised and characterized compound 0 of high-spin heme-Aβ in dimethylformamide, an organic aprotic solvent. This stabilization enables detection through stopped-flow, EPR and resonance Raman spectroscopy, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the oxidative stress caused by high-spin heme-Aβ.

40200705	Serum IgG galactosylation as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of echinococcosis.	Echinococcosis is a serious and potentially fatal parasitic zoonosis, which can be divided into two subtypes in humans including cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE). It poses a great threat to patients' lives, making timely diagnosis and subtype discrimination crucial. AE is easily confused with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to their highly similar features, so differential diagnosis is also imperative. In this work, the galactosylation level of serum IgG was analyzed by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) in a cohort comprising patients, including 100 diagnosed with CE, 27 with AE and 29 with HCC. The relative quantification of IgG digalactosylated (G2), monogalactosylated (G1), and agalactosylated (G0) <i>N</i>-glycans with the formula G0/(G1 + G2 × 2) (IgG Gal-ratio) was obtained and found to effectively distinguish between echinococcosis patients, CE and AE patients, and healthy controls, respectively. Meanwhile, the IgG Gal-ratio was evidently related to different types of CE (from CE1 to CE5) and the follow-up CE disease progress. Furthermore, the IgG Gal-ratio shows the potential differential diagnosis of AE and HCC. Thus, the results demonstrate that the IgG Gal-ratio has the potential to be a biomarker for diagnosis and discrimination of echinococcosis, which also needs to be verified in further studies.
40200696	Ru-based nanoparticle catalyzed direct H/D exchange of silanes.	Deuterated silanes, among the most important reagents for introducing deuterium atoms, are widely utilized in organic synthesis. However, synthesizing versatile deuterated silanes under mild conditions remains a challenge. In this study, we report an effective method for H/D exchange of silanes using Ru-bpy@γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Deuterium gas (D<sub>2</sub>), generated <i>in situ</i> from the electrolysis of D<sub>2</sub>O, served as the deuterium source. Various hydrosilanes and hydrosiloxanes undergo smooth H/D exchange under mild conditions. Furthermore, the products were applied for the derivatization of a wide range of compounds.
40200693	A homozygous human WNT11 variant is associated with laterality, heart and renal defects.	Wnt signaling plays important roles during vertebrate development, including left-right axis specification as well as heart and kidney organogenesis. We identified a homozygous human WNT11 variant in an infant with Situs inversus totalis, complex heart defects and renal hypodysplasia, and we used Xenopus embryos to functionally characterize this variant. WNT11c.814delG encodes a protein with reduced stability that lost signaling activity in vivo. This is remarkable, because the variant encodes a truncated ligand with nearly identical length and predicted structure to dominant-negative Wnts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alteration of the truncated C-terminal end can restore stability and signaling activity similar to Xenopus dominant-negative Wnt11b. Our study also suggests similar functions for WNT11 in human development as described in model organisms. Therefore, biallelic WNT11 dysfunction should be considered as novel genetic cause in syndromal human phenotypes presenting with congenital heart defects and renal hypoplasia, with or without laterality defects. The work presented here enhances our understanding of human development and structure-function relationships in Wnt ligands.

40200685	Single ultrabright fluorescent silica nanoparticles can be used as individual fast real-time nanothermometers.	Optical-based nanothermometry represents a transformative approach for precise temperature measurements at the nanoscale, which finds versatile applications across biology, medicine, and electronics. The assembly of ratiometric fluorescent 40 nm nanoparticles designed to serve as individual nanothermometers is introduced here. These nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented sensitivity (11% K<sup>-1</sup>) and temperature resolution (128 K Hz<sup>-1/2</sup> W cm<sup>-2</sup>), outperforming existing optical nanothermometers by factors of 2-6 and 455, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the encapsulation of fluorescent molecules with high density inside the mesoporous matrix. It becomes possible after incorporating hydrophobic groups into the silica matrix, which effectively prevents water ingress and dye leaking. A practical application of these nanothermometers is demonstrated using confocal microscopy, showcasing their ability to map temperature distributions accurately. This methodology is compatible with any fluorescent microscope capable of recording dual fluorescent channels in any transparent medium or on a sample surface. This work not only sets a new benchmark for optical nano-thermometry but also provides a relatively simple yet powerful tool for exploring thermal phenomena at the nanoscale across various scientific domains.

40200588	Correlation Between DNA Double-Strand Break Distribution in 3D Genome and Ionizing Radiation-Induced Cell Death.	The target theory is the most classical hypothesis explaining radiation-induced cell death, yet the physical or biological nature of the "target" remains ambiguous. This study hypothesizes that the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome is a pivotal factor affecting the probability of radiation-induced cell death. We propose that clustered DSBs in DNA segments with high-interaction frequencies are more susceptible to leading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domains (TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB clustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB distribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we developed a simplified model considering the DSB distribution across TADs. Utilizing track-structure Monte Carlo codes to simulate the electron and carbon ion irradiation, and we calculated the incidence of each DSB case across a variety of radiation doses and linear energy transfers (LETs). Our simulation results indicate that DSBs in TADs with frequent interactions (case 3) are significantly more likely to induce cell death than clustered DSBs within a single TAD (case 2). Moreover, case 2 is significantly more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs (case 1). The curves of the incidence of cases 2 and 3 compared with LETs have a similar shape to the radiation quality factor (Q) used in radiation protection. This indicates that these two cases are also associated with the stochastic effects induced by high-LET radiation. Our study underscores the crucial significance of the 3D genome structure in the fundamental mechanisms of radiobiological effects. The hypothesis in our research offers novel perspectives on the mechanisms that regulate radiobiological effects. Moreover, it serves as a valuable reference for the establishment of mechanistic models that can predict cell survival under different doses and LETs.
40200580	A Murine Model of Radionuclide Lung Contamination for the Evaluation of Americium Decorporation Treatments.	The hydroxypyridinone ligand 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) (HOPO), has been previously characterized as a promising chelating agent for in vivo decorporation of actinides, with decorporation being the removal of internally deposited contaminants from the body after exposure. The large majority of relevant literature reports have detailed the efficacy profile of HOPO as a decorporation agent in rodent models, where controlled radionuclide contamination is conducted via intravenous injection. However, this method of contamination does not necessarily reflect an accurate predictive model of the most probable biodistribution of free metal in the body. In the event of a radiological dispersal device or nuclear power plant accident scenario, it is most likely that first responders, military personnel, and victims of the event will be contaminated via air and water transmission. Therefore, research into the efficacy of chelating agents to treat lung-contaminated in vivo models needs to be carried out. Here, we establish a murine model with controlled, reproducible lung contamination using two different radionuclides, 89Zr and 241Am, for orthogonal biodistribution validation by positron emission tomography and ex vivo radioanalysis, respectively. In addition, we report effective chelation treatment of 241Am-contaminated lungs using HOPO, which improves decorporation by up to 40% compared to Ca-DTPA, the current standard of care.
40200571	Imatinib-Induced Clinical Response in ETV6::ACSL6 Myeloid Neoplasm with Eosinophilic Pneumonitis: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND Myeloid neoplasms with [em]ETV6::ACSL6[/em] fusions are extremely rare entities that are characterized by eosinophilic and/or basophilic leukocytosis. While they clinically mimic myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase fusions such as [em]ETV6::PDGFRB[/em], they have not been shown to be responsive to imatinib. There are currently no effective treatments available and clinical outcomes are poor. CASE REPORT We report a rare case of a 71-year-old man with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome/neoplasms (MDS) with mutated [em]SF3B1[/em] and multilineage dysplasia treated with luspatercept followed by azacitidine. However, he developed clonal evolution of disease to MDS with hypereosinophilia. Chromosome analysis identified t(5;12)(q31;p13). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was negative for [em]FIP1L1/PGFFRA[/em] or [em]PDGFRB[/em] gene rearrangement, but RNA-sequencing identified the [em]ETV6::ACSL6[/em] fusion. He received a hematopoietic cell transplantation with achievement of complete remission but subsequently relapsed, with chromosome analysis again revealing t(5;12)(q31;p13) [[em]ETV6::ACSL6[/em]]. He rapidly clinically deteriorated and developed refractory respiratory failure due to acute eosinophilic pneumonitis. He received a prolonged course of high-dose steroids without adequate improvement of the eosinophilia. Based on reports showing good response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with the [em]ETV6::PDGFRB[/em] fusion, treatment was switched to imatinib, leading to rapid normalization of absolute eosinophil counts, with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that imatinib should be considered for patients with a myeloid neoplasm with an [em]ETV6::ACSL6[/em] fusion who are refractory to corticosteroids. Further molecular investigations are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of imatinib sensitivity in [em]ETV6::ASCL6[/em]-associated disease, given the absence of genetic involvement of a tyrosine kinase.
40200563	Etiological Patterns of Protein-Energy Malnutrition in a Pediatric Clinic in China.	BACKGROUND Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) often occurs within 5 years of age. Untreated PEM in early childhood can affect growth and cognitive function later in life. However, the etiologies of PEM in children are still poorly explored. This study investigated the etiological distribution of PEM in children attending a pediatric health clinic. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study involved 286 children with PEM who visited the West China Second University Hospital Child Healthcare for Xinchuan West China Center for Child Development and Excellence from January to December 2022. Patients were divided into moderate and mild PEM groups according to the severity of PEM. A retrospective analysis of the etiology of PEM was conducted. RESULTS The top 5 etiologies of PEM were food allergy (FA) (57.0%), small for gestational age (SGA) (26.6%), dietary behavior problems (14.3%), premature infants (8.0%), and recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTI) (4.5%). The proportions of SGA and RRTI patients in the moderate PEM group were significantly greater than the mild PEM group (P<0.001). The proportion of patients with 2 or more etiologies in the moderate PEM group was significantly greater than the mild PEM group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The primary reasons for PEM in the investigated children were FA and SGA. Moderate PEM cases were mostly attributed to multiple etiologies. A multidisciplinary management approach involving pediatricians, nutritionists, and social workers is essential for addressing the complex needs of affected children. The importance of early diagnosis and timely management should be emphasized to reduce the number of PEM cases.
40200557	Diphthamide formation in Arabidopsis requires DPH1-interacting DPH2 for light and oxidative stress resistance.	Diphthamide is a post-translationally modified histidine residue of eukaryotic TRANSLATION ELONGATION FACTOR 2 (eEF2) and the target of diphtheria toxin in human cells. In yeast and mammals, the 4Fe-4S cluster-containing proteins Dph1 and Dph2 catalyze the first biosynthetic step of diphthamide formation. Here, we identify Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DPH2 and show that it is required for diphthamide biosynthesis, localizes to the cytosol and interacts physically with AtDPH1. Arabidopsis dph2 mutants form shorter primary roots and smaller rosettes than the wild type, similar to dph1 mutants which we characterized previously. Additionally, increased ribosomal -1 frameshifting error rates and attenuated TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase activity in dph2 mutants also phenocopy the dph1 mutant. Beyond the known heavy-metal hypersensitivity and heat shock tolerance of dph1, we show here that both dph1 and dph2 mutants are hypersensitive to elevated light intensities and oxidative stress, and that wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings accumulate diphthamide-unmodified eEF2 under oxidative stress. Both mutants share the deregulation of 1,186 transcripts associated with several environmental and hormone responses. AtDPH1 and AtDPH2 do not complement the corresponding mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In summary, DPH2 and DPH1 interact to function inter-dependently in diphthamide formation, the maintenance of translational fidelity, wild-type growth rates and TOR kinase activation, and they contribute to mitigating damage from elevated light intensities and oxidative stress. Under oxidative stress, a dose-dependent loss of diphthamide could potentiate downstream effects in a feed-forward loop. This work advances our understanding of translation and its interactions with growth regulation and stress responses in plants.
40200555	Synaptic dysregulation in a mouse model of GRIN2D developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.	Gain-of-function (GoF) variants in the GRIN2D gene, encoding the GluN2D subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), cause a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), characterized by intractable seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delay. We generated mice carrying the GoF V664I variant, orthologous to V667I, which is present in ∼25% of GRIN2D-DEE patients. Heterozygous mutant mice demonstrate behavioral, neuroanatomical, and electrophysiological abnormalities. Lethal convulsive seizures are observed beginning at postnatal day 17. As adults, heterozygotes display abundant and prolonged runs of spike-wave discharges (SWD) that often persist for minutes. The SWD epochs consist of different populations, differentiated by frequency and association with time-locked behavioral arrest. V664I mutant neurons have enlarged presynaptic terminals and increased synaptic distance. Functional analysis reveals increased inhibitory synaptic activity without changes in NMDAR decay kinetics or presynaptic plasticity in CA1 neurons and analysis of hippocampal local field potentials show a 1.5-fold increase in evoked responses and a 1.7-fold increase in action potential generation. Notably, expression of V664I in GABAergic interneurons, but not excitatory forebrain neurons, is sufficient to recapitulate the severe electroclinical phenotype. Altogether our studies show that altered NMDAR function in inhibitory neurons plays a prominent role in DEE associated with GRIN2D gain-of-function variants and suggests that targeted genetic treatment may represent a path forward to successful therapeutic intervention.

40200552	Approach to the Patient: Hirsutism.	Hirsutism affects approximately 10% of women globally, with significant economic and quality of life impact. Facial and body terminal hair growth in a male-like pattern is determined by a number of factors, including circulating androgens, and tissue androgen receptor, 5α-reductase, 3α- and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and ornithine decarboxylase content. The presence of hirsutism is usually determined by the modified Ferriman Gallwey (mFG) visual scale, assessing the amount of terminal hair at nine body sites (upper lip, chin, chest, upper and lower back, upper and lower abdomen, upper arms and thighs). Specific diagnostic cut-offs vary somewhat by ethnicity, although hirsutism is usually defined by an mFG score of >4-6. Hirsutism is a sign of polycystic ovary syndrome in 80-90% of affected women, idiopathic hirsutism in 5-10%, and, depending on ethnicity, 21-hydroxylase deficient non-classic adrenal hyperplasia in 1-10%. Rarer causes include androgen-secreting neoplasms, iatrogenic/drug-induced, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, syndromes of severe insulin resistance/lipodystrophy, ovarian hyperthecosis, and chronic skin irritation. The choice of treatment for hirsutism depends on the severity of symptoms, the patient's reproductive goals, and the underlying cause. Clinicians should not underestimate the degree of patient distress caused by hirsutism. Further, women who complain of excess unwanted hair growth should be evaluated for underlying causes, regardless of the degree to which hirsutism is observable on examination. Management options include medical therapies, such as combined oral contraceptive pills and anti-androgens, and mechanical methods of hair removal. The most effective therapeutic strategy will involve a combination of these modalities, with shared decision-making a key driver.

40200397	The Spectrum of Mitral Regurgitation in Lung Transplant Recipients: A Systematic Review.	Mitral regurgitation (MR) in lung transplant (LTx) recipients is a rare but complex cardiopulmonary phenomenon. The overlap between symptoms of MR and post-LTx complications, such as primary graft dysfunction, complicates its diagnosis and management. This systematic review aims to characterize the incidence, pathophysiology, presentation, and management of MR in LTx patients. We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase. The search yielded 133 studies, of which 11 were included. Data regarding MR development, clinical presentation, echocardiographic findings, and management strategies were extracted and analyzed. Perioperative MR, occurring during or immediately post-LTx, was frequently attributed to the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (MV) occurring in the setting of hypovolemia and/or inotrope usage. Later postoperative MR, on the other hand, was associated with reverse ventricular remodeling and mitral annular dilation, although some variability in the literature was present. Preexisting MR or ventricular dysfunction, elongated MV leaflets, and bilateral LTx procedure appeared to be risk factors for MR development. Management was dependent on the timing of MR and its pathophysiology, where systolic anterior motion-related MR was treated with medical therapy, whereas postoperative MR often required MV interventions. In conclusion, the diagnosis of MR in LTx patients is complicated by its symptomatic overlap with other post-LTx complications. Echocardiographic monitoring in patients with preexisting MR, regardless of severity, is essential for early identification and management. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and refine management strategies for MR in this population.
40200394	Donor Variability and PD-1 Expression Limit BK Polyomavirus-specific T-cell Function and Therapy.	BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) nephropathy is a major cause of premature kidney transplant failure. Current management relies on reducing immunosuppression to restore BKPyV-specific immune control. Ex vivo expansion and transfer of BKPyV-specific cytotoxic T cells prepared from third-party donors may enhance virus-specific treatment, but the efficacy seems suboptimal.
40200375	Reliability of clinical impressions and optimal genetic diagnostic strategies of heritable connective tissue disorders with ocular involvement in a large Chinese cohort.	This study aimed to elucidate the reliability of clinical impressions based on ocular manifestations in patients suspected of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) compared to the final genetic diagnosis. Furthermore, it sought to determine the optimal diagnostic strategy for patients with HCTDs through pathogenicity analysis.
40200366	Transposable element dynamics in Xenopus laevis embryogenesis: a tale of two coexisting subgenomes.	The African clawed frog Xenopus laevis has an allotetraploid genome consisting of two subgenomes referred as L relating to the Long chromosomes and S relating to the Short chromosomes. While the L subgenome presents conserved synteny with X. tropicalis chromosomes, the S subgenome has undergone rearrangements and deletions leading to differences in gene and transposable element (TE) content between the two subgenomes. The asymmetry in the evolution of the two subgenomes is also detectable in gene expression levels and TE mobility. TEs, also known as "jumping genes", are mobile genetic elements having a key role in genome evolution and gene regulation. However, due to their potential deleterious effects, TEs are controlled by host defense mechanisms such as the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex and the Argonaute proteins that mainly modify the heterochromatin environment. In embryogenesis, TEs can escape the silencing mechanisms during the maternal-to-zygotic transition when a transcriptionally permissive environment is created. Moreover, further evidence highlighted that the reactivation of TEs during early developmental stages is not the result of this genome-wide reorganization of chromatin but it is class and stage-specific, suggesting a precise regulation. In line with these premises, we explored the impact of TE transcriptional contribution in six developmental stages of X. laevis. Overall, the expression pattern referred to the entire set of transcribed TEs was constant across the six developmental stages and in line with their abundance in the genome. However, focusing on subgenome-specific TEs, our analyses revealed a distinctive transcriptional pattern dominated by LTR retroelements in the L subgenome and LINE retroelements in the S subgenome attributable to young copies. Interestingly, genes encoding proteins involved in maintaining the repressive chromatin environment were active in both subgenomes highlighting that TE controlling systems were active in X. laevis embryogenesis and evolved symmetrically.
40200361	Anticipatory reaching motor behavior characterizes patients within the Alzheimer's disease continuum in a virtual reality environment.	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive declines in cognitive and motor functions, impairing daily activities. Traditionally, AD diagnosis relies on cognitive assessments, but emerging evidence highlights motor function deficits as early indicators of AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). These motor declines, which often precede cognitive symptoms, include slower and less accurate reaching movements. This study explored reaching actions in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment in AD and MCI patients to identify motor deficits and their link to cognitive decline.
40200359	Individual patterns and synchrony of heart rate variability in adolescent patients with borderline personality psychopathology and their mothers: a case-control study.	In adolescent Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), interactions with caregivers often provoke dysregulation. Vagally-mediated heart rate variability (HRV), a physiological marker of regulatory capacities, shows alterations in BPD. Studies on individual and dyadic HRV in adolescents with BPD (BPD-A) and their mothers (BPD-M) are lacking. We examined 1) individual resting state -, reactivity- and recovery- HRV, 2) intrapersonal concordance of interactional quality with HRV, 3) mother-adolescent interpersonal HRV-synchrony and 4) the association of interpersonal HRV-synchrony with behavioral synchrony in a case-control design.
40200355	Cost effectiveness of a novel swallowing and respiratory sensation assessment and a modelled intervention to reduce acute exacerbations of COPD.	Swallowing impairment observed in ~ 20% of people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and acute exacerbations. We designed a decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Swallowing and Respiratory Sensation Assessment (SwaRSA) tests and swallowing rehabilitation to reduce COPD exacerbations. We believe that swallowing rehabilitation to improve coordination of swallowing and breathing may reduce exacerbations in people with COPD.From the Australia health system perspective, we assessed the cost effectiveness of four tests relative to standard of care, or no testing, over a time horizon of one year. The SwaRSA tests assessed relative to a standard of care arm of no testing: included the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) score, Swallowing Capacity of Liquids, Tongue Strength Assessment, and Respiratory Sensation Assessment, in people with moderate to severe COPD. Outcome measures were COPD exacerbations per year, which were converted into quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Model inputs including costs, test sensitivities and specificities, COPD exacerbation risks, and exacerbation-related utilities were derived from published sources. Our assumptions on the costs, recovery, and risk reduction are based on the available data on pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD.Relative to no-SwaRSA, three individual testing strategies were found to be cost-effective at incremental cost effectiveness ratio per QALY ranging from $27,000 to $37,000 AUD assuming a willingness to pay of $50,000 AUD. The EAT-10 and the tongue strength were the two dominant options on the cost-effectiveness frontier. Model results were robust to variations in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.In COPD, SwaRSA modelling suggests that self-assessment with the EAT-10 and subsequent intervention is highly cost-effective relative to no-SwaRSA.
40200351	Diagnosis and surgical treatment of chronic destructive septic hip arthritis.	Septic hip arthritis (SHA) is a relatively rare but hazardous disease. Much controversy exists regarding the definition, diagnosis and treatment of chronic destructive SHAs. This review aims to provide an overview of the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for chronic, destructive SHA and suggest possible research directions for this disease's future diagnosis and treatment. There is no unified naming or classification standard for SHAs. Chronic destructive SHA still requires a comprehensive diagnosis combining history, signs, bacterial culture, histopathological examination, inflammation and other indicators, of which metagenomic next-generation sequencing is a promising diagnostic tool. Previous treatment options for this disease include debridement, debridement + Girdlestone femoral head and neck resection, and debridement + Girdlestone femoral head and neck resection + two-stage arthroplasty. Among them, one-stage spacer implantation + two-stage arthroplasty is the current standard surgical option with a high success rate and low reinfection rate, while one-stage arthroplasty is a new treatment option proposed in recent years with unique advantages but limitations in terms of surgical indications. In the future, more high-quality studies are needed to provide the latest evidence to support clinical decision-making.

The ketogenic diet (KD) has been used as a therapeutic diet for a range of diseases such as epilepsy, obesity, and cancer. However, it may cause some adverse effects that are not well known. This study aimed to assess the possible impact of the KD on liver structure and function, as well as hepatic inflammatory markers.
40200299	Manipulation of cancer cell pyroptosis for therapeutic approaches: challenges and opportunities.	Remarkable advances have been achieved following discoveries that gasdermins are the executioners of pyroptosis. The pyroptotic process consists a subcellular permeabilization phase and a cell lysis phase, the latter of which is irreversible. Besides immune cells, pyroptosis has also been observed in cancer cells, which exhibit distinct mechanisms compared to canonical immune cell pyroptosis. Although chronic cancer cell pyroptosis fuels tumor growth, intense pyroptotic cell death in tumor cells enhances anticancer immunity by promoting killer lymphocytes infiltration. Triggering pyroptosis in cancer cells is emerging as a promising strategy for cancer treatment. In this review, we introduce the process of cancer cell pyroptosis and its role in antitumor immunity, discuss the translation of these insights into therapies, and highlight current challenges and opportunities in the investigation of cancer cell pyroptosis.
40200290	Bile acid metabolism in multiple sclerosis is perturbed and associated with the risk of confirmed disability worsening.

40200246	Posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression in mothers after preterm delivery and the associated psychological processes.	Mothers of preterm infants report traumatic, anxious and depressive symptoms in the postpartum period. Many studies have focused on biological, social, and life circumstance factors to explain the emergence of these symptoms. The process model proposes to focus on psychological processes, which are mechanisms underlying mental disorders. However, the psychological processes underlying the onset of traumatic, anxious, and depressive symptoms in postpartum mothers of preterm infants had not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to identify the most common symptoms experienced in the first few days after delivery and determine whether processes of anhedonia, brooding rumination, and worry are related to posttraumatic stress (PTS), anxiety, and depression symptoms.

Stroke rehabilitation guidelines recommend using outcome measures like the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) to assess post-stroke upper extremity function. However, integrating such outcome measures into routine clinical practice remains challenging, highlighting the need to understand factors affecting their implementation in evolving healthcare models.
40200200	Comparing umbilical cord arterial blood gas findings in pregnancies with and without gestational diabetes mellitus following elective cesarean section: a multicenter retrospective cohort study in Iran.	Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is linked to adverse fetal outcomes like macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia, with its global incidence increasing. While prior research indicates GDM may impair placental function and fetal oxygen delivery, direct evidence is limited. This study compares umbilical cord arterial blood gas measurements in pregnancies with and without GDM.

40200131	Uncovering the key miRNA-target network of tea plants in resistance to sooty mold disease.	Sooty mold (SM) disease severely threatens tea plant health, reducing yield and quality. Driven by climate change and intensive farming practices, SM prevalence in China has surged, causing significant economic losses and forcing farmers to rely on chemical fungicides, which compromise environmental sustainability. Despite its impact, the molecular mechanisms underlying tea plant defenses against SM remain unclear.
40200106	Tertiary lymphoid structures associated with improved survival and enhanced antitumor immunity in acral melanoma.	Understanding the impact of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) on acral melanoma (AM) and the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical. We analyzed TLS features in primary AM lesions from 46 patients and identified intratumoral TLSs (intra-TLSs) in 25 patients. Intra-TLS presence was significantly associated with improved overall survival. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and multiplex immunofluorescence revealed increased T-cell and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration and fewer tumor-associated macrophages in the TME of intra-TLS patients. Transcriptomic analysis identified a TLS-associated Th1/B-cell gene set as a predictor of survival and immunotherapy response. These findings highlight the prognostic value of intra-TLSs in AMs and suggest that targeting TLS formation could enhance immunotherapy efficacy.
40200093	p53 transcriptionally activates DCP1B to suppress tumor progression and enhance tumor sensitivity to PI3K blockade in non-small cell lung cancer.	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer patients, is characterized by its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. In this study, we identify decapping mRNA 1B (DCP1B) as a tumor suppressor gene that is transcriptionally regulated by p53. DCP1B is found to inhibit the growth and migration of NSCLC cells. Consistently, the level of DCP1B expression is decreased in NSCLC tissues, and its low expression is associated with NSCLC patients' unfavorable outcomes. Mechanistic investigations reveal that DCP1B promotes the turnover of mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) mRNA, and the activation of p53 reduces the expression level of MAPK4 partially through DCP1B. Notably, overexpression of MAPK4 can drive AKT phosphorylation independent of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), thus neutralizing the anti-tumor activity of the PI3K inhibitor in NSCLC cells. Moreover, the p53 agonist combined with the PI3K inhibitor can suppress NSCLC proliferation synergistically in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this study not only uncovers the function and mechanism of the p53-DCP1B-MAPK4 axis in suppressing NSCLC progression but also suggests a promising combination strategy for treating NSCLC.
40200085	RBM24 regulates apoptosis rates by modulating global transcriptome profile in CAL27 cells.	RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key factors regulating post-transcriptional events. Categorized as RBPs, RBM24 expression levels have been shown to be a prognosis-related pivotal gene in oral squamous cell carcinoma. We analyzed the binding targets and regulated post-transcriptional events of RBM24 in RBM24-overexpressing cell lines and controls using iRIP-seq and RNA-seq. RBM24-overexpressing cells showed significant changes in gene expression, which are involved in biological pathways related to apoptosis and immune inflammation. RBM24-regulated genes that undergo alternative splicing are primarily engaged in biological processes related to DNA damage repair and RNA metabolism. More notably, we found that RBM24 binds to lncRNAs in addition to pre-mRNAs. These results indicated that RBM24 could play a key role in cancer progression by finding clinical therapeutic targets for Oral squamous cell carcinoma.
40200079	Primary antifungal prophylaxis in hematological malignancies. Updated clinical practice guidelines by the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL).	At the 10th European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL), the guidelines for antifungal prophylaxis in pediatric and adult patients with hematological malignancies (HM) were updated and some changes introduced. Regarding acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients undergoing remission induction chemotherapy, a B-II grading has been assigned to isavuconazole, micafungin, and caspofungin, based on non-randomized studies that have shown efficacy in preventing invasive fungal diseases (IFD). Regarding high-risk MDS patients treated with azacytidine, prophylaxis with posaconazole during the first four cycles of treatment is supported in the literature. Prophylaxis is not indicated in patients treated for myeloproliferative neoplasms (NPM), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). For patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), prophylaxis is not generally indicated. For patients with multiple myeloma (MM), prophylaxis is not indicated and the limited epidemiological data available do not support the use of prophylaxis in subjects treated with bispecific antibodies. For patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), no substantial changes were made, apart from the addition of isavuconazole with grading B-II in the post-engraftment period. In patients undergoing auto-HSCT, antifungal prophylaxis is not indicated. Previous ECIL guidelines did not include CAR-T cells. The expert panel proposes to endorse the use of anti-mold prophylaxis in high-risk patients during pre-infusion and post-infusion, while in low-risk patients, anti-yeast prophylaxis can be recommended (B-II). For pediatric hematology patients, based on newly published data, caspofungin received a B-I grading as mold-active prophylaxis. Moreover, patients with ALL with insufficient treatment response during induction therapy, and children older than 12 y.o are now considered at high risk for IFD and are recommended to receive antifungal prophylaxis.
40200047	Neural insights on expert surgeons' mental workload during live robotic surgeries.	Despite its adoption and benefits, robotic surgeries can impose additional mental workload on surgeons. Validated questionnaires mostly administered at the end of procedures may not accurately capture the dynamic nature of mental workload over an entire procedure. Hence, we sought to determine if electroencephalogram (EEG) based neural activities in different brain regions can measure variations in expert surgeons' mental workload intraoperatively. EEG data was collected from five different surgeons performing 13 robotic-assisted urological procedures. Data analysis focused on three surgery phases (before, critical, and after). After performing each phase, surgeons provided a rating of their perceived mental workload. A linear mixed effects model was applied to explore the impact of the study phases on the relative spectral band power of EEG signals. The relative theta band power in the frontal brain region was highest during the critical portions of the procedure (p < 0.05). As the subjective ratings increased, the relative frontal theta band power increased (p < 0.001) while the relative parietal alpha band power decreased across all phases. We show that EEG signals can distinguish intraoperative workload in robotic surgeries. This has several applications including predicting risk factors for increased case complexity and surgical education.
40200033	Differential response of tissue engineered skeletal muscle from rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting articular joints and skeletal muscle. To assess the role of cytokines upon muscle strength in RA, we developed an in vitro tissue-engineered human skeletal muscle model (myobundle). Myobundles were generated using primary skeletal muscle cells from the vastus lateralis muscle of RA patients and age-matched healthy controls. RA myobundles were more sensitive to 5 ng/mL IFN-γ, exhibiting reduced contractile force and altered contraction kinetics. Addition of IL-6 with or without IFN-γ led to a small but significant increase in striated fibers. Gene sets involved in the response to hypoxia, MTOR1 signaling, and the unfolded protein response were enriched in IFN-γ-treated RA myobundles, but not IFN-γ-treated controls. Tofacitinib increased contractile force, myosin heavy chain, and PIM1 protein levels in RA myobundles treated with IFN-γ. Thus, in RA muscle, low levels of IFN-γ selectively increase gene pathways that reduce contractile force.
40200028	Subclonal response heterogeneity to define cancer organoid therapeutic sensitivity.	Tumor heterogeneity is predicted to confer inferior clinical outcomes with precision-based strategies, however, modeling heterogeneity in a manner that still represents the tumor of origin remains a formidable challenge. Sequencing technologies are limited in their ability to identify rare subclonal populations and predict response to treatments for patients. Patient-derived organotypic cultures have significantly improved the modeling of cancer biology by faithfully representing the molecular features of primary malignant tissues. Patient-derived cancer organoid (PCO) cultures contain subclonal populations with the potential to recapitulate heterogeneity, although treatment response assessments commonly ignore diversity in the molecular profile or treatment response. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of evaluating individual PCO heterogeneity to enhance the sensitivity of these assays for predicting clinical response. Additionally, organoid subcultures identify subclonal populations with altered treatment response. Finally, dose escalation studies of PCOs to targeted anti-EGFR therapy are utilized which reveal divergent pathway expression when compared to pretreatment cultures. Overall, these studies demonstrate the importance of population-based organoid response assessments, the use of PCOs to identify molecular heterogeneity not observed with bulk tumor sequencing, and PCO heterogeneity for understanding therapeutic resistance mechanisms.
40199966	Mosaic deletions detected by genome sequencing in two families.	Trio-based genome sequencing (GS) is useful for genetic analysis of cases in which exome sequencing failed to resolve the disease-causing variants. In this paper, we report two unrelated families with pathogenic deletions (one outside exome-covering genomic regions and the other involving a single exon) successfully identified by GS. Notably, mosaic deletions were found in both families, which were carefully evaluated in detail by analyzing GS data using Integrative Genomics Viewer, breakpoint PCR, quantitative PCR, and digital PCR. This study emphasizes the benefit of trio-based GS, enabling straightforward interpretation, further aided by other confirmatory experimental methods.
40199965	A copy number variant overlapping the 3'UTR of PLP1 causes spastic paraplegia.	Leukodystrophy presents a significant diagnostic challenge due to its varied clinical presentation and similarity to other myelin disorders, characterized by abnormalities in myelin and white matter. Hypomyelination disorders, including Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and hereditary spastic paraplegias (SPG), are associated with variants in the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene, leading to symptoms ranging from severe dysmyelination in infancy to delayed dysmyelination and axonal degeneration in adulthood. Family history was taken, and pedigree was constructed. Recruitment included seven males and females with spastic paraplegia and nine healthy relatives, who were clinically investigated, and tested with molecular genetic assays including whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), and PCR amplification with fragment analysis on gel electrophoresis to identify and confirm the genetic cause. Family history was consistent with hereditary condition marked by progressive spastic paraplegia in 10 family members. Males had early onset and progressive paraplegia, and neurodegenerative conditions, resulting in a decline in the neurocognitive functions. However, in some females, the symptoms manifested later in their 30s-40s, leading to neurodegenerative conditions and spastic paraplegias. A total of 16 family members were available for genetic testing and segregation studies. Initial clinical WES in four members was negative. Next, WGS identified a novel copy number variant (CNV) loss (75.5 kb) involving the 3'UTR of the PLP1 gene in three members (the mother, affected son, but not in the unaffected son). Segregation studies in all 16 family members confirmed the presence of the CNV in five additional affected individuals and an asymptomatic female, but not in the eight asymptomatic individuals. Our study reports a novel 3'UTR CNV in PLP1 in a large family with several individuals affected with SPG. This finding expands the mutational landscape of the PLP1-related diseases to include CNV and, possibly, small sequence changes in the regulatory regions of PLP1, that would otherwise be overlooked during the interpretation of the next generation sequencing data.
40199939	The relationship between the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and all-cause mortality in ICU patients with primary hypertension: a retrospective study.	Primary hypertension is the most common type of hypertension, with a complex and not fully understood pathogenesis. Insulin resistance (IR) is a metabolic abnormality that has been shown to be quite prevalent among patients with hypertension in existing literature. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a reliable indicator for assessing insulin resistance (IR). This study aims to evaluate the relationship between the TyG index at admission and all-cause mortality (ACM) in patients with severe primary hypertension, and to explore its role in predicting the future all-cause mortality risk in primary hypertension patients. This study employs a retrospective design to categorize all patients into four quartiles based on the TyG index. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method was utilized to estimate the survival curves for each group and to compare the survival outcomes across different quartiles. To assess the nonlinear relationship between the TyG index and prognosis, Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were applied, adjusting for potential confounders. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed to conduct stratified analyses and interaction tests. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that patients with higher TyG index levels had higher all-cause mortality rates at 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days post-admission. This indicates that a higher TyG index is associated with an increased risk of death in the short term. Additionally, multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that an increased TyG index was significantly associated with all-cause mortality at 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days. Meanwhile, RCS analysis indicates that as the TyG index level increases, the hazard ratio (HR) shows a significant upward trend, suggesting a gradual increase in the risk of all-cause mortality. In summary, among patients with primary hypertension in the intensive care unit, elevated TyG levels are associated with an increased risk of short-term mortality.
40199901	Spatially resolved atlas of breast cancer uncovers intercellular machinery of venular niche governing lymphocyte extravasation.	Breast cancers present intricate microenvironments comprising heterotypic cellular interactions, yet a comprehensive spatial map remained to be established. Here, we employed the DNA nanoball-based genome-wide in situ sequencing (Stereo-seq) to visualize the geospatial architecture of 30 primary breast tumors and metastatic lymph nodes across different molecular subtypes. This unprecedented high-resolution atlas unveils the fine structure of the tumor vasculature, highlighting heterogeneity in phenotype, spatial distribution, and intercellular communication within both endothelial and perivascular cells. In particular, venular smooth muscle cells are identified as the primary source of CCL21/CCL19 within the microenvironment. In collaboration with ACKR1-positive endothelial cells, they create a chemokine-rich venular niche to synergistically promote lymphocyte extravasation into tumors. High venule density predicts increased immune infiltration and improved clinical outcomes. This study provides a detailed spatial landscape of human breast cancer, offering key insights into the venular regulation of tumor immune infiltration.
40199899	Nature-based Solutions as Building Blocks for coastal flood risk reduction: a model-based ecosystem service assessment.	Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are increasingly recognized as effective measures for mitigating flood risks and enhancing climate change adaptation. However, evaluating their efficacy in delivering flood risk reduction ecosystem service (FRR-ESS) is usually limited by reliance on qualitative, expert-based "quick-scan" scoring methods. While already challenging for present-day evaluations, this limitation becomes even more significant when addressing future climate scenarios, introducing deep uncertainties in the evaluation. The present study introduces a model-based framework to quantify FRR-ESS provided by coastal NbS, which integrates expert-based assessments with quantitative results from an eco-hydro-morphodynamic numerical model. The model enables a comparative evaluation of individual and combined effects of NbS following a Building Blocks approach. By integrating habitat map change prediction in the evaluation, NbS flood reduction response to present and future storm scenarios (i.e. wave climate and sea level rise) are investigated. The methodology is applied to a Mediterranean coastal lagoon in Sicily (Italy), and can be easily adapted to diverse coastal ecosystems. Our findings underscore the significant role of coastal habitats in reducing flood risk and highlight the importance of integrating physically-based modelling into FRR-ESS evaluation. This approach provides a robust and flexible tool for policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions that support both ecological sustainability and disaster risk reduction.
40199891	Tip60 HAT activators as therapeutic modulators for Alzheimer's disease.	Reduced histone acetylation in the brain causes transcriptional dysregulation and cognitive impairment that are key initial steps in Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. Unfortunately, current treatment strategies primarily focus on histone deacetylase inhibition (HDACi) that causes detrimental side effects due to non-specific acetylation. Here, we test Tip60 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activation as a therapeutic strategy for selectively restoring cognition-associated histone acetylation depleted in AD by developing compounds that enhance Tip60's neuroprotective HAT function. Several compounds show high Tip60-binding affinity predictions in silico, enhanced Tip60 HAT action in vitro, and restore Tip60 knockdown mediated functional deficits in Drosophila in vivo. Furthermore, compounds prevent neuronal deficits and lethality in an AD-associated amyloid precursor protein neurodegenerative Drosophila model and remarkably, restore expression of repressed neuroplasticity genes in the AD brain, underscoring compound specificity and therapeutic effectiveness. Our results highlight Tip60 HAT activators as a promising therapeutic neuroepigenetic modulator strategy for AD treatment.
40199883	Generation of induced alveolar assembloids with functional alveolar-like macrophages.	Within the human lung, interactions between alveolar epithelial cells and resident macrophages shape lung development and function in both health and disease. To study these processes, we develop a co-culture system combining human pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar epithelial organoids and induced macrophages to create a functional environment, termed induced alveolar assembloids. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional analyses, we identify alveolar type 2-like cells producing GM-CSF, which supports macrophage tissue adaptation, and macrophage-like cells that secrete interleukin-1β and interleukin-6, express surfactant metabolism genes, and demonstrate core immune functions. In response to alveolar epithelial injury, macrophage-like cells efficiently eliminate damaged cells and absorb oxidized lipids. Exposure to bacterial components or infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals that these assembloids replicate key aspects of human respiratory defense. These findings highlight the potential of induced alveolar assembloids as a platform to investigate human lung development, immunity, and disease.

40199859	The AKAP12-PKA axis regulates lipid homeostasis during alcohol-associated liver disease.	Disrupted lipogenic signaling and steatosis are key features of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) is a scaffolding partner of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA that controls its spatiotemporal localization. Activation of PKA by cAMP inhibits lipogenesis and facilitates fatty acid oxidation (FAO). The goal of this work is to examine how AKAP12's PKA-anchoring ability regulates outcomes of alcohol-associated steatosis. Crosslinking proteomics identified PKA and its lipogenic substrates as interacting partners of AKAP12. Alcohol exposure diminished AKAP12's interaction with PKA regulatory subunits and PKA substrates, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC1), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Alcohol inhibited PKA activity and increased triglyceride content in human hepatocytes. Forced expression of AKAP12 restored alcohol suppressed PKA activation and inhibited lipid accumulation, whereas silencing had the reverse effect. Since AKAP12 sustained PKA activity, we evaluated whether the AKAP12-PKA scaffold was important in lipid homeostasis. Inhibition of AKAP12-PKA interaction by CRISPR deletion of AKAP12's PKA binding domain in cultured hepatocytes or in mouse models of ALD dramatically suppressed PKA activity, enhanced ACC1 activity demonstrated by reduced inhibitory phosphorylation, increased lipid accumulation and reduced FAO in hepatocytes. Overexpression of AKAP12 in mouse livers sustained PKA activation, diminished basal and alcohol potentiated triglyceride content, and regulated inflammatory signaling altered by alcohol. Mechanistically, we discovered that alcohol enhanced the inhibitory activity of a kinase, serine/threonine-protein kinase 25 (STK25) on PKA that regulated its interaction with AKAP12. In conclusion, the AKAP12-PKA scaffold controls lipogenic signaling, disruption of which favors steatosis during ALD.
40199858	Contactless Braille sensing based on GaN optical devices integrated with epoxy lenses.	Braille serves as an efficient means for visually impaired individuals to access textual information and engage in communication. However, the process of reading Braille can often be cumbersome and time-intensive, particularly in bidirectional human-machine interaction. In this work, a compact optical device for contactless detection of Braille is fabricated and characterized. The GaN-on-sapphire chip, which employs monolithic integration, serves as the core for both light emission and photodetection, significantly reducing its overall footprint. The incorporation of the semi-ellipsoid epoxy lens with optimized dimensions ensures consistent and accurate detection. The sensing device demonstrates high stability and fast response through its line-scanning capabilities on Braille codes. The captured signals are analyzed using a microcontroller, and the Braille recognition results are wirelessly transmitted to a portable mobile device, enabling the conversion into audio and visual formats. This innovative design not only facilitates Braille reading but also holds the potential to advance human-machine interaction.
40199857	Mendelian randomization of immune cell phenotypes to discover potential drug targets for B-cell malignancy.	Although treatment options for B-cell malignancies have expanded, many patients continue to face limited response rates, highlighting an urgent need for new therapeutic targets. To prioritize candidate drug targets for B-cell malignancies, we employed Mendelian Randomization to estimate potentially causal relationships between 445 immune cell traits and six B-cell cancers: follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and multiple myeloma (MM), totaling 22,922 cases and 394,204 controls. 163 traits showed a suggestive association with at least one B-cell malignancy (P < 0.05), with 34 traits being significant after correction for multiple testing (P < 2 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). By integrating findings with observational data and clinical trial evidence to support drug target candidacy, 24 cell surface markers were identified as druggable targets. In addition to established therapeutic targets such as CD3, CD20 and CD38, our analysis highlights BAFF-R and CD39 in HL, CD25 in MM, CD27 in CLL, CD80/86 in DLBCL, and CCR2 in FL and MZL as promising candidates for therapeutic inhibition. Our findings provide further support for the potential of human genetics to guide the identification of drug targets and address a productivity-limiting step.

40199829	Statins and the risk of dementia: a meta-analysis.	Clarify the relationship between the use of statins and the risk of dementia, and further guide the clinical application of statins. This paper uses computer search Chinese and foreign language databases Pubmed, Medline, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, Weipu, CBM, Wanfang, CNKI, etc., to include the literature that meets the standards from the establishment of the library to December 2020, and uses Revman 5.1 software and Stata15.0 software for meta-analysis. Of the 34 included observational studies, stratified subgroup analyses were performed based on the type of clinical trial, sex of participants, presence or absence of apolipoprotein E-4 (ApoEε4) allele, and duration of use. The conclusions showed that (1) the use of statins can significantly reduce the risk of dementia; (2) There is no significant sex difference in reducing the risk of dementia; (3) Continuous use of statins for ≥ 1 year can significantly reduce the risk of dementia compared with the time of taking the drug for < 1 year; (4) Compared with subjects with negative ApoEε4 allele, the use of statins has a more significant effect on reducing the risk of dementia in subjects carrying the ApoEε4 allele.

40199824	Spinocerebellar Ataxia 44 Caused by a Novel GRM1 Variant: Reviewing the Contrasting Pathogenic Mechanisms Underlying Two GRM1-Associated Hereditary Ataxias.	GRM1 encodes type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1). Its pathogenic variants are associated with the rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia 13 (SCAR13) due to loss of mGluR1 function, and the even rarer spinocerebellar ataxia 44 (SCA44) due to a gain-of-function molecular basis. We report a new case of SCA44 caused by a novel and de novo GRM1 variant c.2303 C > T (p.Thr768Ile), which was considered "likely pathogenic" by the American College of Medical Genetic criteria (PS2, PM2, PP3). This variant was predicted to lead to a stability effect on mGluR1 in the evaluation with DynaMut2, like the other known SCA44 GRM1 variants and in contrast to lower stability or destabilizing effects for SCAR13 missense variants. The affected residue Thr768 was located close to the binding pockets of allosteric modulators and within the highly conserved cholesterol recognition association/interaction consensus motif. Collectively, this novel GRM1 variant caused SCA44 by increasing the constitutive activity of mGluR1. Our findings underscore the distinct molecular mechanisms of mGluR1 aberration for the two GRM1-associated hereditary ataxias, and provide a mechanism-relevant prospect in the pharmacological therapies for restoring mGluR1 function.

The treatment landscape for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has increased significantly over the past few decades, thanks to the introduction of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod belong to the newer generation of oral DMTs categorized as sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (S1PRMs). Because of their mechanism of action, they may increase the risk of lymphopenia, which could influence the therapeutic management of people with MS. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the reporting frequency of lymphopenia related to four S1PRMs.
40199813	Chalcone-9: a novel inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway with potent anti-cancer effects in triple-negative breast cancer cells.	Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer incidence and mortality among women worldwide, with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) posing significant treatment challenges. The dysregulation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway contributes to tumor progression, making it a potential therapeutic target. Chalcones, known for their diverse biological activities, including anti-cancer effects, hold promise for drug development. This study explores the anti-cancer activity of (E)-4-(3-(2-(benzyloxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl)-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)benzoic acid (chalcone-9), a novel chalcone derivative.

40199790	Personalized Health Prediction AI Models Using Transfer Learning and Strategic Overfitting on Wearable Device Data.	The increasing availability of wearable device data provides an opportunity for developing personalized models for health monitoring and condition prediction. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on pooled data from diverse individuals, our study explores the strategy of intentionally overfitting models to personal data and subsequently applying a transfer learning technique to refine performance for each user. We predicted Next-Day Condition (NDC) and Next-Day Emotion (NDC) while considering diverse features such as physical activity, sleep patterns, environmental context, and self-reported measures. Initial experiments showed that models trained at the sample level performed better on evaluation data but failed to generalize effectively during external validation. In contrast, our personalized learning approach, initiated with a pre-trained model, significantly enhanced accuracy within ten days of incremental user-specific training. Although generalization across the entire cohort diminished after individual tailoring, extended individualized training increased the overall predictive accuracy for each participant's personal data. The interpretation of feature importance using Shapley's additive explanations revealed substantial variability in the features influencing predictions across individuals, emphasizing the need for tailored health models. These findings highlight the potential of combining intentional overfitting and transfer learning in constructing high-performance user-specific predictive models from wearable data. Future research should expand the number of participants, extend the training period, and refine these methods to bolster personalized digital health solutions.

40199773	Responses of aggregate-associated carbon and their fractions to different positions in a karst valley of Southwest China.	Changes in aggregate-associated carbon and their fractions are vital for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. However, changes in SOC contents and their fractions in different soil aggregates under different landform positions in karst regions remain unclear. Soil samples were collected from the valley bottom (VAFL), dip slope (DIPS), and anti-dip slope (ANTD) in a karst valley of Southwest China. These soil samples were then divided into three aggregates including macroaggregate (> 0.25 mm), microaggregate (0.053-0.25 mm), and silt and clay (< 0.053 mm) using wet sieving methods. Contents of total SOC and their three oxidized carbon fractions (F1: easily oxidized carbon fraction, F2: oxidized carbon fraction, and F3: stable carbon fraction) were measured. Compared with ANTD, total SOC contents, microaggregate-associated carbon contents, and SOC contents in silt and clay fraction decreased by 37.90%, 38.41%, and 40.07%, respectively, under VAFL, and by 12.95%, 11.65%, and 15.60%, respectively, under DIPS. Contents of F1 and F2 fraction under VAFL were significantly lower than those under ANTD and DIPS in bulk soil, microaggregate, and silt and clay. The mean percentages of F2 in total SOC in bulk soil, macroaggregate, microaggregate, and silt and clay were 43.66%, 43.81%, 45.67%, and 41.70%, respectively, while the percentages of F1 were 25.08%, 25.04%, 25.68%, and 24.86%, respectively. Compared with DIPS, SOC stability under ANTD and VAFL increased by 6.59% and 8.44%, respectively. These findings emphasized the influence of landform positions on the carbon contents in different soil aggregates, and deepened the understanding of SOC accumulation mechanisms in Southwest China.

40199766	Spatial differentiation of metallic micronutrients in soil-plant systems along an altitudinal gradient in the Fanjing Mountain, Southwestern plateau of China.	Metallic micronutrients (Cu, Fe, etc.) play a crucial role in plant growth, but limited research has explored the distribution patterns and determinants of these elements within the soil-plant system along elevation gradients in highland alpine forest ecosystems. In this study, we focused on Fanjing Mountain, a highland forest ecosystem in Southwest China, to examine the distribution and partitioning of metal micronutrients (Cu, Fe, Zn, Mo, Ni) within the soil-plant system along an altitudinal gradient, and to identify factors influencing micronutrient dynamics in plants across varying elevations. The results showed that the average contents of Cu, Fe, Zn, Mo, and Ni in soil (plant) were 24.64 (11.96), 28784.38 (1185.17), 659.57 (60.23), 0.97 (0.77), and 25.42 (5.41) mg/kg, respectively. Micronutrient elements exhibited varied trends along the altitudinal gradient; notably, Zn content in both soil and plants increased with elevation. The enrichment capacity of plant branches and leaves for metal micronutrients also shifted with altitude, with Cu and Mo showing significantly higher enrichment levels compared to other elements. Metal micronutrient content of plants was influenced by environmental factors such as soil properties and location, where the effect of soil environmental factors on plant micronutrient content decreases with increasing altitude. These findings enhance our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of metal micronutrients in highland alpine forest ecosystems and provide valuable insights for improving forest soil quality and vegetation conservation.
40199764	Effects of dietary mineral level and creep feed provision on lactating sows during heat stress.	This study evaluated the interactive effect of mineral levels and creep feed provision (CF) on reproductive performance, stress level, and immune status of lactating sows during heat stress (HS). 2 × 2 factorial arrangement was assessed, involving two mineral levels (STD, the diet contains 20, 100, 80, 25, and 0.15 ppm of Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Se, respectively; ADV, the diet contains 25, 150, 160, 50, and 0.30 ppm of Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Se, respectively) with or without CF during HS. The CF group showed lower (P < 0.05) respiratory rate on days 8, 10, 11, and 14. ADV and CF groups showed lower (P < 0.05) body weight loss during lactation. A tendency for decreased (P = 0.063) loss of back fat thickness in the CF group. ADV group shows higher (P < 0.05) weaned piglet weight and survivability. CF group showed lower hair cortisol concentration (P < 0.05) with higher (P < 0.05) piglet survivability. ADV and CF groups showed lower (P < 0.05) serum TNF-α level, also increased (P < 0.05) superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde levels. In milk, the level of Fe, Mn, and Se increased (P < 0.05) in the ADV group. Also, feces excreted higher (P < 0.05) Zn, Fe, Mn, and Se. In conclusion, while both ADV and CF had beneficial effects, ADV posed a risk of increased mineral excretion. Given stricter regulations on dietary trace minerals, CF could be an effective strategy to enhance the performance of sows and piglets under HS.
40199762	Association between temporomandibular disorders and mental and behavioural disorders - a nationwide population-based cross-sectional study.

This study aimed to determine whether TMD patients have higher incidence of specific mental and behavioural disorders (MBDs) using a large-scale dataset with matched controls.
40199761	Development and evaluation of a herbal anti-tick grease using Cissus quadrangularis terpenes and terpenoids as active compounds for controlling ticks on live stock.	Ticks and tick borne diseases are on the rise. This is leading to diseases of economic importance in animals such that farmer`s budgetary allocation is constrained. Recently, interventions involving the use of plant based anti-tick products has shown promising results. Hence, in the present study, a tick grease was developed and evaluated utilising terpenes and terpenoids from Cissus quadrangularis as principal active components. Terpene and terpenoid rich extracts were isolated using a normal phase silica gel packed column and active fraction determined using repellence and knockdown effect. Ethyl acetate was used to extract the terpenes and terpenoids from dried Cissus quadrangularis stems. The chemical composition of the active fraction was evaluated using GC-MS. The formulated tick grease was evaluated under both laboratory and field studies. Out of the six column isolated fractions only 2, eluted with hexane: ethyl acetate ratio: 8:2 (100 mL), and 7:3 (100 mL), showed significant acaricidal activity with a percentage knockdown effect of 100 and 75% respectively. The GC-MS analysis of the combine two fractions showed that, they consisted of various monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Copaene (14.56%), α-ocimene (42.23%), murolene (16.98%) and caryophyllene oxide (11.89%) were found to be the major occurring compounds in the fraction. The tick grease formulated with the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes rich fraction showed significant acaricidal activity when compared to commercial acaricide, armitraz purchased from local veterinary shops. The tick grease showed percent repellence of 100% as compared to 75% for the commercial acaricide. Under field studies, by topical application on cows the tick grease knocked down all ticks including Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Amblyomma variegatum species which were resistant to the commercial acaricide. It also showed good protective effect over the 5 day period selected for the study on non-tick infested cows. Thus our study prove the potential of using terpenes and terpenoids from Cissus quadrangularis as active compounds in formulating a tick grease.
40199759	Development of Japan-Specific HL7 FHIR Medication-Related Profiles.	Adoption of the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) as the global standard for healthcare information exchange has encouraged many countries to develop localized implementation guides that align with their specific regulatory and clinical needs. In 2018, the NeXEHRS Academic Research Group of the Japan Association of Medical Informatics (JAMI) commenced the creation of JP Core, a collection of FHIR profiles tailored for the Japanese healthcare environment. This study is focused on JP Core v1.2.0 released in December 2024. This includes eight medication-related profiles and 23 extensions that optimize Japanese prescription workflows by incorporating local terminologies such as the HOT and YJ Codes. The transition from Simplifier.net to GitHub, coupled with adoption of the Sushi framework, improved collaboration, version control, and standardization.We also examine the Japanese approach to FHIR governance, highlighting the need for a formal regulatory framework akin to the US Core Implementation Guide and the European governance models. Key challenges include terminology binding, cross-border ePrescription integration, and ongoing profile maintenance. Recommendations include the establishment of a national governance body, alignment of domestic terminologies with international standards (e.g., SNOMED CT), and alignment of JP Core interoperability with global frameworks such as the International Patient Summary (IPS) and the European Union (EU) eHealth guidelines. By analyzing the evolution of JP Core and the integration thereof into the Japanese ePrescription ecosystem, this paper provides insights into future FHIR implementation in Japan and highlights lessons learned from international governance structures.

40199749	Neovascular prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression in bone and soft tissue sarcoma: a systematic analysis.	Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are a highly heterogeneous group of rare cancers of mesenchymal origin. Treatment options other than surgery have limited efficacy due to low response rates with some exceptions. Radioligand therapy targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) may provide a novel treatment option, as it was recently suggested that soft tissue sarcomas express PSMA in the neovasculature, and on PET/CT imaging, multiple sarcomas have shown intense PSMA-tracer accumulation. Moreover, in prostate cancer patients, incidental PSMA uptake was seen in hemangiomas. In addition to confirming previous results in soft tissue sarcoma, the current study aims to systematically explore the expression of PSMA in bone tumors and in vascular tumors. Immunohistochemistry for PSMA was performed on a total of 706 tumors. High PSMA expression in the neovasculature was seen in 29% of the soft tissue sarcomas and 33% of the bone sarcomas. Malignant tumors showed a higher frequency of PSMA expression (score 2) as compared to benign tumors, with a high frequency in rhabdomyosarcoma (2 of 2, 100%), mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (14 of 20, 70%), undifferentiated sarcoma of bone (4 of 6, 67%) and of soft tissue (13 of 20, 65%), and osteosarcoma (46 of 81, 57%). In addition, giant cell tumor of bone displayed a high PSMA labelling in 67% of the cases. In contrast, high PSMA expression was seen in only 0-40% of the non-neoplastic vessels in vascular tumors, while 8% of them expressed PSMA in the tumor cells. Thus, with variable frequency among the different subtypes, a subset of bone and soft tissue tumors, both malignant and intermediate behavior, express PSMA and these patients may benefit from PSMA-targeting PET/CT scans or PSMA targeted radioligand therapy.

40199505	A 'True North Statement for Care': charting the course to better care for all Australians.	ObjectiveTo shift the narrative from 'deficit dialogues' in health and social care in Australia, we aimed to generate a series of consensus 'ambition' statements representing what peak care stakeholders in Australia want health and social care to look like in the future.MethodsA multiphase co-design study with Australian 'care' stakeholders was undertaken. This consisted of a desk-based audit of Australian health and social care organisations (n=9) and a pre-forum survey (n=21 responses) (activity 1), the findings of which informed the national forum activities (activity 2, n=31 organisations), which became the content for the Delphi survey (activity 3, n=28 organisations).ResultsThrough this process we distilled five ambition statements and 39 descriptors. These statements are our True North Statement for Better Care, providing a starting point to guide individual, organisation and system redesign across the life span. The statements require action at individual consumer, workforce and system level.ConclusionsCreating the True North Statement for Better Care provides a united direction for heterogeneous groups to work together to improve care for consumers, their workforce and the systems they work in. This is an important initiative to change the way we value, talk about, do, own and research care. Further user testing is required to ensure the statements can be translated into action.

40199503	Advance care planning: empowering older frail people to document their end of life wishes.	ObjectiveTo determine the features that are required to increase uptake of advance care directives (ACDs).MethodsWe conducted a study involving older patients attending aged care outpatient clinics and/or receiving outreach services between March 2021 and December 2022. Patients were assessed using tools related to frailty, end of life and empowerment. If the person agreed to complete an ACD, they were guided through it, and it was subsequently uploaded on the electronic medical record.ResultsOf 170 patients referred to complete an ACD, 47% completed it. These patients had lower Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale and SPICT (Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool) scores. The Frailty and SPICT tools were easier to use, the PAM (Patient Activation Measure) was difficult to use and assess. Patients did, however, show satisfaction in the process.ConclusionsPatients completing an ACD tended to be a little less frail and less likely to die in the following 12months. Increased uptake of ACD is more likely if the less frail are targeted, and assisted through the process by a health professional at a time and place that suits the person.

If UCs are not consistent with UTIs, antibiotics can be discontinued. Previously, our ED physicians did not contact patients with contaminant UCs, and antibiotics were continued unnecessarily. For patients diagnosed with UTIs but having contaminant UCs, we aimed to increase the percentage of antibiotics discontinued from 3% to 75% in 6 months.
40199485	Accuracy of medication allergy documentation in My Health Record after severe adverse drug reactions.	BackgroundInaccurate or incomplete documentation of severe medication allergies, such as anaphylaxis and severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCAR), may lead to harm from inadvertent re-exposure to implicated medications. My Health Record (MHR) is a national patient-controlled electronic health record in Australia linking hospital, general practitioner and community pharmacy records. The medication allergy/adverse reaction section should contain accurate information to aid prescribing.ObjectiveTo investigate the accuracy of documentation in MHR of confirmed medication-related anaphylaxis and SCAR and to determine barriers and facilitators to documentation.MethodsA retrospective cohort study of patients with medication-related anaphylaxis and SCAR, validated between January 2019 and June 2023. Medication allergy documentation in MHR was reviewed after patient consent to determine accuracy with medication and reaction type, against the assessment made by the hospital Adverse Drug Reaction Review Committee and/or allergy clinic consultation.ResultsForty-eight patients with anaphylaxis and 40 patients with SCAR (total 88) were included, involving 134 medications. Fourteen (15.9%) patients had their reactions documented accurately in MHR. When analysed per medication, 21 medications (15.7%) were documented accurately. Anaphylaxis, allergy clinic follow-up and life-threatening severity were factors significantly associated with a higher frequency of accurate allergy documentation in the MHR.ConclusionThe accuracy of medication allergy documentation for severe allergies in the MHR is low, representing a risk of harm from inadvertent re-exposure. This study identifies several system level issues and makes recommendations to improve patient safety.

40199335	Thrombotic Markers in Plasma as Predictors of Response in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treated with Baricitinib - Pilot Observation.	Both disease and treatment carry the risk of thrombotic events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This pilot study aimed to assess changes in thrombotic markers in plasma and their potential role as predictors of response during early baricitinib treatment. The concentrations of antithrombin III (ATIII) activity, D-dimer (DD), fibrinogen, and homocysteine (HCY) were evaluated in RA subjects before and 3 months after the treatment. At baseline, the RA group had higher DD (1472.3 ± 349.2) and fibrinogen (410.4 ± 29.5) compared with healthy controls (HC; 450.3 ± 54.5; <i>p</i> = 0.0002 and 334.9 ± 19.2; <i>p</i> = 0.04, respectively). with no differences in ATIII and HCY. After 3 months, we observed a significant increase in HCY (10.7 ± 0.6 vs. 9.1 ± 0.5; <i>p</i> = 0.018) and ATIII (119.7 ± 2.7 <i>vs</i>. 110.4 ± 3.2; <i>p</i> = 0.004), the latter correlated negatively with disease activity score 28 (DAS28; <i>r</i> = -0686, <i>p</i> < 0.002). After 3 months of baricitinib therapy, the patients were divided into moderate responders (MR) and good responders (GR) groups according to EULAR criteria. At baseline, MR had higher DD (1639.2 ± 550.5 <i>vs</i>. 450.3 ± 54.5; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and lower ATIII (105.3 ± 3.6 <i>vs</i>. 115.1 ± 2.7; <i>p</i> = 0.043) compared with HC. Thrombotic parameters in the first 3 months of baricitinib treatment were mostly in line with current findings concerning the RA population. Increased levels of DD together with low ATIII concentrations seem to predispose to a moderate response to baricitinib treatment.

Aripiprazole, a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic, is considered relatively safe during pregnancy and has a better metabolic profile compared to other antipsychotics. However, its impact on lactation has not been adequately studied. This study aimed to assess the relationship between aripiprazole use during pregnancy and the postpartum period with lactation outcomes.
40198977	Sanguinarine Inhibits Cell Growth in EBV-Positive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	To investigate the effects of Sanguinarine (SAG) on the progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to explore its underlying mechanism, this study utilized Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive DLBCL cell lines, FARAGE, and GM12878S. Cell counting kit-8 and bromodeoxyuridine assays were used to assess the effects of SAG on the cell proliferation. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting were employed to analyze cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Additionally, the molecular mechanism was explored through further immunoblotting analysis of the mechanism. SAG suppressed the growth of EBV-positive DLBCL cells. Furthermore, SAG induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis in these cells. Mechanistically, SAG suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby suppressing DLBCL progression <i>in vitro</i>. SAG effectively inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in EBV-positive DLBCL via Wnt/β-catenin pathway, offering potential therapeutic insights for this lymphoma subtype.

Therefore, alternative classification methods are needed.
40198744	Competency-Based Graduate Nursing Education for Fundoscopic and Otoscopic Exam Using Telehealth.	Mastery of physical assessment skills is critical for assessing and diagnosing patients and is an important learning objective for graduate nursing programs. Standard equipment makes assessment of these skills difficult. A quasi-experimental pre/post single cohort design was used for this project. A telehealth cart adapted with an otoscope and a PanOptic™ ophthalmoscope with a smartphone facilitated the acquisition of kinesthetic skill to perform an otoscopic and fundoscopic exam. Using Benner's novice-to-expert theory stages of competence, the combined values of perceived competent and proficient levels improved from 22 to 40 percent pre-instruction to 70 to 87 percent post-instruction for both techniques.

40198114	Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features.	Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by electroencephalography (EEG), where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported in [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.
40198105	An Emergentist Account of Language in the Brain-Seeking Neural Synergies Behind Human Uniqueness.	Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties-as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.
40198101	Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences.	The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.
40198100	Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location.	The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location-a low-level feature-and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.
40198099	Impact of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation on Event-related Potentials during a Response Inhibition Task.	As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.
40197726	Catheter-based ultrasound nerve stimulation and selective renal denervation: a preliminary case series study.	This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a catheter-based ultrasound renal denervation (RDN) system for nerve mapping guided RDN and treatment efficacy verification. A total of five patients were sequentially enrolled. Low-power pulsed ultrasound stimulation was applied at the distal, middle and proximal segments of the renal arteries, in both head-foot and abdomen-back directions. Ultrasound RDN was selectively performed at sites where SBP increased by at least 5 mmHg following stimulation. Supplementary RDN was conducted at any sites exhibiting an SBP increase of at least 5 mmHg after re-stimulation. A total of 60 directional stimulations were applied across 10 renal arteries, with 70% of these directions received ultrasound RDN. The daytime ambulatory SBP decreased from 151 to 130 mmHg after two months. These findings indicate that catheter-based ultrasound renal mapping guided RDN might feasible and could offer a more targeted approach to the RDN procedure.
40197720	Direct megakaryopoiesis.	Megakaryocytes are large, polyploid cells that produce platelets and originate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. While in the classical paradigm, megakaryocytes are generated in a stepwise fashion through increasingly committed progenitor stages, studies using in-vivo barcoding, transplantation, and in-vitro culture have suggested that, in addition, a more direct pathway existed. The relevance of this direct pathway and its functional and phenotypic characteristics were unclear, however.

40186505	Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic: the intranasal administration as a route for treatment - a patent review.	The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of today's marketed treatments for respiratory infections. As a primary site of infection, the upper airways may represent a key access route for the control and treatment for these conditions. The present study aims to explore and identify, through a patent review, the novelty of therapies for COVID-19 that use the intranasal route for drug administration. A search was carried out in Wipo and Espacenet, using the descriptors 'COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV 2' AND 'treatment OR therapy' AND NOT 'vaccine OR immunizing' and the classification 'A61K9/0043'. Of the 151 patents identified, we excluded 73 duplicates, and 36 documents that meet the criteria adopted for exclusion (not nasally administered formulations, vaccines, post COVID-19 treatments, uncertain route of administration or form). We identified 78 unique patents on patent databases, of which 42 were selected for this review. The documents revealed the use of the intranasal pathway not only for drug repositioning but also for using plant-derived and biological molecules. Overall, the new formulations explore a variety of known drugs and natural products incorporated in drug carrier systems and devices for drug delivery and administration. Thus, the intranasal route remains a promising strategy for drug delivery, offering direct access to the primary infection site and warranting further exploration.
40181506	The LARP6 La module from <i>Tetrabaena socialis</i> reveals structural and functional differences from plant and animal LARP6 homologues.	This study identified the LARP6 La Module from <i>Tetrabaena socialis</i> (<i>T. socialis</i>), a four-celled green algae, in an effort to better understand the evolution of LARP6 structure and RNA-binding activity in multicellular eukaryotes. Using a combination of sequence alignments, domain boundary screens, and structural modelling, we recombinantly expressed and isolated the <i>Ts</i>LARP6 La Module to > 98% purity for <i>in vitro</i> biochemical characterization. The La Module is stably folded and exerts minimal RNA binding activity against single-stranded homopolymeric RNAs. Surprisingly, it exhibits low micromolar binding affinity for the vertebrate LARP6 cognate ligand, a bulged-stem loop found in the 5'UTR of collagen type I mRNA, but does not bind double-stranded RNAs of similar size. These result suggests that the <i>Ts</i>LARP6 La Module may prefer structured RNA ligands. In contrast, however, the <i>Ts</i>LARP6 La Module does not exhibit the RNA chaperone activity that is observed in vertebrate homologs. Therefore, we conclude that protist LARP6 may have both distinct RNA ligands and binding mechanisms from the previously characterized LARP6 proteins of animals and vascular plants, thus establishing a distinct third class of the LARP6 protein family.

40167997	The interface hydrophilic-hydrophobic integration of fluorinated defective graphene towards biomedical applications.	In biomedical fields, rational design of novel two-dimensional (2D) biomedical nanomaterials aims to precisely manipulate biomolecules, including efficient capture, structural-functional transformation, directional movement, and self-assembly. In this work, we innovatively proposed new graphene nanosheets and selected two representative proteins to explore their binding mechanisms, structural-functional transformation of proteins, and biological effects of the materials. Fluorinated defective graphene (FDG) exhibited highly efficient capture and structural-functional transformation for the receptor binding domain (RBD), and we observed its collapse phenomenon in 2D materials for the first time. For the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>), FDG achieved an optimal balance between efficient capture, immobilization, and structural disruption. Further studies showed that fluorination on oxygen-containing defect graphene significantly enhanced variances in water distribution, surface properties, and hydrogen bond networks on the material surface. This allowed amino acids to be confined to specific areas, achieving efficient capture and directional movement. Additionally, the adsorption behavior and interaction strength of peptides and deoxynucleotides on FDG further validated the possibility of self-assembly. In summary, we highlight FDG as an excellent biomedical material with hydrophilic-hydrophobic integration.
40167355	Assessment of the Piris natural orbital functionals on transition metal dihydrides.	Transition metal dihydrides can be seen as a starting point for the study of the interaction between H<sub>2</sub> and d-metal ligands that are widely recognized as challenging molecules for electronic structure methods due to their possible multireference character and electronic correlation effects. The performance of different proposed Piris natural orbital functionals (PNOFs), such as PNOF5, PNOF7, and the global functional (GNOF), in predicting the formation of 3d-transition metal dihydrides was evaluated. A comparison between the results of the PNOFs and several state-of-the-art techniques has been carried out. It was found that all PNOF methods are consistent when static correlation effects are negligible. In particular, PNOF7 demonstrated the most accurate ratio for predicting the formation of the dihydrides and energy profiles, according to multireference methods. On the other hand, although the GNOF method successfully predicts the equilibrium geometries, it overstabilizes systems with high static correlation, such as low multiplicity dihydrides of intermediate 3d-series transition metals. As a whole, they indicate activation of the H<sub>2</sub> bond for all metals and also the formation of dihydrides, except for Co, Cu and Zn.
40167320	Nature of the Reactive Biferric Peroxy Intermediate P' in the Arylamine Oxygenases and Related Binuclear Fe Enzymes.	Binuclear nonheme iron enzymes activate O<sub>2</sub> to perform a wide range of chemical transformations. The process of O<sub>2</sub> activation typically involves a biferric peroxy-level intermediate P. It has been previously found that this intermediate undergoes further activation, either protonation or rearrangement to form P' or further oxidation to form high-valent intermediates Q or X. This study defines the structure of the P' intermediate in the <i>N</i>-oxygenases CmlI (and AurF based on previous data) using nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) in conjugation with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These results, combined with variable temperature variable field (VTVH) magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy on the 1-electron cryoreduced P', define the structure of the P' intermediate as a μ-1,2-hydroxoperoxo biferric site with a second hydroxide bridge. Reaction coordinate calculations demonstrate that single electron transfer (SET) is facilitated by protonation of the peroxo, activating its reductive cleavage, and that the additional hydroxide bridge does not impact this reaction. VTVH MCD studies further reveal that the hydroxide bridge is absent in the biferrous site, suggesting that during the O<sub>2</sub> reaction with the biferrous site, a water molecule forms the hydroxide bridge in providing the proton that activates the peroxide in P' for reactivity.
40167240	Regulating Effect and Mechanisms of Piperine on Glucose Homeostasis.	Glucose homeostasis is a fundamental physiological process critical for the maintenance of normal cellular functions and overall metabolic health, while disruption of this balance is closely associated with a spectrum of metabolic disorders. Black pepper, one of the world's most widely consumed spices, has been utilized extensively in both traditional medicine and culinary practices, with its bioactive compound piperine (PIP, 1-piperoyl-piperidine), the major alkaloid responsible for its characteristic pungency, emerging as a promising agent for the modulation of glucose metabolism. This Review aims to summarize the regulatory effects of PIP on glucose homeostasis in cell models, animal studies, and human clinical trials as well as the underlying biochemical pathways and molecular mechanisms. This Review highlights PIP as a potentially effective treatment for preventing and managing metabolic disorders associated with disrupted glucose balance, emphasizing its diverse role in influencing various biochemical pathways that control key aspects of glucose metabolism and overall metabolic function.
40167238	Catalytic Enantioselective Smiles Rearrangement Enabled by the Directed Evolution of P450 Radical Aryl Migratases.	Despite its synthetic potential, catalytic enantioselective Smiles rearrangement has remained elusive. Through the directed evolution of P450 radical aryl migratases (P450<sub>Smiles</sub>'s), we describe the first example of catalytic enantioselective Smiles rearrangement. A range of racemic <i>N</i>-arylsulfonyl-α-chloroamides could be transformed by P450<sub>Smiles</sub> in an enantioconvergent manner, affording acyclic amide products possessing an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter with excellent chemo- and enantioselectivity. Both electron-rich and electron-deficient substituents were compatible with the migrating aryl group, demonstrating this P450-catalyzed Smiles rearrangement is insensitive to the electronic properties of the migrating group. Importantly, our evolved P450 variants were capable of overriding the innate cyclization activity of the <i>N</i>-alkyl amidyl radical intermediate, allowing the chemoselective reductive formation of acyclic products. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed this unusual enzyme-controlled chemoselectivity stems from the restricted conformation of the amidyl radical within the enzyme active site, disfavoring the cyclization pathway. This new-to-nature biocatalytic asymmetric Smiles rearrangement showcases the synthetic potential of enzymatic chemo- and enantioselectivity control over highly reactive radical intermediates eluding small-molecule catalysts.
40167214	A LysR-like Transcriptional Regulator DsfB Is Required for the Daughter Cell Separation in <i>Bacillus cereus</i> 0-9.	<i>Bacillus cereus</i> 0-9 is a biocontrol strain isolated from a healthy wheat root, and studying cell separation after division in this strain will improve our understanding of its growth, environmental adaptation, and spread. In this work, we identified the deletion of <i>dsfB</i> resulted in a chaining phenotype. Four genes, <i>lysM1</i>, <i>lysM2</i>, <i>lysM3</i>, and <i>lysM4</i>, were associated with daughter cell separation in strain 0-9. Furthermore, DsfB bound to the promoter regions of <i>lysM1</i> and <i>lysM2</i> and induced their transcription. The peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of the <i>lysM1</i> and <i>lysM2</i> gene products was confirmed in vitro by site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analyses. The addition of purified LysM1 or LysM2 proteins in vitro or the overexpression of their coding genes inhibited the chaining phenotype of Δ<i>dsfB</i>. Taken together, our data indicate that DsfB is involved in daughter cell separation via the positive regulation of <i>lysM1</i> and <i>lysM2</i> expression in <i>B. cereus</i> 0-9.
40167164	Defined Glycan Ligands for Detecting Rare l-Sugar-Binding Proteins.	Most cells are decorated with distinct sugar sequences that can be recognized by carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBPs), such as antibodies and lectins. While humans utilize ten monosaccharide building blocks, bacteria biosynthesize hundreds of activated sugars to assemble diverse glycans. Monosaccharides absent in mammals are termed "rare" and are enriched in deoxy l-sugars beyond the "common" sugar l-fucose (l-Fuc) found across species. While immune proteins recognize microbial surfaces, there are limited probes to identify CBPs for the many rare sugars that may mediate these interactions. Here, we devise chemoenzymatic strategies to defined glycoconjugates containing l-Fuc and its structural analog l-colitose (l-Col), a bacterial dideoxysugar believed to bind immune proteins. We report a concise synthesis of l-Col and semisynthetic routes to several activated l-sugars. Incorporation of these sugars into glycans is evaluated using bacterial and mammalian glycosyltransferases (GTs) annotated to transfer l-Col or l-Fuc, respectively. We find that each GT can transfer both l-sugars, along with the rare hexose l-galactose (l-Gal), onto various glycan acceptors. Incorporation of these l-sugars into the resulting glycoconjugates is confirmed using known CBPs. Finally, these glycan ligands are employed to detect rare sugar-binding proteins in human serum. Overall, this work reveals similarities between bacterial and mammalian GTs that may be exploited for <i>in vitro</i> glycoconjugate construction to unveil novel mediators of host-pathogen interactions.
40167137	A Facile Micelle-Assisted Self-Assembly Method to Covalent Organic Framework Helical Nanoarchitectures.	We present a micelle-assisted self-assembly strategy for synthesizing covalent organic framework (COF) helical hollow nanoribbons by using achiral monomers and surfactants. The process involves polymerization of nanowires within rod-like micelle cores, followed by their attachment to form helical nanoribbons and solvothermal crystallization to create hollow COF architectures. This method allows for the controllable synthesis of COF helical nanostructures with tunable pitch and morphology and can be extended to other COF helical architectures by variation of the amine monomer. This strategy provides new insights into designing COF helical nanostructures using achiral building blocks within micellar systems.
40167032	Detoxification of Lipid Peroxidation Aldehyde 4-Hydroxynonenal by Hesperetin Dihydrochalcone, a Microbial Metabolite of Neohesperidin Dihydrochalcone, In Vitro and In Vivo.	Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC) is a safe and widely used sweetener from citrus hesperidin. Beyond its sweetening properties, the potential health benefits and mechanisms of NHDC remain underexplored. This study investigated whether NHDC could reduce lipid peroxidation through its microbial metabolite, hesperetin dihydrochalcone (HDC), which traps 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a reactive carbonyl species generated during lipid peroxidation. In vitro, HDC formed covalent conjugates with 4-HNE through 1,2-addition at the aldehyde site and 1,4-Michael addition at the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, resulting in three distinct adducts that were purified and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Mouse studies confirmed that HDC is the primary metabolite of NHDC and can trap 4-HNE in vivo, forming 4-HNE-HDC conjugates. Further research showed a dose-dependent increase in 4-HNE-HDC conjugates, particularly the mono-4-HNE HDC conjugate formed via 1,2-addition. These findings demonstrate the ability of HDC to reduce carbonyl stress by trapping 4-HNE and highlight the role of microbial metabolism in the transformation of dietary polyphenols into bioactive metabolites. The 4-HNE-scavenging ability of HDC suggests its potential in the development of dietary strategies for reducing lipid peroxidation and preventing chronic diseases associated with carbonyl stress.
40166985	Mechanisms and dynamics of the halophilic reaction between CH<sub>2</sub>CN<sup>-</sup> and CCl<sub>4</sub>.	In gas phase experiments [H. Chen, R. G. Cooks, E. C. Meurer and M. N. Eberlin, <i>J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom.</i>, 2005, <b>16</b>, 2045], the reaction of the CH<sub>2</sub>CN<sup>-</sup> ion with CCl<sub>4</sub> was observed to proceed predominantly <i>via</i> a halophilic reaction, where the nucleophile attacks a Cl atom, displacing the CCl<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ion, along with minor products from S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions and H/Cl exchange. In this study, the energetics of the three reaction pathways were investigated using the DFT, MP2, and DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods. The B3LYP/6-311++G** level of theory accurately described the reaction pathways compared to the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS benchmark while remaining computationally efficient. At the B3LYP/6-311++G** level, the halophilic pathway was found to be barrierless and energetically favorable, whereas the S<sub>N</sub>2 pathway exhibited an energy barrier of 4.34 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> relative to the reactants. The H/Cl exchange reaction is proposed to occur through sequential steps: an initial halophilic pathway followed by proton transfer, due to the high energy barrier of 11.71 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> for the direct reaction. The reaction dynamics, investigated through bimolecular <i>ab initio</i> trajectory simulations at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level, revealed the formation of major halophilic products, consistent with experimental findings. Additionally, the dynamics of the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction were explored by analyzing the post-transition state trajectories.
40166958	Butyrate Regulates Intestinal DNA Virome and Lipopolysaccharide Levels to Prevent High-Fat Diet-Related Liver Damage in Rats.	As the adsorption receptor of bacteriophage tail protein, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a main culprit responsible for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) caused by high-fat diets. However, few studies have focused on how the interaction between intestinal bacteriophages and bacterial LPS affects the development and progression of NAFLD. Herein, we determined that excessive fat intake significantly increases the levels of endogenous LPS, while the administration of beneficial metabolites of the intestinal microbiota (specifically butyrate) alleviated hepatic injury in rats. The beneficial mechanism of butyrate was attributed to the reprogramming of the structure of the intestinal DNA virome (primarily, phageome). Butyrate possesses the potential to augment bacteriophagic microbial diversity, thereby potentially facilitating interactions between intestinal bacteriophages and bacterial LPS (in the case of homologous phage), further improving mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species production, which, in turn, lowered HepG2 cell damage. Likewise, fecal phage transplantation further confirmed that intestinal phages from rats that received butyrate could effectively interact with bacterial LPS to reduce liver damage in rats. Taken together, modifying the intestinal phageome is a promising treatment option for high-fat diet-related NAFLD.
40166924	Characteristics of chemical products under the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> mode of dielectric barrier discharge: comprehensive effects of specific energy input and magnetic field.	The reactive nitrogen species generated under the NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> mode of dielectric barrier discharge have attracted widespread attention in biomedical applications, with the crucial factor for their utilization being the regulation of the species proportion. In this work, we investigated the variation of NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> mode products in an AC-driven coaxial dielectric barrier discharge system under different specific energy inputs (SEIs) controlled by voltages and gas flow rates in the presence and absence of a magnetic field as a method for combinatorial multiparameter regulation. Our findings demonstrated that the effect of SEIs on products was closely related to the discharge conditions. Under constant conditions, increasing the SEI led to the promotion of NO and N<sub>2</sub>O, suppression of NO<sub>2</sub>, and stabilization of ONOO<sup>-</sup>. When the SEI was varied by adjusting the voltage, the product trend followed the same pattern as described above. However, when the SEI was varied by adjusting the gas flow rate, the product trend appeared to differ. As the gas flow rate increased, the discharge power remained almost unchanged, while the SEI decreased significantly, leading to the suppression of NO, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub>, and ONOO<sup>-</sup> production. The magnetic field did not significantly alter the SEI, but it affected the products. Introducing a 0.2 T magnetic field under constant conditions promoted the production of NO while suppressing N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub> and ONOO<sup>-</sup> formation. To understand the microscopic physicochemical mechanisms of product variations under multiple discharge parameters, we analyzed the chemical reaction network, presenting an overview of the effects of multiparameters on the generation of reactive nitrogen species. These insights hold significant value for plasma applications within the realm of biomedicine, where the regulated generation of reactive nitrogen species is pivotal in attaining the desired plasma performance.
40165750	<i>OsGSTF1</i> Endows Higher Tolerance of <i>Oryza sativa</i> to 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvivate Dioxygenase Inhibitor Tripyrasulfone than <i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i>.	The 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor tripyrasulfone exhibits exceptional postemergence selectivity for grass weed control in direct-seeding rice. Previous studies suggested that enhanced metabolism of tripyrasulfone in <i>Oryza sativa</i> contributes to its selectivity against <i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i>, but mechanisms remained unclear. Here, we revealed significantly higher P450s and GSTs activities in <i>O. sativa</i> than <i>E. crus-galli</i> after tripyrasulfone postemergence application. Inhibiting these enzymes increased tripyrasulfone sensitivity in <i>O. sativa</i> (GR<sub>50</sub> in fresh weight reduced by 72-82%) but minimally affected <i>E. crus-galli</i> (28-48% reduction). <i>Oryza sativa</i> absorbed less yet metabolized more tripyrasulfone, with enzyme inhibitors (malathion and NBD-Cl) narrowing the metabolic rate differences. Integrated transcriptomic and qPCR analyses identified 13 candidate genes (7 P450s, 6 GSTs), among which molecular docking demonstrated high affinity between OsGSTF1 and tripyrasulfone/its active metabolite (HDT). Transgenic <i>O. sativa</i> validation confirmed that <i>OsGSTF1</i> enhances tolerance via accelerated metabolism. This study elucidates metabolic selectivity mechanisms and provides genetic targets for herbicide-tolerance breeding.
40165741	Ligand Enabled Iridium-Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroalkenylation of α-Olefins and Styrenes with Acrylamides.	A new type of chiral spiro diphosphite ligand has been developed. Using these ligands, iridium-catalyzed highly enantioselective hydroalkenylation of α-olefins and styrenes with acrylamides has been realized. A variety of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes were successfully coupled with acrylamides to produce γ-substituted chiral acrylamides. The reaction exhibits excellent branched selectivity and high enantioselectivity along with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. DFT calculations indicate that the methyl groups in the ligand play a crucial role in controlling both regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of the reaction.
40165739	Plasmonic Charge Localization and C-H Activation at Single-Atom Sites in Dilute Copper Platinum Alloys.	The role of energy transfer in plasmonic alloys is critical for advancing photocatalysis to industrially and societally relevant chemical processes. In this study, we synthesized and characterized CuPt dilute alloy catalysts to explore the impact of dopant concentration on energy transfer in plasmon-assisted nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation. By leveraging the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in copper nanoparticles, we examined how single-atom and ensemble Pt sites influence (photo)catalytic performance. <i>In situ</i> diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, along with kinetic analysis of photocatalytic experiments, provided evidence that Pt single-atom sites enhance nonthermal charge carrier generation and energy transfer processes, accelerating C-H scission, resulting in a significant increase in light-driven reaction rates compared to CuPt alloys with ensemble Pt sites. The photochemical enhancement enabled by dilute plasmonic alloys is proposed to result from transient oxidative potentials (i.e., hot holes) localized on isolated dopant sites. These findings demonstrate the potential of engineering active sites in dilute plasmonic alloys for tailored electronic properties, paving the way for broader applications in plasmonic photocatalysis.
40165725	High performance photocatalytic water splitting in two-dimensional BN/Janus SnSSe heterojunctions: <i>ab initio</i> study.	Designing and exploring a photocatalyst with interfacial electric fields for hydrogen production <i>via</i> water splitting is a critical area of research. To achieve efficient hydrolysis reactions, heterojunction materials have garnered significant attention due to their excellent electronic structures and interfacial properties. In this study, we designed a 2D BN/SnSSe heterojunction and investigated its photovoltaic properties through first-principles calculations. We found that the BN/SSnSe heterojunction is a type-II structure, with electron mobility (<i>μ</i><sub>e</sub>) and hole mobility (<i>μ</i><sub>h</sub>) of 1257.32 and 439.73 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. By modulating the interlayer spacing to 2.7 Å, we successfully achieved the desired photocatalytic band-edge positions (CBM > -4.44 eV, VBM < -5.67 eV). Additionally, we discovered a unique phenomenon in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the peroxide groups (OOH) automatically detach when H<sup>+</sup> is adsorbed on the reaction intermediate *OOH, leading to the production of O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. We refer to this process as the H-ion induced desorption mechanism (H-IIDM). This mechanism not only enables the separation of the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on different surfaces but also further enhances the photocatalytic efficiency. Furthermore, the BN/SnSSe heterojunction exhibits excellent visible-light absorption with a high optical absorption coefficient (10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>), and BN/SSnSe has a high solar hydrogen production efficiency (32.61%), significantly outperforming conventional 2D photocatalysts. These findings suggest that the BN/SnSSe heterojunction holds great potential as a photocatalyst for water splitting applications.
40165679	A Lanthanide Nanoparticle-Aggregation-Induced Emission Photosensitizer Complex System Drives Coupled Triplet Energy Transfer for Enhanced Radio-Photodynamic Therapy.	Cerenkov light (CL), utilized as an internal excitation source for photodynamic therapy (PDT), addresses the limitations of laser penetration and has substantial potential for seamlessly integrating clinical radiotheranostics with phototheranostics. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of CL-mediated PDT is significantly hindered by challenges, such as the low intensity of CL and inadequate energy transfer between the CL donor and photosensitizers (PSs). In this study, a novel approach is introduced for enhanced radionuclide-activated radio-photodynamic therapy utilizing a hybrid nanoparticle system composed of lanthanide nanoparticles and an aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer (AIE PS), designated LnNP-TQ NPs. This system enables lanthanide nanoparticles to optimize the decay energy of radionuclides, effectively sensitizing the AIE PS through triplet energy transfer (TET)-mediated processes with an efficiency approaching 100%. When activated by the clinical radionuclide <sup>18</sup>F for positron emission tomography imaging, the LnNP-TQ NPs substantially inhibited tumor growth via effective singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) generation. This strategy, which optimally harnesses radionuclide energy and achieves efficient energy transfer, offers a promising pathway for enhancing radiotherapy-phototherapy efficacy in tumor treatment.
40165667	Facet-dependent polaron stability in photocatalysis by SrTiO<sub>3</sub>: a constrained DFT study.	Strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub> or STO) is one of the promising photocatalysts for sustainable energy applications. Using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we herein study the structural and electronic factors contributing to its high photocatalytic activity and facet dependence. The constrained DFT method revealed that the hole polarons in bulk and surface STO are localized primarily on oxygen atoms. In contrast, electron polarons in bulk STO tend to delocalize over oxygen atoms unless stabilized by oxygen vacancies. The stability of hole polarons is higher at the surface O site of the (110) surface compared to the (001) surfaces. In addition, the oxygen vacancy is stable specifically at the TiO<sub>2</sub>-terminated (001) surface. These findings provide an atomic-level insight into the relationship between polaron stability and facet dependence of photocatalysis, paving the way for the design of more efficient STO-based photocatalysts.
40165638	B/N modified GDY as a rare base 2D sensor: a first-principles study.	Detecting DNA rare bases is essential for diagnosing genetic disorders and cancers. However, their low abundance and high structural similarity make selective and sensitive detection challenging. The two-dimensional functionalized carbon material graphdiyne (GDY) holds great promise for enhancing sensor performance due to its excellent electronic properties, biocompatibility, and ease of functionalization. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the adsorption behavior of rare bases on GDY and R-GDY (R = B/N) surfaces. Essential factors, including adsorption energy, bandgap, charge transfer, and density of states, are systematically analyzed. Additionally, critical sensor performance metrics, such as deposition time, sensitivity, and selectivity are predicted, providing valuable insights into the potential applications of these materials. The results indicate that while pure GDY can specifically recognize 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, its sensitivity is limited. In contrast, R-GDY stably adsorbs rare bases <i>via</i> π-π interactions, exhibiting good reversibility and moderate charge transfer, which significantly enhance its sensitivity. R-GDY effectively distinguishes between rare bases based on translocation time, making it ideal for the development of efficient and reusable electrochemical biosensors, thus providing a reliable approach for clinical diagnostics.
40165628	When carbon monoxide goes "upside down": vibrational signatures of CO at NaCl(100) from <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics.	CO adsorbed on NaCl(100) is a model system for surface science showing a rich variety of interesting phenomena. It features several adsorption phases like tilted/antiparallel or perpendicular/upright, very long vibrational lifetimes of the CO internal stretch (IS) mode, anharmonicity-driven vibrational energy pooling, "C-bound" <i>vs.</i> "O-bound" adsorption, and heavy-atom gateway tunneling during CO inversion at low temperatures. Typically, these features and phenomena are experimentally probed by stationary and time-resolved vibrational spectra, exhibiting characteristic differences between the various adsorption modes and phases. To gain atom- and time-resolved insight into vibrational response of CO molecules on NaCl(100), vibrational density of states (VDOS), infrared (IR) and vibrational sum frequency (VSF) spectra are computed from velocity velocity correlation functions (VVCFs) by <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics (AIMD) for various coverages, temperatures and phases. In agreement with experiments, we find that increasing CO ("C-bound") coverages as well as CO inversion lead to redshifts of the CO IS mode. We predict more diffuse spectra at <i>T</i> = 300 K compared to 30 K, reflecting the disorder of adsorbates and monolayer instability at room temperature. Analyzing molecularly decomposed and internal VDOS curves as well as computed non-linear correlation matrices give further insight into the complex molecular dynamics underlying the vibrational spectra, notably for the low-frequency regime where frustrated rotations, translations and intermolecular motions come into play. On a methodological side, we also test and discuss some intricate details of how to compute IR and VSF response using a modified formulation of the VVCF methods [Ohto <i>et al.</i>, <i>J. Chem. Phys.</i>, 2015, <b>143</b>, 124702], by including time and angle-dependent dipole and polarizability derivatives as well as intermolecular couplings by cross correlations. Their effect on computed vibrational spectra is studied. These findings provide a detailed, microscopic insight into the picosecond vibrational spectra and dynamics of CO on NaCl(100), highlighting the effects of temperature, coverage, and changes in adsorbate orientation.
40165494	Low-lying excited states of linear all-<i>trans</i> polyenes: the σ-π electron correlation and the description of ionic states.	In this work, the electronic spectra of all-<i>trans</i> polyenes, from hexatriene to dodecahexaene are investigated. Special attention is given to the challenging description of the ionic 1<sup>1</sup>B+u state. A comprehensive wavefunction analysis of both singlet (2<sup>1</sup>A-g, 1<sup>1</sup>B+u, and 2<sup>1</sup>B-u) and triplet excited states (1<sup>3</sup>A-g and 1<sup>3</sup>B-u) is performed using a range of multireference correlated methods, including multireference configuration interaction with singles and doubles (MR-CISD) including <i>a posteriori</i> size-extensivity Pople correction (+P), and the multireference averaged quadratic coupled-cluster (MR-AQCC) method. While covalent states are well described by multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) theory, accurately describing the ionic state requires addressing size-extensivity errors, basis set effects, and, most importantly, σ-π electron correlation. Taking these factors into account, MR-CISD+P and MR-AQCC results mutually corroborate that the ionic 1<sup>1</sup>B+u state is the first vertically excited state in hexatriene and octatetraene. In decapentaene, extrapolated MR-CISD+P results indicate that the 2<sup>1</sup>A-g and 1<sup>1</sup>B+u states are nearly degenerate, while MR-AQCC suggests that the ionic state lies approximately 0.2 eV below the covalent state. From a wavefunction perspective, the ionic state is consistently well-represented by a single HOMO-LUMO excitation, whereas the contribution of doubly excited configurations increases with chain length for both covalent states.
40165479	Enzyme-Mimic Photoinitiated Flow-Polymerization with High Stereoselectivity under Mild Conditions.	Enzymatic reactions can achieve efficient flow-polymerization with specificity and high stereoselectivity. However, current enzyme-mimic polymerization systems cannot achieve high stereoregularity in flow reactions under mild conditions. This inefficient chain control may be due to the absence of a specific catalyst structure for the target monomer. This study reports a model of enzyme-mimic catalytic material for the polymerization of a specific monomer. In particular, the specific enzyme-mimic photoinitiated flow-polymerization of benzyl acrylate was realized at 22 °C using zinc porphyrin metal-organic framework (Zn-PMOF) membranes with one-dimensional nanochannels, achieving the efficient synthesis of highly heterotactic polymers. Under visible light irradiation, the zinc porphyrin core on the membrane surface could initiate polymerization, while copper porphyrin MOF with similar structures could not. The specific channel structure of the Zn-PMOF membrane provided space for stereochemical control. Control experiments, density functional theory simulations, and spectroscopic characterizations show that the combination of size effect and channel-monomer interactions realized higher monomer conversion and polymer stereoregularity in the flow reaction. Furthermore, the crystallinity, shear stress, and ionic conductivity of enzyme-mimic polymers were considerably better than those of bulk polymerization products. Thus, this study provides a method for enzyme-mimic polymerization with high stereoselectivity under mild conditions.
40164569	Deteriorated Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Cobaltites.	A wealth of remarkable behaviors is observed at the interfaces between magnetic oxides due to the coexistence of Coulomb repulsion and interatomic exchange interactions. While previous research has focused on bonded oxide heterointerfaces, studies on magnetism in van der Waals interfaces remain rare. In this study, we stacked two freestanding cobaltites with precisely controlled twist angles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed clear and ordered moiré patterns, which exhibit an inverse relationship with the twist angle. We observed that the Curie temperature in the twisted region is lower than that in the single-layer region and varies systematically with the twist angle. This phenomenon may be related to the weakening of the orbital hybridization between oxygen ions and transition metal ions in the unbonded interfaces. Our findings suggest a potential avenue for modulating magnetic interactions in correlated systems through twist, providing opportunities for the discovery of unknown quantum states.
40164103	Machine learning-assisted study on the thermal transport properties of two-dimensional M<sub>3</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(M = Fe, Co, Ni) materials.	Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOF) are widely used in electronic devices and energy storage due to their large surface area, abundant active sites, and tunable sizes. A deeper understanding of the thermal transport properties of two-dimensional MOF materials is essential for these applications. In this work, we systematically studied the thermal transport properties of M<sub>3</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(M = Fe, Co, Ni) by using a machine learning interatomic potential method combined with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The results show that the lattice thermal conductivities of Fe<sub>3</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and Ni<sub>3</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>at room temperature are 4.0 W mK<sup>-1</sup>, 5.5 W mK<sup>-1</sup>, and 5.8 W mK<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The differences in thermal conductivity primarily arise from variations in phonon relaxation times, which can be elucidated by examining the three-phonon scattering phase space. Further analysis of bond strengths reveals that the strong bonding between Fe and O impedes phonon propagation through the oxygen atoms, resulting in lower lattice thermal conductivity. Our work provides a fundamental reference for understanding thermal transport in two-dimensional MOF.
40164089	Portal dose image prediction using Monte Carlo generated transmission energy fluence maps of dynamic radiotherapy treatment plans: a deep learning approach.	<i>Aims.</i>This work aims to develop and investigate the feasibility of a hybrid model combining Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and deep learning (DL) to predict electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images based on MC-generated exit phase space energy fluence maps from dynamic radiotherapy treatment plans. Such predicted images can be used as reference images during<i>in vivo</i>dosimetry.<i>Materials and methods</i>. MC simulations involving a Varian True Beam linear accelerator model were performed using the EGSnrc code package. Two custom variants of the U-Net architecture were employed.

The proposed method was tested through 2D gamma index analysis, comparing predicted and measured EPID images.<i>Results</i>. Results showed gamma passing rates of 38.65%, 74.16% and 96.17% (minimum, median, maximum) for a simpler model variant and 52.72%, 80.61% and 96.80% for the more complex model variant.<i>Conclusion</i>. The study highlights the feasibility of integrating MC and DL methodologies for<i>in vivo</i>dosimetry quality assurance in complex radiotherapy delivery.
40163806	Synthesis and Superconductivity of Ternary A15-(Lu, Y)<sub>4</sub>H<sub>23</sub> at High Pressures.	Ternary hydrides, formed by introducing new elements into binary hydrides, are a crucial pathway for enhancing superconducting transition temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) or reducing the stable pressures. In this work, we have acquired the ternary hydride formed by Lu and Y atoms, inspired by the low stabilization pressure of the Lu-H system with its fully filled 4<i>f</i> electrons, as well as the higher <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> of the Y-H system. By effectively controlling the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, we have successfully synthesized <i>Pm</i>-3<i>n</i> (Lu, Y)<sub>4</sub>H<sub>23</sub> (A15-type). The synthesized <i>Pm</i>-3<i>n</i> (Lu, Y)<sub>4</sub>H<sub>23</sub> reveals the highest <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> of 112 K at 215 GPa, which is the record <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> among A15-type superconductors. Compared to the binary <i>Pm</i>-3<i>n</i> Lu<sub>4</sub>H<sub>23</sub>, the <i>Pm</i>-3<i>n</i> (Lu, Y)<sub>4</sub>H<sub>23</sub> exhibits a 60% increase in <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> and a 61% enhancement in the upper critical field μ<sub>0</sub><i>H</i><sub>c2</sub>(0). Interestingly, <i>Pm</i>-3<i>n</i> (Lu, Y)<sub>4</sub>H<sub>23</sub> displays minimal volume expansion and a slight increase in the H-H bond distance relative to <i>Pm</i>-3<i>n</i> Lu<sub>4</sub>H<sub>23</sub> due to the introduction of Y atoms. Combined theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that the substitution of Lu atoms with Y atoms enhances electron-phonon coupling (EPC) through modified electronic bands and phonon softening caused by the expansion of H-H bonds, collectively driving the significant enhancement of <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> in <i>Pm</i>-3<i>n</i> (Lu, Y)<sub>4</sub>H<sub>23</sub>. Our work demonstrates a crucial strategy for adjusting and enhancing the superconducting performance of hydrides and offers valuable practical experience for developing ternary hydrides.
40163798	Interface Preconstruction Enables Robust Passivation of the Ah-Level Aqueous Li-ion Batteries.	The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) offers effective passivation on the anode for aqueous lithium-ion batteries (ALIBs). Conventional passivation in ALIBs mainly relies on the LiF-contained SEI originating from anion reduction in the electrolyte. However, such SEI formation is a competitive reaction negatively impacted by the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in high Li<sup>+</sup> irreversible consumption and imperfect bare flaws. To address this issue, we propose preconstructing an artificial interphase by introducing a multifunctional interface additive CsF to build superior passivation on the anode in ALIBs. CsF first undergoes a displacement reaction with LiTFSI from the fresh electrolyte to form the LiF in situ on the interface of the anode before the cycles, avoiding the extra Li<sup>+</sup> irreversible consumption. Meanwhile, we uncover that the dissolving Cs<sup>+</sup> in the electrolyte can destroy the hydrogen bond network of the water to lower water activity on the anode interface and strongly interact with TFSI<sup>-</sup> to form the cation-anion complex, facilitating the anion proximity to the anode interface. The anion reduction based on the artificial interphase can finally help achieve the robust SEI in ALIBs. Such passivation stabilizes the aqueous electrolyte, significantly suppressing the side reaction of the HER that allows ALIBs to obtain a superior long life above 2000 cycles. The ampere-hour-level (Ah-level) pouch cell achieves an energy density of 57 Wh/kg and 176 Wh/L with high energy efficiency (∼94%).
40163768	Atomistic Details of Nanocluster Formation from Machine-Learned-Potential-Based Simulations.	Understanding the mechanism for the formation of metal nanoclusters is an open challenge in nanoscience. Computational modeling can provide molecular details of nanocluster formation that are otherwise inaccessible. However, simulating nanocluster nucleation in solution presents significant challenges, including inaccurate energy predictions and limitations on the system size and time scale. This work addresses these challenges by combining deep neural networks (DNNs) with well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD) to model the nucleation of a prototypical nanocluster, Ag<sub>6</sub>(SCNH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub> in methanol. A neural-network-potential-based unbiased molecular dynamics simulation captured the cluster's dynamic behavior, while WT-MetaD simulations revealed an almost barrierless transition from dispersed precursors to a nucleated state. The method's robustness was further demonstrated by scaling up to 30 randomly distributed precursors, which resulted in spontaneous nucleation. This study presents the first successful DNN model of nanocluster formation in solution with density-functional-theory-level accuracy, paving the way for advancements in the field.
40163638	Tritium adsorption and absorption on (100) and (001) surfaces of pure and tin defective zirconium.	Zirconium alloys such as zircaloy-4 are used as tritium (T) getter materials in tritium-producing burnable absorber rods (TPBARs) due to their ability to capture T, thereby forming metal hydrides. Developing an understanding of T adsorption onto zircaloy prior to diffusion into the subsurface is relevant for rational tritium getter and TPBAR design, to improve material properties for nuclear applications. Herein, density functional theory calculations revealed the preferred binding sites for T adsorption on Zr(001) and Zr(100). The energy barriers of T transfer, along the surface and from the surface to the subsurface were computed. The adsorption properties of Zr(001) were found to be superior to those of Zr(100). Surface tin impurities were found to strongly repel T. The presence of subsurface and surface tin resulted in higher absorption energy barriers for both the forward and reverse processes. Based on the calculated energy barriers, a surface to surface T diffusion coefficient of 9.53 × 10<sup>-10</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> is expected for pristine Zr(001). A surface to subsurface T diffusion coefficient on the order of 10<sup>-13</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> is predicted in pristine Zr, decreasing to 10<sup>-19</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for the transfer with a subsurface tin impurity.
40163627	Rotational and vibrational spectroscopy of a weakly bound hexafluoroisopropanol⋯dinitrogen complex: <sup>14</sup>N hyperfine splittings, molecular geometry, and experimental benchmarks.	The rotational spectrum of a weakly bound binary complex of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) with molecular nitrogen was measured using chirped-pulse and cavity-based Fourier transform microwave spectrometers. In addition, its infrared spectrum was measured in the OH stretching region. An extensive conformational search identified multiple binding sites on HFIP, with the global minimum structure featuring a <i>trans</i>-HFIP conformation and nitrogen weakly bound at the acidic proton (H<sub><i>t</i></sub>N<sub>H</sub>). Good agreement between the experimentally determined rotational constants and the relative intensity patterns of <i>a</i>-, <i>b</i>-, and <i>c</i>-type transitions with theoretical predictions conclusively identified the H<sub><i>t</i></sub>N<sub>H</sub> conformer. This assignment is further corroborated by an analysis of the <sup>14</sup>N nuclear quadrupole hyperfine structure. The non-equivalence of the two <sup>14</sup>N nuclei in H<sub><i>t</i></sub>N<sub>H</sub> is confirmed through a detailed molecular symmetry group analysis, as well as the <sup>14</sup>N nuclear quadrupole hyperfine analysis. Examination of the experimental nuclear quadrupole coupling constants offers additional insights into the orientation and large-amplitude vibrational motions of the N<sub>2</sub> subunit. Furthermore, the experimentally derived rotational constants and the OH stretching band position of the complex, compared with previously known values for the isolated monomer, serve as complementary benchmarks for evaluating the systematic quality of predictions from electronic structure calculations across several levels of theory. This combined examination of vibrational energy levels and structural parameters aids in distinguishing fortuitously accurate predictions of individual properties.
40163623	Simultaneously Enhancing the Catalytic Activity and Thermostability of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Aminopeptidase via Structure-based Design.	Aminopeptidases are crucial hydrolases in the food and pharmaceutical industries. This study addresses the need to enhance the catalytic performance of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> aminopeptidase (PaAps) through a multifaceted computational design strategy. We introduced single-site mutations followed by combinatorial mutations to develop a mutant library, identifying the optimal mutant S112D, which demonstrated a 5.19-fold increase in catalytic activity and nearly doubled the thermostability compared to the wild type. The kinetic parameters (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>, <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>, and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) of S112D were found to be 4.36, 6.52, and 4.36 times greater than those of the wild type, respectively. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the S112D mutant induced global conformational changes, resulting in a more open active pocket that facilitated better binding with the substrate, thereby improving conformational stability. Additionally, the S112D mutant exhibited a closer nucleophilic attack distance and stronger hydrogen bonding interactions, further boosting catalytic efficiency. Remarkably, mutant S112D, as well as the wild type, showed hydrolytic activity on both corn and soybean proteins. The hydrolysis rate of corn protein by S112D was approximately 1.92 times that of PaAps, and for soybean protein, it is roughly 1.84 times. These findings offered valuable insights for developing more efficient enzyme modification strategies.
40163620	Evaluating iron diimines: ion-pairing, lability and the reduced state.	Tris(diimine)iron(II) complexes are aspirational photosensitizers but their small ligand fields confer lability and distinct redox properties. We study these aspects in the gas phase using mass spectrometry and density-functional theory of [Fe(N^N)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> dications (N^N = 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 4,4'-dibromo-2,2'-bipyridine (bipy<sup>Br</sup>), 4,4'-di(<i>tert</i>-butyl)-2,2'-bipyridine (bipy<sup><i>t</i>-Bu</sup>)). Collision-induced dissociation of ion pairs {[Fe(N^N)<sub>3</sub>]X}<sup>+</sup> (X = BPh<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> and BAr<sup>F</sup><sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>; Ar<sup>F</sup> = 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) requires high energies, not because of strong ion pairing but because the tetraarylborates are poor ligands, such that the lowest-energy pathway requires ligand dissociation. Dissociation of dications reveals contrasting thermal stabilities ([Fe(bipy<sup><i>t</i>-Bu</sup>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> > [Fe(phen)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> ≫ [Fe(bipy<sup>Br</sup>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> > [Fe(bipy)(phen)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> > [Fe(bipy)<sub>2</sub>(phen)]<sup>2+</sup> > [Fe(bipy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>), while ion-mobility spectrometry reveals their relative collision cross-sections ([Fe(bipy<sup><i>t</i>-Bu</sup>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> > [Fe(bipy<sup>Br</sup>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> > [Fe(phen)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> > [Fe(bipy)(phen)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> > [Fe(bipy)<sub>2</sub>(phen)]<sup>2+</sup> > [Fe(bipy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>). Dications can be reduced to their respective monocations with [1,3-dicyanobenzene]<sup>-</sup>, and the extent of reaction increases with calculated redox potentials for [Fe(N^N)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+/+</sup> couples. Despite the ligand-centered nature of the redox processes, the stabilities of the radical monocations ([Fe(bipy<sup><i>t</i>-Bu</sup>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> ≈ [Fe(phen)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> > [Fe(bipy)(phen)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> > [Fe(bipy)<sub>2</sub>(phen)]<sup>+</sup> > [Fe(bipy<sup>Br</sup>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> > [Fe(bipy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup>) follow a similar order to the dications. This suggests that the π-donor and -acceptor properties of diimines are apt to stabilize both charge states, as would be present in photoredox catalysis.
40163590	Deep Learning with Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction Images to Predict Cation Ratio in Sr<sub>2<i>x</i></sub>Ti<sub>2(1-<i>x</i>)</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Thin Films.	Machine learning (ML) with in-situ diagnostics offers a transformative approach to accelerate, understand, and control thin film synthesis by uncovering relationships between synthesis conditions and material properties. In this study, we demonstrate the application of deep learning to predict the stoichiometry of Sr<sub>2<i>x</i></sub>Ti<sub>2(1-<i>x</i>)</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin films using reflection high-energy electron diffraction images acquired during pulsed laser deposition. A gated convolutional neural network trained for regression of the Sr atomic fraction achieved accurate predictions with a small dataset of 31 samples. Explainable AI techniques revealed a previously unknown correlation between diffraction streak features and cation stoichiometry in Sr<sub>2<i>x</i></sub>Ti<sub>2(1-<i>x</i>)</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin films. Our results demonstrate how ML can be used to transform a ubiquitous <i>in-situ</i> diagnostic tool, that is usually limited to qualitative assessments, into a quantitative surrogate measurement of continuously valued thin film properties. Such methods are critically needed to enable real-time control, autonomous workflows, and accelerate traditional synthesis approaches.
40163418	Criegee Intermediates Significantly Reduce Atmospheric (CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CFCN.	Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) is widely used for many industrial purposes due to its superior insulating properties; however, it is also a potent greenhouse gas with a high global warming potential (GWP) and an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 3,200 years. Here, we investigate heptafluoroisobutyronitrile ((CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CFCN, also called C4-fluoronitrile or C4-FN) to help determine if it is a sustainable alternative to SF<sub>6</sub>. We present experimental measurements and high-level quantum chemical calculations with a new computational strategy to elucidate the reaction kinetics between C4-FN and Criegee intermediates (CIs), specifically CH<sub>2</sub>OO and <i>syn</i>-CH<sub>3</sub>CHOO. By employing a new strategy to obtain CCSDT(Q)/CBS-level accuracy for a larger system than has previously been possible, combined with state-of-the-art kinetics methods, we obtain good agreement between theoretical and experimental rate constants. We find that the reactions between C4-FN and CIs are substantially faster than previously known degradation pathways, particularly the OH radical reaction. This shows the importance of incorporating additional reactive species into atmospheric chemistry models and climate impact assessments, paving the way for more effective climate change mitigation. Including the CI reactions in two possible scenarios gives a predicted atmospheric lifetime of C4-FN of 2-34.5 years, with a significant reduction in its global warming potential. This supports C4-FN's potential as an environmentally friendly substitute for SF<sub>6</sub>.
40163371	Low-Temperature Direct Arylation Polymerization for the Sustainable Synthesis of a Library of Low-Defect Donor-Acceptor Conjugated Polymers via Pd/Ag Dual-Catalysis.	Donor-acceptor alternating conjugated polymers (D-A CPs) are one of the best materials for high-performance organic electronic devices, owing to their low bandgap and high charge carrier mobility. However, most of the D-A CPs are synthesized by less sustainable polymerization methods. To address this issue, direct arylation polymerization (DArP), eliminating the need for transmetalating agents, was developed over the past two decades. Nevertheless, C-H activation during DArP still requires significantly harsh reaction conditions, limiting the precision and applicability of CPs. In this report, we demonstrate a versatile and sustainable Pd/Ag dual-catalytic DArP conducted at low or even room temperatures, thereby yielding low-defect D-A CPs. Initially, electron-deficient acceptor substrates with various electronic properties and p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> underwent successful concerted-metalation-deprotonation (CMD) via Ag catalysis with mild conditions and highly chemoselective Pd-catalyzed C-C coupling. This synergistic dual-catalysis allowed for the library synthesis of D-A and A-A CPs from acceptor C-H monomers and aryl halide monomers at low temperatures (25-70 °C) in sustainable solvents such as <i>p</i>-cymene. Interestingly, the D-A CPs obtained via Pd/Ag DArP displayed higher structural regularity and crystallinity, eventually outperforming those prepared by conventional synthetic methods in device performances of ambipolar organic field-effect transistors (μ<sub>e</sub> up to 0.80 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor inverters (gain up to 102).
40163317	Are There High-Density Deep States in an Atomic-Layer-Deposited Indium-Gallium-Zinc Oxide Thin Film?	It has been well recognized that high-density deep states exist in indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) thin films. Many of the device characteristics of IGZO transistors, such as negative bias illumination stability (NBIS), are understood to be related to these deep states. However, in this work, it was found that the deep-state density (<i>N</i><sub>tD</sub>) of atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) IGZO transistors can be an ultralow value (<2.3 × 10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>) by the proposed NBIS-free light-assisted <i>I</i>-<i>V</i> measurements so that the deep states do not affect the <i>I</i>-<i>V</i> characteristics even in the subthreshold region. This work also reveals that NBIS is not related to the photoexcitation of electrons in the deep states. Our results suggest that the existence of deep states and the impact of deep states on ALD IGZO transistors may need to be revisited.
40163039	Tunable Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Crystal Order in Spin-Splitting Antiferromagnets.	The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect provides dissipationless channels for spin transport, which is highly expected for low-power quantum computation. Spin-splitting bands are vital for the QAH effect in topological systems, with ferromagnetism indispensable to manipulate the Chern number. Crystal-order-dependent QAH effects in spin-splitting antiferromagnets are proposed here. Since the spin splitting of these antiferromagnets originates from the alternate crystal environment, the Chern number can be modulated by the crystal order, opening an additional dimension for tuning the QAH effect. Our concept is illustrated by two-dimensional (2D) MnBi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>4</sub> (MBT) with even septuple layers, typical axion insulators with fully magnetic compensation. By interlayer rotation and translation operations, sublattices of MBT with opposite magnetizations are no longer connected by inversion or mirror symmetries, leading to the transition to QAH insulators. Flexible stacking of 2D materials enables a reversible Chern number by crystal design. Our findings would advance QAH effect-based devices toward high controllability, integration density, and operation speed.
40163025	Improved Hysteresis of High-Performance p-Type WSe<sub>2</sub> Transistors with Native Oxide WO<sub><i>x</i></sub> Interfacial Layer.	Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors like transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great promise as new channel materials for next-generation electronic devices. However, their practical implementation is hampered by the lack of suitable gate dielectrics and interfaces that minimize interface and oxide traps. Here, we introduce a novel strategy to improve the dielectric interface of tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) p-type field-effect transistors (p-FETs) by integrating a native oxide, tungsten oxide (WO<sub><i>x</i></sub>), as an interlayer into a high-κ hafnium dioxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>) back gate stack. The WO<sub><i>x</i></sub> interlayer serves as both a doping layer to adjust the threshold voltage (<i>V</i><sub>TH</sub>) and an interfacial layer to improve the WSe<sub>2</sub>-HfO<sub>2</sub> interface. The subthreshold swing (SS) in long-channel p-FETs with this gate stack can achieve a near-ideal value (∼68 mV/dec), and hysteresis improves significantly within a 6 V gate sweep range. This work establishes a pathway for high-κ dielectric integration in high-performance 2D electronics.
40163022	Localized Charge Doping in Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors via Metal Subnanocluster Absorption.	A semiconducting carbon nanotube (CNT) has been considered as a promising channel material for high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) in the post-Moore era. The significant ungated resistance in the gate extension region reduces the maximum current (<i>I</i><sub>max</sub>) and limits the scaling process of CNTFETs. Here, we systematically report charge-doping strategies by designing metal subnanocluster absorption onto CNTs. When density functional theory simulations were combined with experimental synthesis and measurements, it was found that Pd subnanoclusters are well-suited for p-type doping and Sc and Y are more effective for n-type doping in CNTFETs. The former maintains an average saturated <i>I</i><sub>max</sub> of 1410 μA/μm and an average peak transconductance (<i>g</i><sub>m</sub>) of 597 μS/μm in 200-nm-<i>L</i><sub>ch</sub> CNTFET. Our work demonstrated the availability of using metal subnanoclusters for polarity-controlled localized doping in the gate extension region for short-channel CNTFETs or similar low-dimensional semiconductors.
40163021	Outcompeting Thermodynamics: Ion-Pairing and Coulombic Interactions to Trigger Perfluoroacetate Intra-Ionic Photooxidation for Perfluoroalkylation Reactions.	Trifluoromethylation is a key transformation in drug and agrochemical synthesis, yet current reagents often suffer from high cost, low atom economy, and low scalability. Trifluoroacetate derivatives represent ideal reagents as they are highly abundant and cheap, but their very positive one electron oxidation potential (∼2.3 V vs NHE) often hampers their widespread use in photoredox catalysis. Indeed, at these potentials, selectively oxidizing trifluoroacetate over reaction solvent or partner substrates becomes challenging. Herein, we present a novel approach that circumvents these limitations through the use of a pentacationic Ir(III) photosensitizer that forms a strong 1:1 ion-pair with trifluoroacetate in acetonitrile (<i>K</i><sub>eq</sub> = 6 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>). This ion-pair formation enables rapid and efficient photooxidation of trifluoroacetate in ∼90 ps without significant solvent or partner substrate oxidation, as indicated by femtosecond and nanosecond UV-visible transient absorption spectroscopy. The CF<sub>3</sub><sup>•</sup> radicals so generated are shown to trifluoromethylate a range of partner substrates, including aromatic compounds, heterocycles, natural products and pharmaceutically relevant products, in moderate yields (20-60%). Control experiments reveal that ion-pairing is crucial for the successful generation of CF<sub>3</sub><sup>•</sup> as photosensitizers that oxidize trifluoroacetate without forming ion pairs were ineffective for trifluoromethylation. This probably originates from the more thermodynamically accessible substrate oxidation outcompeting diffusional trifluoroacetate oxidation. The reaction was further exemplified to allow functionalization with a variety of perfluoroalkyl groups of different chain lengths. The approach reported herein could also be used for the removal and/or use of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often called "forever chemicals", that have recently raised environmental and health concern.
40163016	Broadband Full Polarization Control Using a Staggered Arrangement of Metamolecules.	Metasurfaces show an extraordinary ability for polarization control, despite the limitations imposed by their working bandwidth and complex meta-atom designs. Here, we present a strategy for generating arbitrary polarization in the broadband, relying solely on the Pancharatnam-Berry phase. The proposed metasurface design comprises two metamolecules arranged in a staggered configuration. Importantly, the orientation of the two metamolecules provides a new degree of freedom to control both the amplitude and phase of right- and left-circular polarization components. We experimentally demonstrated that the polarization of the scattered light can cover the entire Poincaré sphere by merely tuning the metamolecule orientation. These results provide a unique approach for fabricating ultracompact photonic devices and integrated quantum optical systems.
40162988	Redox Studies of the Scandium Metallocene (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>2</sub><sup>t</sup>Bu<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>II</sup> Lead to a Terminal Side-On (N═N)<sup>2-</sup> Complex: [(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>2</sub><sup>t</sup>Bu<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>III</sup>(η<sup>2</sup>-N<sub>2</sub>)]<sup></sup>.	Cyclic voltammetry measurements on the scandium(II) metallocene, Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>II</sup> (Cp<sup>ttt</sup> = C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>2</sub><sup>t</sup>Bu<sub>3</sub>), reveal a -1.87 V vs Fc<sup>+</sup>/Fc event assigned to the [Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc]<sup>+/0</sup> redox couple and a -3.09 V process assigned to the [Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc]<sup>0/-</sup> redox couple, which are consistent with subsequent chemical studies. Chemical oxidation of Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>II</sup> with AgBPh<sub>4</sub> gives the scandocenium cation salt [Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>III</sup>][BPh<sub>4</sub>], <b>1</b>. The [Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>III</sup>]<sup>+</sup> cation does not coordinate the [BPh<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup> anion or THF solvent; however, one of the methyl groups of a <i>tert</i>-butyl substituent has a close interaction with the Sc(III) ion. Decomposition occurs in the presence of a [<sup>n</sup>Bu<sub>4</sub>N][PF<sub>6</sub>] supporting electrolyte, and chemical studies indicate that <b>1</b> reacts with the [PF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>-</sup> anion by fluoride abstraction to form Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>III</sup>F and PF<sub>5</sub>. Chemical reduction of <b>1</b> to Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>II</sup> proceeds with Cp*<sub>2</sub>Sm<sup>II</sup> and Cp*<sub>2</sub>Co<sup>II</sup> (Cp* = C<sub>5</sub>Me<sub>5</sub>), which is consistent with the measured reduction potentials. Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>II</sup> was not observed to react with N<sub>2</sub>; however, the treatment of Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>II</sup> with KC<sub>8</sub> and 18-crown-6 (crown) under N<sub>2</sub> forms the (N═N)<sup>2-</sup> complex, Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>III</sup>(μ-η<sup>2</sup>:η<sup>2</sup>-N<sub>2</sub>)K(crown), <b>2</b>. The reaction of Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>II</sup> with KC<sub>8</sub> in the presence of 2.2.2-cryptand (crypt) generates [K(crypt)][Cp<sup>ttt</sup><sub>2</sub>Sc<sup>III</sup>(η<sup>2</sup>-N<sub>2</sub>)], <b>3</b>, which is the first isolable complex of any metal with a terminal side-on (N═N)<sup>2-</sup> ligand. These Ln<sup>II</sup>A<sub>2</sub>/M/N<sub>2</sub> reactions (M = alkali metal; (A)<sup>-</sup> = anion) are the Ln(II)/Ln(I) analogs of the previously reported Ln(III)/Ln(II) reactions, Ln<sup>III</sup>A<sub>3</sub>/M/N<sub>2</sub>, in which reduction of Ln(III) complexes generates Ln(II) reactivity to form (N═N)<sup>2-</sup> complexes.
40162964	Tunable Drift-Diffusion Synergy in Suspended Te Nanowires for Multistate Photodetection.	Tuning the interplay between photoconductive (drift-driven) transport and photothermoelectric (diffusion-driven) transport in a single device remains crucial for next-generation optoelectronics and in-sensor computing. Here, we present a suspended tellurium nanowire (Te NW) photodetector that concurrently harnesses and actively balances these two transports using asymmetric (local) or symmetric (flood) illumination in tandem with a bias voltage. This enables on-demand transitions from diffusion-dominated to drift-dominated photoresponses at room temperature, a feat not realized in prior Te-based detectors. Under zero bias with local illumination, robust photothermoelectric diffusion yields positive or negative photocurrents, with a responsivity <i>R</i><sub>i</sub> of 124.28 A/W and specific detectivity (<i>D</i>*) of 7.80 × 10<sup>11</sup> Jones. Conversely, flood illumination under finite bias triggers photoconductive drift, with a peak responsivity <i>R</i><sub>i</sub> of 65.03-68.79 A/W and <i>D</i>* of 7.99 × 10<sup>10</sup>-8.47 × 10<sup>10</sup> Jones. By programming the illumination and bias conditions, we realize positive, negative, or zero photocurrent states, forming a three-mode response platform. Remarkably, the device exhibits a sub-100 μs response time and retains stable detection under ambient conditions, illustrating its viability for real-world applications. This work establishes a versatile blueprint for broadband, multistate photodetection toward in-sensor computing tasks.
40162909	The Role of Protons in CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction on Gold under Acidic Conditions.	Carbonate formation constitutes a major obstacle in the electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR), restricting the industrial implementation of this reaction. Even when adopting mild acidic electrolytes, carbonate formation is still observed. The fundamental reason lies in the inevitable OH<sup>-</sup> generation when H<sub>2</sub>O is the proton donor, leading to subsequent carbonate formation. Thus, exploring the reaction pathway of the CO<sub>2</sub>RR in the acid, especially if a proton can directly participate in the reaction, is critical. Herein, we employed a rotating ring-disk electrode and surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy to investigate the electrode process of the CO<sub>2</sub>RR in acid. A pH-dependent behavior of CO<sub>2</sub>RR is observed, indicating proton acting as the reactant in the RDS, originating from the early onset of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption under locally acidic conditions.
40162870	3D Imaging Reveals Widespread Stacking Disorder in Single Crystal 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks.	Although tailored porosity is a defining feature of layered, two-dimensional (2D) polymers known as 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), understanding the interplanar stacking of 2D COFs and their resulting three-dimensional (3D) pore structure remains challenging. Here, we use scanning transmission electron microscopy and ptychography, an emerging 3D angstrom-scale imaging method, to study single-crystalline particles of the imine-linked 2D COF TAPB-DMPDA. Previously assumed to adopt an average-eclipsed structure with only angstrom-level stacking disorder, we find the crystals contain widespread stacking disorder of larger magnitudes, including interplanar shifts up to a half unit cell and nanoscale inhomogeneities in stacking and tilt. 3D visualizations show pore channels are distorted by this stacking disorder. The extensive stacking disorder found in even high-quality 2D COFs has profound implications for envisioned applications and should motivate the development of design strategies to control their 3D structures.
40162862	Synergistic Interfacial Dipole and π-Conjugation Effects Enable Efficient Tin Perovskite Solar Cells.	Tin perovskites are considered promising candidates for realizing high-performance, lead-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Despite prominent progress made through bulk optimization, unsatisfactory interfaces between tin perovskite and charge transport layers are critical obstacles to boosting device performance. Herein, we address this issue by introducing piperazine dihydroiodide (PDI) and ferrocene (Fc) at the interface of tin perovskite/C<sub>60</sub> to synergistically improve the interfacial charge transport. Specifically, PD<sup>+</sup> interacts with formamidinium ions (FA<sup>+</sup>) to form an interfacial dipole, and Fc establishes π-π conjugation with C<sub>60</sub>. These effects significantly improve electron extraction at the tin perovskite/C<sub>60</sub> interface and reduce energy losses. As a result, the efficiency of tin PSCs is remarkably improved from 10.62% to 13.65%, accompanied by enhanced stability. This work highlights the importance of interfacial modulation in tin PSCs toward realizing efficient and eco-friendly perovskite photovoltaics.
40162743	Polarization Rearrangement Induced High-Efficiency Piezocatalytic Overall Pure Water Splitting in Ultrathin (001)-Confined PbTiO<sub>3</sub>.	Facing the emergencies of global warming and energy shortages, nano ferroelectrics, which exhibit superior charge separation capabilities and polarization tunability, are extensively utilized in piezocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> production. However, acquiring polarized structures that behave with robust ferroelectricity and strong piezoelectricity in ultralow dimension nanomaterials for efficient piezocatalysis remains a huge challenge. This research achieved exceptional piezocatalytic overall pure water splitting performance in 3.5 nm-thick (001)-confined PbTiO<sub>3</sub> nanosheets, reaching a H<sub>2</sub> evolution rate of 1068 μmol g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, exceeding those of similar ferroelectric oxides. The highly confined crystallographic polarization orientation in nanosheets induced polarization rearrangement from the <i>c</i>-axis to other nonpolarized crystallographic orientations, as evidenced by piezoelectric force microscopy and phase field simulations, which improve piezoelectricity and boost piezocatalytic behavior significantly. Local structure investigations jointly by neutron pair distribution function, X-ray absorption spectrum, and atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy methods show that the rearranged structure arises from the lattice inhomogeneous tensile strain. TiO<sub>6</sub> octahedrons were distorted, with the Ti atom moving diagonally toward the symmetry center. Such ferroelectric reconstruction of a practical nanopolarized structure with remarkable performance in this work will promote the development of high-performance nano ferroelectrics.
40162740	Recent Advancement in Ferroic Freestanding Oxide Nanomembranes.	Ferroic and multiferroic oxides have been of significant interest for the last four decades due to their tremendous potential for next-generation memory and computational technologies. Possessing multiple ferroic orders with strong coupling between them erects a new way toward fast and low voltage switching. The major challenge is the scarcity of multiferroic materials at room temperature operation with a high coupling strength and robust ferroic orderings. Integration of existing multiferroics, mostly complex oxides, into the silicon-based platform also poses a major challenge. The recent development of freestanding oxide membranes offers a versatile solution for new and novel strategies to develop new materials. In this mini-review, we summarize the significant developments that happened in very recent years with ferroic oxide nanomembranes. We outline different approaches that have been implemented in the freestanding membranes to modulate the ferroic orderings, magnetism, ferroelectricity, and ferroelasticity. Along with the well-developed methods, such as bending and stretching of the membranes, we also emphasize the strength of twisting as a promising way to design and tune novel multiferroic orderings.

40162716	Exfoliating from high-pressure arsenic-nitrogen compounds: an efficient way to obtain 2D-AsN.	AsN compounds show potential for optoelectronic applications and are considered promising candidates for solar cell materials. Here, new arsenic-nitrogen compounds (<i>i.e.</i>, AsN, As<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>, AsN<sub>3</sub>) have been identified under pressure by first-principles calculations. We find that the cubic phase of reported AsN compounds transforms into the newly discovered layered <i>Cmc</i>2<sub>1</sub> phase at 19 GPa and then transitions to the <i>Pnma</i> phase at 63 GPa. Both layered structures are semiconductors and exhibit dynamic and mechanical stability at 0 GPa, suggesting potential for quenching to ambient pressure. Furthermore, two-dimensional AsN with a structure similar to black phosphorus is proposed to have excellent multifunctionality; however, it has not yet been synthesized. We propose a method to exfoliate monolayer AsN from a layered structure and find that the exfoliation energies of AsN compounds are at least 1 meV Å<sup>-2</sup> lower than those of graphene and phosphorene. These findings shed light on the formation conditions and properties of AsN compounds and provide valuable insights for future experimental synthesis.
40162707	Reduction by Oxidation: Selective Hydrodehalogenation of Aryl Halides by Mediated Oxalate Oxidation.	Electro-organic reduction reactions are canonically carried out at a cathode at which a significant negative potential is applied. Specifically, at carbon electrodes, aryl bromides and chlorides undergo heterogeneous reduction in organic solvents at potentials more negative than -2 V vs <i>E</i><sup>0'</sup> for the Fc/Fc<sup>+</sup> couple (Fc = ferrocene). To decrease the overpotential for reduction reactions, homogeneous or heterogeneous electrocatalysis strategies are often employed. Here, we present an electrochemical method to reduce aryl bromides and chlorides that is initiated by an oxidation reaction at very mild potentials (∼0 V vs Fc/Fc<sup>+</sup>). Specifically, electrochemical oxidation of an outer-sphere redox mediator, 1,1-dimethylferrocene, in dry <i>N,N</i>-dimethylformamide (DMF) containing oxalate (C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), results in the homogeneous one-electron oxidation of C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The resulting C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>•-</sup> decomposes in ∼1 μs to release the carbon dioxide radical anion (CO<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>), a potent reductant that is oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> at -2.68 V vs Fc/Fc<sup>+</sup>. In this way, an oxidation reaction at low electrode potentials enables homogeneous reduction of aryl bromides and chlorides, which are otherwise directly reduced at very negative potentials. Using this method, selective hydrodehalogenations of electron-deficient aryl bromides and chlorides are carried out at a reticulated vitreous carbon anode with up to quantitative conversion yields. Cyclic voltammetry and finite difference simulations are used to characterize the hydrodehalogenation of 4-bromobenzonitrile via C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> oxidation. Additionally, we show that the efficiency of hydrodehalogenation is tuned by deliberate additions of water to DMF solutions, leading to a substantial improvement in overall conversion yields without interference from water or proton reduction.
40162701	Interactions of lycopene with β-cyclodextrins: Raman spectroscopy and theoretical investigation.	Carotenoids (Cars) are essential molecules with diverse biological roles, and their solubility can be enhanced by forming complexes with cyclodextrins, which incorporate them into their cavities without chemical bonds. In this study, we investigated the interactions of lycopene with β-cyclodextrins using Raman spectroscopy, molecular dynamics and DFT. We simulated models of simplified structures, including various β-cyclodextrins and <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> lycopene configurations, to better understand how structural changes influence the <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> band shift observed in Raman spectroscopy. Our focus was on reducing interactions such as van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic effects to isolate the impact of structural alterations on the methyl group in carotenoids. We measured solid lycopene and its complexes with β-cyclodextrins, which exhibited Raman <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> shifts. According to the modelling data, this can be attributed to the monomer band of lycopene.
40162551	Aggregation-enhanced TADF in deep-red emitters for high-performance OLEDs.	When isolated molecules undergo aggregation, their intermolecular interactions increase, potentially altering their electronic structures and affecting photophysical properties such as fluorescence lifetime. The extent of this change largely depends on the molecular structure. For thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials, their luminescence mechanism in terms of the scale of increased lifetime from single molecules to aggregates and how that influences their optoelectronic device performance remain largely unexplored. In this study, we report a series of deep-red TADF emitters that are designed from D-A and D<sub>2</sub>-A types of molecular structures, with quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (QCN) as the electron acceptor (A) and naphthalene-substituted <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-diphenylamine (ND) as the electron donor (D). The D<sub>2</sub>-A type emitter (αND)2-QCN exhibits a pronounced aggregation-enhanced TADF (AE-TADF) effect compared to the D-A type emitters. This enhancement results from a significant reduction in the singlet-triplet energy gap (Δ<i>E</i><sub>ST</sub>) upon aggregation, driven by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in their J-aggregates. The AE-TADF effect facilitates more efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), enabling the high performance of an (αND)2-QCN-based deep-red OLED (<i>λ</i><sub>EL,max</sub> = 622 nm) with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE<sub>max</sub>) of 14.3%.
40162528	<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> Utilizes Decarboxylated <i>S</i>-Adenosylmethionine for the Biosynthesis of Tandem Aminopropylated Microcin C, a Potent Inhibitor of Bacterial Aspartyl-tRNA Synthetase.	The biosynthetic pathways of natural products involve unusual biochemical reactions catalyzed by unique enzymes. Aminopropylation, although apparently simple, is an extremely rare modification outside polyamine biosynthesis. The canonical pathway used in the biosynthesis of peptide-adenylate antibiotic microcin C of <i>E. coli</i> (<i>Eco</i>-McC) entails alkylation by the <i>S</i>-adenosyl-methionine-derived 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group of the adenylate moiety and subsequent decarboxylation to yield the bioactive aminopropylated compound. Here, we report the structure and biosynthesis of a new member of the microcin C family of antibiotics, <i>Bsu</i>-McC, produced by <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> MG27, which employs an alternative aminopropylation pathway. Like <i>Eco</i>-McC, <i>Bsu</i>-McC consists of a peptide moiety that facilitates prodrug import into susceptible bacteria and a warhead, a nonhydrolyzable modified isoasparaginyl-adenylate, which, when released into the cytoplasm, binds aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) inhibiting translation. In contrast to the <i>Eco</i>-McC, whose warhead carries a single aminopropyl group attached to the phosphate moiety of isoasparaginyl-adenylate, the warhead of <i>Bsu</i>-McC is decorated with a tandem of two aminopropyl groups. Our <i>in silico</i> docking of the <i>Bsu</i>-McC warhead to the AspRS-tRNA complex suggests that two aminopropyl groups form extended interactions with the enzyme and tRNA, stabilizing the enzyme-inhibitor complex. We show that tandem aminopropylation results in a 32-fold increase in the biological activity of peptidyl-adenylate. We also show that <i>B. subtilis</i> adopted an alternative pathway for aminopropylation in which two homologous 3-aminopropyltransferases utilize decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine as a substrate. Additionally, <i>Bsu</i>-McC biosynthesis alters the social behavior of the <i>B. subtilis</i> producer strain, resulting in a sharp decrease in their ability to form biofilms.
40162500	Super strain enhanced thermal conductivity of monolayer aluminum/gallium nitride (Al<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>N) alloys.	The Al<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>N alloys play a crucial role as buffer layers in next-generation power electronic devices, where thermal transport is of great significance to performance stability and reliability. Typically, the Al<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>N alloys are often subjected to stress, stemming from various factors such as material preparation processes, temperature fluctuations during device operation, and external mechanical forces. Nevertheless, how to regulate stress and the impact of stress on the thermal transport properties of Al<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>N alloys remain unclear. In this paper, based on state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we investigate the strain-regulated thermal transport properties of the monolayer Al<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>N alloys. Under tensile strain, the thermal conductivity of Al<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>N first increases and then decreases with increasing strain, presenting a non-monotonic behavior. The most significant enhancement of the thermal conductivity emerges in Al<sub>0.5</sub>Ga<sub>0.5</sub>N, where more than 20 times the pristine value is achieved at 10% strain. The fundamental mechanism underlying this anomalous response to strain of the thermal conductivity is traced back to the presence of lone pair electrons around the nitrogen atoms in Al<sub><i>x</i></sub>Ga<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>N. The interactions between the lone pair of electrons and the bonding electrons decrease with increasing strain, which gives rise to weakened phonon anharmonicity and super enhanced thermal conductivity. The findings revealed in this study indicate future directions for the efficient regulation of the thermal conductivity of advanced thermal functional materials and high-performance thermal management in electronics.
40162478	Site-Specific <i>O</i>-Glycosylation in Oncofetal Fibronectin IIICS Domain Creates Cancer Stage-Specific Biomarkers.	Despite the pathological importance of oncofetal fibronectin isoforms associated with cancer cell progression and metastasis, our understanding of the structural and molecular details that occurred in this abundant and ubiquitous extracellular matrix component remains largely unknown. Here, we communicate that site-specific <i>O</i>-glycosylation in the oncofetal fibronectin creates cancer stage-specific serum biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by quantitative MS-based glycoproteomic approach. Selective reaction monitoring (SRM) using a structure-defined synthetic glycopeptide library enabled absolute quantitation of the targeted label-free tryptic fragments bearing cancer-relevant <i>O</i>-glycans derived from the type III homology connective segment (IIICS) domain of the oncofetal fibronectin (onfFN) in the sera of HCC patients and healthy controls. We found site-specific <i>O</i>-glycoform alteration from T/sialyl T antigens to Tn/sialyl Tn antigens at the consecutive threonine residues <sup>2155</sup>Thr-Thr-Ala<sup>2157</sup> within this fragment during cancer progression. Surprisingly, this dynamic glycoform alteration is observed specifically in the patient sera diagnosed newly as stage 2-4 groups not in the normal control and stage 1 patient groups. Our results provide compelling evidence that site-specific glycoform changes observed in the onfFN IIICS domain during the tumor proliferation elaborate new class cancer stage-relevant "dynamic epitopes" as highly potential cancer diagnostic and therapeutic targets.
40160172	Exploiting Spintronics at Room Temperature for Long-Wave Infrared Nanophotonic Digital Bolometers.	Digital detectors that "click" such as avalanche diodes and superconducting nanowire sensors are widely used in visible and near-infrared frequencies within the fields of quantum communications, imaging and metrology. On the other hand, the vast field of infrared bolometry has been dominated by analog detectors barring a few examples which require extremely challenging low temperature environments. Here, we propose and demonstrate a nanophotonic bolometer designed by engineering spintronic materials and dimensions to provide "clicks" from thermally activated transitions between two discrete magnetization states. We demonstrate that this nanophotonic bolometer is capable of high readout speeds of 91.6 MHz, which is faster than commercial vanadium dioxide detectors, and a noise equivalent temperature difference of ∼103 mK at 25 Hz. Further improvements to optical and thermal coupling are expected to push the sensitivity beyond even state-of-the-art cooled imagers paving the way for a new class of high-speed room temperature infrared sensors.
40160152	Evaluating the preferential adsorption of N<sub>2</sub> from a binary mixture of N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> on extra-framework cations of zeolites: a computational and experimental study.	Separation of N<sub>2</sub> from a N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> gas mixture is critical for various industrial/medical applications. Temperature/pressure swing adsorption is the top-notch industrial technology used for this separation, where zeolites are the materials used for adsorption. Zeolite X/Y with Li<sup>+</sup> as an extra-framework cation is the best-known sorbent for N<sub>2</sub> gas molecules. However, the present net zero emission scenario has made lithium a critical element, making it imperative to implement its alternative in various other technologies. In this context, the present work is a computational evaluation to identify a cation that can replace Li<sup>+</sup> for preferential adsorption of N<sub>2</sub> over O<sub>2</sub>. The DFT study, based on parameters such as selective adsorption energies of N<sub>2</sub> over O<sub>2</sub> and IR stretching frequencies of the adsorbed N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> molecules, identifies Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> as potential cations. These cations have preferential adsorption for N<sub>2</sub> over O<sub>2</sub> by 10 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> or more. However, BOMD simulations reveal that only Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> keep the N<sub>2</sub> molecule bound at 300 K and the O<sub>2</sub> molecule gets desorbed from these frameworks. The desorption temperature of N<sub>2</sub> on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> is 350 K and on Mg<sup>2+</sup> is 400 K. These observations are corroborated by electronic charges on cations and molecular orbitals. Significantly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is identified to adsorb up to 2 N<sub>2</sub> molecules, making it an ideal candidate for N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> separation in place of Li<sup>+</sup>. To validate this, we have carried out an experimental study that showed a good N<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity of 2.1 mmol g<sup>-1</sup> for Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
40160134	Guest molecule dynamics and ferroelectric transition in a clathrate compound.	Low molecular weight glass formers encapsulated within clathrate structures offer a singular testground to study the intricate interplay of confined molecular motion and ferroelectric properties. Using broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS), we investigate the dynamic behavior of 1-propyl-1<i>H</i>-imidazole within a supramolecular enclosure formed by duad semicage <i>p-tert</i>-butylcalix[4]arene. Unlike the bulk liquid, where the dielectric spectrum is dominated by the structural relaxation, the clathrates paraelectric phase reveals two distinct molecular relaxation processes. Aided by quantum chemical calculations, the slow process is assigned to head-to-tail reorientations of the guest molecule, while the faster process arises from intramolecular fluctuations of the imidazole ring. These dynamics freeze as the system transitions to the ferroelectric state <i>via</i> a second-order phase change that has been characterized by photopyroelectric calorimetry.
40160130	Influence of substitution patterns on isomer preference in 1 : 1 chromone-methanol complexes.	The cluster formed by chromone and methanol serves as an excellent model for studying the various contributions to intermolecular interaction energy. The asymmetric ketone motif of chromone provides distinct hydrogen-bonding sites, enabling differentiation between an "inside" and an "outside" isomer using infrared spectroscopy. We employ DFT simulations to assess how functional groups influence the balance between the two isomers and to identify derivatives that switch their isomer preference upon electronic excitation. We identify three mono-substituted and four doubly substituted chromone derivatives that meet these criteria. Additionally, the contributions to intermolecular interactions are examined using the local energy decomposition method.
40160125	Oxidation-resilient superconductivity in a novel high-hardness superconductor: a first-principles study.	Niobium nitride (NbN) is a crucial superconducting material that has been extensively studied and utilized. Enhancing the working temperature and environmental stability of devices fabricated from this material is a significant research focus. In this study, we employed first-principles computational methods to comprehensively investigate the superconducting, mechanical, and electronic properties of CsCl-type NbN. Our results reveal that this type of superconducting material exhibits a high superconducting transition temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) of up to 16 K along with exceptional hardness. Under high pressure conditions, the phonons undergo gradual hardening, leading to a decrease of <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>. However, when oxidized, its superconductivity not only persists but also there is even an increase of <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>. This phenomenon is attributed to the electron doping effect caused by oxygen substitution for nitrogen, which shifts the Fermi level closer to the van Hove singularity. Our findings present a promising candidate for further experimental exploration.
40160096	Biocatalytic Preparation of High-Purity DHA-Enriched Partial Glycerides through Semirational Design and Modification of Lipase Lip1897.	High-purity docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) partial glycerides (PG) supplements have promising market prospects. In this study, a novel lipolytic enzyme family I lipase Lip1897, derived from <i>Streptomyces thermodiastaticus</i>, was identified and modified to be applied to the enzymatic synthesis of high-purity docosahexaenoic acid partial glycerides (DHA-PG). Lip1897 displayed optimal activity and good stability at 55 °C and pH 5.0. Further study found that Lip1897 could catalyze the hydrolysis of DHA triglycerides (TG) and DHA ethyl esters (EE), the esterification of DHA, and the glycerolysis of docosahexaenoic acid ethyl esters (DHA-EE), which had good prospects for industrial application. To enhance the catalytic selectivity of Lip1897, semirational design and modification based on structural analysis were carried out, and the mutant Lip1897-H106W showed a 1.86-fold increase in glycerolysis activity. The molecular docking results indicated that the mutant bound to the substrate DHA-EE at lower energy and with a more stable conformation. Under the solvent-free system, Lip1897-H106W was employed to catalyze the glycerolysis of DHA-EE for the synthesis of DHA-PG, achieving a promising DHA-EE conversion rate of 95.02% and a high DHA-PG yield of 70.85%. The efficient glycerolysis for preparing high-purity DHA-PG was realized. This research provides a reference for enhancing the efficiency of specific configurational functional lipid biosynthesis through enzyme discovery and modification.
40160017	Within-person dynamics of attention to race and expression of race bias: a real-time test of the self-regulation of prejudice model.	Prior research has supported some aspects of a theorized prejudice self-regulation model. We provide the first test of the full model-based process of bias regulation as it unfolds in real time. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from White undergraduates at two large American universities (N = 130; 40% female) during a racial stereotype priming task. Attention to Black male face primes, indexed by the P2 ERP, increased following self-regulation failures. In turn, within-person, trial-to-trial variability in attention to Black male faces predicted variability in bias expression. The latter effect was moderated by individual differences in internal motivation to respond without prejudice (IMS). Specifically, among lower-IMS individuals, trials in which Black faces elicited relatively larger P2 amplitudes (relative to an individual's own average P2 amplitude) were associated with increased behavioral race bias. In contrast, and consistent with theory, among higher-IMS individuals trials in which Black faces elicited larger relative P2 amplitudes were associated with decreased bias. Findings provide direct evidence supporting the temporal sequencing of race-bias regulation and identify within-person variability in attention to race as a potential mechanism for determining when and in whom bias will be regulated.
40160003	Harnessing CNC-Carrier Nanomaterials for Enhanced Zn<sup>2+</sup>-Mediated Inhibition of Oomycete Asexual Reproduction.	Oomycetes are devastating plant pathogens causing major crop losses, with spores as key infection sources. Inhibiting asexual reproduction, especially sporangium formation and spore release, is crucial for disease prevention. Zn<sup>2+</sup> has shown potential in inhibiting oomycete reproduction, but excessive concentrations can cause cytotoxicity and environmental risks. To address this, we used polydopamine (PDA) to complex Zn<sup>2+</sup> and form a PDA@Zn<sup>2+</sup> coating on cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) through hydrogen bonding. This ionic nanopesticide (CNC@PDA@Zn<sup>2+</sup>) enhances effectiveness against oomycetes while reducing dosage and improving biosafety. Bioexperimental results indicate that CNC@PDA@Zn<sup>2+</sup> significantly inhibits sporangium formation and spore release from <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> (<i>P. capsici</i>) by suppressing the expression of key sporulation genes (<i>PcATP4</i>, <i>cdc,</i> and <i>G-protein</i>), disrupting spore cell membranes, and altering organelle structures. <i>In vivo</i>, it reduces <i>P. capsici</i> infection on pepper leaves, even in the presence of mycelium. This study highlights CNC@PDA@Zn<sup>2+</sup> as a promising biobased nanomaterial for sustainable crop protection.
40159786	Modeling the subsurface adsorption of atomic oxygen in silver from high vacuum to high pressure.	Coadsorption of atoms or molecules on a solid can modulate adsorption energies, adsorbate geometries, surface reconstructions, and surface reactions. Interactions between atomic adsorbates at higher coverages can even promote percolation of some atoms beneath the surface into the subsurface or deeper into the bulk of the solid. The evolution of surface phenomena and the emergence of subsurface adsorption with increasing coadsorption effects are less understood at the atomic level due to the experimental and theoretical challenges of studying larger surface coverages. Yet, important practical applications, such as metal oxidation, corrosion, and industrial heterogeneous catalysis occur at high adsorbate concentrations and require a fundamental understanding of adsorption and reactivity over a wide range of coverages. Here, we develop an all-site, <i>ab initio</i>, lattice-gas model that describes surface and subsurface adsorption in a crystalline solid and apply it to study the adsorption of atomic oxygen on the Ag(111) surface at varying oxygen concentrations and O<sub>2</sub> pressures ranging from high vacuum to high pressure. The coadsorbate interactions in the model are treated in a pairwise manner and all parameters of the model are calculated using density functional theory. This study demonstrates that three-dimensional lattice-gas models can be powerful theoretical tools to predict the conditions for subsurface adsorption and elucidate the underlying inter-adsorbate interactions.
40159642	3D Mass Spectrometry Imaging as a Novel Screening Method for Evaluating Biocontrol Agents.	The aim of this study was to evaluate innovative mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) for determining the metabolic potential of selected soil bacteria from the genera <i>Bacillus</i> and <i>Priestia</i> in the presence of the phytopathogen <i>Fusarium</i>. This research marks the first application of direct 3D MSI that to visualize interactions between potential biocontrol agents and plant pathogens on agar medium. The LARAPPI/CI-3D-MSI (Laser-Assisted Remote Atmospheric Pressure Imaging/Chemical Ionization-3D Mass Spectrometry Imaging) setup provided valuable insights into the compounds produced by the tested microorganisms, revealing their spatial distributions and their ability to diffuse into the agar medium. Subsequently, a Pathway Impact Analysis of Metabolites was conducted. Ion images based on ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry data were obtained, including for potentially bioactive compounds. Statistical analysis of the entire MS data set showed that the metabolites identified for <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> samples were distinctly separated from the <i>Priestia megaterium</i> samples and could be helpful tools for screening biocontrol strains. The LARAPPI/CI MSI technique offers significant advantages over existing MSI methods. Further research using this technology could help validate the effectiveness of various biopreparations and contribute to enhancing the quality of biological plant protection products available on the market.
40159138	Precision of <i>in</i> <i>Vivo</i> Pesticide Toxicology Research Can Be Promoted by Mass Spectrometry Imaging Technology.	Pesticides are crucial for agricultural production, but their excessive use has become a significant pollution source, leading to increased pesticide residues in the environment and food and posing a threat to human health. <i>In vivo</i> pesticide toxicology research aims to protect humans with detection technology playing a key role. Spatial information plays a crucial role in <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i> pesticide toxicity research. However, current technologies cannot simultaneously analyze the content and spatial information on pesticides <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i>. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) technology can address this limitation by simultaneously analyzing the content and spatial distribution of chemicals <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i> with high sensitivity and efficiency, aiding in the discovery of toxic biomarkers and mechanisms. Nevertheless, the limited application of MSI <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i> pesticide toxicology research hinders the accuracy of such research. Therefore, MSI should be promoted to enhance the accuracy of <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i> pesticide toxicology research.
40159096	Motivation on Intramolecular Through-Space Charge Transfer for the Realization of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF)-Thermally Stimulated Delayed Phosphorescence (TSDP) in C^C^N Gold(III) Complexes and Their Applications in Organic Light-Emitting Devices.	Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and the very recently established thermally stimulated delayed phosphorescence (TSDP) are two promising approaches for enhancing the performance of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). Here, we have developed a new class of through-space charge transfer (TSCT) carbazolylgold(III) C^C^N complexes with unique TADF-TSDP properties by introducing a rigid arylamine on the carbazolyl auxiliary ligand. The highly twisted conformation between the C^C^N and carbazolyl ligands induces strong through-bond ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (TB-LLCT) character in their lowest singlet and triplet excited states, with small singlet-triplet energy gaps for efficient TADF. Moreover, the close spatial proximity between the cyclometalating ligand and the lateral arylamine enables appreciable intramolecular through-space electronic coupling that allows the generation of relatively low-lying triplet through-space ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (<sup>3</sup>TS-LLCT) excited states. The TADF-TSDP properties are verified by temperature-dependent emission, lifetimes, and ultrafast transient absorption studies. Interestingly, through better alignment with extended planarity and the strengthening of the electron-donating ability of the lateral arylamine, the enhanced through-space electronic coupling can effectively perturb the energies of <sup>3</sup>TBCT, <sup>3</sup>TSCT, and intraligand (<sup>3</sup>IL) excited states and thus manipulates the TSDP efficiency. Orange-emitting vacuum-deposited OLEDs made with these gold(III) complexes demonstrate respectable maximum external quantum efficiencies of >10% and long operational half-lifetimes of up to 65,314 h at a luminance of 100 cd m<sup>-2</sup>. This work not only demonstrates the realization of interesting TADF-TSDP and TSCT properties in the gold(III) C^C^N cyclometalated system but also enriches the diversity of molecular design for high-performance TSDP and TSCT emitters.
40159080	A Fresh Twist on the Phospha-(Aza)-Wittig Reaction.	The reactivity of an unsupported phosphinidene oxide, BnArNP═O (Bn = benzyl; Ar = bulky aryl group), as the electrophilic partner in Wittig reactions with ylides is described. Reactions with methylene-triphenylphosphorane (H<sub>2</sub>C═PPh<sub>3</sub>) and ethylidene-triphenyl-phosphorane (HMeC═PPh<sub>3</sub>), proceed as expected, giving rise to the phosphaalkene metathesis products and triphenylphosphine oxide. This reaction can be extended to other ylides such as <i>N</i>-(triphenylphosphoranylidene)methanamine (MeN═PPh<sub>3</sub>), to afford an aminoiminophosphane BnArNP═NMe. In these reactions the phosphinidene oxide plays the role of an electrophile, which would typically be the remit of an organic carbonyl in classical Wittig reactions. Further mechanistic insight into such transformations can be gained by altering the nature of the phosphorus-ylide. Upon reacting BnArNP═O with H<sub>2</sub>C═PMe<sub>3</sub> (which possesses a smaller, more Lewis basic, phosphine) an alternative product is formed. This transformation supports the formation of a betaine intermediate that subsequently undergoes hydrogen-migration to afford an oxidized phosphorus(V) compound related to phosphorus acid.

40156852	Exquisite Complex Reaction Cascade in the Natural 1,2,4-Triazine Assembly.	1,2,4-Triazine ring is a scaffold widely found in biologically active compounds, but how nature makes it remains enigmatic. In this study, we unveil the complex enzymatic and nonenzymatic cascade reactions that assemble the 1,2,4-triazine moiety found in the structures of the natural products pseudoiodinine and toxoflavin. Through biochemical studies, isotope labeling, and the application of substrate analogues, we propose a plausible pathway for the 1,2,4-triazine assembly from a common precursor in riboflavin biosynthesis. This process involves four two-electron oxidation steps, C-N bond formation, decarboxylation, and the N-N bond forming step catalyzed by a metal-dependent WD40-repeat (WDR) protein. This study thus not only provides the first biocatalytic route for the 1,2,4-triazine assembly but also identifies a previously unrecognized catalytic role of a large WDR protein family.
40156837	Synthesis of Two-Dimensional Antiferromagnetic Semiconductor CuFeS<sub>2</sub> with a High Néel Temperature.	Two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductors have garnered significant attention due to their promising applications in spintronics and intriguing magneto-optical performance. However, low Néel temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>N</sub>) and inadequate air stability constrain their application. Here, we report the synthesis of a 2D semiconducting CuFeS<sub>2</sub> (CFS) exhibiting AFM order. It features a high <i>T</i><sub>N</sub> (473.0 ± 0.4 K) and remains stable in air for at least 2 weeks. The semiconductor characteristics are confirmed via electrical measurements. AFM order and a high magnetic phase transition temperature are demonstrated by Raman and second-harmonic generation (SHG) spectra. This work provides a new 2D AFM semiconductor with a high Néel temperature, offering a novel platform for studying unconventional physical phenomena and spintronics.
40156821	Thermally Stable Cellulose-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerators with Ultrahigh Charge Density Enabled by Deep Traps and Multiple Noncovalent Interactions.	Stable high-output for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) in extreme environments is challenged by high charge dissipation rates and friction layer degradation at high temperatures. This study introduces a triboelectric material design that ensures stable high-output at high temperatures through a synergistic approach of multilayer noncovalent bonding and increased surface deep trap density. By grafting sulfonic acid groups onto cellulose and incorporating self-assembled molecules with large energy gaps, we significantly enhance the dielectric's charge storage capacity and reduce charge dissipation by 82%. The modified cellulose exhibits a notable increase in deep trap density and improved mechanical properties through enhanced high-enthalpy states from noncovalent interactions. As a result, TENGs achieve an ultrahigh surface charge density of 152 μC/m<sup>2</sup> at 250 °C. This strategy presents a simple method for constructing TENGs with stabilized electrical output in high-temperature settings, facilitating their use as self-powered sensors in extreme conditions.
40156567	Reactivating Molecular Cobalt Catalysts for Electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> Conversion to Methanol.	Molecular catalysts immobilized on a carbon support have demonstrated electrocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> conversion capabilities distinct from those of metallic surfaces. For instance, cobalt phthalocyanine supported on carbon nanotubes (CoPc/CNT) is capable of selective CO<sub>2</sub>-to-methanol conversion with ∼30% selectivity, which cannot be accomplished by other metal catalysts, such as cobalt, silver, and copper. However, despite its promising methanol selectivity, the CoPc/CNT catalyst exhibits a gradual decrease in the methanol production rate during the electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR). This catalytic instability impedes its practical application, yet little is known about the origin of the activity decay and viable solutions to circumvent it. In this study, we show that the catalytic deactivation is not an irreversible process caused by the chemical degradation of the catalyst and present reactivation strategies to recover the catalytic performance for stable methanol production. We propose that formaldehyde, an intermediate generated during the CO<sub>2</sub>RR, can act as a poisoning species, and its adsorption configuration on the cobalt site can determine the fate of its reaction pathway: carbon-down (*CH<sub>2</sub>O) versus oxygen-down (*OCH<sub>2</sub>) pathways. In contrast to the carbon-down configuration leading to methanol production, the oxygen-down configuration can inhibit its further reduction, poisoning the cobalt active site and causing the deactivation.
40156551	Synthesis of Electron-Deficient BisAzaCoroneneDiimide-Conjugated Polymers by Light-Locking Dynamic Covalent Bonds.	We present a novel light-locked dynamic covalent polymerization methodology to synthesize conjugated polymers based on BisAzaCoroneneDiimides (BACDs). This metal-free process converts reversible poly imines into kinetically locked conjugated polymers using visible light, generating minimal side products. By incorporating aldehyde-functionalized comonomers, the approach enables the creation of diverse n-type semiconducting polymers with tunable optical band gaps and low LUMO levels. The polymers exhibit exceptional thermal, electrochemical, and photostability with strong interchain interactions upon electrochemical reduction observed in solution, attributed to the BACD core. Broad absorption from the visible to the near-infrared range underscores their potential in charge and energy transport applications for organic electronics. This scalable, sustainable strategy unlocks access to a versatile class of n-type diimide polymers.
40156538	Controlling Reaction Pathways of Ethylene Hydroformylation Using Isolated Bimetallic Rhodium-Cobalt Sites.	Designing efficient ligand-free heterogeneous catalysts for ethylene hydroformylation to produce C<sub>3</sub> oxygenates is of importance for both fundamental research and practical applications, but it is often hindered by insufficient catalytic activity and selectivity. This work designs isolated rhodium-cobalt (Rh-Co) sites confined within a ZSM-5 zeolite to enhance ethylene hydroformylation rates and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability. By adjusting the Co/Al ratio in Co-ZSM-5, different sizes of Co are formed; subsequent Rh introduction produces isolated Rh<sub>1</sub>Co<i><sub><i>x</i></sub></i> clusters with different Rh-Co coordination numbers (CNs). In-situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that a Rh-Co CN of 3, corresponding to an isolated Rh<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>3</sub> site, provides optimal bindings to reaction intermediates and thus achieves the highest hydroformylation rates among supported Rh-based catalysts. This study demonstrates the role of coordination-tuning via a secondary metal in effectively controlling the reaction pathway over single Rh atom catalysts.
40155389	Nanofluidic Memristive Transition and Synaptic Emulation in Atomically Thin Pores.	Ionic transport across nanochannels is the basis of communications in living organisms, enlightening neuromorphic nanofluidic iontronics. Comparing to the angstrom-scale long biological ionic pathways, it remains a great challenge to achieve nanofluidic memristors at such thinnest limit due to the ambiguous electrical model and interaction process. Here, we report atomically thin memristive nanopores in two-dimensional materials by designing optimized ionic conductance to decouple the memristive, ohmic, and capacitive effects. By conducting different charged iontronics, we realize the reconfigurable memristive transition between nonvolatile-bipolar and volatile-unipolar characteristics, which arises from distinct transport processes governed by energy barriers. Notably, we emulate synaptic functions with ultralow energy consumption of ∼0.546 pJ per spike and reproduce biological learning behaviors. The memristive nanopores are similar to the biosystems in angstrom structure, rich iontronic responses, and millisecond-level operating pulse width, matching the biological potential width. This work provides a new paradigm for boosting brain-inspired nanofluidic devices.
40155360	Extrinsic and Intrinsic Factors Governing the Electrochemical Oxidation of Propylene in Aqueous Solutions.	The electrochemical synthesis of commodity chemicals such as epoxides and glycols offers a sustainable alternative to conventional methods that involve hazardous chemicals. Efforts to improve the yield and selectivity of propylene oxidation using Pd-based catalysts have been shown to be highly sensitive to applied potential, pH, and electrochemical cell design. Record efficiencies and yields were obtained by substitution of PdO by 4d or 5d transition metals, including Pt, with thus far little rationale regarding the origin for the improvement. Through electrochemical analysis, scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the mechanism of propylene oxidation on Pd-based catalysts. We demonstrate that adsorbates forming on PdO, where Pd adopts a square-planar coordination [PdO<sub>4</sub>], differ from that forming on the surface of oxidized metallic Pd catalysts with an oxo intermediate mediating propylene oxidation on PdO. We further show that Pt substitution in PdO does not modify this oxo intermediate. Varying pH, we found that the onset for propylene oxidation is pH independent, indicating a potential-determining step where the proton is not involved in and similar reaction pathway in acidic and near-neutral conditions. Finally, our work undoubtedly demonstrates that high Faradaic efficiency toward propylene glycol and propylene oxide formation, such as those previously reported in the literature, can be achieved by means of electrode engineering and mastery of mass transport and local pH. Notably, we achieved ≈100% faradaic efficiency for propylene glycol at 1.7 V vs RHE in acidic media using a Pt-substituted PdO catalyst loaded onto a gas diffusion electrode.
40155199	Large Positive Magnetoconductance in Carbon Nanoscrolls.	We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls, spirally wrapped graphene layers with open end points, can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll increases by about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild interturn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about with the emergence of magnetic-field-induced zero-energy modes, specific to rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.
40153947	Magnetic properties and electronic structure ofJeff=12square lattice quantum magnet Bi<sub>2</sub>ErO<sub>4</sub>Cl.	Two-dimensional (2D) rare-earth-based square lattice (SL) quantum magnets provide a pathway to achieve distinctive ground states characterized by unusual excitations. We investigate the magnetic, heat capacity, structural, and electronic properties of a magnetic system Bi<sub>2</sub>ErO<sub>4</sub>Cl. This compound features a structurally ideal 2D SL composed of Er<sup>3+</sup>rare-earth magnetic ions. The single-phase polycrystalline sample was synthesized using hydrothermal, followed by a vacuum-sealed tube technique. The analysis of heat capacity and magnetic data indicates that the Er<sup>3+</sup>ion adopts aJeff=12state at low temperatures. Fitting the Curie-Weiss (CW) law to the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility data reveals a CW temperature of approximately -2.1 K, suggesting antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between the Er<sup>3+</sup>moments. Our first-principles calculations validate a 2D spin model relevant to the titled Er compound. The presence of AFM interaction between the Er<sup>3+</sup>ions is further confirmed using total energy calculations (DFT+<i>U</i>), aligning with the experimental results. The heat capacity measurements reveal the presence of magnetic long-range order below<i>T</i><sub>N</sub>= 0.47 K. The magnetic heat capacity data follows<i>T</i><sup>1.8</sup>power law dependence below<i>T</i><sub>N</sub>.
40153946	A primer on Kitaev model: basic aspects, material realization, and recent experiments.	This elementary review article is aimed to the beginning graduate students interested to know basic aspects of Kitaev model. We begin with a very lucid introduction of Kitaev model and present its exact solution, Hilbert space structure, fractionalization, spin-spin correlation function and topological degeneracy in an elementary way. We then discuss the recent proposal of realizing Kitaev interaction in certain materials. Finally we present some recent experiments done on these materials, mainly magnetization, susceptibility, specific heat and thermal Hall effect to elucidate the recent status of material realization of coveted Kitaev spin-liquid phase. We end with a brief discussion on other theoretical works on Kitaev model from different many-body aspects.
40153943	Topical review: electronic and optical properties of Kekulé and other short wavelength spatial modulated textures of graphene.	A review of the electronic and optical properties of Kekulé and other short wavelength modulations textures on graphene is presented. Starting from the experimental realization of such textures, the review discusses the electronic and optical properties in terms of several theoretical models like the tight-binding Hamiltonian and effective low energy models based on the Dirac equation. Other surveyed subjects are, strain effects, valley engineering, Kekulé bilayers, zitterbewegung, Kekulé interfaces, valley birefringence and the skew valley scattering. Specific signatures in the optical and electronic conductivities of Kekule textures are next discussed using several approaches like linear response theory, the random phase approximation, and Floquet theory. Plasmons are also presented by considering the dielectric function. Finally, a discussion is presented on how Kekulé textures are related with highly correlated phases, including its importance in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene superconductivity and related quantum phases.
40153874	Non-topological solitons and quasi-solitons.	Solitons in relativistic field theories are not necessarily topologically charged. In particular, non-topological solitons-known as Q-balls-arise naturally in nonlinear field theories endowed with attractive interactions and internal symmetries. Even without stabilizing internal symmetries, quasi-solitons known as oscillons, which are long-lived, can also exist. Both Q-balls and oscillons have significant applications in cosmology and particle physics. This review is an updated account of the intriguing properties and dynamics of these non-topological solitons and quasi-solitons, as well as their important roles in early-Universe scenarios and particle physics models.
40153694	Solvent Medium-Induced Changes to Internal Pressure in the Layered Host VOPO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O and the Influence on Intercalation Reactions.	Layered vanadium phosphate dihydrate, VOPO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O, has been chosen as a host for ferrocene intercalation to explore the influence of solvent-guest and solvent-host interactions on rates and product selection. After eliminating solvents that react directly with the VOPO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O host, ferrocene intercalation was evaluated in a series of seven solvents that do not themselves intercalate or otherwise alter the host structure. The intercalation kinetics are analyzed in acetone, butanone, pentanone, acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, and DMF. No intercalation is observed in DMF, but all other solvents yield a mixture of stage 1 and stage 2 ferrocenium intercalation products with reaction rates and product ratios varying across the series of solvents. Using <i>ex situ</i> as well as <i>in situ</i> PXRD methods, faster reactions yield more stage 1 product, while a higher degree of stage 2 product is seen for slower kinetics. The results are interpreted in the context of competition between intercalation rates and the buildup of elastic strain between intercalated domains and unintercalated host. To understand solvent effects, both solvent-guest and solvent-host effects are considered. None of the typically considered solvent-guest effects, such as guest desolvation energy, dielectric constant, and guest oxidation potential, correlate with the observed reaction kinetics. On the other hand, different solvent environments are shown to change the internal pressure, <i>P</i><sub>eff</sub>, within the layered hosts, a consequence of changing surface energy and surface tension (stress) in particles with nanometer scale dimensions. The VOPO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O interlayer spacing decreases when particles are suspended in DMF and organonitrile solvents, while the layers separate slightly in acetone, butanone, and pentanone. Using calculated elastic constants, the structural changes correspond to changes in <i>P</i><sub>eff</sub> in the range 0.22 GPa > Δ<i>P</i><sub>eff</sub> > -0.11 GPa across the series of solvents. A density functional theory analysis of the influence of pressure on ferrocene diffusion adds support for the idea that intercalation kinetics are altered by changing internal pressure. The results show solvent environments can be responsible for altering the effective pressure within intercalation hosts, influencing intercalation rates and product selection, even if the solvents do not react directly with the host solids.
40153602	Titanium Phosphinidene and Phosphide Moieties from Oxidative Phosphorylation and Desilylation.	A unique entry into mononuclear titanium complexes bearing phosphinidene and phosphide ligand moieties is reported. Reaction of [K(crypt)][(PN)<sub>2</sub>TiCl] (<b>1</b>, crypt = 2.2.2-cryptand) with [Na(OCP)] results in [K(crypt)][(PN)<sub>2</sub>Ti(OCP)] (<b>2</b>) and such species can be oxidized to the derivative [(PN)<sub>2</sub>Ti(OCP)] (<b>3</b>), both of which do not undergo decarbonylation. However, the reaction of <b>1</b> and [NaP(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] leads to an unprecedented Ti<sup>III</sup> phosphinidene, [K(crypt)][(PN)<sub>2</sub>Ti═PSiMe<sub>3</sub>] (<b>4</b>), through an oxidative phosphorylation reaction. To promote the formation of a Ti≡P bond, complex <b>4</b> was treated with 0.5 equivalent XeF<sub>2</sub>, resulting in an oxidative desilylation step forming a molecular titanium phosphide complex, [K(crypt)][(PN)<sub>2</sub>Ti≡P] (<b>5</b>), which showed a characteristic downfield chemical shift at 1449.8 pmm in the <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectrum. Complex <b>5</b> can be further functionalized to generate a terminal Ti<sup>IV</sup> phosphinidene, [(PN)<sub>2</sub>Ti═PSiMe<sub>3</sub>] (<b>6</b>), and the latter can be independently accessed through oxidation of <b>4</b>. All new complexes were characterized structurally and as appropriate by multinuclear NMR, CW X-band EPR (for Ti<sup>III</sup>), and HFEPR (for Ti<sup>II</sup>) spectroscopies.
40153570	Unveiling the <i>N</i><i>-</i>Glycomic Diversity of Goat Lactoferrin during Lactation.	Goat lactoferrin is an <i>N-</i>glycoprotein, and its glycan moieties are essential for its biological activity. However, the structures of these glycans, particularly the sialylated isomers with α-2,3- or α-2,6-linkages, remain poorly characterized. Utilizing online hydrophilic liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, our study characterized <i>N-</i>glycans in goat lactoferrin across different lactation stages, and the putative structures of the 86 <i>N-</i>glycans of goat lactoferrin were presented, including 53 previously undetected ones. The content and variety of <i>N-</i>glycans decreased from colostrum to mature milk, with transitional milk exhibiting the highest levels of neutral and high-mannose <i>N-</i>glycans. Colostrum was particularly rich in fucose- and sialylated <i>N-</i>glycans, especially those with α-2,6-linkages. Notably, the α-2,6-linked sialylated <i>N-</i>glycan H5N4F1A1-1 was 7.09-fold and 12.85-fold more abundant in colostrum compared to transitional and mature milk, respectively. These findings provide valuable insights into the structure of lactoferrin and could facilitate the development of functional goat milk products.
40153524	Biosynthetic Investigations of Ulbactins Unveil Two Novel Thiazolinyl Imine Reductases Crucial for the Generation of Siderophore Activity.	Siderophores are ferric ion chelating natural products secreted by microorganisms to survive in an iron-deficient environment. During screening for siderophores from marine bacteria, four interconvertible ulbactins C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> and oxidized derivatives were identified in the bacterium <i>Pseudoalteromonas flavipulchra</i> S16. Iron-ion chelating activity assays revealed that the reduction of thiazoline rings is critical for the activity. The ulbactins biosynthetic gene cluster (<i>ubt</i>) was identified in the genome of <i>P. flavipulchra</i> S16 and validated <i>via</i> gene knockout and heterologous expression. A unique feature of ulbactin biosynthetic machinery involves UbtA, an atypical didomain enzyme (A<sub>Sal</sub>-SalS) converting chorismate to salicyl-AMP. Two novel thiazolinyl imine reductases, UbtL and UbtM, were characterized as being essential for thiazolidine formation. Substitution of the native promoter of the <i>ubt</i> gene cluster with a constitutive promoter yielded new ulbactin variants and intermediate compounds, including unprecedented hydroxylated and dehydroalanine-containing ulbactins. <i>In vitro</i> reconstitution of ulbactins uncovered a distinctive synergistic catalytic mechanism between UbtL and UbtM for heterocycle reduction, which drives structural diversification during ulbactin biosynthesis.
40153363	Multilaboratory Study of a Nontarget Data Acquisition for Target Analysis (nDATA) Workflow Using Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry for the Screening of 1087 Pesticides in Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.	A nontarget Data Acquisition for Target Analysis (nDATA) workflow was developed to screen pesticides in fresh produce based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution full scan mass spectrometry/variable data-independent tandem mass spectrometry acquisition (LC-FS MS/vDIA MSMS) and a pesticide database. The MSMS spectral library was generated to create a database consisting of 1087 pesticides based on authentic pesticide standards. The retention time (±0.5 min), precursor ion (≤± 5 ppm), and product ions (≤± 5 ppm) were extracted for each pesticide from LC-FS MS/data-dependent MSMS acquisition (LC-FS MS/DDA MSMS). Mass accuracy criteria, along with ±0.1 min retention time tolerance, were used for the identification of pesticides. Three laboratories evaluated and validated the nDATA workflow to screen and identify pesticides from produce extracts (apples, bananas, broccoli, carrots, grapes, lettuce, oranges, potatoes, strawberry, and tomatoes) prepared by the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) procedure. Of the 1087 pesticides evaluated, false-positive rates were ≤5% for 977 pesticides in blank matrices and false-negative rates were ≤5% for 921 and 985 pesticides in fortified matrices at 10 and 100 μg/kg, respectively. False positives detected were misidentified pesticides, incurred residues, or contaminants possibly resulting from process or system contamination detected below the threshold level of 10 μg/kg. False negatives were attributed to pesticides that did not sufficiently ionize or fragment or had poor stabilities and QuEChERS extraction efficiencies. Incurred residues in archived produce samples (apple, Chinese broccoli, grape, kale, kohlrabi, orange, pepper, strawberry, tomato, and turnip green) were prepared using QuEChERS, evaluated by the nDATA workflow, and the results were compared and confirmed, if possible, to targeted GC-MS/MS, LC-MS/MS, and LC-FS MS/DDA MSMS methods. The three laboratories identified 25 parent pesticides at levels >10 μg/kg that were consistent with findings from targeted procedures and discovered 10 different metabolites that were not provided in the multiple reaction monitoring method or inclusion list of the targeted procedures. GC-MS/MS identified two pesticides, chlorothalonil and dacthal, and a possible chlorothalonil metabolite, pentachlorobenzonitrile, that were not amenable to LC-low or LC-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis in produce samples. To improve the identification quality, the nDATA workflow further implemented quality control, operational, and processing measures to reduce the number of false detects, and the data evaluation workload. As demonstrated in this study, the validated nDATA workflow creates new opportunities for chemical residues analysis, offering a potential screening complement to targeted LC-MS/MS, GC-MS/MS, and nontargeted methods for pesticides and other contaminants of interest.
40153311	A Systematic Approach for Incorporating Structural Flexibility in High-Throughput Computational Screening of Metal-Organic Frameworks for Xylene Separation.	Separation of xylene isomers poses a significant challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. Currently, zeolites are utilized as adsorbents for this purpose in the chemical industry despite suboptimal separation performance. With tunable pore size and chemical functionality, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents for separation. By virtue of high-throughput computational screening (HTCS), the adsorption performance of a large collection of MOFs can be evaluated <i>in silico</i> by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Unlike prior studies assuming rigid structures of MOFs during screening, we develop a systematic approach for incorporating flexibility in HTCS for xylene separation. First, MOFs are judiciously classified with external flexibility (volume/shape changes) and internal flexibility (intraframework fluctuations), respectively, based on the nature and extent of structural deformation from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Afterward, adsorption in MOFs with external flexibility is simulated by hybrid MC/MD method, the flexible snapshot method is used for MOFs with a sort of internal flexibility, and grand-canonical MC (GCMC) method is employed for MOFs with negligible flexibility. Finally, top-performing MOFs are identified for xylene separation. While substantially reducing computational cost, this study also delivers more reliable results compared to the assumption of rigid structures. The HTCS approach is versatile and can be extended beyond MOFs, offering a robust tool for the virtual screening of other soft-porous materials for a wide range of important applications.

40152883	Microbial Fermentation-Derived Dihydroquercetin Derivatives Exhibit Superior Efficacy in Ameliorating Insulin Resistance via JNK/PI3K/AKT Pathway Regulation Compared to Dihydroquercetin.	Insulin resistance (IR) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by diminished insulin sensitivity, leading to impaired glucose uptake and a potential progression to hyperglycemia and diabetes. While lifestyle modifications are essential, the limitations of current pharmacological interventions highlight the need for natural products with therapeutic benefits. This study introduces two novel dihydroquercetin (DHQ) derivatives, 8-hydroxy-dihydroquercetin (H-DHQ) and dihydroquercetin-7-<i>O</i>-β-d-(4″-<i>O</i>-methyl)-glucoside (DHQ-MG), developed through microbial fermentation using <i>Beauveria bassiana</i>. Results indicated that H-DHQ and DHQ-MG significantly enhanced the alleviation of IR in a HepG2 cell model compared with DHQ, with no significant differences noticed between DHQ-MG and H-DHQ. Mechanistic analyses revealed that these derivatives effectively reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, thereby activating the JNK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote glycogen synthesis, suppress gluconeogenesis, and stimulate glucose transport. This research highlights the potential of H-DHQ and DHQ-MG as effective natural alternatives for managing IR, while also providing indirect evidence for the application of microbial fermentation as a strategy to modify natural flavonoids for this purpose.
40152826	A novel model for bulk modulus and bond energy calculation of Si and its binary compounds, tetrahedral ternary semiconductors in bulk and nanocrystals.	This study investigates the correlations between bulk modulus, mean bond length, mean bond ionicity, and bond energy for a variety of tetrahedral group semiconductors, such as IV, III-V, II-VI, I-III-VI<sub>2</sub>, II-IV-V<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>-IV-VI<sub>3</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>-V-VI<sub>4</sub>, and III<sub>2</sub>-VI<sub>3</sub> elements and compounds. A clear correlation between the mean bond length (<i>d</i><sub>mean</sub>), and bond energy (<i>E</i><sub>b</sub>) was found in the form: <i>E</i><sub>b</sub> = 74.115 (eV A<sup>2</sup>) × <i>d</i><sub>mean</sub><sup>-2</sup> × (1 + <i>f</i><sub>i</sub>), where <i>f</i><sub>i</sub> is the group compound ionicity. For every group, ionicity values between 0 and 0.75 were calculated. Additionally, a consistent link between bulk modulus (<i>B</i>) and bond energy was found and used to compute bulk modulus (in GPa) and bond energy (in eV) for a variety of groups, including II-IV-V<sub>2</sub>, I-III-VI<sub>2</sub>, III<sub>2</sub>-VI<sub>3</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>-IV-VI<sub>3</sub>, and I<sub>3</sub>-V-VI<sub>4</sub>, which were previously unavailable. Additionally, by adding size-dependent factors through mean bond length <i>d</i><sub>mean</sub> at the nanoscale, extended the obtained relationships to a nanoscale semiconductor. When applied to Si nanocrystals, the modified bulk modulus equation, <i>B</i>(<i>r</i>) = 0.7775 (GPa eV<sup>-1.85</sup>) × (<i>E</i><sub>b</sub>(<i>r</i>))<sup>1.85</sup> × (1 - <i>f</i><sub>i</sub>) takes size effects into account without allowing for parameter adjustment. Because of variations in the surface-to-volume ratio, lattice characteristics, bond ionicity, and mean bond length, the bulk modulus drops from 98 GPa in bulk Si to 90 GPa in 5 nm Si nanoparticles (NPs). The bulk modulus of semiconductor materials noticeably decreases with decreasing size; NPs exhibit the largest fall, followed by nanowires (NWs) and nanofilms (NFs). These discrepancies result from changes in the nanoscale's mean bond length and bond energy. The findings emphasize the significance of these effects for adjusting the mechanical characteristics of nanostructured materials, and simulations and experimental evidence corroborate them.
40152809	Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen to ammonia on metal nanoclusters: insights and trends from d- and p-block metals.	The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen (NRR) to ammonia on metal nanoclusters represents a transformative approach to sustainable ammonia synthesis, offering a greener alternative to the highly energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, which is a significant contributor to global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. By harnessing renewable electricity under ambient conditions, electrocatalytic NRR could dramatically lower the carbon footprint and enable decentralized, on-demand ammonia production. However, the inherent stability of N<sub>2</sub> presents a major obstacle to its efficient activation. Metal nanoclusters, with their distinctive electronic and structural characteristics, have emerged as highly promising catalysts to overcome this challenge. This study systematically investigates the NRR catalytic performance of a broad spectrum of d-block and p-block metal nanoclusters. Through the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) for global minimum structure optimization and comprehensive mechanistic pathway analysis, we uncover key trends in N<sub>2</sub> activation, NRR reaction pathways, selectivity, and efficiency across various nanoclusters. Our findings provide critical insights into the design of advanced NRR electrocatalysts, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient technologies for ammonia production.
40152806	Analysis of the impact of protein conformational dynamics and intermolecular interactions on water flux through TIP3;1 aquaporins of <i>Zea mays</i> L.	The discovery of aquaporins (AQPs) in 1992 had a profound impact on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transport of substances across cell membranes. To further understand water mobilization through AQPs, this study focuses on the characterization of water flux through the TIP3;1 aquaporins of <i>Zea mays</i> L. using molecular dynamics. The primary objective is to elucidate how protein-water intermolecular interactions and protein conformational dynamics impact water mobility across the cell membrane. To conduct this analysis, the three-dimensional structure of TIP3;1 was modeled using AlphaFold2, from which the complete system was constructed. This system consisted of a homotetramer of TIP3;1 immersed in a fragment of cell membrane and solvated with water molecules and ions. Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for 90 ns, resulting in the determination of an osmotic permeability coefficient (<i>p</i><sub>f</sub>) of 0.8172 ± 0.146 × 10<sup>-14</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. In general, the mobility of water along the single-file water channel is influenced by the complex interplay of protein conformational dynamics and hydrogen bonding. The conformational dynamics of the protein channel modify the pore radius available for the passage of water, which affects the frequency of protein-water interactions and consequently influences the mobility of water in the channel. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which AQP activity is modulated without involving changes in protein chemical composition.
40152782	Target-Induced Enzymatic Cascade Reaction Method: Integrating Strand Displacement Amplification and CRISPR/Cas12a for Homogeneous Assays of Biotin.	The important biological role of biotin emphasizes the need for a sensitive method to detect it in foodstuffs. This article introduces a homogeneous and sensitive biotin analysis method that leverages a target-induced enzymatic cascade reaction, incorporating strand-displacement amplification (SDA) and the CRISPR/Cas12a system. Without target biotin, streptavidin (SA) specifically binds to the biotinylated probe DNA, hindering Klenow polymerase from extending the primer single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) due to the steric hindrance created by the SA-biotin complex, resulting in low fluorescence. Conversely, competition between the target biotin and the biotin label for binding to SA reduces the amount of SA captured on the primer ssDNA. The SDA process, which involves Klenow polymerase and the Nb.BbvCI enzyme, proceeds smoothly, thereby activating the CRISPR/Cas12a system and producing an intense fluorescence signal. Utilizing this principle, precise and sensitive biotin detection in food matrices was achieved, with a limit of detection of 0.01 nM.
40152770	Strong Coupling between Mn<sup>2+</sup> Dopants and CdSe Nanoplatelets Enables Charge-Transfer Transition and Dual Emission.	Doping transitional metals into colloidal nanocrystals can significantly modify their excited-state dynamics and enrich their optical and magneto-optical functionalities. Here we synthesize Mn-doped CdSe nanoplatelets and investigate their excited-state dynamics and light-emission mechanisms. Extensive characterizations suggest that Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions are situated near the surface-region of the nanoplatelets. The atomic thinness of nanoplatelets allows for a strong host-dopant coupling, manifested as broadband charge-transfer absorption and emission (near 575 nm) between the host valence band and the dopant <i>d</i>-orbitals. Photoexcitation of the host leads to rapid (a few ps) electron transfer from the conduction band to the <i>d</i>-orbitals, and the resultant charge-transfer state decays within a few ns not only through charge-transfer emission but also generating an excited-state species (likely Mn-Mn dimer) with a characteristic near-infrared emission. These novel photophysics and photochemistry uncovered for quasi-two-dimensional Mn-doped nanocrystals form the basis for optical, magneto-optical, and energy conversion applications using such materials.
40152742	Phonon-mediated superconductivity in the metal diborides XB<sub>2</sub> under pressure.	As a promising candidate for high-temperature superconductors, the AlB<sub>2</sub> structure has garnered significant attention. Notably, the discovery of MgB<sub>2</sub>, which is stable at zero pressure and exhibits a high <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> of 39 K, has sparked a surge in research on metal borides. Metals, acting as electron donors, play a crucial role in stabilizing the relative positions of metal and boron atoms, thereby contributing to the stabilization of the crystal structure and the enhancement of superconductivity. In this study, the Mg atom was replaced with another metal atom X (X = Li, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Rb, Zr, Nb, Cs, Ba, Hf, Ta). The resulting 12 compounds demonstrated stability at zero or low pressure. However, none of these compounds exhibited superconductivity comparable to that of the parent MgB<sub>2</sub>. Among them, LiB<sub>2</sub>, CsB<sub>2</sub>, and RbB<sub>2</sub> emerged as the most promising candidates for superconductors. These findings highlight the complex interplay between the density of electronic states at the Fermi level and electron-phonon coupling in determining the superconductivity of binary metal borides. The computational results provide valuable insights for future research and the design of new superconducting materials within this family of metal compounds.
40152696	Engineering <i>Pichia pastoris</i> for Efficient <i>De Novo</i> Synthesis of 2'-Fucosyllactose.	2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL), the most abundant in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), is a nutrient of great importance. As a safe organism widely used in industries, <i>Pichia pastoris</i> was tested here for 2'-FL production. The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway of 2'-FL was constructed using genome-editing technology based on CRISPR-Cas9 with an initial titer of 1.01 g/L. Introducing N-terminal SUMO or Ub tag to FucT2 and the transporter CDT2 from <i>Neurospora crassa</i> into <i>P. pastoris</i> was found to improve 2'-FL production. Then, modular metabolic engineering was conducted to improve 2'-FL production, enhancing the GTP supply module, NADPH regeneration module, and precursor supply module. Subsequently, the key enzyme FucT2 was semirationally designed to further increase 2'-FL production. Finally, the 2'-FL production by engineered <i>P. pastoris</i> was scaled up to the 3 L fermenter in fed-batch mode, resulting in a titer of 22.35 g/L that is the highest by <i>P. pastoris</i>. The results prove the effectiveness of the metabolic engineering strategies and demonstrate that <i>P. pastoris</i> could be a potential chassis to produce HMOs.
40152664	Engineering of Glycosyltransferase for Efficient Biosynthesis of Salidroside.	Salidroside has been widely used in the cosmetic and medicinal industries. Previously, potential glycosyltransferase UGT<sub>BS</sub> was obtained for salidroside synthesis. However, the catalytic efficiency for salidroside was undesirable. In this study, a semirational design was applied to engineer UGT<sub>BS</sub>. The quadruple mutant M4 (I62N/S129T/F168W/Y316S) showed significantly enhanced salidroside synthesis. A conversion rate of 94.7% was obtained using mutant M4, which was 2.2-fold higher than that of the wild-type. The regioselectivity of mutant M4 toward tyrosol hydroxyl was also improved, resulting in 97.9% salidroside in the total product, which was 1.2-fold higher than that of the wild type. Kinetic constants and molecular simulations indicated that increased affinity and altered conformation of the binding pocket accounted for the enhanced salidroside synthesis. Furthermore, a fed-batch cascade reaction strategy was used, and over 183 mM salidroside was obtained. The engineered mutant M4 demonstrated precise catalysis for salidroside formation.
40152624	High solar-to-hydrogen efficiency in Z-scheme AlN/GaO heterojunctions for visible light water splitting.	Hydrogen production from solar energy is an important means to solve the problems of fossil fuel consumption and environmental pollution, and the efficiency of hydrogen production from solar energy is an important indicator. Photocatalytic water decomposition technology driven by solar energy is an ideal way to create clean energy. In this paper, a new Z-scheme AlN/GaO van der Waals heterojunction is proposed. Through first-principles calculations, we have systematically studied the electronic properties and photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the AlN/GaO heterostructure. The calculation results show that the lattice mismatch rate of the AlN/GaO heterojunction is only 0.48%. At the same time, it not only performs well in terms of thermodynamics, kinetics and mechanical stability, but also has an appropriate band gap of 1.45 eV with an electron mobility of up to 2753.48 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Under light irradiation, the transfer of internal photogenerated carriers forms a built-in electric field from AlN to GaO, which forms a typical Z-scheme, and leads to the hydrogen evolution reaction on AlN with strong reduction ability. It is worth noting that the AlN/GaO heterojunction shows a high absorption coefficient in the visible light absorption range and has an excellent solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 60.1%. These advantages demonstrate that the AlN/GaO heterojunction, as a promising photocatalyst, has significant application potential and offers a novel approach to address the energy crisis and environmental pollution challenges.
40152613	Reinforcement learning-based inverse design of composite films for spacecraft smart thermal control.	Thermal control is crucial for the normal operation of spacecraft, as it directly affects the performance and lifespan of the payload. The thermochromic properties of VO<sub>2</sub> give it a natural advantage in smart thermal control of spacecraft, but traditional design methods still struggle to meet the design expectations for thermal control composite films. Based on this, this paper focuses on the thermal control requirements for spacecraft and proposes the design of composite films that integrate the coordinated control of dynamic thermal emitters and solar reflectors using machine learning algorithms. Firstly, a reinforcement learning optimization framework was constructed using a transfer matrix method combined with deep Q-learning. Multiple Fabry-Pérot resonator stacked structures have been optimized for the design of dynamic thermal emitters. The results indicated that a three-resonator stacked structure achieved a wide adjustable emissivity range of 0.939 near the 10 μm wavelength band. Based on this structure, a solar reflector was further designed to achieve low absorption in the solar wavelength band. The resulting smart thermal control composite film achieved a low absorption of 0.180 in the solar wavelength band, while maintaining a high emissivity adjustable range of up to 0.806. The simulated thermal control performance in a space environment indicates that, accounting for solar absorptivity, the cooling power of the film can shift from -183.42 W m<sup>-2</sup> to 83.13 W m<sup>-2</sup> before and after the phase transition. Furthermore, the composite film can maintain good thermal control performance within a large range of incident angles, promoting the practical application research of smart thermal control composite films.
40152547	Enantioselective Dearomative [2π + 2σ] Photocycloaddition of Naphthalene Derivatives with Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes Enabled by Gd(III) Catalysis.	The cycloaddition reactions of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with alkenes, imines, nitrones, or aziridines have served as an efficient platform to create conformationally restricted saturated bicyclic scaffolds. However, the use of readily available aromatics in such reactions, especially in an asymmetric manner, remains underexplored. Herein, we report a highly regio- and enantioselective dearomative [2π + 2σ] photocycloaddition reaction between naphthalene derivatives and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, enabled by Gd(III) catalysis. Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and naphthalenes adorned with a diverse array of functional groups are well-tolerated under mild conditions, affording enantioenriched pharmaceutically important bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes in 30-96% yields with 81-93% ee and 12:1 → >20:1 rr. The synthetic versatility of this reaction is further demonstrated by the facile removal of directing group and derivatizations of the dearomatized product. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy studies suggest the involvement of an excited naphthalene species in the reaction process.
40152427	Microscopic Kinetics of Water Adsorption in Metal-Organic Frameworks.	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown great potential in atmospheric water harvesting, dehumidification, and passive evaporative cooling. Their performance is determined by the water uptake and adsorption kinetics of the MOFs. Here, the water adsorption kinetics in MOFs are systematically investigated using our proposed theoretical framework and experimental measurements. At low relative humidities (RHs), water molecules are adsorbed and diffuse freely in MOFs, as described by the linear driving force assumption and Fick's law. At high RHs, water condenses into liquid clusters before diffusing, modeled by a two-concentration framework. At medium RHs, both water molecules and clusters coexist in MOFs. Good agreement between experiments and simulations of water uptake and kinetics of UiO-66, CAU-10-H, MOF-801, MIL-101, and MOF-303 demonstrates our theoretical framework fully captures water vapor adsorption processes in MOFs. Our results further show that water adsorption capacity and kinetics are jointly influenced by the porosity, pore radius, and pore geometry factor.
40152424	Potential Antidiabetic Activity of Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid: An Insight into Its Inhibitory Mechanisms on Carbohydrate-Hydrolyzing Enzymes, the Binding Behaviors with Enzymes, and <i>In Vivo</i> Antihyperglycemic Effect.	The inhibitory mechanisms and binding behaviors of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) to α-glucosidase/α-amylase were investigated by <i>in vitro</i> multispectroscopic methods and <i>in silico</i> modeling technique. The results demonstrated that NDGA reversibly and uncompetitively inhibited α-glucosidase, exhibiting stronger inhibition than acarbose, while it displayed noncompetitive inhibition against α-amylase. Additionally, NDGA could spontaneously bind to α-glucosidase/α-amylase mainly through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces, thus altering the spatial structure of enzymes and reducing their catalytic activity. The presence of crowding reagents/polysaccharides/undigested milk proteins would decrease the inhibitory ability of NDGA, whereas fatty acids exhibited the opposite phenomenon on α-glucosidase. Furthermore, the antidiabetic activity of NDGA <i>in vivo</i> was evaluated using the diabetic <i>Drosophila</i> model induced by a high-sugar diet. It was found that NDGA significantly reduced the glucose levels of diabetic <i>Drosophila</i>. These findings suggested that NDGA was a potential inhibitor of α-glucosidase/α-amylase and could be used as a nutritional adjuvant to prevent diabetes.
40152328	Rational Design Principles for <i>De Novo</i> α-Helical Peptide Barrels with Dynamic Conductive Channels.	Despite advances in peptide and protein design, the rational design of membrane-spanning peptides that form conducting channels remains challenging due to our imperfect understanding of the sequence-to-structure relationships that drive membrane insertion, assembly, and conductance. Here, we describe the design and computational and experimental characterization of a series of coiled coil-based peptides that form transmembrane α-helical barrels with conductive channels. Through a combination of rational and computational design, we obtain barrels with 5 to 7 helices, as characterized in detergent micelles. In lipid bilayers, these peptide assemblies exhibit two conductance states with relative populations dependent on the applied potential: (i) low-conductance states that correlate with variations in the designed amino-acid sequences and modeled coiled-coil barrel geometries, indicating stable transmembrane α-helical barrels; and (ii) high-conductance states in which single channels change size in discrete steps. Notably, the high-conductance states are similar for all peptides in contrast to the low-conductance states. This indicates the formation of large, dynamic channels, as observed in natural barrel-stave peptide channels. These findings establish rational routes to design and tune functional membrane-spanning peptide channels with specific conductance and geometry.
40152302	Transformer-based deep learning structure-conductance relationships in gold and silver nanowires.	Due to their inherently stochastic nature, microscopic configurations and conductance values of nano-junctions fabricated using break-junction techniques vary and fluctuate in and between experiments. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to observe the structural evolution of nano-junctions while measuring their conductance, a fact that prevents the establishment of their structure-conductance relationship. Herein, we conduct classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with neural-network potentials to simulate the stretching of Au and Ag nanowires followed by training a transformer-based neural network to predict their conductance. In addition to achieving an accuracy comparable to <i>ab initio</i> molecular dynamics within a computational cost similar to classical force fields, our approach can acquire the conductance of a large number of junction structures efficiently. Our calculations show that the transformer-based neural network, leveraging its self-attention mechanism, exhibits remarkable stability, accuracy and scalability in the prediction of zero-bias conductance of longer, larger and even structurally different gold nanowires when trained only on smaller systems. The simulated conductance histograms of gold nanowires are highly consistent with experiments. By examining the MD trajectories of gold nanowires simulated at 150 K and 300 K, we find that the formation probability of a three-strand planar structure appearing at 300 K is much higher than that at 150 K. This may be the dominating factor for the observed blueshift of the main peak positioned between 1.5-2<i>G</i><sub>0</sub> in the conductance histogram following the temperature increase. Moreover, our transformer-based neural network pretrained on Au has an excellent transferability, which can be fine-tuned to predict accurately the conductance of Ag nanowires with much less training data. Our findings pave the way for using deep learning techniques in molecule-scale electronics and are helpful for elucidating the conducting mechanism of molecular junctions and improving their performance.
40152223	Construction of C4-Spirocyclic Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks Via Asymmetric Multicomponent Povarov Reaction for Enantioselective Sensing.	Although many chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) have been synthesized, the rapid development of this field has been severely restricted by the limitations of CCOFs synthesis methods and the scarcity of their chiral structural unit types. Herein we report, for the first time, the construction of C4-spirocyclic CCOFs via the asymmetric multicomponent Povarov reaction under ambient conditions. The obtained <b>C4</b>-<b>spiro</b>-(2<i>S</i>, 4<i>R</i>)-<b>TMTT</b>-<b>COF</b> can be as a novel chiral fluorescent sensor to discriminate D/L-PAL enantiomers. This finding will provide a simple and universal method for constructing CCOFs with novel chiral structural groups and might open new insights into the construction of the CCOFs featuring multiple distinct types of carbon chiral centers.
40152073	Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass: role of non-affine flows.	Memory effect reflects a system's ability to encode, retain and retrieve information about its past. Such effects are essentially an out-of-equilibrium phenomenon providing insight into the complex structural and dynamical behavior of the system. Kovacs effect is one such memory effect that is traditionally associated with thermal history. Although studies on the Kovacs-like memory effect have been extended to mechanical perturbations such as compression-decompression, whether such effects can also be observed under volume-conserving perturbations like shear, remains unclear. Combining experiments, simulations and linear response theory we demonstrate Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass. Moreover, we explore the influence of non-linear perturbations and establish a correlation between the deviation from linear response prediction and microscopic non-affine flows generated due to such large deformations in affecting the memory effect. Our study not only extends Kovacs-like memory effect in the domain of volume-conserving mechanical perturbations, it also highlights the importance of the nature of underlying microscopic flows in controlling the bulk stress relaxation, affecting the Kovacs-like memory effect in amorphous materials.

Finally, the review identifies future directions, including scaling microfluidic techniques, expanding compatibility with hydrophilic compounds, and integrating machine learning to further enhance the development of nanoprecipitation.
40151999	Cascade-Targeting Apoptosis via Synergy of TRAIL-Specific Bystander Effect and Mitochondrial Photodamage in Cancer Therapy.	Tumor-specific apoptosis exerts considerable curative efficacy in cancer, particularly with TRAIL, which has been approved in the clinic; however, therapeutic outcome is compromised due to apoptosis evasion and the short half-life of exogenously infused TRAIL. Herein, we propose a synergistic apoptosis strategy of orthotopic TRAIL expression for enhancing the bystander effect and mitochondrial photodamage for intrinsic apoptosis activation. To actualize synergetic apoptosis, we develop cascade-targeting nanoparticles to perform cell-to-mitochondria shuttling, in which TRAIL-expressing plasmid (pTRAIL) is coprecipitated with calcium phosphate on a glycyrrhetinic acid (GA)-modified graphene oxide nanosheet. For apoptosis synergy, GA mediates tumor accumulation of nanoparticles, followed by structure dissociation for efficient pTRAIL release and expression (cascade module I). Thereafter, GA-modified graphene carriers perform mitochondria distribution for laser-triggered photodamage (cascade module II). The nanoparticles yield tumor inhibition of 86.78% in the melanoma model and demonstrate metastasis blocking activity. Collectively, a cascade-targeting apoptosis technology via a combination of TRAIL-specific bystander effects and mitochondrial photodamage provides innovative oncotherapy synergy.
40151986	Ultrafast excited-state dynamics of 4-hydroxychalcone: role of intramolecular charge transfer and photoacidity.	Diarylketones such as benzophenones, oxybenzones, chalcones and their derivatives exhibit promising applications as UV filters/sunscreen agents due to their effective absorption in the UV region and dissipation through non-radiative pathways. However, elucidation of the underlying photoreactive mechanism is non-trivial due to the ultrafast lifetimes of transient species, involvement of non-adiabatic curve crossings among the potential surfaces, <i>etc.</i> In this context, we investigate the excited-state photoreaction dynamics of 4-hydroxychalcone (4-HC) under various environments through femtosecond-transient absorption (fs-TA), nanosecond-transient absorption (ns-TA), and femtosecond-fluorescence upconversion (fs-FL) measurements. Steady-state fluorescence measurements of 4-HC in the presence of 1-methylimidazole (MI)/<i>tert</i>-butylamine (TBA) exhibit dual band emission. The fs-TA measurements of 4-HC in the presence of MI/TBA exhibit distinct spectral and associated lifetimes as compared to 4-HC alone indicating a significant interaction of the hydroxyl proton with bases and influencing the reaction dynamics. The 4-HC:MI/TBA adduct undergoes excited-state intermolecular proton transfer within a time scale of ∼500 fs and subsequently relaxes back to the ground state through a long-lived triplet state. The experimental observations of excited-state reaction dynamics of 4-HC in the presence of MI/TBA bases have been well corroborated with the computational analysis.
40151984	Fitting ambiguities mask deficiencies of the Debye-Hückel theory: revealing inconsistencies of the Poisson-Boltzmann framework and permittivity.	The more than 100-year-old Debye-Hückel theory displays the most widely used approach for modeling ionic activities in electrolytes. The Debye-Hückel theory finds widespread application, such as in equations of state and Onsager's theory for conductivities. Here, a theoretical inconsistency of the Debye-Hückel theory is discussed, which originates from the employed Poisson-Boltzmann framework that violates the statistical independence of states presumed for the Boltzmann statistics. Furthermore, the static permittivity of electrolytic solutions is discussed as not directly measurable, while common methods for its extraction from experimental data are assessed as erroneous. A sensitivity analysis of modeled activity coefficients with respect to the permittivity and ionic radii as input parameters is conducted, showing that their influences overshadow physicochemical differences of common variations of Debye-Hückel models. Eventually, this study points out that the justification of the traditional and still often used Debye-Hückel models by experimental validation is affected by fitting ambiguities that eventually impede its predictive capabilities.
40151957	Polarization-Field-Induced Inequivalent Exciton Dynamics in Janus MoSeS/MoSe<sub>2</sub> Heterostructures.	The interplay between excitons and physical fields emerges as a forefront research topic within the domain of condensed matter physics, harboring significant impact for unraveling material properties. Herein, we investigate the valley exciton behaviors in Janus MoSeS/MoSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures with 2H- or 3R-stacking configurations. We ascertain that the intrinsic polarized electric field in Janus materials can markedly enhance the valley polarization. Furthermore, experimental results reveal that different excitons exhibit inequivalent spin-valley dynamic processes under intrinsic electric fields. Among them, intervalley trions exhibit a superior capability to preserve their spin states under a strong intrinsic electric field due to the quantum-confined Stark effect, thereby achieving the highest degree of valley polarization. This work provides fundamental insights into the strong correlation effect between excitons and polarized electric fields, signifying an advancement in control over the valley degree of freedom.
40151848	Functional assessment of migration and adhesion to quantify cancer cell aggression.	During epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cells lose their cell-cell adhesion junctions as they become more metastatic, altering cell motility and focal adhesion disassembly associated with increased detachment from the primary tumor and a migratory response into nearby tissue and vasculature. Current <i>in vitro</i> strategies characterizing a cell's metastatic potential heavily favor quantifying the presence of cell adhesion biomarkers through biochemical analysis; however, mechanical cues such as adhesion and motility directly relate to cell metastatic potential without needing to first identify a cell specific biomarker for a particular type of cancer. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of two functional metrics of cancer aggression, wound closure migration velocity and cell detachment from a culture surface, for three pairs of epithelial cancer cell lines (breast, endometrium, tongue tissue origins). It was found that one functional metric alone was not sufficient to categorize the cancer cell lines; instead, both metrics were necessary to identify functional trends and accurately place cells on the spectrum of metastasis. On average, cell lines with low metastatic potential (MCF-7, Ishikawa, and Cal-27) were more aggressive through wound closure migration compared to loss of cell adhesion. On the other hand, cell lines with high metastatic potential (MDA-MB-231, KLE, and SCC-25) were on average more aggressive through loss of cell adhesion compared to wound closure migration. This trend was true independent of the tissue type where the cells originated, indicating that there is a relationship between metastatic potential and the predominate type of cancer aggression. Our work presents one of the first combined studies relating cell metastatic potential to functional migration and adhesion metrics across cancer cell lines from selected tissue origins, without needing to identify tissue-specific biomarkers to achieve success. Using functional metrics provides powerful clinical relevancy for future predictive tools of cancer metastasis.
40151068	Comparison of functionality, mood, and biopsychosocial status in rheumatic patients with and without self-reported bowel problems and the evaluation of BETY's impact on these factors: a retrospective study.	This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the comparison of functionality, mood, and biopsychosocial status in rheumatic patients with and without self-reported bowel problems and the evaluation of <i>Bilişsel Egzersiz Terapi Yaklaşımı (BETY) - (Cognitive Exercise Therapy Approach in English)</i>'s impact on these factors.
40150803	Origin and Suppression of Nonradiative Recombination in Inorganic Halide Perovskites.	The intrinsic defects of inorganic perovskites, characterized by shallow transition energy levels, confer a high degree of defect tolerance, which is crucial for enhancing the performance of optoelectronic devices. However, the effectiveness of these advanced devices is hindered by significant nonradiative recombination losses due to the presence of defects. Despite extensive efforts to mitigate nonradiative recombination, the underlying causes of these losses in perovskites remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the detrimental impact of hydrogen interstitials on CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> and propose a pseudospring model for the nonradiative recombination mechanism involving hydrogen interstitials. Furthermore, by strategically manipulating the stretching mode of the pseudospring, we could effectively suppress nonradiative losses through targeted A-site and B-site engineering interventions. Finally, we reassess the micromechanistic basis of the remarkable defect tolerance observed in inorganic perovskites and elucidate the fundamental processes.
40150802	<i>O</i>-Cyanobenzaldehydes Irreversibly Modify Both Buried and Exposed Lysine Residues in Live Cells.	Lysine residue represents an attractive site for covalent drug development due to its high abundance (5.6%) and critical functions. However, very few lysines have been characterized to be accessible to covalent ligands and perturb the protein functions, owing to their protonation state and adjacent steric hindrance. Herein, we report a new lysine bioconjugation chemistry, <i>O</i>-cyanobenzaldehyde (CNBA), that enables selective modification of the lysine ε-amine to form iso-indolinones under physiological conditions. Activity-based proteome profiling enabled the mapping of 3451 lysine residues and 85 endogenous kinases in live cells, highlighting its potential for modifying hyper-reactive lysines within the proteome or buried catalytic lysines within the kinome. Further protein crystallography and mass spectrometry confirmed that K271_ABL1 and K162_AURKA are covalently targetable sites in kinases. Leveraging a structure-based drug design, we incorporated CNBA into the core structure of Nutlin-3 to irreversibly inhibit the MDM2-p53 interaction by targeting an exposed lysine K94 on the surface of murine double minute 2. Importantly, we have demonstrated the potential application of CNBA as a lysine-recognized bioconjugation agent for developing new antibody-drug conjugates. The results collectively validate CNBA as a new selective and efficient modifying agent with broad applications for both buried and exposed lysine residues in live cells.
40150791	3-Center-3-Electron σ-Adduct Enables Silyl Radical Transfer below the Minimum Barrier for Silyl Radical Formation.	Transition-metal-catalyzed cleavage of the Si-H bond in silanes to yield silyl radicals requires substantial amounts of energy, which are commonly supplied by photons. For Rh(II) porphyrins, efficient hydrosilylation catalysis becomes accessible only upon site isolation in a metal-organic framework (MOF), and the formation of free silyl radicals likewise requires irradiation. Within the MOF, however, an uncommonly facile direct silyl radical transfer to olefin substrates is also possible, which makes thermal olefin hydrosilylation accessible at room temperature. The ability of MOF-supported Rh(II) metalloradicals to furnish an unprecedented 3-center-3-electron (3c-3e) Rh(II)-silane σ-adduct enables the assembly of a tricomponent transition state that is comprised of Rh(II), silane, and ethylene. The tricomponent transition state bypasses the high-energy silyl radical species and enables silyl radical transfer with an activation free energy ∼15 kcal·mol<sup>-1</sup> below the minimum energy barrier for silyl radical formation. We report direct observation of the 3c-3e silane σ-adduct, which is a stable species in the absence of light and olefins. Furthermore, a combination of experiments and quantum chemical calculations shows that direct silyl radical transfer to ethylene is promoted by the temporary oxidation of the transition structure by a proximal Rh(II) center. Thus, the crucial role of the MOF matrix is to fix the inter-Rh separation in our catalyst at a value large enough for 3c-3e silane adduct formation but short enough for facile electron transfer.
40148233	Unraveling Oxyanion Effects on Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis of Nickel Hydr(oxy)oxides: The Critical Role of Fe Impurities.	Electrolyte modulation can enhance the performance of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by tailoring the electrocatalyst-electrolyte interface, but the role of anion additives remains controversial. Herein, we report our findings on unraveling the effects of oxyanions (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) and identifying Fe impurities as the key factor driving OER activity enhancement in Ni hydr(oxy)oxide model catalysts. Fe impurities, introduced via oxyanion salts, significantly enhance OER activity, while oxyanions themselves have minimal direct impact when Fe ions are removed. Our results, including <i>operando</i> Raman spectroscopy, reveal that Fe enhances Ni reducibility/redox reversibility. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that Fe preferentially adsorbs on Ni surface sites with higher deprotonation energy. These findings reveal the critical role of surface-adsorbed Fe in modulating Ni hydr(oxy)oxide activity and highlight overlooked impurity effects in electrocatalysis when studying additive effects in electrolyte modulation.
40148232	Geminal Mirror Twin Boundaries in H-Phase NbTe<sub>2</sub>.	Grain boundaries (GBs) in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly influence their physicochemical properties. Mirror twin boundaries (MTBs), a special GB type, reveal one-dimensional quantum features such as topological states and charge density waves. However, the large-scale fabrication of well-aligned MTBs remains challenging. Here, we present a simple solution method to introduce high-density paired MTBs in monolayer 1H-NbTe<sub>2</sub>. Using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we identify two "MTB" types─metastable Nb-oriented 4|4E and Te-oriented 4|4P, forming aligned MTBs with quantized spacings. The formation mechanism of paired MTBs is hypothesized to involve specific intralayer atomic rearrangements within a distorted 1T-phase, followed by H-phase core coalescence, facilitated by strain-induced energy barrier reduction and electron doping stabilization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that paired MTBs stabilize metastable H-phase, enabling the coexistence of superconductivity and nontrivial band topology. The approach of our group to fabricating high-density paired MTBs advances boundary engineering in TMDs for designing functional quantum devices.

40148101	Phase Identification of Layered GaS by Polarization-Dependent Angle-Resolved Oblique Incident Second Harmonic Generation.	Layered gallium sulfide (GaS), a material that has attracted much attention in the field of micro-nano optoelectronics recently, is predicted to have four stable stacking orders (β-, γ-, ε-, and δ-GaS) with close formation energies; β-GaS is the most considered, and other phases are seldom discussed. However, considering the ease of the phase transition in few-layer materials, the lack of accurate crystal phase identification prevents a full understanding of this material for specific applications requiring other crystal phases. Here, we report a novel in situ and nondestructive method to identify the phase of layered GaS by polarization-dependent angle-resolved oblique incident second harmonic generation (SHG). Through this method, we discovered the presence of γ-GaS with a portion of approximately one-sixth of the total samples. Our work has laid a foundation for the application of GaS, and our approach has established a technical guarantee for structural analysis of van der Waals layered materials.
40147456	Structural Context Modulates the Conformational Ensemble of the Intrinsically Disordered Amino Terminus of α-Synuclein.	Regions of intrinsic disorder play crucial roles in biological systems, yet they often elude characterization by conventional biophysical techniques. To capture conformational distributions across different time scales, we employed a freezing approach coupled with solid-state NMR analysis. Using segmentally isotopically labeled α-synuclein (α-syn), we investigated the conformational ensembles of the six alanines, three glycines, and a single site (L8) in the disordered amino terminus under three distinct conditions: in 8 M urea, as a frozen monomer in buffer, and within the disordered regions flanking the amyloid core. The experimental spectra varied significantly among these conditions and deviated from those of a statistical coil. In 8 M urea, monomeric α-syn exhibited the most restricted conformational sampling, rarely accessing chemical shifts characteristic of α-helices or β-strands. In buffer, monomeric α-syn showed a broader conformational sampling, favoring α-helical conformations and, to a lesser extent, random coil states. Notably, amino acids in the disordered regions flanking the amyloid core demonstrated the most extensive conformational sampling, with broad peaks encompassing the entire range of possible chemical shifts and a marked increase in highly extended β-strand conformations. Collectively, this work demonstrates that intrinsically disordered regions exhibit distinct conformational ensembles, which are influenced not only by the chemical environment but also by the conformations of adjacent protein sequences. The differences in the conformational ensembles of the disordered amino terminus may explain why the monomer and the amyloid form of α-syn interact with different biomolecules inside cells.
40147007	Molecular Design Principles for Photoactive Transition Metal Complexes: A Guide for "Photo-Motivated" Chemists.	Luminescence and photochemistry involve electronically excited states that are inherently unstable and therefore spontaneously decay to electronic ground states, in most cases by nonradiative energy release that generates heat. This energy dissipation can occur on a time scale of 100 fs (∼10<sup>-13</sup> s) and usually needs to be slowed down to at least the nanosecond (∼10<sup>-9</sup> s) time scale for luminescence and intermolecular photochemistry to occur. This is a challenging task with many different factors to consider. An alternative emerging strategy is to target dissociative excited states that lead to metal-ligand bond homolysis on the subnanosecond time scale to access synthetically useful radicals. Based on a thorough review at the most recent advances in the field, this article aims to provide a concise guide to obtaining luminescent and photochemically useful coordination compounds with d-block elements. We hope to encourage "photo-motivated" chemists who have been reluctant to apply their synthetic and other knowledge to photophysics and photochemistry, and we intend to stimulate new approaches to the synthetic control of excited state behavior.
40147006	Herbicidal Activity and Metabolic Profiling of <i>Piper tuberculatum</i> Jacq. Leachates.	Understanding how allelochemicals with herbicidal activity are released in plant interactions is key to developing sustainable weed control strategies. This study aimed to investigate the herbicidal activity and metabolic profile of <i>Piper tuberculatum</i> Jacq. leachates. <i>In vitro</i> bioassays were performed with <i>P</i>. <i>tuberculatum</i> leaf leachates to evaluate their effects on the germination and early growth of <i>Bidens bipinnata</i> L. and <i>Digitaria insularis</i> (L.) Fedde. (DIGIN.). The leachate extracts were subsequently characterized via liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and molecular networking. The results showed that weed germination and seedling development were significantly affected by the <i>P</i>. <i>tuberculatum</i> leachates. Metabolomic analysis revealed that allelochemicals belonging to the classes of alkaloids, fatty acids, phenolic compounds, steroids, and terpenoids are potentially involved in herbicidal activity. These findings suggest that <i>P</i>. <i>tuberculatum</i> could be explored as a natural alternative for sustainable weed management, potentially reducing the dependence on synthetic herbicides.
40147001	How Temperature Change Affects the Lattice Parameters, Molecular Conformation, and Reaction Cavity in Enantiomeric and Racemic Crystals of Thalidomide.	For the single crystals of thalidomide (C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, TD) grown by the solvent evaporation method, the temperature dependences of the crystal structures have been investigated over a wide temperature range between 100 and 423.15 K. Comparing the α-form of a racemic TD crystal, which consists of symmetric heterochiral dimers and belongs to <i>P</i>2<sub>1</sub>/<i>n</i> space group, with the enantiomeric TD crystal, which belongs to <i>P</i>2<sub>1</sub> and consists of asymmetric (pseudosymmetric) homochiral dimers, there have been clear differences in the temperature-dependent changes of the lattice parameters, the isobaric linear thermal expansion coefficients (along the crystallographic and the principal Cartesian axes), the volumetric expansion coefficients of the unit cell, and the structures of hydrogen-bonded dimer in the crystal such as intra- and intermolecular dihedral angles, cavities (reaction cavities), and the hydrogen-bond length. In the asymmetric homochiral dimers, one monomer with a larger reaction cavity changes its intramolecular dihedral angle with temperature, while the other monomer with a smaller cavity does not. In contrast, in the symmetric heterochiral dimers, two monomers with the same cavity volume similarly change their intramolecular dihedral angles with the temperature. Such differences in the temperature-dependent conformational changes between asymmetric and symmetric dimers cause differences between enantiomeric and racemic crystals.
40146905	Ligand-Controlled Regioselective Dearomative Vicinal and Conjugate Hydroboration of Quinolines.	A dearomative strategy to regioselectively modify arenes using a "diene" synthon within aromatic rings provides access to highly functionalized heterocycles from abundant aromatic feedstocks and represents an alternative synthetic approach besides traditional cross-coupling and C-H functionalization methodologies. In this study, we present an efficient method for selectively introducing boron onto quinolines through dearomative hydroboration using easily accessible and stable phosphine-ligated borane complexes. The vicinal 5,6- and conjugate 5,8-hydroborated products could be obtained regioselectively by modifying the phosphine ligand. Drawing inspiration from diverse organoboron transformations, these borane building blocks were diversified by a range of downstream functionalizations, providing modular pathways for the skeletal modifications of quinolines to access a variety of challenging functionalized heterocycles.
40146797	Gap-Enhanced Catalysis in Gold Nanostructures by Electric Field and Curvature Effects.	The catalytic performance of plasmonic nanostructures is strongly influenced by surface morphology. While the antenna effect in tip regions has received considerable attention, the role of gap morphology has been largely overlooked. Comprehending morphology-regulated catalysis at the subparticle level remains constrained by morphology heterogeneity and imaging resolution limitations, hindering rational nanocatalyst design. Here, we develop a single-particle catalytic activity assay by coupling single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) imaging with plasmon-enhanced fluorescence, enabling the probing of catalytic dynamics of plasmonic Au nanostructures and their correlation with local electric fields. Using this approach, we demonstrate that nanospine formation with nanoscale gaps on Au nanostructures significantly enhances catalytic activity. Further investigations using SMF imaging, electric field simulations, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the gap-enhanced catalytic activity is driven by amplified electric fields and increased substrate adsorption at negatively curved sites. This study provides valuable insights into designing plasmonic nanocatalysts through surface morphology engineering.
40146663	Chemoselective Hydrogenation of Halonitrobenzenes by Platinum Nanoparticles with Auxiliary Co-N<sub>4</sub> Single Sites in Sandwiched Catalysts.	The chemoselective hydrogenation of halonitrobenzenes to haloanilines is of great importance but remains challenging to simultaneously achieve high catalytic activity, excellent selectivity, and good reusability, especially for <i>ortho</i>-substituted substrates. This is due to the occurrence of hydrogenolysis of halogen groups, as well as the easy migration and aggregation of active species on the catalyst surface during the hydrogenation of nitro groups. In this study, we integrate Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with auxiliary Co-N<sub>4</sub> single sites from a porphyrinic metal-organic framework [known as PCN-221(Co)] in a sandwiched nanostructure as a catalyst for the chemoselective hydrogenation of <i>ortho</i>-halonitrobenzenes at 80 °C and 1 MPa H<sub>2</sub> in a 50 mL batch microreactor. This sandwiched catalyst achieves 97.3% selectivity for <i>ortho</i>-chloroaniline at nearly complete conversion of <i>ortho</i>-chloronitrobenzene, with an exceptionally high turnover frequency (TOF) of 11,625 h<sup>-1</sup> and good reusability over ten cycles, outperforming state-of-the-art heterogeneous supported metal catalysts. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the nitro group in <i>ortho</i>-chloronitrobenzene is preferentially hydrogenated by Pt NPs, while the <i>ortho</i>-chloro group is selectively adsorbed by Co-N<sub>4</sub> single sites in PCN-221(Co), preventing its hydrogenolysis and enhancing selectivity for <i>ortho</i>-chloroaniline. Furthermore, the PCN-221(Co) shell in the sandwiched catalyst plays a key role in enriching <i>ortho</i>-chloronitrobenzene and stabilizing the supported Pt NPs, thus leading to high catalytic activity and good reusability. Additionally, at nearly complete conversion of <i>ortho</i>-fluoronitrobenzene and <i>ortho</i>-bromonitrobenzene, this sandwiched Pt catalyst displays 100% selectivity for <i>ortho</i>-fluoroaniline with a TOF of 8680 h<sup>-1</sup> and 99.2% selectivity for <i>ortho</i>-bromoaniline with a TOF of 5859 h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. When <i>meta</i>- and <i>para</i>-halonitrobenzenes are used as substrates, high activity and excellent selectivity for the corresponding haloanilines are also achieved by the sandwiched Pt catalysts.
40146290	Electron/hole pinning effects, localization, and dielectric properties in (Nb,Cu) co-doped SnO<sub>2</sub> ceramics.	Dielectric ceramics with charge carrier pinning effects have exhibited high dielectric permittivity and low dielectric loss. However, the detailed mechanism has not yet been fully clear, such as the types of carriers, certain parameters within the pinning effect, <i>etc.</i> To address these issues, a prototype high dielectric permittivity system, <i>i.e.</i> (Nb,Cu) co-doped rutile Nb<sub><i>x</i></sub>Cu<sub><i>y</i></sub>Sn<sub>1-<i>x</i>-<i>y</i></sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<i>x</i> = <i>y</i> = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05) ceramics, was explored. The findings indicate that the charge transfer and distribution were inferred by the combination of Bader charge difference (BCD) and the iso-surface of the excitation state. Moreover, the pinning effect was expressed by the hole delocalization index (HDI) and the electron delocalization index (EDI) at the specific ionic position. The ceramics with a low doping level (<i>x</i> = <i>y</i> ≤ 0.03) exhibited a large dielectric permittivity (>10<sup>3</sup>) and a loss of 0.1 (1 kHz, room temperature). The dielectric permittivity decreased while the loss increased with increasing doping levels. A series of characterization studies combined with theoretical calculations suggested that the ceramic with a low doping level (<i>x</i> = <i>y</i> ≤ 0.03) was dominated by the electron pinning effect, while the hole pinning effect was observed at the higher doping level. This work provides new insights into the charge pinning defect dipole models to illustrate the dielectric properties of ceramics.
40146212	First-principles study on promoting the performance of graphene as an anode material for alkali metal ion batteries by covalent cross-linking of rigid molecules.	In this work, to study the influence of covalent cross-linking on the properties of a layered carbon structure, bilayered graphenes with a larger layer distance were built, supported by covalently cross-linked molecules, 1,4-phenylene (GPG) or <i>p</i>-phenylenediamine (GPPG). Based on first-principles calculations, it was found that both structures are thermally stable at a temperature of 500 K. The internal covalently cross-linked molecule can effectively expand the layer distance, enhance the adsorption stability, increase the theoretical specific capacity, and reduce the diffusion energy barrier. GPG has a theoretical specific capacity of 770.65/1541.29/1233.04 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> for Li/Na/K ions, while GPPG has larger values of 2307.56/1442.23 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> for Na/K ions. As anode materials of Li/Na/K ion batteries, both GPG and GPPG display a stable voltage output during the charging/discharging process. The diffusion energy barriers of Li, Na and K ions far from the supported molecule in GPG/GPPG are 0.21/0.31, 0.05/0.15 and 0.03/0.16 eV, respectively. Furthermore both GPG and GPPG show excellent cycling stability based on appropriate variation of their interlayer spacing during the adsorption process.
40146189	The role of substrate mechanics in osmotic biofilm spreading.	Bacteria invade surfaces by forming dense colonies encased in a polymer matrix. Successful settlement of founder bacteria, early microcolony development and later macroscopic spreading of these biofilms on surfaces rely on complex physical mechanisms. Recent data show that on soft hydrogels, substrate rigidity is an important determinant for biofilm initiation and spreading, through mostly unknown mechanisms. Using a thermodynamically consistent thin-film approach for suspensions on soft elastic surfaces supplemented with biomass production we investigate <i>in silico</i> the role of substrate softness in the osmotic spreading of biofilms. We show that on soft substrates with an imposed osmotic pressure spreading is considerably slowed down and may be completely halted depending on the biomass production rate. We find that the critical slowing down of biofilm spreading on soft surfaces is caused by a reduced osmotic influx of solvent into the biofilm at the edges, which results from the thermodynamic coupling between substrate deformation and interfacial forces. By linking substrate osmotic pressure and mechanical softness through scaling laws, our simple model semi-quantitatively captures a range of experimentally observed biofilm spreading dynamics on hydrogels with different architectures, underscoring the importance of inherent substrate properties in the spreading process.
40146115	Mesoscopic study of smart dendritic-polymeric micelles for the removal of hormonal contraceptives from polluted aqueous environments.	The ability of new smart dendritic-polymeric micelles (Boltorn-H40-P(NPAM)-P(NIPAM)) to extract hormonal contraceptives from polluted aqueous environments was investigated using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations and coarse-grained models. Mesoscopic results indicated that these dendritic-polymeric micelles exhibit stimulus sensitivity at two low critical solution temperatures (LCST's). Thermal scans revealed that the micelles generate distinct temperature-dependent miscibility intervals: below the LCST, a thermodynamically stable micellar system is formed, while above the LCST, the system loses miscibility through a cloud point, resulting in hydrophobic particles with a complex conformational structure, comprising a dendritic core and a polymeric shell that double encapsulates the hydrophobic core. The removal process of two hormonal contraceptives, drospirenone and 17α-ethinylestradiol, using Boltorn-H40-P(NPAM)-P(NIPAM) micelles involved two consecutive stages: (I) loading the contraceptive molecules into the dendritic core below the LCST, and (II) separating the contraceptive molecules <i>via</i> a cloud point above the LCST. Finally, all the stages involved in the removal of hormonal contraceptives from polluted aqueous environments were explored in detail.
40146078	Phase transition of Fe under extreme conditions studied by using an anharmonic phonon approach based on machine learning force fields.	The phase transition structure and dynamical mechanisms of solid-state bcc phase iron (Fe) under extreme conditions remain an open question. This study systematically investigates the phase transition process and dynamical mechanisms of solid Fe at 0-1000 K and 0-30 GPa by combining machine learning force field molecular dynamics simulations and an anharmonic phonon approach. Considering the high-temperature anharmonic effects, we calculated and compared the Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies of bcc, hcp, and fcc phase Fe. At zero temperature, Fe transitions from the bcc phase to the hcp phase at 13.83 GPa. Due to the influence of temperature anharmonic effects, this transition pressure increases with rising temperature, reaching 17.20 GPa at 1000 K. During the bcc → hcp phase transition, the Gibbs free energy of the fcc phase is always higher than that of the bcc or hcp phases, indicating that the fcc phase is a metastable phase. The transverse acoustic branch (TA1) is the most sensitive to temperature and pressure, exhibiting frequency softening phenomena during the phase transition, which is the origin of the dynamic instability and strong phonon anharmonicity of the bcc phase. According to the phonon vibration polarization vector, the vibrational modes of the TA1 mode near the Γ point provide a continuous phase transition geometric pathway for the bcc phase to transition to the hcp phase through the intermediate fcc phase. These theoretical results support the experimental two-step phase transition viewpoint of Fe from bcc to hcp under high temperature and high pressure.
40146067	van der Waals Lamination for Effective Bottom Channel Modulation of Oxide Transistors.	Plasma treatment has been widely used to improve the performance of oxide transistors. However, the real active channel of the back-gated transistors is typically buried close to the dielectric interface and cannot be effectively modulated by plasmas. In this work, we report a bottom plasma treatment strategy that can directly modulate the oxide channel. Within this process, the as-deposited oxide channel could be physically peeled off from the sacrificial wafer using the van der Waals delamination process, exposing the bottom channel region for direct plasma treatment. After treatment, indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) transistors exhibit a large on-off ratio of 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> and high carrier mobility over 25 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, which is over 4 times higher compared to the control device with conventional top plasma treatment. Furthermore, detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements confirm that the improved performance originates from the passivation of oxygen vacancy and nitrogen doping within the active bottom channel region.
40145970	Enantiospecific Synthesis of α-Tertiary Amines: Ruthenium-Catalyzed Allylic Amination with Aqueous Ammonia.	Ammonia stands out as the most available, cost-effective, and atom-economical source of nitrogen for organic synthesis. In the laboratory, it is safely and most conveniently handled in aqueous solution. Despite the advantages, the direct application of aqueous ammonia in the field of transition-metal catalysis remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the first ruthenium-catalyzed allylic substitution using ammonia. The catalytic system, consisting of [Cp*Ru(MeCN)<sub>3</sub>]PF<sub>6</sub> and a phenoxythiazoline ligand, enables the enantiospecific amination of tertiary allylic carbonates in aqueous media and affords enantioenriched primary amines as single regioisomers in high yields.
40145903	An Amplificative Detection Approach for Autocatalytic Sensing of Ethylene.	Amplified sensing offers the potential for high sensitivity; however, the vast majority of molecular strategies involve stoichiometric detection and signal transduction, including numerous recent examples of systems inspired by transition-metal-catalyzed reactions. Activation of latent precatalysts by a target analyte represents an attractive strategy for detecting low-concentration species. Analyte amplification represents another attractive approach, akin to PCR-based assays. Here we report an autocatalytic detection system based on the ethylene activation of Ru-I2 olefin metathesis precatalysts. Signal transduction is amplified by both catalytic ring closing metathesis of profluorescent substrates and ethylene propagation to activate additional units of catalyst. High sensitivity is observed as a result of this dual-mode amplified detection of ethylene. Detection of endogenous ethylene from fruit and oxidation-decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids via lipid peroxides is demonstrated.
40145871	Charge State Tuning of Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride.	Boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are among the most extensively studied optically active spin defects in van der Waals crystals, due to their promising potential to develop two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensors. In this letter, we demonstrate the tunability of the charge state of boron vacancies in ultrathin hBN layers, revealing a transition from the optically active singly negatively charged state to the optically inactive doubly negatively charged state when sandwiched between graphene electrodes. Notably, there is a photoluminescence quenching of a few percent upon the application of a bias voltage between the electrodes. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of considering the charge state of optically active defects in 2D materials, while also showing that the negatively charged boron vacancy remains robust against external perpendicular electric fields. This stability makes it a promising candidate for integration into various van der Waals heterostructures.
40145799	Development of CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Strains for the Cell-Surface Display of a Novel Fusion Acid-Alkaline Phytase.	Phytases enhance phosphorus bioavailability in animal feed, but their limited reusability hinders their application. To overcome this, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> was engineered to display a fusion phytase combining acid and alkaline phytases on its cell surface by using CRISPR/Cas9. The enzyme was anchored via the α-agglutinin-GPI system in two marker-free strains, BY4743::<i>GAP-mGEB</i> and BY4743::<i>GAP-aGEB</i>, employing MFα and Aga2p signal peptides, respectively. Both strains exhibited robust surface activity across a broad pH range, retaining >50% relative activity between pH 1.0 and 7.0, with dual optima at pH 2.0 and 5.0-6.0. Kinetic analysis revealed a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 0.377-0.989 mM and a <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> of 0.014-0.019 μmol/min/mg wet-cell weight, with the Aga2p strain showing the highest efficiency. The fusion phytase exhibited ∼ 3.5-4 times higher activity than the single acid phytase. These strains effectively degraded phytate in soybean, corn flour, and rice bran, demonstrating a sustainable approach for improving phosphorus utilization in animal feed.
40145748	Proceedings of the Clinical Microbiology Open 2024: artificial intelligence applications in clinical microbiology.

Participants included clinical and public health laboratory directors, representatives from government agencies, and biotechnology industry partners. The group engaged in discussions with the theme, "The Lab of the Future." One of the primary topics discussed was artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities in clinical microbiology laboratories. This report summarizes the discussion and sentiment of the group regarding AI tools, opportunities and challenges of AI in clinical laboratories, and potential future directions for AI in clinical microbiology practice.
40145565	Stable Unpaired Electron States in the Lu-Lu Bond Leading to the Absence of Odd-Even Parity in the Kondo Effect of Lu<sub>2</sub>@C<sub>82</sub> Transistors.	Spin qubits constructed in endohedral fullerenes benefit from the protective shielding of the carbon cage, which effectively mitigates external decoherence and enables ultralong coherence times. However, endohedral fullerene spin qubits face the challenge of charge transfer in complex electrical environments, such as during qubit readout or large-scale integration, which can induce spin state modifications. In this study, we developed transistors based on the endohedral fullerene Lu<sub>2</sub>@C<sub>82</sub> and observed the absence of parity dependence in the Kondo effect; this result was contradictory to the typical behavior of the Kondo effect observed in C<sub>60</sub>. Density functional theory calculations revealed that upon electron loss, a spin-1/2 electron predominantly from the <i>s</i>-orbitals formed in the Lu-Lu bond and its orbital energy was significantly lower than that of the highest occupied molecular orbital. Based on these results, Lu<sub>2</sub>@C<sub>82</sub> held stable unpaired electron states across multiple charge states and has potential applications in spin quantum devices.
40145552	Bilayer Kagome Ferrimagnet Exhibiting Exceptional Spontaneous Exchange Bias in TbMn<sub>6</sub>(Ge,Ga)<sub>6</sub>.	Manipulating interlayer interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials has led to intriguing behaviors. Borrowing these 2D signatures to bulk materials is likely to unlock exceptional properties. Here, we report an emergent 2D-like bilayer Kagome ferrimagnet through reducing the interbilayer magnetic interaction to nearly zero. This concept is realized within bulk TbMn<sub>6</sub>(Ge,Ga)<sub>6</sub> compounds, characterized by an isolated and pure Mn Kagome lattice, simply by the chemical substitution of Ge with Ga. Specifically, the targeted compound TbMn<sub>6</sub>Ge<sub>5</sub>Ga<sub>1</sub> exhibits a giant spontaneous exchange bias (SEB) of approximately 1.6 T, which is more than twice that observed in known materials. Field-dependent neutron diffraction reveals the robust nature of the compensated ferrimagnetic (FiM), characterized by almost two-thirds of the moments being pinned and irreversible under fields up to 9 T. Through magnetic and structural analysis, alongside theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the substantial SEB is related to the intense competition between local robust and weak FiM states within the bilayer Kagome configuration, which are stabilized by an incommensurate spin arrangement. The concept of a bilayer Kagome magnet offers new opportunities for discovering attractive properties in 2D-like materials.
40145537	Perovskite phase formation in pure and Sm- and La-substituted BiFeO<sub>3</sub> thin films in isothermal and non-isothermal regimes.	The prototype bismuth ferrite (BiFeO<sub>3</sub>) has been considered a promising multiferroic material for next-generation devices due to its singular features. Still, several critical challenges that have not yet been overcome prevent its full implementation in commercial technologies. The kinetics of BiFeO<sub>3</sub> phase growth in thin films and the effects of trivalent rare earth substitution on the dynamics of phase formation in this system are among the important subjects to be studied. The present work reports a study on the phase formation kinetics in pure BiFeO<sub>3</sub>, samarium-substituted BiFeO<sub>3</sub> (Bi<sub>0.9</sub>Sm<sub>0.1</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub>), and lanthanum-substituted BiFeO<sub>3</sub> (Bi<sub>0.9</sub>La<sub>0.1</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub>) thin films in isothermal and non-isothermal regimes using X-ray diffraction as an investigative tool. Pure BiFeO<sub>3</sub> was the first system to form the perovskite phase, followed by Sm-BiFeO<sub>3</sub> and La-BiFeO<sub>3</sub> films, indicating that the rare-earth cations influence the perovskite formation, and La<sup>3+</sup> is the most effective at delaying the phase formation. The perovskite phase fractions formed as a function of the temperature of different samples were fitted using fourteen appropriate theoretical kinetic models. The data from the pure BiFeO<sub>3</sub> films were best fitted with the second-order model, while the third-order model resulted in better fits for the Sm- and La-substituted thin films. The activation energies determined through the Arrhenius relation were the lowest for pure BiFeO<sub>3</sub> films and the highest for La-BiFeO<sub>3</sub> films. The obtained results indicate that the transition of kinetic models along the system is due to the stoichiometry around the concentrations of the compound used in the synthesis.
40145531	How to estimate the surface coverage of polymer grafted planar substrates and spherical nanoparticles.	Surface coverage is an important parameter in describing the kinetics of adsorption in interface science, the adsorption theory of macromolecules (<i>e.g.</i>, proteins, DNA) on biomaterial surface, the stability of colloids with surface modifications and the application of surfactants at interfaces. In this work, we focus on nanoparticles (NPs) with polymer coatings and, with a mean-field approach, propose a universal theoretical model for calculating the coverage of polymers on planar or spherical substrates at different solvent qualities. Validated by molecular dynamics simulations, our model is applicable to a wide range of polymer morphologies - from partially occluded to completely covered NPs - and provides a novel quantitative approach to characterize this type of polymer patchy particles.
40145443	Plant Tannase: Evolutionary and Functional Divergence Features.	In plants, α/β-hydrolase regulates the hydrolysis of ester compounds, enriching the types and functions of specialized metabolites. In this study, three genes─<i>CsCSE</i>, <i>CsCXE3</i>, and <i>CsTA</i>─which encode caffeoyl shikimate esterase (CSE), carboxylesterase (CXE), and tannase (TA), respectively, were isolated from the tea plant genome through multiomics correlation analysis. Evolutionary analysis showed that CSE and CXE were ancient, whereas TA emerged in core eudicots approximately 120 million years ago. Enzyme activity assays revealed that CsCSE and CsCXE3 catalyze phenolic acid and acetate ester hydrolysis, respectively. Interestingly, CsTA not only has the catalytic function of CsCSE and CsCXE3 but also catalyzes the hydrolysis of galloylated catechin, hydrolyzable tannin, and hormone ester. Overall, CsTA is a newly derived α/β-hydrolase with evolutionary and functional divergence features. This study expands our understanding of the physiological significance of plant TA and provides insights into the potential role of <i>CsTA</i> in the complex metabolic processes of tea plants.
40145418	Spontaneous Generation of an Endogenous RORγt Agonist.	The transcription factor RORγt regulates the development of Th17 cells and their inflammatory cytokine IL-17─a pathway that can both clear bacterial pathogens and drive autoimmune diseases. An endogenous RORγt agonist with a noncanonical structure, a lysophosphatidylethanolamine (1-18:1-LPE or <b>1</b>), was recently identified, and its identity both increases our understanding of immune regulation and creates options for therapeutic intervention. Compound <b>1</b> could be formed directly through enzymatic cleavage of a suitable phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) or by "triggering" of a suitable plasmalogen with accompanying 1,2-acyl migration from the <i>sn</i>-2 to <i>sn</i>-1 positions of glycerol. This study illustrates the plausibility of a plasmalogen-based pathway through synthesis of the plasmalogen precursor (<b>2</b>) and triggering the plasmalogen's electron-rich vinyl ether with small electrophiles characteristic of inflammatory and tumor environments to create 1-18:1-LPE (<b>1</b>). The plasmalogen-based pathway is consistent with previous studies on the formation of <b>1</b>, and it also conforms to Lands rules for acyl chain distribution and provides a mechanism for immune signaling with both spatial and temporal control.
40145409	GSH/pH-sensitive Förster resonance energy transfer nanoparticles for synergistic chemotherapy and chemodynamic therapy.	Stimulus-responsive polymers have attracted significant attention as intelligent and advanced drug delivery systems. In this work, a glutathione-responsive polymer was synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of natural biological molecules lipoic acid and tetraphenylene (TPE)-containing vinyl monomers. The poly(disulfide) block ensures rapid degradation of carriers and drug release under specific conditions. In addition, the introduction of pendant carboxyl groups enables Fe<sup>3+</sup> incorporating capacity and the hydrophobic TPE block significantly boosts drug loading and aggregation induced emission (AIE) for visualization of assembly. Fe<sup>3+</sup> and doxorubicin (DOX) loaded nanoparticles (DOX@Fe NPs) were obtained <i>via</i> coordination and hydrophobic interactions for synergistic chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. Especially, the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between TPE and DOX further enables visualization of DOX release <i>via</i> a fluorescence signal. The <i>in vitro</i> release experiment results demonstrated that under the conditions of pH 5.5 and 5 mM GSH, the release efficiency of DOX reached 79.2% in 12 hours. In the cellular experiment, the viability of 4T1 cells co-incubated with DOX@Fe NPs for 48 hours was only 2.5%, verifying that DOX@Fe NPs possess potent tumor-killing capability.
40145380	Mechanism of microplastic and nanoplastic emission from tire wear.	Tire and brake-wear emissions, in particular nanoparticulate aerosols, can potentially impact human health and the environment adversely. While there is considerable phenomenological data on tire wear, the creation and environmental persistence of particulate pollutants is not well understood. Here, we unequivocally show that normal mechanical tire wear results in two distinct micro and nanoplastic (MNP) populations: a smaller, aerosolized fraction (<10 μm), and larger microplastics. Nanoplastic emissions follow a power law distribution that we show is consistent with the classical arguments of Archard, and Griffiths. Nanoplastic pollution increases dramatically with vehicle speed and weight, as the power law distribution characterizing these gets steeper. Charge stabilization of the tire wear nanoparticles keeps them suspended, while microplastics settle due to gravity. Larger microplastics are formed by sequential wear processes and show a log-normal distribution, as anticipated by Kolmogorov. Thus, the particle size distribution provides mechanistic insights to tire fragmentation: the aerosolized fraction is determined by power input to the tire while the larger microplastics are determined by sequential wear processes due to tire-road surface interactions, independent of vehicle weight and speed.
40145365	Exploring the structure and stability of pentameric amyloid β peptide aggregates in aqueous ammonium-based ionic liquid solutions.	The self-assembly of amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins into fibrils is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble pentamers, particularly those formed in the early stages of Aβ aggregation, are considered highly neurotoxic. This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to explore how trimethylammonium chloride (TMAC), cholinium chloride (ChoC), and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) ionic liquids (ILs) affect the conformational stability and the association mechanism of Aβ pentameters. These ILs, characterized by varying hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, exert differential effects on the conformatioanl flexibility of Aβ pentameters. Computational analyses reveal that TBAC induces greater conformational flexibility and multiple energetically favorable states for the Aβ pentamer, potentially driving the pentamerization process along various pathways to form different polymorphic Aβ fibrillar structures. Moreover, analysis of solvent distributions demonstrates that exchange of water by IL ion pairs at the pentamer's exterior surface primarily occurs beyond the first layer of surface-bound water molecules. Particularly, hydrophobic TBA cations show an enhanced propensity to replace weakly interacting water molecules on the surface. Mechanistic insights derived from umbrella sampling simulations further elucidate how ILs modulate the association/dissociation of Aβ monomers within pentameric aggregates. Our findings indicate that the binding of the Aβ peptide becomes less favorable and the binding free energy decreases when transitioning from TMAC to TBAC solutions, as compared to a pure aqueous solution. Finally, energy landscape analysis of Aβ peptide docking to Aβ pentameters reveals multiple low-energy conformations, which are more dispersed in the presence of ChoC and TBAC solutions, potentially hindering Aβ prefibril growth.
40145146	High-resolution <sup>13</sup>C NMR indicates that changes in the dynamics of polyproline II conformations induce collagen I fibrillogenesis.	Collagen I is a 300 nm long fibrous protein that plays an important role in maintaining the structure of several tissues, such as the dermis, bone, enamel and cornea. In these tissues, collagen is found in the form of fibrils, which can be several microns in length and have different diameters. Collagen-collagen interactions rely mainly on the hydrogen bond (H-bond) network and display a very strong sensitivity to temperature; at the physiological temperature, it forms micro to macro fibrils but tends to be dissolved into a triple helix at 5 °C. It has been argued that the temperature-dependent structural transformation of the more flexible regions of collagen is mainly responsible for this transition. In the present work, we used <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with magic angle spinning (MAS) technique to acquire local and unusual high-resolution information on the conformations and dynamics of collagen in the microfibril form (at the physiological temperature) and dissolved form (at 5 °C). The obtained data showed that at physiological temperatures, about 60% of the dihedral angles in the collagen are in the polyproline II (PII) conformation, which resulted in higher dynamics than the other residues. These residues displayed chemical shifts in previously assigned regions close to amino acids. Alternatively, the regions assigned to imino acid-rich regions displayed the strongest decrease in dynamics in contrast to the remaining conformations. Although the resolution remained relatively good at 5 °C, no strong shift was observed in the NMR spectrum for the other residues, indicating that the temperature affected mainly the PII residues. These results support the previous hypothesis that the PII regions are mainly responsible for the temperature-dependent tunability of collagen into fibrils. These data bring new insights into collagen mechanics and may help understand the impact of collagen defects in related diseases.
40143759	Mechanistic Characterization of Diterpene Synthase Pairs for Tricyclic Diterpenes from Cyanobacteria.	In recent years, genome mining in cyanobacteria has revealed abundant gene clusters related to natural product biosynthesis. However, only a few terpene synthases (TSs) have been identified from this bacterial phylum. Pfam profiles, such as PF03936 and PF19086, which are frequently used for TS retrieval, are built from plant, bacterial, and fungal TSs. Herein, we constructed a new hidden Markov model (HMM) specific to bacterial TSs on the basis of 110 bacterial TSs experimentally validated in recent years. Using this model, we identified a pair of diterpene synthases, Cpt11 (class II TS) and Cts11 (class I TS), in the cyanobacterium <i>Scytonema tolypothrichoides</i>. <i>In vitro</i> experiments demonstrated that Cpt11 catalyzes the formation of <i>syn</i>-copalyl diphosphate from geranylgeranyl diphosphate and that Cts11 subsequently converts <i>syn</i>-copalyl diphosphate into a rare 6,6,7-tricyclic diterpene alcohol. Its biosynthesis was established through isotope labeling experiments, which revealed a unique sequence of a 1,6-proton shift and ring expansion to a seven-membered ring. We solved the crystal structure of Cts11 at a resolution of 1.76 Å. Additionally, via site-directed mutagenesis experiments, we identified two amino acid residues whose exchanges affected the formation of the original diterpene alcohol, leading to the formation of two new compounds: a 6,6,7-tricyclic diterpene hydrocarbon and another 6,6,6-tricyclic diterpene alcohol. A BLAST search revealed several sequences that shared over 70% identity with Cts11 from cyanobacteria that could produce diverse diterpenes. This study demonstrates the potential for cyanobacteria to produce unprecedented terpenoids and lays the foundation for studying the physiological activities of terpenoids in cyanobacteria.
40143676	Enhancing Zinc Bioavailability in Rice Using the Novel Synthetic Siderophore Ligand Proline-2'-Deoxymugineic Acid (PDMA): Critical Insights from Metal Binding Studies and Geochemical Speciation Modeling.	Bioavailable ligands that bind metals mediate their uptake in plants, leading to the study of artificial ligands as potential fertilizers. Proline-2'-deoxymugineic acid (PDMA) has shown a high affinity for Fe<sup>III</sup>, enhancing iron uptake in rice and suggesting that it could be used for improving zinc uptake. This work studied chemical solution parameters, i.e., redox potential, ion strength, pH, and ligand/metal concentrations controlling Zn<sup>II</sup>-PDMA complex formation in rice-producing soils using geochemical speciation modeling. We show that PDMA is generally selective for Zn<sup>II</sup> in reducing, saline, and alkaline soil solutions. Comparison with a recent micronutrient uptake study in rice suggests that free PDMA should be added in reducing conditions to avoid competition with Cu<sup>II</sup> and Fe<sup>III</sup> or as the Zn<sup>II</sup>-PDMA complex at pH below 9. The Zn/M ratios (M = Cu<sup>II</sup>, Fe<sup>III</sup>) needed to form stable Zn<sup>II</sup>-PDMA complexes were also identified. This study shows the promise of PDMA as a fertilizer to overcome zinc deficiencies in alkaline and flooded soils.
40143629	A Hybrid Plasmonic Nanoplatform for One-Pot DNA and Antibody Detection of Hepatitis B, Monkeypox, and Associated Infections.	Currently, nucleic acid and antibody tests for infectious diseases are conducted independently, often resulting in fragmented diagnostics and delayed clinical decision-making. Given the diversity of analytes involved in infectious diseases, comprehensive detection is essential in clinical practice. Here, we introduce One-potNASH, a novel DNA and antibody hybrid plasmonic nanoplatform that unifies nucleic acid and antibody detection within a single assay. By integrating extraction-free thermal lysis of 1 μL of serum, One-potNASH achieves single-DNA copy sensitivity while enhancing antibody detection sensitivity by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to that of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinically, One-potNASH for hepatitis B, monkeypox (MPX), and associated infections can detect DNA and multiplexed antibodies (anti-HBc, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV for hepatitis B and anti-A29L, anti-H3L, and anti-HIV for MPX) with 100% sensitivity and specificity. This integrated approach addresses critical clinical needs by streamlining workflows, reducing diagnosis time, and enabling a comprehensive evaluation of infectious diseases, thereby facilitating rapid therapeutic interventions and improved patient outcomes.
40143540	Bat-Inspired Bionic Bimodal Active Cognitive Electronic Skin with Multisensory Integration Ability.	Empowering intelligent robots with cognitive abilities that rival or even surpass those of humans is the key to enabling more complex and sophisticated interactions. Currently, most electronic skins (e-skins) perform excellently in distinguishing shallow object properties, but they still face significant challenges in perceiving deeper object properties. Here, inspired by the multisensory integrated cognition of echolocation and tactility in bats, a bionic bimodal active cognition (BBAC) e-skin is designed. This e-skin utilizes feature fusion machine learning methods to evolve from passive perception to advanced active cognition and, further, constructs a bimodal enhanced intelligent material cognition system based on multilayer perceptron. This system enables intelligent robotic hands integrated with BBAC e-skin to achieve synergistic cognition of dielectric constant, softness, and material types of 8 smooth surface objects through a simple proximity and contact action without strictly controlling the test conditions, significantly surpassing the ability of humans.
40143535	Record-High-Molecular-Weight Polyesters from Ring-Opening Copolymerization of Epoxides and Cyclic Anhydrides Catalyzed by Hydrogen-Bond-Functionalized Imidazoles.	Polyesters, with potential for degradability and sustainability, are some of the most versatile polymer materials. However, the limitation of molecular weight (MW) presents a barrier to their applications. The synthesis of polyesters with high MW by the ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides and cyclic anhydrides is promising but rare and challenging. Herein, we report a series of air-stable, hydrogen-bond-functionalized imidazole catalysts for the copolymerization. These catalysts can produce polyesters (4 examples) using cyclohexane oxide (CHO), propylene oxide (PO), phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE), 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene 1,2-epoxide (VCHO), and phthalic anhydride (PA) with record-high MW: <i>M</i><sub>n</sub> = 171.2 kDa for poly(CHO-<i>alt</i>-PA), <i>M</i><sub>n</sub> = 518.5 kDa for poly(PO-<i>alt</i>-PA), <i>M</i><sub>n</sub> = 100.5 kDa for poly(PGE-<i>alt</i>-PA), and <i>M</i><sub>n</sub> = 236.4 kDa for poly(VCHO-<i>alt</i>-PA). Furthermore, it can achieve an unprecedented efficiency of 15.6 kg of polyester/g of catalyst at a molar ratio of catalyst/PA/PO = 1:40000:60000. The record-high MW achieved can be attributed to the unique anionic-cationic coexisting ROCOP mechanism, which can reduce transesterification, chain transfer, and annulation side reactions. All high <i>M</i><sub>n</sub> polyesters showed excellent thermal stability, high tensile strength, and a Young's modulus comparable to some commodity thermoplastics like polystyrene and polylactic acid.
40143463	Computer-Aided Molecular Modifications for Enhanced Activity and Thermal Stability of d-Allulose 3-Epimerase.	D-Allulose 3-epimerase (DAE) can convert D-fructose into D-allulose, but its lower activity and poor thermal stability restrict its application in industrial production. This study utilized a semi-rational design and specific site mutations to enhance the enzyme activity and thermal stability of a DAE from <i>Clostridium scindens</i> ATCC 35704 (<i>Csc</i>-DAE) at the same time. Notably, the activities of six mutants (V22I, A25V, Q46I, C212N, G165A, and G267D) and the orderly superimposed double-point mutants were increased by 1.08-1.31 and 1.28-1.64 times that of the wild type (553.7 U/mg), respectively. In addition, A25V/C212N showed good thermal stability, and its optimum temperature (<i>T</i><sub>opt</sub>) was 65 °C and half-life (<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>) was 3.997 h at 60 °C, which increased by 5 °C and 5.76 times, respectively. The conversion ratio reached 30.62 and 31.22% at 65 and 70 °C, respectively, and the structural changes of the mutants were analyzed using molecular docking. These studies provide a beneficial mutation for industrial applications.
40143437	Identifying Candidate Genes for Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.) Fruit Firmness through Genome-Wide Association Studies.	The firmness of grape berries is a critical factor influencing their commercial feasibility and is highly valued by both breeders and consumers. However, grape berry firmness is a complex quantitative trait governed by multiple genes, and our understanding of its genetic regulatory network remains incomplete. To elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying grape berry firmness, this study employed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify potential candidate genes associated with fruit firmness and cellulose content and to explore the gene regulatory network that controls their variation. The comprehensive GWAS results identified <i>CesA</i> as a candidate gene potentially regulating fruit firmness through its involvement in cellulose biosynthesis. To validate these findings, whole-genome gene family identification analysis was conducted. Furthermore, the key gene <i>VvCslD5</i> was selected for functional validation, which included overexpression studies and subcellular localization. This study provides valuable insights into the regulation of biosynthesis and transcriptional signaling pathways that govern the structure of grape cell walls as well as the mechanisms underlying variations in grape firmness. These findings establish a solid foundation for future functional analyses of grape traits and will enhance breeding practices aimed at improving grape quality.
40143405	Chiral All-Inorganic Perovskite Subnanowires.	The phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking during the crystallization of achiral molecules or ions, which leads to the formation of controllable enantiomerically pure crystals, has garnered significant interest but remains a challenge to fully overcome. This presents a particularly formidable obstacle in the creation of three-dimensional (3D) structured chiral all-inorganic perovskites, further complicated by their achiral crystalline space groups. In this report, we successfully synthesized right- or left-handed (P/M) chiral 3D P/M-CsPbX<sub>3</sub> (X = Cl, Cl-Br, Br, Br-I) perovskite subnanowires (SNWs), in which Pb(II) can be partially substituted by hetero ions, such as Cu(II), Sn(II), and Mn(II). The selective control of the SNW handedness was achieved through the strategic incorporation of trace chiral amine enantiomers. The chiroptical activity arises from the helical structure of the SNWs. The mechanisms underlying the formation of this chiral structure were systematically investigated and interpreted by using a thermodynamic model. We utilized the chiral P/M-CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> SNWs to fabricate circularly polarized light (CPL) photodetectors, which exhibited an impressive photocurrent dissymmetry factor (<i>g</i><sub>Iph</sub>) of 0.75. In the field of spin light-emitting diodes (spin-LEDs), circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) was accomplished by employing the SNWs as a dual-functional material that provides both chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) and CPL emission capabilities.
40143386	Degradable Alternating Copolymers from Living Radical Copolymerization of Natural Levoglucosenone and Dienes.	Here, we present an efficient synthetic route to biobased alternating copolymers via the living radical copolymerization of naturally occurring levoglucosenone (LGO) and dienes. By employing reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, well-defined LGO-derived copolymers were readily synthesized featuring high degrees of alternation, well-controlled molecular weights, and excellent end-group fidelity. Additionally, the alternating copolymers exhibited thermal and mechanical properties comparable to those of the commodity polystyrene. Furthermore, an on-demand metathesis degradation was identified, highlighting their potential as degradable materials.
40139964	Functional Characterization of a Highly Efficient Endoglucanase from <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> BJ2022 and Its Application in the Preparation of Low-Molecular-Weight Konjac Glucomannan.	Endoglucanases may not only act on β-1,4-linkages in β-glucan but also target d-glucose in glucomannan, which can expand their utility in the preparation of prebiotics. In this study, a highly efficient endoglucanase (BlGH5) from <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i> BJ2022 was expressed and characterized. BlGH5 exhibited the highest activity at pH 7.0 and 60 °C. It maintained over 80% activity at pH 4.0-7.0 and 30-60 °C. BlGH5 specifically cleaved β-1,4-glycosidic bonds linked to d-glucose. Site-directed mutagenesis results suggested that Arg<sup>91</sup>, Asn<sup>167</sup>, Glu<sup>168</sup>, Trp<sup>206</sup>, His<sup>228</sup>, Tyr<sup>230</sup>, Ser<sup>263</sup>, and Trp<sup>290</sup> are key residues for its binding and catalytic activity. Moreover, BlGH5 displayed high activity against konjac glucomannan (KGM), indicating that BlGH5 could be used to prepare low-molecular-weight konjac glucomannan (KGM-L). Based on the physicochemical properties of KGM and KGM-L, KGM-L was characterized by reduced molecular weight and viscosity. Fecal fermentation experiments demonstrated that KGM and KGM-L could promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Still, KGM-L was more conducive to the growth of the gut probiotics. In conclusion, we identified an endoglucanase for the degradation of KGM. Results indicated that KGM-L would have superior prebiotic effects. Thus, our study provides a basis for the future development and application of KGM-L as a prebiotic.
40139934	Ferroelectrically Enhanced Polarization-Sensitive AuNPs-Deposited α-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>/PdSe<sub>2</sub> Photodetector with Ultrahigh Photoresponsivity and Detectivity.	To enhance the detectivity and overall performance of the device, this study presents a polarization-sensitive photodetector by leveraging the anisotropic in-plane crystal structures of α-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> and PdSe<sub>2</sub>. By incorporation of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and exploiting the ferroelectrically controllable polarization of α-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, the proposed photodetector achieves exceptional polarization detection capabilities. Specifically, aligning the poling direction of α-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> with the <i>a</i>-axis of PdSe<sub>2</sub> and the incorporation of AuNPs yield a remarkable photoresponsivity of 4137 A/W and a detectivity of 1.158 × 10<sup>13</sup> Jones at a near-infrared wavelength of 980 nm, along with a rapid response time of 29 μs. Polarization sensitivity of the device was significantly enhanced by a factor of 5.9, from 2.56 to 15.1, through the poling of the two-dimensional ferroelectric α-In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. These findings represent a substantial advancement in the development of high-performance, polarization-sensitive photodetectors using atomically thin 2D materials, offering new opportunities for next-generation optoelectronic applications.
40139930	Multifunctional Sensitive Positive Friction Layer of TPU/MXene/STO Composited Film for Triboelectric Nanogenerator.	Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are ideal candidates for flexible wearable electronics due to their simple structure, high output voltage, and sensitivity. However, the output of the flexible TENG for wearable electronics still needs further improvement. This study fabricated a positive triboelectric layer with fillers to improve the output equipped with a dense, irregular surface structure by using electrospinning. The effect of the composite filler consisting of conductive MXene nanosheets and ferroelectric strontium titanate nanoparticles was investigated by adjusting their ratio. Compared to pure thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), the voltage and current of the TMS-based (TPU/MXene/STO) TENG increased by 7 and 34 times. Furthermore, the fabricated TENG has been successfully applied in flexible sensing. It can detect the curvature of different object grips and various breathing conditions, making it promising for intelligent sensing and health monitoring applications. This study successfully developed a low-cost, high-performance, and highly sensitive TENG, which shows significant potential in smart wearable devices.
40139807	Fibrous Sphere Architectures for Efficient Daytime Radiative Cooling and Moisture Management.	A radiative cooling nanofabric was designed to reflect incoming solar light, exhibit strong emissivity, and simultaneously provide moisture-wicking properties, making it suitable for personal thermal management in hot outdoor environments. We developed a nanofabric with fibrous sphere architecture, consisting of polyacrylonitrile-SiO<sub>2</sub> and poly(vinylidene fluoride-<i>co</i>-hexafluoropropylene)-TiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers, complementing high solar reflectivity and directional water transport as well as promising thermal and moisture management capabilities. The fibrous sphere architecture possessed excellent solar reflectivity (93%) and strong emissivity (∼0.95). In outdoor conditions under direct sunlight, the nanofabric was shown to reduce skin temperature by 15 °C compared to the cotton textile. Furthermore, the nanofabric exhibited a subambient radiative cooling capacity of 5 °C at noon and 2 °C at nighttime. This nanofabric architecture provides a promising pathway for the development of radiative cooling nanofabrics with integrated sweat/moisture management, enabling personal cooling technologies and heat control in daily life.
40139762	Curcumin Ameliorated Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis While Modulating the Gut Microbiota and Serum Metabolome.	Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is the leading cause of secondary osteoporosis. Recently, the "bone-gut axis" theory has linked bone development with gut microbial diversity, community composition, and metabolites. Curcumin, a well-studied polyphenol, shows potential in mitigating bone loss and osteoporosis. Alendronate, a standard therapeutic agent for osteoporosis, serves as a positive control in this investigation. The study demonstrates the potency of curcumin in reducing bone loss and restoring bone mineral density, enhancing trabecular parameters notably through increased trabecular number, volume, and thickness and reduced bone marrow cavity size. Gut microbiome sequencing revealed that both curcumin and alendronate treatments similarly enhanced gut microbial diversity and altered microbiota composition, increasing beneficial bacteria (<i>Akkermansia</i>_muciniphila, <i>Dubosiella</i>_sp910585105, and <i>Ruminococcus</i>_sp910584195) while reducing harmful bacteria (<i>Treponema</i>_D_sp910584475 and <i>Duncaniella</i>_sp910584825). Furthermore, significant changes in serum levels of metabolites including raffinose, ursolic acid, spermidine, inosine, hypoxanthine, thiamine, and pantothenic acid were observed post-treatment with curcumin or alendronate. Importantly, these beneficial metabolites and microorganisms were negatively correlated with inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, curcumin holds promise for use against GIOP by modulating the gut microbiome and serum metabolome as well as reducing systemic inflammation.
40139734	Exposure Risk Identification and Priority Control List Development of Pesticides in Agricultural Cultivation Areas.	The adverse effects of 33 typical pesticides in dry and paddy lands in typical cultivation areas of China were investigated. First, the resistance and cross-resistance (for target organisms), toxicity, and joint toxicity (for nontarget organisms) of pesticides were evaluated, and nine pesticides with high resistance, three with wide cross-resistance, nine with high toxicity, and one with wide joint toxicity were screened. Second, the optimal synergist control schemes in dry and paddy lands were developed, under which resistance to target organisms (corn aphid, soybean aphid, and rice water weevil) reduced by 23.46%, 46.06%, and 26.36% (maximum), respectively, and toxicity (neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity) to nontarget organisms (ladybird beetle, parasitic wasp, and Chinese mitten crab) reduced by 38.83%, 17.76%, and 15.94% (maximum), respectively. Third, the multitoxicity (neurotoxicity, metabolic toxicity, developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, and respiratory toxicity) adverse outcome pathway based on human health risk was constructed, and 10 pesticides with higher risk and composite risk were identified. Finally, the total exposure risk of 33 typical pesticides was predicted, and a priority control list was proposed. This study provides theoretical guidance for controlling pesticide application to achieve the green and sustainable development of agricultural soils.
40139733	From Plants to Plants: Plant-Derived Biological Polymers as Sustainable and Safe Nanocarriers for Direct Delivery of DNA to Plant Cells.	Sustainable plant-derived biopolymers cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and Zein protein were used to deliver plasmid DNA with a reporter GFP gene (pDNA) to plant cells. CNC and Zein were modified with the cationic agent 2,3-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (EPTMAC) to electrostatically bind the biopolymers to negatively charged pDNA. Established pDNA-CNC and pDNA-Zeins conjugates were delivered to tobacco cells by leaf injection and vacuum infiltration of tobacco leaves and seedlings. Both methods effectively provided transient GFP expression in exposed plant cells that was visualized by confocal microscopy and confirmed by qRT-PCR (GFP gene expression) and Western blot (GFP protein expression). Our findings support the idea that nanopolymers derived from agricultural waste residues can successfully be used to advance plant transformation and gene editing. Delivering genetic material using biocompatible, plant-based nanopolymers in large-scale vacuum infiltration of plant tissues reduces existing limitations of plant transformation and increases the speed of the transformation process.
40138795	Dissipationless edge transport in single-layer topological insulator Bi<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub>based device under high vacancy concentration.	Single-layer Bismuth Monobromide (SL-Bi<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub>) is a recently experimentally confirmed room temperature quantum spin hall insulator with a relatively large bulk band gap. In this paper, we investigate the electronic properties of SL-Bi<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub>and single-layer bismuth monobromide nanoribbon (SL-Bi<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub>NR) introducing different vacancy defects near the nanoribbon edges. With maximally localized wannier function (MLWF) constructed Hamiltonian we show that SL-Bi<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub>NR edge states are protected by bulk topology and robust against disorder. In conjunction with MLWF and non-equilibrium Green's function, we also show that in devices made from SL-Bi<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub>, transmission through the topologically protected edge states do not suffer from degradation when the device is sufficiently wide. Increasing channel length and defect concentration affect only the bulk states transmission leaving edge states transmission perfectly quantized. This resilience against disorder signifies SL-Bi<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>4</sub>'s promising candidacy for next-generation electronic & spintronics devices application.
40138702	Subnanometric Nickel Phosphide Heteroclusters with Highly Active Ni<sup>δ+</sup>-P<sup>δ-</sup> Pairs for Nitrate Reduction toward Ammonia.	The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the neutral nitrate reduction reaction (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>RR) toward ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is essential to address the environmental issues caused by NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> but remains considerably challenging owing to the sluggish reaction kinetics of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>RR in neutral media. Herein, we report subnanometric heteroclusters with strongly coupled nickel-phosphorus (Ni-P) dual-active sites as electrocatalysts to boost the neutral NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>RR. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the subnanometric feature of Ni-P heteroclusters promotes the electron transfer from Ni to P, generating Ni<sup>δ+</sup>-P<sup>δ-</sup> active pairs, in which Ni<sup>δ+</sup> species are highly active for the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>RR and P<sup>δ-</sup> tunes the interfacial water hydrogen bonding network to promote the water dissociation step and accelerate proton transfer during the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>RR. Consequently, in the neutral NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>RR, Ni-P heteroclusters exhibit a large NH<sub>3</sub> yield rate of 0.61 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> at -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is 2.8- and 3.3-fold larger than those on Ni-P nanoparticles and Ni clusters, respectively, and the generated NH<sub>3</sub> exists as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in electrolytes. This study offers an efficient approach to boosting electrocatalytic reactions with multiple intermediates by designing subnanometric heteroclusters with strongly coupled active sites.
40138698	Methanol to Olefins (MTO): Understanding and Regulating Dynamic Complex Catalysis.	The research and development of methanol conversion into hydrocarbons have spanned more than 40 years. The past four decades have witnessed mutual promotion and successive breakthroughs in both fundamental research and industrial process development of methanol to olefins (MTO), demonstrating that MTO is an extremely dynamic, complex catalytic system. This Perspective summarizes the endeavors and achievements of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in the continuous study of reaction mechanisms and process engineering of the dynamic, complex MTO reaction system. It elucidates fundamental chemical issues concerning the essence of the dynamic evolution of the MTO reaction and the cross-talk mechanisms among diffusion, reaction, and catalyst (coke modification), which are crucial for technology development and process optimization. By integrating the chemical principles, the reaction-diffusion model, and coke formation kinetics of MTO, a mechanism- and model-driven modulation of industrial processes has been achieved. The acquisition of a deepening understanding in chemistry and engineering has facilitated the continuous optimization and upgrading of MTO catalysts and processes.
40138671	De Novo Design of Proteins for Autocatalytic Isopeptide Bond Formation.	Isopeptide bonds (IPBs)─formed between the amine group of a Lys residue and the carboxamide/carboxy group of Asn/Gln or Asp/Glu─play essential roles in many biological processes, ranging from cellular signaling and regulation to blood clotting and bacterial pathogenesis. The formation of IPBs is not a spontaneous process and requires enzymatic machinery that provides a specialized active site environment to enable this challenging catalytic reaction. Here we report the de novo design and characterization of two proteins (dnIPB-1 and dnIPB-2) capable of autocatalytic IPB formation. While these designed proteins preserve the key active-site residues of their structural template (the bacterial pilin protein RrgA), they possess less than 31% sequence identity to RrgA. Extensive structural and Ala-scanning analyses indicate that IPB formation requires a solvent-protected core motif composed of several critical residues, yet there is also a large tolerance to different protein topologies and overall protein sizes in terms of accommodating an IPB-forming motif. Notably, the structural insights gained from the study of dnIPB-1 and dnIPB-2 also guided the redesign of an initially failed construct (dnIPB-3) and enabled it to form an IPB, highlighting the value of de novo design in examining sequence-structure-function relationships not explored in natural evolution. Our study highlights the versatility of IPBs as designable elements which can be used to construct functional proteins or protein-based materials with enhanced chemical, thermal, and mechanical stabilities.
40138661	Force Generation by Enhanced Diffusion in Enzyme-Loaded Vesicles.	The diffusion coefficient of some metabolic enzymes increases with the concentration of their cognate substrate, a phenomenon known as enhanced diffusion. In the presence of substrate gradients, enhanced diffusion induces enzymatic drift, resulting in a nonhomogeneous enzyme distribution. Here, we study the effects of enhanced diffusion on enzyme-loaded vesicles placed in external substrate gradients using a combination of computer simulations and analytical modeling. We observe that the spatially inhomogeneous enzyme profiles generated by enhanced diffusion result in a pressure gradient across the vesicle, which leads to macroscopically observable effects, namely deformation and self-propulsion of the vesicle. Our analytical model allows us to characterize the dependence of the velocity of propulsion on experimentally tunable parameters. The effects predicted by our work provide an avenue for further validation of enhanced diffusion, and might be leveraged for the design of novel synthetic cargo transporters, such as targeted drug delivery systems.
40138625	Photolytic Access to Oxaspirodecanes and Chromenes from Vinyldiazo Ester Cycloaddition with <i>p</i>-Quinones: A Vinylcarbene Is Not Involved.	Synthetic methods that provide access to skeletally diverse heterocyclic motifs are poised to accelerate drug discovery and streamline the synthesis of advanced intermediates and materials. However, the development of such synthetic methods necessitates leveraging previously unexplored mechanistic pathways. We report herein an efficient blue light-emitting diode light-induced reaction of vinyldiazoacetates and quinones that produces spirocyclic dihydrofurans, featuring the synthetically challenging oxaspiro[4,5]decane core of numerous medicinal agents, agrochemicals, and natural products. In a departure from the well-established photochemical reactivity of diazo compounds, these reactions do not involve vinylcarbene intermediates formed by photolytic dinitrogen extrusion. Instead, they result from photoexcitation of the quinone to its triplet state with subsequent triplet energy transfer to the vinyldiazo ester. The subsequent addition of the vinylogous carbon of the triplet vinyldiazoacetate to the quinone oxygen affords the triplet diradical that collapses to the spirocyclic dihydrofuran upon the loss of dinitrogen. A strain release-driven and Bro̷nsted acid-catalyzed rearrangement of the spirocyclic products unravels the fused bicyclic ring system of equally synthetically and medicinally valuable chromenes, enabling facile skeletal diversification of the important heterocyclic motifs.
40138615	Soft Biological Actuators for Meter-Scale Homeostatic Biohybrid Robots.	Skeletal muscle's elegant protein-based architecture powers motion throughout the animal kingdom, with its constituent actomyosin complexes driving intra- and extra-cellular motion. Classical motors and recently developed soft actuators cannot match the packing density and contractility of individual muscle fibers that scale to power the motion of ants and elephants alike. Accordingly, the interdisciplinary fields of robotics and tissue engineering have combined efforts to build living muscle actuators that can power a new class of robots to be more energy-efficient, dexterous, and safe than existing motor-powered and hydraulic paradigms. Doing so ethically and at scale─creating meter-scale tissue constructs from sustainable muscle progenitor cell lines─has inspired innovations in biomaterials and tissue culture methodology. We weave discussions of muscle cell biology, materials chemistry, tissue engineering, and biohybrid design to review the state of the art in soft actuator biofabrication. Looking forward, we outline a vision for meter-scale biohybrid robotic systems and tie discussions of recent progress to long-term research goals.
40138541	Limited Electron-Dominated Electrorheological Response with TiO<sub>2</sub> Buffer Layer.	We report porous carbon sphere electrorheological (ER) nanoparticles coated with a titanium dioxide layer (HCs@TiO<sub>2</sub>). Utilizing the buffering effect of amorphous TiO<sub>2</sub>, the HCs@TiO<sub>2</sub> ER fluid (ERF) shows a yield stress that exceeds that of previous carbon-based ER nanomaterials. The mechanisms of the high ER response are elucidated through the analysis of the dielectric properties, demonstrating that the amorphous TiO<sub>2</sub> shell not only restricts the electron-dominated motion but also significantly improves the interfacial polarization. Furthermore, the HCs@TiO<sub>2</sub> ERF exhibits superior sedimentation stability and low current density, which is attributed to the formation of a hydrogen bond network. The rheological behavior of HCs@TiO<sub>2</sub> ERF is analyzed using the Bingham and Cho-Choi-Jhon model, where the dynamic yield stress as a function of electric field strength is fitted using a generalized yield stress equation. These analyses indicate that local electrostatic accumulation between the hybrid shells benefits the ER response.
40138526	Pyridine-N-Anchored Ag Strategy Facilitated Br<sup>-</sup> Adsorption via Ultrahigh Exposure and Coordination Unsaturation of Ag.	Traditional adsorbents using silver nanoparticles demonstrated exceptional adsorption capacities for Br<sup>-</sup>. However, the majority of the adsorption sites in silver nanoparticles are situated on their surfaces, limiting the interaction of internal atoms with Br<sup>-</sup>. Therefore, we synthesized Ag/UiO-bpy MOF by utilizing the two pyridine nitrogen atoms in the ligand to anchor silver. So each silver atom was effectively exposed. Besides, owing to the coordinatively unsaturated state of the silver atoms, they exhibited a stronger adsorption affinity for Br<sup>-</sup>. As a result, Ag/UiO-bpy demonstrated an exceptional Br<sup>-</sup> adsorption capacity of 362.6 mg/g. Notably, the adsorption capacity with respect to silver was 2083.9 mg/g<sub>Ag</sub>, which surpasses all previously reported values in the literature. Furthermore, Ag/UiO-bpy exhibited rapid kinetics and exceptional selectivity in Br<sup>-</sup> adsorption experiments. This work not only fabricated a Br<sup>-</sup> adsorbent with a high adsorption capacity but also proposed a new and innovative strategy for the subsequent preparation of Br<sup>-</sup> adsorbents.
40138478	Rotation-Symmetry Grating Contact Photodetector for Visible Full Linear Polarimetry Detection.	Integrated linearly polarized (LP) light detectors hold importance for next-generation optoelectronic systems. However, current compact LP photodetectors relying on the scalar anisotropic absorption of natural materials or the bipolar polarization photoresponse of artificial structures are usually unable to achieve full polarization angle detection or are restricted to the long-infrared waveband. Here, we report a photodetector by integrating InSe flakes with three-fold rotation-symmetry grating contacts for zero-bias full linear polarimetry detection. The photodetector creates an asymmetric junction interface driven by the polarization-dependent propagating surface plasmon polariton wave, generating a zero-bias bipolar polarization photoresponse. By direct measurement of the photocurrents, linear polarization angle and incident power intensity detection can be achieved in a single device at 633 nm. Moreover, we demonstrate the decoding of polarization-angle-encrypted information, showing the great potential of the proposed devices in polarization information processing. Our work offers a promising strategy for developing compact full linear polarimetry photodetectors.
40138468	Host Defense Peptide-Mimicking Poly(2-oxazoline)s Displaying Potent Activities toward Phytopathogens to Alleviate Antimicrobial Resistance in Agriculture.	Given the limited types of agricultural bactericides and the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance, bacterial plant diseases pose a serious threat to agricultural production, which calls for effective antimicrobial agents with a low propensity for resistance. Host defense peptides (HDPs) have drawn significant attention for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, we found that HPD-mimicking poly(2-oxazoline) Gly-POX<sub>20</sub> exhibits potent activity against bacterial phytopathogens, with superior antibacterial selectivity and proteolytic stability compared to the natural HDP melittin. Compared to commonly used agricultural bactericides, Gly-POX<sub>20</sub> displays more efficient antibiofilm activity and a lower propensity for resistance than does the antibiotic streptomycin, likely due to its antibacterial mechanism, which involves DNA interaction and generating lethal doses of ROS. <i>In vivo</i> studies reveal that Gly-POX<sub>20</sub> is effective in preventing and treating phytopathogens without observable damage to plant tissues, suggesting that poly(2-oxazoline) could be a promising bactericide for agricultural applications.
40138379	Engineering Acidic Resistance in UDP-Galactose 4-Epimerase Enables Efficient UDP-Galactose Synthesis from Sucrose.	Uridine diphosphate galactose (UDP-Gal) provides galactosyl units for active carbohydrate biosynthesis; however, limited availability and high costs hamper large-scale applications. In the two-enzyme cascade system of UDP-Gal synthesis, the pH conflict between UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (GALE) and sucrose synthase (Susy) blocks UDP-Gal production. Therefore, surface charge engineering was conducted to obtain a variant (GALE<sub>M2</sub>) with improved acid resistance. GALE<sub>M2</sub> enzyme activity reached 214.26 ± 0.20% that of wild-type GALE at pH 6.5. Its half-life time increased by 2 h at pH 6.5, and the pH resistance range was widened effectively with local surface charge reshaping and a decreased isoelectric point. An improved flexibility of the substrate entrance enhanced the catalytic performance under acidic conditions. Cascading GALE<sub>M2</sub> and Susy<sub>M6</sub> yielded UDP-Gal (24.5 mM) with a space-time yield of 12 g/L/h within 1.25 h, demonstrating the robust route of short reaction time and high efficiency, for rapid UDP-Gal synthesis from readily available sucrose via cascade catalysis.
40138206	Nonzero Berry curvature dipole, magnetic gapped edge states and persistent spin texture in a rotational symmetry preserved van der Waals magnetic topological insulator.	Berry curvature dipole and persistent spin textures are unconventional quantum marvels with paramount relevance towards nonlinear transport phenomena and futuristic spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate that a magnetic van der Waals (vdW) heterobilayer, comprised of semiconducting monolayers 1H-MoSe<sub>2</sub> (nonmagnetic) and ferromagnet 1H-VSe<sub>2</sub>, exhibits a finite Berry curvature dipole (<i>D</i><sub>Bcd</sub>) in the absence of strain or twist perturbation, where each constituent layer displays no <i>D</i><sub>Bcd</sub> owing to three-fold (<i>C</i><sub>3v</sub>) rotational symmetry. A change in sign of <i>D</i><sub>Bcd</sub> is observed over an energy range, suggesting its oscillatory nature. Further, persistent spin texture (PST) with small spin canting and a prominent magnetic gap of 190 meV have emerged in the edge state spectrum of the vdW system. We find the emerged topological properties are crystal facet dependent. Moreover, an exotic quantum state of intrinsic spin-valley locking at two inequivalent K valleys with distinct spin identity is observed in the dispersion relation. We explore the subtle role of spin-valley locking in the generation of a finite <i>D</i><sub>Bcd</sub>, which has not been previously discussed in this context. Such quantum states promote right and left handed circular polarization and are perceived as a binary catalogue for information encoding and energy. Further, the role of symmetry breaking in the observed phenomena of the AB-stacked vdW heterobilayer is discussed. We propose that both time reversal symmetry breaking and spin-valley locking are essential for inducing nonzero <i>D</i><sub>Bcd</sub> in an AB stacked vdW heterostructure, where the three-fold (<i>C</i><sub>3</sub>) rotational symmetry is preserved along the <i>z</i>-axis only.
40136068	Improved Production and Rheological Properties of Exopolysaccharides by Co-Overexpression of β-1,3-Glucan Synthase and UDP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase Genes in <i>Ganoderma lingzhi</i>.	The β-1,3-glucan synthase gene 2 (<i>gls2</i>) from the biosynthetic pathway of polysaccharides was cloned and overexpressed in <i>G. lingzhi</i>. The content of intracellular polysaccharides in the <i>gls2</i> overexpression strain was 22.96 mg/100 mg of dry weight, 20% higher than that in the wild-type (WT) strain. The effect of co-overexpression of <i>gls2</i>, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene (<i>ugp</i>), and <i>gls</i> on polysaccharide biosynthesis was also investigated in <i>G. lingzhi</i>. The production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) in the G2-U-G transformants was 62% higher than that in the WT strain. Moreover, EPS from G2-U-G transformants had a higher molecular weight and glucose levels (6.3 × 10<sup>3</sup> kDa and 89.19%) than those from the WT strain (4.8 × 10<sup>3</sup> kDa and 78.15%), respectively. Furthermore, they showed higher viscosity, greater thixotropy, and a stronger gel network than EPS from the WT strain. Overall, this study contributes to the efficient production, development, and application of <i>Ganoderma</i> exopolysaccharides.
40136059	High Nitrogen Enhances Maize Susceptibility to <i>Holotrichia parallela</i> via β-Caryophyllene-Mediated Olfactory Recognition and Jasmonate Suppression.	Excessive nitrogen application not only affects plant development but also significantly influences plant-pest interactions. This study investigates how nitrogen fertilization modifies the metabolism of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and its interaction with <i>Holotrichia parallela</i>, a key soil-dwelling pest. High-nitrogen (HN) conditions increased the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with β-caryophyllene and palmitic acid strongly attracting larvae behavior selection, and β-caryophyllene attracting female oviposition. RNA interference targeting <i>HparOR19</i> and <i>HparOR22</i> genes confirmed the role of β-caryophyllene in pest olfactory recognition. Conversely, low-nitrogen (LN) conditions stimulated jasmonic acid (JA)-related defenses, while HN promoted the production of primary metabolites such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose, which act as feeding stimulants. These findings highlight the intricate relationship among nitrogen fertilization, maize metabolism, and pest behavior, underscoring the necessity of integrating metabolic insights into effective pest management strategies.
40136058	Order-Disorder Transition Induced Dynamic Rashba Effect in 2D Halide Perovskites.	Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites exhibit pronounced Rashba splitting, positioning them as promising candidates for spintronic applications. However, the underlying mechanism of inversion symmetry breaking and its impact on excitonic optical properties remains elusive. In this study, we investigate a series of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites and reveal that the order-disorder transition induced by phenyl-based cations triggers a dynamic Rashba effect. At the critical temperature, we observe a reduction in exciton recombination lifetime, an increase in circularly polarized photoluminescence, and a 3-fold enhancement in polarization by constructing a van der Waals heterostructure. Theoretical calculations indicate that local inversion symmetry breaking, driven by the slight displacement of Pb atoms, is the key mechanism underlying the dynamic Rashba effect. These findings establish the dynamic Rashba effect as a critical mechanism governing exciton dynamics, offering valuable insights into advancing spintronic and optoelectronic technologies based on 2D perovskites.
40136044	Dimension Control of Hexagonal SiGe Single Branched Nanowires.	Hexagonal SiGe, with its direct band gap, holds promising light-emission properties and potential for advanced optoelectronic applications. The growth of this material has been achieved as nanowires, within core-shell or multibranch trunk structures. However, core-shell designs are limited to radial growth, restricting the axial dimensional control, while multibranch structures lack growth precision, reducing their practical applicability. Here, we introduce a novel technique to grow hexagonal SiGe as single-branched nanowires, achieving unprecedented control over dimension and morphology. The branch diameter is precisely tuned by adjusting the trunk diameter, leveraging the use of the same Au catalyst particle throughout both trunk and branch growth. We investigate the growth rate and its diameter dependency within the Gibbs-Thomson framework, providing valuable insights into growth dynamics. This innovative method opens new opportunities for advanced studies on hexagonal SiGe, paving the way for developing next-generation quantum devices.
40136011	Reflective Learning as a Pathway to Professional Self-Actualization in Simulation-Based Learning: A Qualitative Case Study.	Simulation-based learning (SBL) is essential in health care education, integrating theoretical knowledge with practical experience through reflective learning in debriefs. Although reflective learning during postsimulation debriefs enhances theory-practice integration, its role in fostering intrinsic motivation and professional self-actualization is not fully understood.This study examines how reflective learning, rooted in humanistic learning principles, influences students' self-actualization in the Critical Care Flight Paramedic Program (CCFPP). Specifically, it seeks to understand how and why reflective learning influences CCFPP students' intrinsic motivation, professional growth, and self-actualization through the framework of Self-Determination Theory (SDT).
40136010	Identification of Novel Umami Peptides from Low-Salt Dry-Cured Ham Skin and Revelation of the Umami Mechanism through Molecular Docking with T1R1/T1R3.	Dry-cured ham is highly favored by consumers due to its unique flavor, which is attributed to its various umami peptides. Four novel umami peptides were isolated from the skin of low-salt dry-cured ham. Sensory evaluations and electronic tongue analysis demonstrated that these peptides exhibited umami thresholds of 0.125-0.5 mg/mL. Molecular docking with the T1R1/T1R3 receptor gave binding energies ranging from -8.6 to -7.638 kcal/mol, demonstrating that hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces represent the main forces involved in the binding of these peptides to the umami receptor. Hydrogen bonding significantly enhance the binding stability, while the van der Waals forces optimize the binding conformation to promote conduction of the umami signal. These findings confirm the presence of novel umami peptides in the skin of low-salt dry-cured ham, thereby enriching the umami peptide database and providing a theoretical basis for the high-value utilization of byproducts in livestock product processing.
40135935	Inner-Outer Sheath Synergistic Shielding of Polysulfides in Asymmetric Solvent-Based Electrolytes for Stable Sodium-Sulfur Batteries.	Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries are garnering interest owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the notorious shuttle behavior of sodium polysulfides (NaPS) and uncontrollable dendrite growth lead to the poor cycle stability of RT Na-S cells. In this work, we report the use of 1,2-dimethoxypropane (DMP) and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether (TFTFE) as inner solvent and outer diluent, respectively, in a localized high-concentration electrolyte system. Impressively, the asymmetric DMP as the inner solvent, introduced to replace the conventional solvent 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), shields NaPS effectively from incorporation into the inner solvation structure due to the extra methyl groups in the molecular structure. Furthermore, the TFTFE diluent, which contains electron-withdrawing perfluoro segments (-CF<sub>3</sub>- and -CF<sub>2</sub>-), exhibits significantly low solvation power. Consequently, the outer sheath TFTFE diluent further minimizes NaPS dissolution, thereby enhancing the cycle stability. This inner-outer sheath synergistic effect leads to the formation of highly effective cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers simultaneously, significantly alleviating the shuttle effect and reducing the side reactions between NaPS and sodium metal. Remarkably, the Na-S cells with the designed electrolyte present long-cycling reversibility with 530 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> over 600 cycles at a C/2 rate and a low capacity decay rate of 0.077% per cycle. This study provides a profound understanding of the electrolyte structure involving NaPS and offers a firm basis for the rational design of electrolytes for rechargeable metal-sulfur battery systems.
40135773	Adding a Twist to Lateral Flow Immunoassays: A Direct Replacement of Antibodies with Helical Affibodies, from Selection to Application.	Immunoreagents, most commonly antibodies, are integral components of lateral flow immunoassays. However, the use of antibodies comes with limitations, particularly relating to their reproducible production, and poor thermal and chemical stability. Here, we employ phage display to develop affibodies, a class of nonimmunoglobulin affinity proteins based on a small three-helix bundle scaffold, against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Subsequently, we demonstrate the utility and viability of affibodies to directly replace antibodies in lateral flow immunoassays. In addition, we highlight several physiochemical advantages of affibodies, including their ability to withstand exposure to high temperature and humidity while maintaining superior performance compared to their antibody counterparts. Furthermore, we investigate the adsorption mechanism of affibodies to the surface of gold nanoparticle probes via a His<sub>6</sub>-tag, introduced to also facilitate recombinant purification. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate the structural and physical characteristics of affibody dimers which result in high-performing detection probes when immobilized on nanoparticle surfaces. This work demonstrates that affibodies can be used as direct replacements to antibodies in immunoassays and should be further considered as alternatives owing to their improved physiochemical properties and modular design.
40135735	Two-Dimensional, Chiral Colloidal Superlattices Engineered with DNA Origami.	Colloidal crystal engineering is widely recognized as a superior method for creating novel materials in multiple fields. However, achieving chiral superlattices of nanoparticles remains a considerable challenge so far. Here, we spread a two-dimensional (2D), microscale DNA origami array on substrate surfaces to maintain its planar conformation onto which DNA-encoded metal nanoparticles are attached to designated positions, thereby creating 2D chiral superlattices. By designing programmable chiral patterns of DNA sticky ends within the DNA origami units, we realize a variety of 2D chiral superlattices over large areas with well-defined chiral configurations of nanoparticle arrangements. The underlying chiral optical mechanism of the superlattices is revealed, showing the essential role of local plasmonic couplings within the repeating units. This research represents the first example of DNA-programmed 2D chiral superlattices of nanoparticles assembled directly on a substrate surface, with the potential to impact future studies in on-chip integrated metamaterials, photonics, optoelectronics, and related fields.
40135706	Imaging the Néel Vector in Few-Layer CrPS<sub>4</sub> with Second-Harmonic Generation.	Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a powerful technique for probing the crystallographic symmetry. Recently, SHG has also been shown to exhibit sensitivity to time-reversal symmetry, allowing studies of magnetic order in layered antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. Here, we report SHG investigation of chromium thiophosphate (CrPS<sub>4</sub>), a layered A-type AFM material with a finite/zero net magnetization for odd/even-layer-number crystals, respectively. The SHG intensity of bulk CrPS<sub>4</sub> across its Néel temperature reveals that both crystallographic and magnetic symmetry breaking contribute to SHG at low temperatures. From the polarization analysis, we identify the tensor element linked to the magnetic order. Interestingly, the polarization response is sensitive to the history of the magnetic field applied to the even-number-layer crystals, suggesting that the SHG is sensitive to the Néel vector direction. Polarized SHG microscopy of a terraced CrPS<sub>4</sub> shows that the AFM order of even-number-layer regions is determined by the ferromagnetic order of the neighboring odd-number-layer regions.
40135632	Dynamic and Diverse Coacervate Architectures by Controlled Demembranization.	The dynamics of membranes are integral to regulating biological pathways in living systems, particularly in mediating intra- and extracellular communication between membraneless and membranized nano- and microcompartments. Mimicking these dynamics using biomimetic cell structures deepens our understanding of biologically driven processes, including morphological transformations, communication, and molecular sequestration within distinct environments (e.g., (membraneless) organelles, cytoplasm, cells, and the extracellular matrix). In this context, the demembranization of membranized coacervates represents a promising approach to endow them with additional functionalities and dynamic reconfiguration capabilities in response to external or biological stimuli. This versatility broadens their applicability in synthetic biology, systems biology, and biotechnology. Here, we present a strategy for controlled demembranization of membranized coacervate droplets. The membranized coacervates are created by coating membraneless coacervates with terpolymer-based nanoparticles to form a solid-like membrane. The addition of an anionic polysaccharide then triggers the demembranization process arising from electrostatic competition with the membrane components, resulting in polysaccharide-containing demembranized coacervate droplets. This membranization/demembranization process not only allows for the controlled structural reconfiguration of the coacervate entities but also varies their permeability toward (biological) (macro)molecules and nano- and microscale objects. Additionally, integrating an additional polymersome layer in this process facilitates the creation of bilayer and ″Janus-like″ membranized coacervates, advancing the development of coacervate protocells with hierarchical and asymmetric membrane structures. Our work highlights the control over both membranization and demembranization processes of coacervate protocells, establishing a platform for creating advanced protein-containing synthetic protocells with dynamic and diverse (membrane(less)) architectures.
40135544	Enhanced bonding intensity between the vertically aligned carbon fiber thermal interface material and heat spreader of a flip-chip package through a silane coupling agent.	Flip chips have been widely used in microelectronic packaging to meet the requirements of high density and optimal performance; the thermal interface material (TIM) is the primary bottleneck for heat dissipation in flip-chip packages. Vertically aligned thermal pads offer higher thermal conductivity compared with thermal gels, yet their poor interface bonding strength makes their application challenging. In this study, a silane coupling agent (KH550) was applied to improve the bonding strength between the TIM and heat spreader (HS). The presence of the silane coupling agent intermediate layer enabled the TIM and HS to be connected <i>via</i> covalent bonds, greatly improving their bonding strength. The shear strength of the interface between the TIM and HS was increased by 610.7%, and the interface thermal resistance was decreased by 52.78%. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to investigate the interface bonding mechanism.
40135539	Enhancing the Catalytic Efficiency of l-Rhamnose Isomerase for d-Allose Synthesis through Simultaneous Engineering of Noncatalytic and Catalytic Pockets.	d-Allose is a crucial rare sugar that holds significant application value in the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries. The most prevalent method for the production of d-allose is its conversion from d-allulose, which is catalyzed by l-rhamnose isomerase (l-RI). However, this enzyme demonstrates relatively low catalytic efficiency toward d-allulose. To enhance the catalytic efficiency of l-RI derived from <i>Clostridium stercorarium</i>, key amino acids in the noncatalytic pockets were mutated to improve the probability of d-allulose entering the catalytic pocket and to increase the local concentration of the substrate in the active region. Simultaneously, the impact of steric hindrance on the lid around the catalytic pocket was reduced by mutating the amino acid His99. Notably, the catalytic efficiency of the combined mutant E53D/A142G/E273D/H99A toward d-allulose was increased by 170% compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> 168 whole cells expressing this l-RI variant achieved a 36.5% conversion rate of d-allose from 100 g/L d-allulose within 90 min. This study presents a highly efficient biocatalyst with the potential for industrial production of d-allose.
40135535	Exploring the electronic properties of carbon nanoflake-based charge transport materials for perovskite solar cells: a computational study.	Carbon-based materials, in particular carbon nanoflakes (CNFs) and carbon quantum dots (CQDs), have been increasingly used in charge transport layers and electrodes for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). There are practically limitless possibilities of designing such materials with different sizes, shapes and functional groups, which allow modulating their properties such as band alignment and charge transport. Solid state packing further modifies these properties. However, there is still limited insight into the electronic properties of these types of materials as a function of their chemical composition, structure, and packing. Here, we compute the dependence of band alignment and charge transport characteristics on the size, chemical composition, and structure of commonly accessible types of nanoflakes and functional groups and further consider the effect of their packing. We use a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and density functional-based tight binding (DFTB) to get electronic structure level insight at length scales (nanoflake sizes) relevant to the experiment. We find that CNFs must have sizes as small as 1.3 nm to provide band alignments suitable for their use as hole transport materials in PSCs containing the commonly used methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. We show that both shape and functionalization can significantly modify the band alignment of the CNF, by more than half an electron volt. Inter-flake interactions further modify the band alignment, in some cases by about half an electron volt. CNFs having small sizes possess sufficient inter-flake electronic coupling for efficient hole transport. In contrast, no shape or size of CNFs produces band alignment suitable for their use as electron transport materials.
40135523	Freestanding Perovskite and Brownmillerite SrCoO<sub><i>x</i></sub> Membranes for Direct Imaging of Topotactic Phase Transitions.	Topotactic phase transitions between perovskite SrCoO<sub>3</sub> and brownmillerite SrCoO<sub>2.5</sub> have garnered attention for application in energy-efficient neuromorphic computing systems. However, the evolution of local microstructures, crucial for designing topotactic devices and improving switching performance, remains underexplored due to the limitations of epitaxial thin films bound to bulk substrates. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of topotactic oxide SrCoO<sub><i>x</i></sub> as a freestanding membrane, successfully stabilizing both perovskite and brownmillerite phases. Plan-view transmission electron microscopy identifies the extraordinary formation of filamentary one-dimensional (1D) domains of SrCoO<sub>2.5</sub> phases during the topotactic phase transition, correlated with the 1D oxygen vacancy channels that facilitate rapid oxygen ion diffusion. These 1D domains serve as direct evidence of the anisotropic nature of the topotactic phase transition, dictated by oxygen diffusion. These findings also underscore the advantages of freestanding membrane geometries for developing a fundamental understanding of phase transitions in complex oxides.
40135499	Fluorinated Ribonucleocarbohydrate Nanoparticles Allow Ultraefficient mRNA Delivery and Protein Expression in Tumor-Associated Myeloid Cells.	Ribonucleic acids (RNA) are commonly formulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNP) for in vivo use, but challenges exist with systemic delivery and low in vivo expression efficiency. Inspired by ribonucleoprotein complexes in cells, we created synthetic ribonucleocarbohydrate (RNC) complexes based on cyclodextrin nanoparticles with ferrocenyl fluorocarbons capable of carrying mRNA and additional small-molecule drug payloads, facilitating lysosomal escape and immune stimulation all in the same nanoparticle. We show that this strategy results in highly efficient myeloid cell targeting (dendritic cells and MHC expressing macrophages) and protein expression following systemic administration. The RNC platform should have broad applications in vaccine development, immunosuppression, and immunostimulation for various diseases.
40135497	Advances in hot carrier relaxation dynamics of perovskites with ultrafast time-resolved detection.	Perovskite (PVK) materials have been widely studied and widely used in photoelectric conversion devices due to their unique crystal structure, many interesting physical and chemical properties and low manufacturing cost. Despite extensive research, challenges remain in fully understanding the dynamic processes of carrier recombination, separation, transport and dynamic evolution of defect states, which are critical to device performance. Addressing these gaps is essential for the development of high-speed optoelectronic devices. The development of high-speed devices requires a full understanding of the properties of materials, especially the dynamic processes such as carrier recombination, separation, and transport, which often play a vital role in the performance of devices. Therefore, in order to better understand and control the behavior of photo-induced hot carriers (HC), ultrafast laser detection technology is applied to the study of PVK materials, which can observe and measure the generation, transmission, and recombination of photo-induced HCs in real time to reveal their dynamic behavior and photoelectric properties. This paper summarizes the latest research progress of ultrafast carrier dynamics in all-inorganic halide PVKs, double PVKs and organic-inorganic halide PVKs to fully understand their carrier relaxation, recombination, transfer, and other behaviors. Additionally, this review highlights emerging trends and unresolved issues in HC dynamics, aiming to provide a roadmap for future studies in this area. It is expected that with the help of the relevant physical mechanism of HC relaxation dynamics obtained here, breakthroughs will be made in improving and regulating the photoelectric conversion efficiency and the corresponding ultrafast light response devices in the future.
40135467	Transient stress and fabric model for quasi-static granular flows in three dimensions.	We present and validate a general three-dimensional continuum model for predicting the coupled fabric and stress transient response in 3D dense granular flows for the quasi-static regime. The model is inspired by isotropic and kinematic hardening theory, which is widely applied to plastic loading cycles in metals, which constitutes a connection between two different flowing materials through the same plastic modeling framework. The first part of the model consists of a differential evolution equation for the fabric tensor, which incorporates a new parameter called contact persistence to model the capacity of the fabric network to keep its contacts according to the relative direction of the shear-rate. The second part of the model is an expression for the shear stress comprised of a backstress, proportional to the fabric tensor, and a term proportional to the shear-rate direction. This shear stress decomposition was obtained from DEM data extracted within a 3D Couette cell during unsteady processes wherein the shear-rate direction rotates instantaneously with respect to the axis perpendicular to the walls of the cell. The results of the model are compared with DEM simulations for different changes in shear orientation, achieving a good agreement for the evolution of the fabric and deviatoric stress tensors. The model is shown to be compatible with the second law of thermodynamics, revealing that the origin of the backstress flow resistance in granular media is distinct from the cause of backstresses in metals; rather than arising from stored defect energy, it arises from the dependence of dilatancy on the alignment of the fabric and flow-rate.
40135457	Color variation in radio-luminescence of P-dots doped with thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules.	Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials possess exceptional photophysical properties. Organic scintillators utilizing TADF materials have shown great promise for applications requiring efficient radio-luminescence, owing to their high quantum efficiency and tunable emission properties. Previous studies demonstrated that polymer dots (P-dots) doped with TADF materials exhibit radio-luminescence under hard X-ray and electron beam excitation. However, the TADF materials used in these experiments were limited to limited color options, restricting their utility and hindering the exploration of multicolor radio-luminescence necessary for advanced applications. In this study, we successfully achieved multicolor radio-luminescence-blue, yellow, and red-by developing P-dots doped with TADF materials that emit across the visible spectrum. This breakthrough was demonstrated under excitation by hard X-rays, gamma rays, and electron beams. The ability to realize multicolor radio-luminescence is crucial, as it enables enhanced spatial and spectral resolution, which is vital for applications such as high-precision bio-imaging and multimodal sensing.
40135374	Ultrasound-induced piezoionic hydrogels with antibacterial and antioxidant properties for promoting infected diabetic wound healing.	The effective treatment of infected diabetic wounds remains a major challenge due to bacterial infection and severe oxidative stress. Herein, an antibacterial and antioxidant piezoionic hydrogel (ANDT) is synthesized <i>via</i> a one-pot photocuring process of a precursor solution containing acrylic acid, <i>N</i>-isopropyl acrylamide, quaternary ammonium salt (DPAB), and tannic acid (TA). The ANDT hydrogel exhibits reliable adhesion and appropriate mechanical properties, which can provide a favorable physical barrier. Owing to the introduction of antibacterial DPAB and antioxidant TA, the ANDT hydrogel can reduce inflammation and create an optimal microenvironment for cellular growth. Furthermore, due to the piezoionic effects, the ANDT hydrogel under ultrasound stimulation can generate a biomimetic endogenous electric field to modulate cellular behaviors, thereby achieving an active pro-healing effect. The infected diabetic wound model demonstrates that the ANDT hydrogel combined with ultrasound therapy can effectively reduce inflammation, increase collagen deposition, and promote angiogenesis, thus accelerating the healing process of infected diabetic wounds. This work may provide a promising strategy for developing advanced wound dressing to promote infected diabetic wound healing.
40135262	Parity violation effects on the electric field gradient.	The parity violation (PV) effects on the electric field gradient (EFG) and the nuclear quadrupole coupling constant (NQCC) of a wide variety of chiral systems are studied in a four-component (4c) framework. Formal expressions and calculations of the PV effects on the EFG are presented for the first time at 4c Dirac Hartree-Fock level. The chiral systems studied are XHFClY (X = C, Sn; Y = Br, I, At) molecules together with NUHXY (X, Y = F, Cl, Br, I) and NUF XY (X, Y = Cl, Br, I) uranium containing systems. We found that for the latter, calculations of PV effects on NQCC are two orders of magnitude lower than the current experimental precision and they are suitable candidates for future PV measurements in NQCC, in particular the NUHFCl chiral molecule. The dependence on the basis set, the nuclear charge distribution model and the kinetic balance prescription related to the negative-energy states is also analysed.
40134373	Nonlinear behavior of stochastic athermal fiber networks with elastic-plastic fibers.	Stochastic fiber networks form the structural component of network materials, which are broadly encountered in engineering and biology. Apparent elastic-plastic behavior, characterized by a yield point and softening at larger strains, is observed in some of these materials. A range of mechanisms, some of which being unrelated to fiber plasticity, may cause this behavior. In this work we investigate network plasticity caused by the plastic deformation of fibers and develop a comprehensive perspective on its relationship with network structural parameters. We determine the scaling of the yield stress and yield strain with network parameters emphasizing differences between the affine and non-affine deformation regimes. The non-linear response of the network is more complex when fiber plasticity takes place than in the purely elastic case. We describe four non-linear regimes and their dependence on network parameters. Further, we evaluate the dissipation and residual strains resulting upon loading-unloading cycles for a variety of networks and discuss design strategies for maximizing energy dissipation. Finally, we provide guidelines for the interpretation of experimental results and discuss ways to distinguish between various mechanisms that may cause a yield point and apparent elastic-plastic behavior.
40134360	A universal approach to the fabrication of reusable EGOFET-based aptasensors with track-etched membranes for biorecognition layers.	Nowadays, biosensor platforms based on various organic electrolytic transistors are in great demand due to their ability to specifically determine a wide range of biological analytes with extreme sensitivity. The main drawback of such platforms is their disposability at relatively high costs, preventing widespread application. In this work, we elaborate and successfully demonstrate a proof of concept for a universal approach for the fabrication of a reusable EGOFET-based aptasensor using polymer track-etched membranes as cheap disposable elements for biorecognition layers. We defined the most suitable pore size of track-etched membranes, which was enough for the penetration of viral particle and their capture near the current-carrying layer of EGOFET. The sensitivity of the fabricated EGOFET-based aptasensor to influenza A virus was comparable with disposal EGOFET-based biosensors having a biorecognition layer placed directly on the semiconducting layer. The limit of detection of the fabricated device was 8 × 10<sup>4</sup> VP mL<sup>-1</sup>, which was superior to those of antibody-based rapid analysis test systems (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>-4 × 10<sup>8</sup> VP mL<sup>-1</sup>) but inferior to those of the PCR method (3 × 10<sup>2</sup>-1.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> VP mL<sup>-1</sup>). The elaborated approach paves the way for the simple development of universal point-of-care tools consisting of rapid, non-invasive miniaturized sensors for the detection of a wide range of analytes, which are recognizable by aptamers.
40134349	Valence band modulation and the p-type conducting mechanism of LiMCh<sub>2</sub> (M = Al, Ga, In and Ch = S, Se, Te) semiconductors driven by low-electronegativity anions.	Due to the strong electronegativity of oxygen ions, O 2p orbital derived valence bands lead to low hole mobility and poor hole doping, which makes it extremely difficult to obtain high-conductivity p-type transparent materials. Herein, we propose a design principle called electronegative effect modification of the valence band (EEMVB) by utilizing low-electronegativity chalcogen anions to promote valence band dispersion. The proposed design principle is tested on LiMCh<sub>2</sub> (M = Al, Ga, and In and Ch = S, Se, and Te) compounds in the <i>I</i>4̄2<i>d</i> space group using density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the atomic scale. The DFT-D3(0) method with zero damping is adopted for geometry optimizations. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) is subsequently used for electronic and optical property calculations. We demonstrate that the electronegativity difference between chalcogen anions has a great influence on the bonding characteristics of LiMCh<sub>2</sub>, which in turn affects the overlap states at the valence band maximum (VBM). Combining the band gap, effective mass and p-type propensity, LiAlTe<sub>2</sub> is identified as a promising p-type transparent material. A hole effective mass as low as 0.37 <i>m</i><sub>0</sub> is predicted for LiAlTe<sub>2</sub>, which benefits from the mixing of Te 5p orbitals with Al 3p orbitals to produce highly favorable dispersion at the VBM. Defect calculations are discussed for LiAlTe<sub>2</sub>, showing that LiAlTe<sub>2</sub> displays an intrinsic p-type behavior, originating from the Li-on-Al antisite defect, without effective hole killers in this material. The design principle proposed herein is expected to open up a pathway for high-performance p-type materials.
40134342	Giant Second Harmonic Generation by Photoinduced Phase Engineering.	Addressing the growing demand for ever-shrinking nonlinear optical devices requires a paradigm shift to two-dimensional (2D) materials to bypass phase-matching limitations encountered in bulk crystals. While strategies like strain, electrical gating, and surface decoration have been explored to enhance the nonlinear susceptibility of 2D materials, the potential of laser-driven effects, with its exceptional controllability and accessibility, remains largely underexplored. Here, we demonstrate an optical approach to achieve a giant second-order parametric response in a metastable noncentrosymmetric 1M-WS<sub>2</sub> by selectively controlling laser pulse duration. We report a record effective second harmonic generation coefficient of ∼2000 pm/V, surpassing typical values of conventional nonlinear crystals by several orders of magnitude. Detailed analyses reveal that the structural distortions unique to the 1M phase are crucial for the enhanced nonlinear response. These findings establish an alternative way to amplify nonlinear optical properties and set 1M-WS<sub>2</sub> as a promising candidate for compact optical modulators and nanolasers.
40134244	Catalytic Aldehyde Decarbonylase Activity by a Thiolate-Bound Iron Porphyrin: Observation of a Peroxyhemiacetal Intermediate during Catalysis.	Aldehyde decarbonylation is a key chemical step in nature that is involved in the biosynthesis of hormones and long-chain hydrocarbons where O<sub>2</sub> is the oxidant. A cytochrome P450 enzyme, aromatase, catalyzes this reaction, where a thiolate-bound ferric peroxide is proposed to be the oxidant. Despite several attempts, only substoichiometric yields have been reported by synthetic iron porphyrins in organic solvents using peroxide. Several synthetic nonheme complexes have been reported to catalyze decarbonylation in stoichiometric yields using peroxides as oxidants. Catalytic decarbonylation with molecular O<sub>2</sub> using either heme or nonheme complexes remains elusive. Iron picket-fence porphyrin is attached to thiol-terminated self-assembled monolayers. In situ resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals the accumulation of an Fe(III)-OOH intermediate with Fe-O and O-O vibrations at 579 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 798 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, during heterogeneous electrocatalytic O<sub>2</sub> reduction in a pH 7 buffer solution. In the presence of different aldehydes in solution, catalytic aldehyde decarbonylase reactivity is observed with TON and TOF of ∼ 83000 and 277 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, for 2-methyl-2-phenylpropionaldehyde and ∼ 13000 and 45 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, for undecanal using molecular O<sub>2</sub> in a pH 7 buffer solution. In situ SERRS-RDE in the presence of 2-phenylpropionaldehyde indicates the formation of a peroxyhemiacetal species with Fe-O, O-O, and C-O vibrations at 520 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 833 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and 1185 cm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, as an intermediate in catalytic aldehyde decarbonylase activity.
40134243	Reconfigurable Neuromorphic Computing Using Methyl-Engineered One-Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Memristors.	The rapid evolution of neuromorphic devices seeks to bridge biological neural networks and artificial systems, enabling energy-efficient and scalable computing for next-generation artificial intelligence. Herein, we introduce methyl-engineered one-dimensional covalent organic framework (1D COF)-based memristors as a transformative platform for reconfigurable neuromorphic computing. The incorporation of methyl groups enhances localized polarization effects within the COF framework, effectively mitigating random Ag<sup>+</sup> migration/diffusion and stabilizing conductive filament morphology. This strategic modification yields devices with exceptional multilevel storage capabilities, exhibiting superior stability, linearity, and reproducibility. Moreover, the highly ordered architecture and customizable chemical environment of the methyl-functionalized 1D COF allows for precise control over resistive switching behaviors, facilitating the emulation of synaptic functions and the development of artificial neural network architectures. Demonstrating exceptional performance in neuromorphic tasks such as high-accuracy image recognition, these devices showcase significant promise as the foundation for energy-efficient, next-generation neuromorphic computing systems.
40134226	Rational Design for Monodisperse Gallium Nanoparticles by In Situ Monitoring with Small-Angle X-ray Scattering.	Colloidal chemistry is a well-known synthetic platform for producing size-uniform nanoparticles. However, the optimization of each material system still relies on a tedious trial-and-error approach in a multiparametric space, commonly referred to as design-of-experiments. This process is particularly laborious for emerging material classes for which only a handful of syntheses have been reported. Alternative approaches for the rational design of colloidal nanoparticles involve studying the reaction with in situ methods, thereby revealing the true underlying rules for the synthesis of monodisperse nanoparticles. Here, we focus on highly promising but little-studied colloidal gallium nanoparticles, using synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering as a highly suitable in situ monitoring technique. We investigate the intertwined effects of process temperature, concentration of reactants, and the sterics of surface ligands during the hot-injection synthesis of gallium colloids. For quantitative comparison, we provide a description of gallium synthesis through the timestamps of partially overlapping reaction, nucleation, and growth stages. Our results reveal the key role of surface ligands in balancing the kinetics of nucleation and growth, as well as in enabling colloidal stability during the synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the large overlap between the nucleation and growth stages does not preclude the formation of monodisperse gallium nanoparticles. Our in situ experiments suggest several possible strategies for achieving size-uniform colloidal nanoparticles, thus enabling a rational design for the peculiar system of liquid metal nanodroplets and offering insights that can be extended to other monodisperse colloids prepared via hot-injection synthesis.
40134068	Fluorescent Thermometers Based on Carbon Quantum Dots with Various Detection Modes for Intracellular Temperature Measurement.	We report that carbon quantum dots (CQDs) synthesized via a hydrothermal process using anthraquinone derivatives and l-cysteine provide versatile detection modes, making them suitable for various experimental setups. By modification of the precursor structures, these CQDs can function as different types of fluorescent nanothermometers, including those based on fluorescence intensity, ratiometrics, and fluorescence lifetime. Notably, fluorescence lifetime-based CQDs demonstrate robust performance under a wide range of conditions, including variations in pH and ionic strength. The CQDs exhibit low cytotoxicity and high cellular uptake efficiency, enabling wash-free imaging and precise fluorescence lifetime-based temperature measurements at the single-cell level. Furthermore, we successfully measured temperature changes associated with biochemical reactions, including the increase in cellular temperature induced by mitochondrial depolarization. In addition, these fluorescence lifetime-based measurements could be cross-verified using their fluorescence intensity. These findings underscore the potential of CQDs as versatile and minimally invasive tools for nanoscale thermometry in live cells.
40133085	Single-Crystal X-ray Structures of Homochiral Brønsted Acidic Covalent Organic Frameworks.	Determining the crystal structures of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with atomic precision is pivotal for uncovering their properties and optimizing functionalities. However, the synthesis of high-quality single crystals of COFs suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis, especially chiral COFs (CCOFs), remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we report two three-dimensional (3D) CCOFs synthesized via imine condensation of tetrahedral tetraamine and tetraaldehydes derived from optically active 1,1'-biphenol phosphoryl chloride or thiophosphoryl chloride. Single crystals of varying sizes are obtained through either a low-temperature modulation strategy, yielding large crystals up to 100 μm, or a solvothermal method. The large single crystals are structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, achieving a resolution of 0.90 Å. These two CCOFs are isostructural and each features a 4-fold interpenetrated diamondoid open framework with all phosphoric acid groups periodically aligned within tubular helical channels, displaying enhanced Brønsted acidity compared to non-immobilized acids. The frameworks exhibit permanent porosity, chemical resistance in boiling water, 14 M NaOH, and 0.1 M HCl, and thermal stability up to 400 °C. Notably, these CCOFs serve as efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Brønsted acid catalysts in the asymmetric addition to aromatic aldehydes, enantioselective transfer hydrogenation of ketimines, and three-component direct asymmetric Mannich reactions involving aldimines and cyclic ketones, achieving good to high enantioselectivities (up to 99.5% ee) that surpass those obtained in analogous systems with homogeneous catalysts. This work represents the first successful demonstration of single-crystal structures of homochiral COFs, paving the way for in-depth investigations into structure-property relationships in enantioselective processes and facilitating the design of novel functional chiral organic materials.
40133071	Nitric Oxide Inhibition of Glycyl Radical Enzymes and Their Activases.	Innate immune response cells produce high concentrations of the free radical nitric oxide (NO) in response to pathogen infection. The antimicrobial properties of NO include nonspecific damage to essential biomolecules and specific inactivation of enzymes central to aerobic metabolism. However, the molecular targets of NO in anaerobic metabolism are less understood. Here, we demonstrate that the <i>Escherichia coli</i> glycyl radical enzyme pyruvate formate lyase (PFL), which catalyzes the anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate, is irreversibly inhibited by NO. Using electron paramagnetic resonance and site-directed mutagenesis we show that NO destroys the glycyl radical of PFL. The activation of PFL by its cognate radical <i>S</i>-adenosyl-<i>l</i>-methionine-dependent activating enzyme (PFL-AE) is also inhibited by NO, resulting in the conversion of the essential iron-sulfur cluster to dinitrosyl iron complexes. Whole-cell EPR and metabolic flux analyses of anaerobically growing <i>E. coli</i> show that PFL and PFL-AE are inhibited by physiologically relevant levels of NO in bacterial cell cultures, resulting in diminished growth and a metabolic shift to lactate fermentation. The class III ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) glycyl radical enzyme and its corresponding RNR-AE are also inhibited by NO in a mechanism analogous to those observed in PFL and PFL-AE, which likely contributes to the bacteriostatic effect of NO. Based on the similarities in reactivity of the PFL/RNR and PFL-AE/RNR-AE enzymes with NO, the mechanism of inactivation by NO appears to be general to the respective enzyme classes. The results implicate an immunological role of NO in inhibiting glycyl radical enzyme chemistry in the gut.
40133061	Exploring the NMR Metabolic Landscape of <i>Chrysochromulina rotalis</i>: The Impact of Photobioreactor Configurations and Culture Conditions.	This study utilizes the advanced analytical capabilities of nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics to perform an untargeted and comprehensive analysis of the metabolic profile of<i>Chrysochromulina rotalis</i> under varying environmental conditions and photobioreactor setups. By identifying key biomolecules, including lipids, pigments, proteins, and carbohydrates, this research highlights the remarkable adaptability of<i>C. rotalis</i> and its potential as a valuable source of bioactive compounds with industrial application. These findings are supported by experiments conducted at both laboratory and pilot scales. At the laboratory scale, a bubbling bench photobioreactor operated under various LED lights, irradiances, and temperatures. At the pilot scale, 80 L indoor and outdoor tubular and bubble column photobioreactors were used with modified nutrient concentrations and irradiances, along with a 140 L outdoor flat panel photobioreactor. Significant metabolic variations were observed across these setups. Optimal production of carotenoids, chlorophyll <i>c</i>, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), triacylglycerols (TAG), and 1,2-diacylglycerols occurred at 30 μmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup>. Temperature effects revealed that 25 °C favored carotenoids and PUFA, while 35 °C increased glycerol and dimethyl sulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Red light enhanced fatty acids (FA), whereas white light increased osmolytes and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Scaling up cultivation further influenced the metabolic profile. Tubular photobioreactors at 268 μmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·s<sup>-1</sup> had higher PUFA, TAG, and carotenoid levels, while the indoor bubble columns contained more fucoxanthin, choline, and osmolytes. The outdoor bubble column and flat panel photobioreactors exhibited a similar metabolite composition, with the bubble column showing higher levels of sterols and alanine. Finally, metabolite covariation patterns were explored using Spearman rank correlation, providing insights into metabolic regulation under different conditions. These findings contribute to optimizing photobioreactor-based cultivation strategies for maximizing the production of valuable biomolecules from<i>C. rotalis</i>.
40132264	Generation of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived anterior foregut endoderms on integrin-binding short peptide-based synthetic substrates.	Anterior foregut endoderms (AFEs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an important cell source in stem cell technology as they give rise to some important lineages like lung progenitors and thyroid cells. Coating substrates plays a critical role in AFE generation. Currently, conventional large molecule proteins like Matrigel are used in most differentiation protocols. However, the complex components and mechanisms of these coatings have limited both the exploration of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction and potential clinical applications. In this study, we identified eight pure synthetic integrin-binding short peptides as effective coatings for iPSC growth and AFE generation with an integrin-binding peptide array. Our results showed that integrin<i>α</i>5<i>β</i>1-,<i>α</i>V<i>β</i>8-, and<i>α</i>IIb<i>β</i>3-binding peptides supported the adhesion and expansion of iPSCs and AFE generation by guided differentiation via a definitive endoderm (DE) in a full-anchorage-dependent manner. AFE generation was also found on coatings based on integrin<i>α</i>3<i>β</i>1-,<i>α</i>6<i>β</i>1-,<i>α</i>V<i>β</i>1-,<i>α</i>V<i>β</i>6-, and<i>α</i>M<i>β</i>2-binding peptides following a process with temporal suspension growth in the DE-inducing stage, with lower AFE generation efficiency compared to the full-anchorage-dependent peptide groups and Matrigel. According to the results, the integrin<i>α</i>5<i>β</i>1-binding peptide is the most promising defined substrate for inducing AFEs because of its equivalent efficiency with traditional Matrigel coating in supporting iPSC expansion and differentiation toward AFEs. Additionally, the other seven peptide-based coatings also exhibit potential and could be further investigated for developing synthetic-coating strategies in future studies involving AFEs. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of integrin and ECM function and hold great potential for disease modeling as well as therapeutic exploration of AFE origin organs.
40132231	Fabrication of multilayer heterogeneous cell assembly for pathophysiologically relevant 3D<i>in-vitro</i>IBD disease model for high throughput drug screening.	Regarding the approval of novel pharmaceuticals, the most common reason for failure is inadequate oral drug bioavailability. Owing to the complex physiological milieu of the human intestine, which is characterized by its varied composition, various functions, and one-of-a-kind dynamic conditions, it is difficult to reproduce the organ<i>in vitro</i>. Traditional monolayers in two dimensions, sophisticated three-dimensional systems, and developing fluid-dynamic platforms are examples of<i>in-vitro</i>intestinal models. Caco-2 cells have been the gold standard for studying drug permeability for over two decades, particularly for BCS Class II/III/IV drugs. Other intestinal<i>in vitro</i>models exist; however, pharmaceutical corporations and regulatory authorities use the Caco-2 cell line to predict human intestinal permeability. To predict oral drug absorption and study normal intestinal epithelial physiology, it is necessary to have advanced technologies capable of creating human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs) with cellular variety and functions. There is a strong link between the permeability data obtained<i>in vitro</i>and the fractions absorbed by humans in complex multicellular models. However, although microphysiological systems accurately replicate physiological cues of the digestive tract, they still require standardization. We critically reviewed a step towards tissue-created 3D intestinal organoids and 3D heterocellular multicompartmental models without compromising cellular variety and function. To bridge the gap between 2D and 3D intestinal culture models, a physiologically appropriate hIEC model provides a novel platform for patient-specific testing and translational applications. A comprehensive understanding of numerous 3D<i>in-vitro</i>models of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. Additionally, this review will provide insights into the benefits and limitations of these models and their relevance in understanding intestinal physiology and accelerating drug discovery through high-throughput screening.
40132215	Dissolved Oxygen Redox as the Source of Hydrogen Peroxide and Hydroxyl Radical in Sonicated Emulsive Water Microdroplets.	Sonicated emulsive water microdroplets (SEWMs) accelerate and enable a variety of catalyst-free chemical transformations. However, significant unanswered questions remain regarding the chemical intermediates they form and their possible redox origin. In this study, we identified dissolved O<sub>2</sub> as the primary originator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as OH<sup>•</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We uncovered the role of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> redox by using a combination of microelectrochemical methods to detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, isotopic methods to identify the source of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and a combination of electron spin resonance and the DMPO spin trap to detect radicals such as OH<sup>•</sup>. Notably, we found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is correlated with O<sub>2</sub> content via a reduction pathway enabled by a sufficiently large reducing power that can additionally generate H<sub>2</sub> and even perform Pb electroless deposition on Au and Cu metal substrates. Building on our findings, continuous O<sub>2</sub> bubbling of SEWMs showed accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> up to ∼88 mM in the aqueous phase within 1 h of sonication, demonstrating the scale-up promise of this method. Distinct to sonochemistry of a single phase, this study advances our understanding of the confluence of redox and chemical reaction mechanisms within SEWMs as a biphasic system. This insight paves the way for improving their reaction kinetics, yield, and selectivity, positioning these attractive redox microreactors as alternatives to traditional electrolyzers.
40132086	Polymorphic ROYalty: The 14th ROY Polymorph Discovered via High-Throughput Crystallization.	Polymorphism, when a substance can exist in more than one crystalline form yet return to the same liquid or solution phase, is characterized by differences in packing or molecular conformation. Polymorphs often exhibit differing physical properties, and are therefore particularly important in the development of materials and pharmaceuticals. However, gaining a thorough understanding of the solid-state landscape of a molecule requires exhaustive experimental screening of crystallization conditions, a particular challenge when using classical crystallization methods. We show that high-throughput Encapsulated Nanodroplet Crystallization (ENaCt) can enable the rapid and efficient exploration of the solid-state landscape of highly polymorphic molecules, through an in-depth study of 5-methyl-2-((2-nitrophenyl)amino)thiophene-3-carbonitrile (ROY), the most polymorphic small molecule known. An ENaCt screen encompassing 1536 individual crystallization experiments, spanning 320 unique conditions, resulted in direct access to single crystals, suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis, for all six of the known polymorphs accessible from solution (Y, R, YN, ON, ORP and R18). In addition, two polymorphs (Y04 and Y19) previously accessed only via melt and heteroseeded melt experiments, and a new polymorph of ROY (O22) were obtained. Furthermore, ENaCt screening resulted in the identification of the first ROY solvate (ROY· methyl anthranilate) and the first example of a ROY dimer, formed via in situ oxidation. ENaCt is thus shown to be an impactful tool for the experimental mapping of the solid-state landscape of highly polymorphic molecules and, through the discovery of a new polymorph O22, has ensured that tetradecamorphic ROY retains the record for the most polymorphic small molecule.
40132083	Ultrahigh-Q Quasi-BICs via Precision-Controlled Asymmetry in Dielectric Metasurfaces.	Achieving ultrahigh quality factor optical resonances is crucial for advancing low-threshold lasers, high-sensitivity sensors, and nonlinear photonics. While dielectric metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) show great potential, their experimental realization has been challenging due to the difficulty of precisely controlling symmetry-breaking at the nanoscale. Here, we introduce a precision-controlled symmetry-protected qBIC method using angular perturbations to precisely tune asymmetry, ensuring both high precision and reproducibility of Q-factors. In contrast to traditional SP-qBIC excitation, which relies on uncontrolled asymmetry, our method offers more accurate and consistent control by precisely tuning angular perturbations instead of structural variations. Additionally, our approach defines the lower limit of achievable Q-factors, providing a reliable lower bound. The experimental demonstration of SP-qBICs in composite nanoslit metasurfaces achieves a record-breaking Q-factor of 1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup>-the highest reported for SP-qBICs to date. These findings offer a promising platform for designing ultrahigh-Q resonators for next-generation photonic-applications.
40132074	Spectra-Orthogonal Optical Anisotropy in Wafer-Scale Molecular Crystal Monolayers.	Controlling the spectral and polarization response of two-dimensional (2D) crystals is vital for developing ultrathin platforms for compact optoelectronic devices. However, independently tuning optical anisotropy and spectral response remains challenging in conventional semiconductors due to the intertwined nature of their lattice and electronic structures. Here, we report spectra-orthogonal optical anisotropy─where polarization anisotropy is tuned independently of spectral response─in wafer-scale, one-atom-thick 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) monolayers synthesized on monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals. Utilizing the concomitant spectral consistency and structural tunability of perylene derivatives, we demonstrate tunable optical polarization anisotropy in 2DMCs with similar spectral profiles, as confirmed by room-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and cross-polarized reflectance microscopy. Additional angle-dependent analysis of the single-crystal and polycrystalline molecular domains reveals an epitaxial relationship between the 2DMC and TMD. Our results establish a scalable, molecule-based 2D crystalline platform for unique and tunable functionalities unattainable in covalent 2D solids.
40131759	Identification of Polyamines in Human Milk, Formula Milk, and Other Dairy Products: a Special Method Based on Precolumn Derivatization, Double-Florisil Purification, and Gas Chromatography-Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry.	Polyamines in human milk are essential for the rapid growth and development of neonates and infants. However, the concentrations of polyamines in human milk have not been well characterized and the special methods for detecting polyamines in human milk, formula milk, or other dairy products remain largely unavailable to date. In this study, an accurate and sensitive method based on trifluoroacetic acid anhydride (TFAA) derivatization, double solid-phase extraction (SPE) purification, and gas chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QqQ MS) was established for the evaluation of polyamines in human milk, formula milk, and other dairy products. High coefficients of determination for internal calibration curves were obtained (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> > 0.99). Low limits of detection (5.0, 1.0, and 0.5 nmol/dL) and limits of quantification (10.0, 3.0, and 1.0 nmol/dL) for putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, respectively, were also achieved. The precision (expressed as relative standard deviation, RSD < 9.0%) and recovery rates (78.3-108.4%) were satisfactory. Spermidine and spermine in human milk were found significantly higher than those in formula milk and commercial cow's milk. The difference of polyamine content in human milk and infant formula should be paid attention to, particularly when infant formula is used as a complete replacement for human milk.
40131741	Ligand-Controlled Enantioselective Copper-Catalyzed Hydroboration and Ring-Opening Dihydroboration of Arylidenecyclobutanes.	Arylidenecyclobutanes are readily accessible and versatile reagents in synthetic chemistry due to the multifaceted reactivity exhibited by their alkene and strained cyclobutane moieties. However, metal-catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of arylidenecyclobutanes, particularly the controllable ring-retaining and ring-opening reactions, is rarely explored. Considering the versatile synthetic utility of enantioenriched organoboronate compounds, herein we report ligand-controlled enantioselective copper-catalyzed ring-retaining hydroboration and ring-opening dihydroboration reactions of arylidenecyclobutanes that afford chiral <i>α</i>-cyclobutyl benzylboronate and 1,5-diboronate compounds with high enantioselectivity when (<i>S</i>)-DTBM-Segphos and (<i>S</i>,<i>S</i>)-Ph-BPE are employed, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal that the ring-opening process of arylidenecyclobutanes via β-C elimination is significantly slower than that of arylidenecyclopropanes in the presence of CuOAc and (<i>S</i>,<i>S</i>)-Ph-BPE. The synthetic utility of these two enantioselective protocols is further demonstrated through conducting various stereospecific and site-selective transformations of the enantioenriched organoboron products, including concise synthesis of bioactive molecules.
40131736	Polyethylenimine-Assisted Interfacial Modulation Based on Electrostatic Balancing and Hierarchical Channel to the Cytidine 5'-Monophosphate Conversion Performance of Uridine-Cytosine Kinase.	Interfacial modulation of protein microenvironments plays a pivotal role in enhancing enzyme immobilization and catalysis. In this study, we proposed a polyethylenimine (PEI)-assisted strategy that combines electrostatic and affinity interactions to improve the performance of Cytidine 5'-Monophosphate (CMP) conversion by uridine-cytidine kinase (UCK). The PEI-modified interface creates an optimal local microenvironment that maintains a balanced charge distribution, stabilizes UCK's conformation, and prevents denaturation. Electrostatic interactions promote product adsorption, enhance diffusion, and reduce substrate accumulation, boosting reaction efficiency. The kinetic assays revealed an increase in the maximum reaction rate from 16.8 to 113.2 μM·min<sup>-1</sup> with a remarkable increase in substrate affinity and enzyme activity. The relative enzyme activity at the optimal substrate concentration increased from 70.4 to 106.9%, and by 113.3% under conditions of substrate inhibition. This study provides theoretical and technical support for the efficient production of CMP with promising applications in food, feed, and medical fields.
40131343	An Enhanced Ratiometric Fluorescence Immunosensor for Rapid Detection of AFB<sub>1</sub> Based on the Dual-Enzyme Synergistic Co-Catalytic Effect of Natural Enzymes and Nanozymes.	Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) is considered a critical analyte in food safety testing due to its widespread contamination and high toxicity. In this study, a ratiometric fluorescent immunosensor with synergistic catalysis by natural enzymes and nanozymes (N-N-RF-immunosensor) was constructed for the rapid detection of AFB<sub>1</sub>. Copper oxide and zeolitic imidazolate framework composite nanomaterials (CuO/ZIF-8 NCM) with peroxidase and oxidase activities were prepared. A ratiometric fluorescence signal was generated through the synergistic cocatalytic effect of the CuO/ZIF-8 NCM and alkaline phosphatase, in response to the competition interaction between the anti-idiotypic nanobody-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein (Nb2-5-AP) and AFB<sub>1</sub>. The assay could detect aflatoxins within 140 min, exhibiting a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.032 ng/mL, a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.4 pg/mL, and a linear range of 0.0024-1.043 ng/mL. Compared with the traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the sensitivity was enhanced 25-fold, while the detection parameter was shortened by 1/3. Furthermore, the immunosensor was successfully applied in the actual samples, with recoveries ranging from 81 to 127%. The N-N-RF-immunosensor shows great potential for rapid and sensitive detection of aflatoxins.
40131335	Two-step Production Method for Lacto-<i>N</i>-Triose II via Cell-Coupled Biocatalytic Strategy.	Lacto-<i>N</i>-triose II (LNT II) represents a significant neutral human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) that functions as a fundamental structural framework for the synthesis of more complex HMOs. In this study, we utilize GlcNAc and lactose as substrates, employing a whole-cell catalytic approach for the synthesis of LNT II. First, we have identified and successfully expressed three genes associated with the production of LNT II: Nahk, EcGlmU, and LgtA, synthesized LNT II through a whole-cell catalytic system utilizing multistrain coupling. Then, to further enhance the yield, we incorporated yeast cells for energy regeneration, employed coexpression strategies to minimize cell density, following a series of systematic optimizations resulting in a 7-fold increase in LNT II production. Finally, a two-step catalytic process was conducted in a 5L bioreactor, and the maximum LNT II production reached 52.34 g/L with a conversion rate of lactose 95.95%.
40130945	Preparation, Structural Characterization, and <i>In Vitro</i> Modulation of the Gut Microbiota Activity of a Novel α-Glucan in <i>Hericium erinaceus</i>.	<i>Hericium erinaceus</i> (<i>H. erinaceus</i>) is a kind of medicinal and edible fungus that contains polysaccharide as the most studied effective component at present. In this paper, a novel α-glucan was successfully isolated from <i>H. erinaceus</i> fruiting bodies by hot water extraction combined with the fractional ethanol precipitation method. To analyze the monosaccharide composition, methylation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed, and the polysaccharide was identified having α-(1→4)-glycosidic bonds with a single unit α-D-Glc<i>p</i> branch attached at the <i>O</i>-6 position (<i>M</i><sub><i>w</i></sub>, 1.43 × 10<sup>7</sup> g/mol, branching ratio of 9:1). Furthermore, the aqueous solution analysis demonstrated that this α-glucan adopts a rigid spherical conformation. The polysaccharide exhibited resistance to simulated gastrointestinal digestion but was effectively degraded by gut microbiota (GM), leading to significant changes in total polysaccharide content, reducing sugar, and pH value. Notably, the α-glucan was beneficial to increase the contents of acetic and propionic acids in metabolites, stimulated the growth of beneficial bacteria (<i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>), and inhibited the proliferation of harmful bacteria (<i>Fusobacterium</i>). Overall, the study deepened the regulatory effects of α-glucan with different ratios of main and branch chains from <i>H. erinaceus</i> fruiting bodies on GM, which provides theoretical support for developing of GM-targeted foods.
40130907	Reorganizing the Pt Surface Water Structure for Highly Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction.	The hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline electrolytes exhibits markedly slower kinetics than that in acidic electrolytes. This poses a critical challenge for alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). The slower kinetics in alkaline electrolytes is often attributed to the more sluggish Volmer step (hydrogen desorption). It has been shown that the alkaline HOR activity on the Pt surface can be considerably enhanced by the presence of oxophilic transition metals (TMs) and surface-adsorbed hydroxyl groups on TMs (TM-OH<sub>ad</sub>), although the exact role of TM-OH<sub>ad</sub> remains a topic of active debates. Herein, using single-atom Rh-tailored Pt nanowires as a model system, we demonstrate that hydroxyl groups adsorbed on the Rh sites (Rh-OH<sub>ad</sub>) can profoundly reorganize the Pt surface water structure to deliver a record-setting alkaline HOR performance. In situ surface characterizations, together with theoretical studies, reveal that surface Rh-OH<sub>ad</sub> could promote the oxygen-down water (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>↓</sub>) that favors more hydrogen bond with Pt surface adsorbed hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>↓</sub>···H<sub>ad</sub>-Pt) than the hydrogen-down water (OH<sub>2↓</sub>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>↓</sub> further serves as the bridge to facilitate the formation of an energetically favorable six-membered-ring transition structure with neighboring Pt-H<sub>ad</sub> and Rh-OH<sub>ad</sub>, thus reducing the Volmer step activation energy and boosting HOR kinetics.
40130895	Analysis of Key Aroma Compound Changes in Grass Carp Fillets during Cold Storage Using Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography-Olfactometry-Mass Spectrometry and Odor Activity Value.	This study analyzed the changes in key aroma compounds in grass carp fillets during cold storage using aroma extract dilution analysis, odor activity values, and aroma recombination. A total of 11, 13, and 14 volatile compounds were recombined to construct recombination models representing the odor of fillets at 0, 3, and 7 days of cold storage, respectively. The key aroma compounds in fresh fillets included hexanal, (<i>Z</i>)-4-heptenal, nonanal, (<i>E</i>,<i>E</i>)-2,4-octadienal, (<i>E</i>,<i>Z</i>)-2,6-nonadienal, (<i>E</i>)-2-nonenal, decanal, (<i>E</i>)-2-decenal, (<i>E</i>,<i>E</i>)-2,4-decadienal, 1-octen-3-ol, and 2,3-pentanedione. Moreover, (<i>E</i>)-2-octenal, 2-cyclopenten-1-one, γ-dodecalactone, and octanoic acid became the key aroma compounds after 3 and 7 days of refrigeration, respectively. (<i>Z</i>)-4-Heptenal, (<i>E</i>,<i>Z</i>)-2,6-nonadienal, (<i>E</i>)-2-nonenal, decanal, and (<i>E</i>,<i>E</i>)-2,4-decadienal indicated the deterioration in flavor quality of fillets, which rose by 38.29 μg/kg (0-7 days). This study clarifies the key aroma compounds and characteristic compounds responsible for odor changes during the cold storage of fillets, establishing a basis for future improvement in odor quality during cold storage.
40130822	Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy through Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species and Depleting Glutathione.	The complex tumor microenvironment (TME) affects reactive oxygen species (ROS)-based therapies; breaking the limitations of the TME to enhance the effectiveness of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is full of great challenges. Herein, iron atomically dispersed nanoparticles (Fe-N-C) were first reported as sonosensitizers with highly efficient ROS generation by overcoming TME limitations. Its peroxidase and catalase-like activities catalyze H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to produce highly toxic ·OH and <i>in situ</i> O<sub>2</sub>, respectively, and then O<sub>2</sub> molecules adsorbed at Fe active sites obviously lower the energy barrier for ·OH formation. Meanwhile, its glutathione-oxidase-like activity can rapidly consume glutathione (GSH) in the TME to induce tumor cell apoptosis and ferroptosis. Density functional theory calculation results elucidate the possible mechanism of ROS generation: O<sub>2</sub> molecules are activated by receiving sonoelectrons to generate ·O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, which further reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O to produce OH<sup>-</sup>. Then OH<sup>-</sup> is oxidized by sonoholes to form ·OH. Fe-N-C displays a superior tumor specificity SDT.
40130774	Configuration Retention in <i>P</i>-Trifluoromethyl Phosphine Enabled Rh(I)-Catalyzed Decarbonylative Coupling of Carboxylates and Boroxines.	As compared with asymmetric catalysis, the memory of chirality provides another promising strategy to introduce chiral centers in light of numerous chiral starting materials that can be accessed. Decarboxylative coupling has become an important strategy for C-C or C-X bond formation over decades of development for its versatility and the low cost and structural diversity of carboxylic acids. However, the memory of chirality or more general configuration retention in this transformation has seldom been studied. Here, we report a novel π acceptor-type ligand <i>P</i>-trifluoromethyl phosphine enabled Rh(I)-catalyzed decarbonylative coupling of carboxylates and boroxines. The configuration of the α-carbon can be fully retained in this transformation for chiral, <i>cis-</i>, or <i>trans</i>-substrates. Several <i>P</i>-trifluoromethyl phosphine-Rh(I) carbonyl complexes were prepared and their <i>v</i>(CO) values were compared with known complexes, which indicated that the π-accepting property of the ligand is important to the decarbonylative reaction.
40130771	An Atomically Dispersed Mn Photocatalyst for Vicinal Dichlorination of Nonactivated Alkenes.	A novel Mn-based single-atom photocatalyst is disclosed in this study, designed for the dichlorination of alkenes to achieve vicinal dichlorinated products using <i>N</i>-chlorosuccinimide as a mild chlorinating agent, which have widespread applications as pest controlling agents, polymers, flame retardants, and pharmaceuticals. In developing this innovative catalyst, we achieved the atomic dispersion of Mn on aryl-amino-substituted graphitic carbon nitride (<i>f-</i>C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>). This marks the first instance of a heterogeneous version, offering an operationally simple, sustainable, and efficient pathway for dichlorination of alkenes, including drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. This material was extensively characterized by using techniques such as UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), magic-angle spinning (MAS), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy to understand it at the atomic level. Furthermore, mechanistic studies based on multiscale molecular modeling, combining classical reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations and quantum chemistry (QC) calculations, illustrated that the controlled formation of Cl radicals from the in situ formed Mn-Cl bond is responsible for the dichlorination reaction of alkenes. In addition, gram-scale and reusability tests were also performed to demonstrate the applicability of this approach on an industrial scale.
40130482	Bioinspired hybrid DNA/dendrimer-based films with supramolecular chirality.	Bioinspired hybrid DNA/dendrimer films were obtained by heating long double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) above its melting temperature and, while in the denatured state, mixing it with poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers, followed by controlled cooling. The formation of these new types of films was found to be dependent on several parameters, including the initial heating temperature, pH, buffer composition, dendrimer generation, amine/phosphate (N/P) ratio, and cooling speed. In addition to the PAMAM dendrimers (generations 3, 4, and 5), films could also be produced with branched poly(ethylenimine) with a molecular weight of 25 kDa. The results indicated that these films were formed not only through electrostatic interactions established between the negatively charged DNA molecules and the positive dendrimers, as expected, but also through random rehybridization of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) during the cooling process. The resulting films are water-insoluble, transparent when thin, highly elastic when air-dried, exceptionally stable over extended periods, cytocompatible, and easily scalable. Notably, the slow cooling process allowed for the establishment of at least a partially ordered structure in the films, as revealed by circular dichroism, providing evidence of supramolecular chirality. It is envisioned that these films may have significant potential in biomedical applications, such as drug/gene delivery systems, platforms for cell-free DNA transcription and components in biosensors.
40130352	Modulation of the biological response to surfaces through the controlled deposition of 3D polymeric surfactants.	Biomaterials play a crucial role in modern medicine through their use as medical implants and devices. However, they can support biofilm formation and infection, and lack integration with the surrounding human tissue at the implant site. This work reports the development of novel poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA) based copolymers that address both issues. These PEA materials were molecularly designed polymeric surfactants (surfmers) synthesised <i>via</i> controlled radical polymerisations to achieve different polymeric architectures, (<i>i.e.</i>, statistical and block copolymers). These were both deposited as structured 2D films on glass coverslips and used to manufacture monodisperse 3D micro-particles with functional surfaces (<i>via</i> microfluidics). ToF-SIMS was used to analyse these 2D and 3D surfaces to understand: (a) the surface arrangement of the monomer sequences exhibited by the different polymer structures and (b) how this surface monomer arrangement influenced mammalian fibroblast cell and/or <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> behaviour at these film/particle surfaces. In addition, the form of the fibronectin (FN) network assembly's importance in promoting growth factor (GF) binding was probed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) on the 2D films. This confirmed that specific surfmer molecular surface organisations were achieved during film/micro-particle fabrication, which presented exterior functionalities that either prevent biofilm attachment or promote the formation of structured FN networks for GF binding.
40130333	Infrared Spectroscopic Signatures of the Fluorous Effect Arise from a Change of Conformational Dynamics.	Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic compounds widely employed in society due to their chemical inertness. These substances accumulate in the environment, from where they enter human bodies, leading to harmful effects like cancer. PFAS exhibit omniphobic properties, which often cause them to separate from both aqueous and organic phases, forming a fluorous phase. Yet, the physical nature of this fluorous effect is unknown. Here, we shed light on the fluorous effect by analyzing the infrared absorption spectra of perfluorinated and semifluorinated alkanes in various solvents. We find that specific bands in the C-F stretching vibrational region exhibit selective behaviors in fluorous and nonfluorous environments. In a fluorous environment, these bands undergo significant broadening, and the asymmetric CF<sub>3</sub> stretching bands decrease in intensity. Using static density functional theory calculations and force-field molecular dynamics simulations, we decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms: The decrease in absorption intensities is related to the intermolecular vibrational coupling of the perfluoroalkyl chains, while an acceleration of conformational changes in the carbon backbone of the molecules causes the observed band broadening. Given the high specificity of the reported spectral changes to a fluorous environment, bands in the C-F stretching range can serve as spectroscopic markers for the fluorous phase, facilitating the study of PFAS aggregation. Such knowledge can lead to the rational design of absorber materials for PFAS, which are aimed at mitigating their environmental impact.
40130332	A poly(ether-ketone-ketone) composite scaffold simulating the immune-osteogenic cascade for <i>in situ</i> bone regeneration.	The process of bone repair is intrinsically associated with the immune response. Following scaffold implantation, the pro-inflammatory response initiates the immune-osteogenic cascade. Efficient recruitment and timely conversion of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype are critical for promoting subsequent bone regeneration. Poly(ether-ketone-ketone) (PEKK) is an attractive orthopaedic material, but exhibits biological inertness. In this study, an immunomodulatory PEKK/bioglass composite scaffold was fabricated by fused deposition modeling and a soft cryogel containing monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) was infilled into the macropores of the scaffold (PBCM). The rapid release of MCP-1 from PBCM initially mobilized endogenous macrophages, which subsequently recruited rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs). Continuous release of bioactive ions not only facilitated the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype, thereby establishing a favorable anti-inflammatory microenvironment conducive to bone formation, but also stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of rMSCs. Moreover, cytokines secreted by macrophages further promoted osteogenesis. <i>In vivo</i> experiments demonstrated excellent bone regeneration following PBCM implantation. Taken together, this study aimed to develop a novel immunomodulatory PEKK composite scaffold that can simulate the immune-osteogenic cascade for timely recruitment of endogenous cells, efficient immunomodulation of macrophages and superior osteogenic abilities, potentially serving as potent implants for tissue engineering applications.

40130289	Access to chiral phthalidyl ester prodrugs <i>via</i> an isothiourea-catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution reaction.	An isothiourea-catalyzed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution reaction has been developed for the synthesis of chiral phthalidyl ester prodrugs. Various chiral phthalidyl esters were obtained in moderate to excellent yields (up to 97%) and good to excellent optical purities (up to 99 : 1 er). Notably, a variety of acyl chlorides were well tolerated, even those derived from pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. This catalytic transformation is an effective strategy for the development of chiral phthalidyl ester prodrugs.
40126878	Ruthenium(II)-catalyzed synthesis of poly-substituted furans <i>via</i> intermolecular oxidative annulation of 3-(phenylethynyl) oxazolidin-2-ones.	This study presents a new method for the synthesis of poly-substituted furans by an oxidative annulation reaction of ynamides in the presence of Ru(II) as a catalyst, copper(II) triflate Cu(OTf)<sub>2</sub> as an oxidant, and cesium carbonate (Cs<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) as a base. The reaction shows broad substrate scope and compatibility with readily available starting materials, with yields ranging from good to excellent.
40126535	Asymmetric synthesis of Fmoc-<i>threo</i>-HOAsn for the total synthesis of nicrophorusamide A.	Fmoc-protected β-hydroxyasparagine is an essential structural motif in organic chemistry, widely present in natural products and clinically important drugs, such as antibiotics. Here, a diastereoselective synthesis of Fmoc-protected HOAsn from a simple Garner's aldehyde has been developed. The Fmoc protected Garner's aldehyde reacted with triphenylmethyl isocyanide and formic acid at 60 °C, affording good yield with excellent diastereoselectivity. The application of the Passerini reaction product Fmoc-protected HOAsn for Fmoc-SPPS towards the synthesis of nicrophorusamide A and its analogues has also been reported, which is conducive to systematic SAR studies.
40126525	Silver-free, palladium-catalyzed arylation of pyrrolo[1,2-<i>a</i>]quinoxaline C-H bonds with aryl bromides.	Arylation of C1-H bonds in pyrrolo[1,2-<i>a</i>]quinoxaline derivatives has hitherto been challenging. The sole method known until now suffers from a narrow scope of aryl iodides, while requiring an overstoichiometric amount of a silver additive and a high-molecular-weight phosphine ligand. Herein, we developed a method for coupling C1-H bonds in pyrrolo[1,2-<i>a</i>]quinoxalines with aryl bromides in the presence of simple reagents, namely Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub> as catalyst, PPh<sub>3</sub> as ligand, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> as base, and 1,4-dioxane as solvent. This successful arylation did not require any silver additive and was tolerant of a wide range of functional groups such as aldehyde, nitro, cyano, ester, and heterocycles.
40126514	Zn/H<sub>2</sub>O-mediated tandem reductive cyclization of 2-(2-nitrophenyl)-1<i>H</i>-benzo[<i>d</i>]imidazoles with aldehydes to synthesize 5,6-dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-<i>c</i>]quinazolines.	A one-pot tandem approach to synthesize 5,6-dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-<i>c</i>]quinolones has been developed from 2-(2-nitrophenyl)-1<i>H</i>-benzo[<i>d</i>]imidazoles and aldehydes <i>via</i> a Zn/H<sub>2</sub>O-mediated reductive cyclization process, characterised by cheap and readily available raw materials, a simple, green, economical and efficient protocol, good product yields and product diversity.
40126449	Identification and synthesis of 4'-<i>ortho</i>-aminobenzoyl ascarosides as sex pheromones of gonochoristic <i>Caenorhabditis nigoni</i>.	Using a combination of RP-C18 chromatography, MS and NMR techniques, a new class of homologous modular ascarosides carrying a 4'-<i>ortho</i>-aminobenzoyl moiety was identified from <i>Caenorhabditis nigoni</i> and <i>Caenorhabditis tropicalis</i>. These compounds could not be detected using targeted ascaroside screens based on precursor ion screening for <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 73.0294 [C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sup>-</sup>, which highlighted a limitation of the current protocols. Their structure assignment was established by total synthesis of AB-asc-C5 (SMID: abas#9) as a representative example in about 1% yield over 14 steps. To achieve this aim, a new method for the synthesis of orthogonally protected ascarosides has been developed which provides methyl 2-benzoyl-ascaroside as a highly versatile building block for regioselective ascaroside synthesis. Furthermore, a new synthesis for short chain C5 ascarosides was developed that employs selective reduction and Grubbs cross metathesis. The identity of synthetic AB-asc-C5 and the natural product isolated from <i>C. nigoni</i> was established by an NMR mixing experiment. Retention of <i>C. nigoni</i> males by the exclusively female produced AB-asc-C5 suggests a function as a sex pheromone component. Along with the indole ascarosides (icas), the new class of 4'-<i>ortho</i>-aminobenzoyl ascarosides (abas) represents a mechanism to translate bacterial food dependent L-tryptophan availability into species-specific signaling molecules.
40126189	Smectic-like bundle formation of planktonic bacteria upon nutrient starvation.	Bacteria aggregate through various intercellular interactions to build biofilms, but the effect of environmental changes on them remains largely unexplored. Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of <i>Escherichia coli</i> aggregates to dynamic changes in the growth conditions. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystals. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be a common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments.
40126187	Construction of spirocarbocyclic scaffolds through dearomatization using calcium carbide as an alkyne source.	A novel method for the one-step construction of spirocarbocyclic scaffolds by dearomatizing annulation is described. A number of spiro[indene-1,1'-naphthalen]-2'-ones are efficiently synthesized by reactions of 1-arylnaphthalen-2-ols with aryl iodides and calcium carbide through Csp<sup>2</sup>-H activation and simultaneous formation of four C-C bonds. Meanwhile, a series of spiro[cyclopentane-1,1'-naphthalene]-2,4-dien-2'-ones are effectively obtained by reactions of 1-bromonaphthalen-2-ols with aryl iodides and calcium carbide through cross-coupling and simultaneous formation of seven C-C bonds. The salient feature of this protocol is the use of an inexpensive and easy-to-handle solid alkyne source as a substitute for flammable and explosive gaseous acetylene. In addition, satisfactory yields and a simple workup procedure are also advantages of this method. The corresponding products can also be synthesized on a gram scale.
40126018	Storage of the vital metal tungsten in a dominant SCFA-producing human gut microbe <i>Eubacterium limosum</i> and implications for other gut microbes.	Enzymes containing tungsten rather than the ubiquitous and analogous element molybdenum are prevalent in the human gut microbiome, especifically in microbes that contribute to overall gut health. <i>Eubacterium limosum</i> is a dominant human gut organism whose production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from lactate involves tungstoenzymes. Here, we characterized <i>E. limosum</i> Tub, a tungsten storage protein. Tub has a sub-nanomolar affinity for tungstate and contains a single TOBE domain first characterized in a molybdate storage protein. Crystal structures revealed Tub assembles as a hexamer composed of a trimer of dimers, capable of binding eight tungstate oxyanions at two distinct binding sites located at inter-subunit interfaces. Tungstate-saturated Tub exhibited unusually high thermal and chemical stability. Glucose-grown <i>E. limosum</i> accumulates tungsten in Tub and has low levels of two tungstoenzymes, termed WOR1 and FDH, which oxidize aldehydes and formate, respectively. Lactate-grown cells contain high concentrations of these two tungstoenzymes where WOR1 and FDH are involved in converting lactate to SCFAs. Glucose-grown cells appear to accumulate tungstate in Tub in preparation for lactate availability in the human gut. Tub and other TOBE-containing proteins are widespread in the human gut microbiome, and gene co-occurrence analysis predicts that there are comparable numbers of TOBE-containing proteins involved in the storage of tungstate as there are that bind molybdate. The results with <i>E. limosum</i> represent an important step for understanding tungsten storage mechanisms for tungstoenzymes within human gut microbes in general.IMPORTANCETungsten metabolism was found to be prevalent in the human gut microbiome, which is involved in the detoxification of food and antimicrobial aldehydes, as well as in the production of beneficial SCFAs. In this study, we characterized a protein in the human gut microbe, <i>Eubacterium limosum</i>, that stores tungstate in preparation for its use in enzymes involved in SCFA generation. This revealed several families of tungstate binding proteins that are also involved in tungstate transport and tungstate-dependent regulation and are widely distributed in the human gut microbiome. Elucidating how tungsten is stored and transported in the human gut microbes contributes to our understanding of the human gut microbiome and its impact on human health.
40126017	Standard mouse diets lead to differences in severity in infectious and non-infectious colitis.	<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infects the large intestine and can result in debilitating and potentially fatal colitis. The intestinal microbiota is a major factor influencing the severity of disease following infection. Factors like diet that shape microbiota composition and function may modulate <i>C. difficile</i> colitis. Here, we report that mice fed two distinct standard mouse chows (LabDiet 5010 and LabDiet 5053) exhibited significantly different susceptibility to severe <i>C. difficile</i> infection. Both diets are grain-based with comparable profiles of macro and micronutrient composition. Diet 5010-fed mice had severe morbidity and mortality compared to Diet 5053-fed mice despite no differences in <i>C. difficile</i> colonization or toxin production. Furthermore, Diet 5053 protected mice from toxin-induced epithelial damage. This protection was microbiota-dependent as germ-free mice or mice harboring a reduced diversity microbiota fed Diet 5053 were not protected from severe infection. However, cohousing with mice harboring a complex microbiota restored the protective capacity of Diet 5053 but not Diet 5010. Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct metabolic capacities between Diet 5010- and Diet 5053-fed intestinal microbiotas. Diet 5053-mediated protection extended beyond <i>C. difficile</i> infection as Diet 5053-fed mice displayed less severe dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis than Diet 5010-fed mice, highlighting a potentially broader capacity for Diet 5053 to limit colitis. These findings demonstrate that standard diet formulations in combination with the host microbiota can drive variability in severity of infectious and non-infectious murine colitis systems, and that diet holds therapeutic potential to limit the severity of <i>C. difficile</i> infection through modulating the functional capacity of the microbiota.IMPORTANCEDiet is a major modulator of the microbiota and intestinal health. This report finds that two different standard mouse diets starkly alter the severity of colitis observed in a pathogen-mediated (<i>Clostridioides difficile</i>) and non-infectious (dextran sodium sulfate) mouse colitis experimental systems. These findings in part explain study-to-study variability using these mouse systems to study disease. Since the gut microbiota plays a key role in intestinal homeostasis, diet-derived modulation of the microbiota is a promising avenue to control disease driven by intestinal inflammation and may represent a potential intervention strategy for at-risk patients.
40126012	EV68-228-N monoclonal antibody treatment halts progression of paralysis in a mouse model of EV-D68 induced acute flaccid myelitis.	In 2014, 2016, and 2018, infection with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was associated with outbreaks of a poliomyelitis-like paralytic syndrome, called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). While only a small fraction of patients infected with EV-D68 developed AFM, this subgroup of patients does not typically seek treatment until after the onset of neurological symptoms. There are currently no approved human monoclonal antibody therapies or vaccines available for EV-D68. Here, we show that a monoclonal antibody, EV68-228-N, can quickly stop the progression of paralysis in a mouse model of AFM, even when treatment is initiated after the onset of paralysis. We found that EV68-228-N effectively halted the progression of paralysis when tested against both 2014 and 2016 EV-D68 isolates in an immunocompetent mouse model of AFM. All animal experiments were conducted in a blinded fashion. The IC<sub>50</sub> of EV68-228-N against 2014 and 2016 EV-D68 isolates was confirmed <i>in vitro</i> to be less than 330 ng/mL, and EV68-228-N was found to be equally effective at neutralizing 2018 and 2022 viral isolates without any evidence of emerging resistance. We further show that, following infection with EV-D68, mice treated with EV68-228-N have more surviving motor neurons in the spinal cord's lumbar enlargement than control treated animals. Taken together, this work suggests that EV68-228-N treatment has the potential to halt the progression of paralysis in AFM patients who present at the clinic with neurologic symptoms and that EV68-228-N will retain neutralization potential against emerging EV-D68 isolates.
40126010	The long noncoding RNA APR attenuates PPRV infection-induced accumulation of intracellular iron to inhibit membrane lipid peroxidation and viral replication.	Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is an important pathogen that has long been a significant threat to small ruminant productivity worldwide. Iron metabolism is vital to the host and the pathogen. However, the mechanism underlying host-PPRV interactions from the perspective of iron metabolism and iron-mediated membrane lipid peroxidation has not been reported thus far. In this study, we identified a novel host long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA), APR, that impairs PPRV infectivity by sponging miR-3955-5p, a negative microRNA (miRNA) that directly targets the gene encoding the ferritin-heavy chain 1 (FTH1) protein. Importantly, we demonstrated that PPRV infection causes aberrant cellular iron accumulation by increasing transferrin receptor (TFRC) expression and that iron accumulation induces reticulophagy and ferroptosis, which benefits PPRV replication. Moreover, PPRV infection enhanced the localization of cellular iron on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and caused ER membrane damage by promoting excess lipid peroxidation to induce reticulophagy. Interestingly, APR decreased PPRV infection-induced accumulation of intracellular Fe<sup>2+</sup> via miR-3955-5p/FTH1 axis and ultimately inhibited reticulophagy and ferroptosis. Additionally, our results indicate that interferon regulatory factor 1 promotes APR transcription by positively regulating APR promoter activity after PPRV infection. Taken together, our findings revealed a new pattern of PPRV-host interactions, involving noncoding RNA regulation, iron metabolism, and iron-related membrane lipid peroxidation, which is critical for understanding the host defense against PPRV infection and the pathogenesis of PPRV.IMPORTANCEMany viruses have been demonstrated to engage in iron metabolism to facilitate their replication and pathogenesis. However, the mechanism by which PPRV interacts with host cells from the perspective of iron metabolism, or iron-mediated membrane lipid peroxidation, has not yet been reported. Our data provide the first direct evidence that PPRV infection induces aberrant iron accumulation to promote viral replication and reveal a novel host lncRNA, APR, as a regulator of iron accumulation by promoting FTH1 protein expression. In this study, PPRV infection increased cellular iron accumulation by increasing TFRC expression, and more importantly, iron overload increased viral infectivity as well as promoted ER membrane lipid peroxidation by enhancing the localization of cellular iron on the ER and ultimately induced ferroptosis and reticulophagy. Furthermore, a host factor, the lncRNA APR, was found to decrease cellular iron accumulation by sponging miR-3955-5p, which directly targets the gene encoding the FTH1 protein, thereby attenuating PPRV infection-induced ferroptosis and reticulophagy and inhibiting PPRV infection. Taken together, the results of the present study provide new insight into our understanding of host-PPRV interaction and pathogenesis from the perspective of iron metabolism and reveal potential targets for therapeutics against PPRV infection.
40125718	Fluid mechanics of sarcomeres as porous media.	Muscle contraction, both in skeletal and cardiac tissue, is driven by sarcomeres, the microscopic units inside muscle cells where thick myosin and thin actin filaments slide past each other. During contraction and relaxation, the sarcomere's volume changes, causing sarcoplasm (intra-sarcomeric fluid) to flow out during contraction and back in as the sarcomere relaxes. We present a quantitative model of this sarcoplasmic flow, treating the sarcomere as an anisotropic porous medium with regions defined by the presence and absence of thick and thin filaments. Using semi-analytic methods, we solve for axial and lateral fluid flow within the filament lattice, calculating the permeabilities of this porous structure. We then apply these permeabilities within a Darcy model to determine the flow field generated during contraction. The predictions of our continuum model show excellent agreement with finite element simulations, reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude while maintaining accuracy in modelling the biophysical flow dynamics.
40125568	Rhodium(III)-catalyzed asymmetric allylic cyclization of cyclohexadienone-tethered allenes.	The rhodium(III)-catalyzed asymmetric allylic cyclization of cyclohexadienone-tethered allenes is successfully developed. This protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance and is applicable for modifying biologically active molecules containing phenol structures. Notably, compounds 3ga and 3ha demonstrate promising anticancer properties.
40123523	Base-controlled regioselectivity <i>via</i> distinct mechanisms during C-H thionation of azinium salts with elemental sulfur.	Regioselective C-H-thionation of pyridine and quinoline rings can be achieved through the reaction of the corresponding quaternary azinium salts with sulfur and a base <i>via</i> a radical- or carbene-involved reaction pathway. The selectivity of CS group installation is determined by the reaction mechanism and affected by the base used.
40123497	Metal-free regioselective hydrophosphorylation of electron-deficient alkynes catalyzed by oxazaborolidines.	Here, we describe a metal-free strategy for the hydrophosphorylation of electron-deficient alkynyl to access various P-containing olefins catalyzed by commercial oxazaborolidines with high regio-selectivity (<i>E</i> : <i>Z</i> up to 99%). Interestingly, the possible mechanism suggests that the catalytic path proceeds through a synergistic addition process which leads to single <i>E</i>-structure products. Moreover, the chiral oxazaborolidine catalyst probably works as a Lewis pair which can accelerate the cleavage of the O-H bond in diarylphosphine oxides and provide appropriate steric hindrance to control the regioselectivity.
40123496	An azothiazole probe as a multianalyte colorimetric chemosensor for urea and biologically significant amines.	We report an azothiazole-based probe as a chemosensor for urea with a LOD of 45 μM. The underlying sensing principle is an instantaneous color change associated with the complex forming between the probe and ammonia, a hydrolysis product of urea catalyzed by the enzyme urease. In addition, the probe has a broad scope in sensing biologically significant amines such as arginine and lysine across a wide range of pH (4 to 8). Through extensive spectroscopic and computational studies in conjunction with control experiments, the importance of H-bonding in the sensing mechanism has been unraveled, revealing the stoichiometry, binding constant and LOD of these analytes with the probe. Indeed, the two individual amino acids can be distinguished by the spectral changes associated with UV-vis spectroscopy or by contrasting color diffusion under agarose gel conditions. Moreover, the probe shows a broad scope in detecting a range of aliphatic primary and secondary amines, including cyclic amines. The utility of the probe has also been demonstrated by using it for sensing urea in urine samples. These attributes make this probe a cost-effective, reusable and versatile chemosensor with ease of handling for sensing multianalytes by varying the conditions and detection modes.
40123462	Digital light processing 3D printing of high-fidelity and versatile hydrogels <i>via in situ</i> phase separation.	Recently, digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing has garnered significant interest for fabricating high-fidelity hydrogels. However, the intrinsic weak and loose network of hydrogels, coupled with uncontrollable light projection, leads to low printing resolution and restricts their broader applications. Herein, we propose a straightforward DLP 3D printing strategy utilizing <i>in situ</i> phase separation to produce high-fidelity, high-modulus, and biocompatible hydrogels. By selecting acrylamide monomers with poor compatibility within a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) network during polymerization, we create phase-separated domains within polyacrylamide (PAM) that effectively inhibit ultraviolet (UV) light transmission. This regulation of UV light distribution results in anhydrous inks with exceptional properties: ultra-high resolution (1.5 μm), ultra-high modulus (1043 MPa), and high strength (70.0 MPa). Upon hydration, the modulus and strength of the hydrogels decrease to approximately 4000 times those of the anhydrous gels, exhibiting high mechano-moisture sensitivity suitable for actuator applications. Additionally, the DLP 3D-printed hydrogels, featuring micro-scale structures, demonstrate good biocompatibility and facilitate nutrient transport for cell proliferation. This versatile DLP 3D printing strategy paves the way for the fabrication of high-fidelity and multifunctional hydrogels.
40117169	Construction of multi-functionalized carbon chains by Ni-catalyzed carbosulfonylation of butadiene.	Multi-functionalized carbon chains are prevalent motifs existing in various natural products and drugs. How to construct multi-functionalized carbon chains represents a meaningful task. Herein, we developed a photo-induced stereoselective 1,4-carbosulfonylation of butadiene to construct multi-functionalized carbon chains under nickel catalysis. A wide variety of aryl iodides and sodium sulfinates could be facilely coupled with butadiene to generate difunctionalized olefin intermediates. Taking advantage of the internal CC bond, various functional groups have been efficiently incorporated to construct multi-functionalized aliphatic compounds. A scale-up reaction, an iterative reaction and late-stage modifications have been performed to further demonstrate the synthetic utility of this protocol.
40117139	CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>Na-promoted photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohols to aromatic aldehydes and aromatic esters.	Aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohols to aromatic aldehydes and aromatic esters is an important chemical transformation. Here, sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate was used as the precursor of an organic photocatalyst, and it transformed into pentacoordinate sulfide under an O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere and light irradiation at room temperature. The <i>in situ</i> formed pentacoordinate sulfide showed excellent photocatalytic efficiency, with photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohols providing aromatic aldehydes in good yields; photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohols in other aliphatic alcohols afforded aromatic esters in moderate to good yields. The method avoids the use of precious transition-metal complexes and elaborate organic dyes as photocatalysts.
40116797	Visible light-induced g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> catalyzed C-H acylation and trifluoromethylation of quinoxalinones: an efficient and recyclable approach.	Photoinduced C-H functionalization of quinoxalines is a key transformation for the derivatization of biologically relevant molecules. Traditionally, homogeneous catalysts such as transition metal complexes or organic dyes are indispensable for these transformations. However, these methods often suffer from limitations related to cost, recyclability, and environmental impact. Herein, by using inexpensive, readily available and recyclable graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, a diverse range of acyl- and trifluoromethyl-functionalized quinoxalinone derivatives were synthesized in good to excellent yields under the irradiation of blue LEDs. Control experiments confirmed that the photogenerated electrons played a pivotal role in promoting the generation of acyl and trifluoromethyl radical intermediates. Moreover, g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> showed no significant loss of activity after at least six reaction cycles. Potentially, g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> represents a promising alternative to noble metal photocatalysts in organic synthesis.
40116744	Concise practical avenues toward 5,5-spiro-α-prolines.	This article describes concise and practical synthetic approaches toward the multigram-scale preparation of value-added conformationally constrained 5-spirocyclic α-prolines from readily accessible starting materials. Direct carboxylation of 2-spiropyrrolidines is a novel and promising approach to achieve this goal, particularly for substrates with no acidic centers within the spiro-linked portion of the pyrrolidine core. The method allows for quick, one-step preparation of the target chemicals in good yields. An alternative synthetic avenue was designed for substrates unsuitable for direct carboxylation. This 4-step protocol involves common laboratory practice transformations and is comparable in its efficiency to the carboxylation method. This study concludes a series of our investigations on the elaboration of efficient methods for the construction of spiro-proline frameworks.
40116707	Effect of hydroxy groups on X-ray-induced reactions of azo benzene derivatives.	Caged compounds whose chemical bonds are cleavable by specific stimuli are useful tools for life science research because they facilitate control of various biological activities spatiotemporally. Although caged compounds activatable by hard X-rays can be employed for control in deep tissue owing to the high bio-permeability of X-rays, chemical bond cleavage by ionizing radiation has not been investigated adequately. Previously, we demonstrated that an azo bond tethered to a rhodamine scaffold can be efficiently cleaved by hydrated electrons, which is one of the radiolysis products of water, to release rhodamine. In this study, we synthesized novel azo benzene derivatives, AZO1-4, which can release 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA), a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, and hydroxy groups or amino groups were introduced into them in order to assess the substituent effect on azo bond cleavage. While the amount of 3-ABA was nearly the same for all the azo compounds, decomposition of azo compounds increased according to the number of hydroxy groups. Furthermore, a methoxyl-radical-adding product was detected from AZO2. These results suggested that the hydroxy group accelerates not azo bond cleavage but the other decomposition pathway.
40116672	Heterogeneous piezo-self-Fenton material design: an intersecting solution for pollutant degradation and tumor therapy.	Heterogeneous piezo-self-Fenton (EPSF), an integration of piezocatalysis and heterogeneous Fenton reactions, forms the foundation for efficient redox interfacial reactions in complex environments. The significant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the catalytic process and the mechanical energy-driven nature of the EPSF process provide distinct advantages in environmental remediation and biomedical applications. Numerous studies on EPSF catalysts have emerged in recent years across these fields. However, the construction approaches and design strategies for EPSF catalysts in various application scenarios remain unclear. This review synthesizes and analyzes studies on organic pollutant degradation and targeted tumor therapy. Based on the elucidation of redox processes in EPSF catalysis, the catalysts are categorized according to structural features, clarifying common material systems across different fields. The factors influencing EPSF catalytic performance are subsequently outlined, followed by an evaluation of corresponding enhancement strategies. Finally, design strategies for EPSF catalysts across applications are analyzed, emphasizing the commonalities and distinctions in catalyst design for different fields. Insights are provided to inform future catalyst development.
40116601	Synthetic Biology in Natural Product Biosynthesis.	Synthetic biology has played an important role in the renaissance of natural products research during the post-genomics era. The development and integration of new tools have transformed the workflow of natural product discovery and engineering, generating multidisciplinary interest in the field. In this review, we summarize recent developments in natural product biosynthesis from three different aspects. First, advances in bioinformatics, experimental, and analytical tools to identify natural products associated with predicted biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) will be covered. This will be followed by an extensive review on the heterologous expression of natural products in bacterial, fungal and plant organisms. The native host-independent paradigm to natural product identification, pathway characterization, and enzyme discovery is where synthetic biology has played the most prominent role. Lastly, strategies to engineer biosynthetic pathways for structural diversification and complexity generation will be discussed, including recent advances in assembly-line megasynthase engineering, precursor-directed structural modification, and combinatorial biosynthesis.
40116321	Hybrid strengthening of cellulose nanocrystal-based solvent co-cross linked flexible organohydrogels with fast self-healing, diverse adhesive nature, and anti-freezing behavior for advanced human health monitoring.	Continuous real-time monitoring of non-cognitive markers is essential for the preliminary detection, control, and regulation of long-standing health conditions. Existing diagnostic techniques are frequently invasive and often not well suited for at-home monitoring, limiting their use in early detection of disorders. In this study, a flexible organohydrogel-based wearable sensor has been developed offering high accuracy and durability for real-time human health assessment. Employing a solvent co-cross linking strategy, a wrinkle texture organohydrogel is synthesized by combining polyacrylamide (PAm), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) grafted onto the surface of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) through the free radical graft copolymerization technique. This innovative approach combines both physical and chemical interaction to eliminate mechano-chemical conflict and provide the organohydrogel with a balanced mechanical performance (2100% stretchability), toughness (519 kJ m<sup>-3</sup>), flexibility, conductivity ( 0.29 S m<sup>-1</sup>), remarkable adhesion, wide working range (-60 °C to 60 °C), and fast self-healing properties. In contrast to conventional hydrogels, this one-pot synthesis eliminates the need for metallic nanofillers, lowering cytotoxicity. In addition, PAm in combination with CNCs also provides biocompatibility, whereas sodium chloride makes the organohydrogel ionically conductive and sensitive. The engineered sensor exhibits enhanced efficiency, durability, and sensitivity and can be employed in haptic sensing technology.
40114637	Base-mediated synthesis of ring-fluorinated imidazo[1,2-<i>a</i>]pyridines <i>via</i> sequential C-F substitutions.	Developing innovative approaches for the synthesis of compounds that integrate imidazo[1,2-<i>a</i>]pyridines and fluoro fragments is crucial. Herein, an expedient [3 + 3] annulation method for synthesizing ring-fluorinated imidazo[1,2-<i>a</i>]pyridines <i>via</i> two consecutive C-F substitutions from readily available 1<i>C</i>,3<i>N</i>-dinucleophiles and β-CF<sub>3</sub>-1,3-enynes is presented. This protocol exhibits several appealing features, including readily available and inexpensive substrates, a broad range of functional groups, step and atom economy, and mild reaction conditions without any transition-metal catalysts.
40112768	Role of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein in hypothalamic regulation of feeding behavior during fasting and cold exposure.	Appetite regulation is a complex process that is critical for maintaining energy balance and is governed by intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms in the hypothalamus. RNA-binding proteins play vital roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA and influence feeding behavior and energy metabolism. This study explored the role of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (Cirbp) in hypothalamic neurons under metabolic stress conditions, such as fasting and cold exposure. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the hypothalami from fasted mice identified 67 differentially expressed RNA-binding proteins, with Cirbp and RNA-binding motif protein 3 (Rbm3) being significantly upregulated. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed increased Cirbp expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and dorsomedial hypothalamus during fasting, indicating responsiveness to metabolic cues. Ribo-Tag analysis of agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons demonstrated elevated Cirbp expression levels in response to fasting, linking it to hunger-regulating pathways. Intracerebroventricular injection of Cirbp antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS ODN) reduced Cirbp expression, leading to a decrease in food intake and a reduction in body weight, highlighting the functional role of Cirbp in appetite regulation. Cold exposure also induced Cirbp expression in the ARC, which correlated with an increase in food intake. Blockade of Cirbp by AS ODN treatment attenuated cold-induced food intake, indicating that Cirbp plays a specific role in regulating feeding behavior during cold stress. This suggests that Cirbp is a key mediator in hypothalamic responses to metabolic stress, influencing feeding behavior through its regulatory functions in AgRP neurons. Further exploration of Cirbp mechanisms may offer insights into therapeutic strategies for energy balance disorders, such as obesity and anorexia.
40111085	Ultrasound-responsive smart biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.	Bone defects resulting from trauma, tumors, or other injuries significantly impact human health and quality of life. However, current treatments for bone defects are constrained by donor shortages and immune rejection. Bone tissue engineering has partially alleviated the limitations of traditional bone repair methods. The development of smart biomaterials that can respond to external stimuli to modulate the biofunctions has become a prominent area of research. Ultrasound technology is regarded as an optimal "remote controller" and "trigger" for bone repair biomaterials. This review reports the comprehensive and systematic overview of ultrasound-responsive bone repair smart biomaterials. It presents the fundamental theories of bone repair, the definition of ultrasound, and its applications. Furthermore, the review summarizes the ultrasound effect mechanisms of biomaterials and their roles in bone repair, including detailed studies on anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, and cell therapy. Finally, the advantages of ultrasound-responsive smart biomaterials and their future prospects in this field are discussed.
40111082	Adaptive evolution of sesquiterpene deoxyphomenone in mycoparasitism by <i>Hansfordia pulvinata</i> associated with horizontal gene transfer from <i>Aspergillus</i> species.	Leaf mold caused by the ascomycete fungus <i>Cladosporium fulvum</i> is a devastating disease of tomato plants. The mycoparasitic fungus <i>Hansfordia pulvinata</i> is an effective biocontrol agent that parasitizes <i>C. fulvum</i> hyphae on leaves and secretes 13-deoxyphomenone, an eremophilane-type sesquiterpene, which was also identified as a sporulation-inducing factor in <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. Here, we identified deoxyphomenone biosynthesis (<i>DPH</i>) gene clusters conserved in both <i>H. pulvinata</i> and <i>Aspergillus</i> section <i>Flavi</i>, including <i>A. oryzae</i> and <i>A. flavus</i>. Functional disruption of <i>DPH1</i> orthologous genes encoding sesquiterpene cyclase in <i>H. pulvinata</i>, <i>A. oryzae</i>, and its close relative <i>A. flavus</i> revealed that deoxyphomenone in <i>H. pulvinata</i> had exogenic antifungal activity against <i>C. fulvum</i> and controlled endogenic sporulation in <i>Aspergillus</i> species. Complete <i>DPH</i> clusters, highly similar to those in <i>H. pulvinata</i>, were exclusive to <i>Aspergillus</i> section <i>Flavi</i>, while species in other <i>Aspergillus</i> sections contained fragmented <i>DPH</i> clusters. A comparative genomics analysis revealed that these <i>DPH</i> gene clusters share a common origin and are horizontally transferred from an ancestor of <i>Aspergillus</i> to <i>H. pulvinata</i>. Our results suggest that after horizontal transfer, <i>H. pulvinata</i> maintained the <i>DPH</i> cluster as the inhibitory effect of deoxyphomenone on spore germination and mycelial growth contributed to its mycoparasitism on the host fungus <i>C. fulvum</i>.
40111048	Defense arsenal of the strict anaerobe <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> against reactive oxygen species encountered during its infection cycle.	<i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, a strict anaerobe, is the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This enteropathogen must adapt to oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), notably those released by the neutrophils and macrophages recruited to the site of infection or those endogenously produced upon high oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) exposure. <i>C. difficile</i> uses a superoxide reductase, Sor, and several peroxidases to detoxify ROS. We showed that Sor has a superoxide reductase activity <i>in vitro</i> and protects the bacterium from exposure to menadione, a superoxide donor. After confirming the peroxidase activity of the rubrerythrin, Rbr, we showed that this enzyme together with the peroxiredoxin, Bcp, plays a central role in the detoxification of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and promotes the survival of <i>C. difficile</i> in the presence of not only H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but also air or 4% O<sub>2</sub>. Under high O<sub>2</sub> concentrations encountered in the gastrointestinal tract, the bacterium generated endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The two O<sub>2</sub> reductases, RevRbr2 and FdpF, have also a peroxidase activity and participate in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resistance. The <i>CD0828</i> gene, which also contributes to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> protection, forms an operon with <i>rbr</i>, <i>sor</i>, and <i>perR</i> encoding a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensing repressor. The expression of the genes encoding the ROS reductases and the CD0828 protein was induced upon exposure to either H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or air. We showed that the induction of the <i>rbr</i> operon is mediated not only by PerR but also by OseR, a recently identified O<sub>2</sub>-responsive regulator of <i>C. difficile</i>, and indirectly by σ<sup>B</sup>, the sigma factor of the stress response, whereas the expression of <i>bcp</i> is only controlled by σ<sup>B</sup>.
40111047	Insights into the physiological and metabolic features of <i>Thalassobacterium</i>, a novel genus of <i>Verrucomicrobiota</i> with the potential to drive the carbon cycle.	<i>Verrucomicrobiota</i> are widely distributed across various habitats but are difficult to culture. Some previous multiomics analyses reported that <i>Verrucomicrobiota</i> have outstanding metabolic capacity for organic matter degradation and are able to degrade and synthesize polysaccharides, two activities that could contribute significantly to the Earth's carbon cycle. Here, we isolated from marine sediment two novel strains, <i>Thalassobacterium maritimum</i> SDUM461003<sup>T</sup> and <i>Thalassobacterium sedimentorum</i> SDUM461004<sup>T</sup>, that represent a new genus of the difficult-to-culture phylum <i>Verrucomicrobiota</i>. Genome analysis, functional annotation, and experimental verification revealed that these two strains degrade polysaccharides and antibiotics, including some complex sulfated polysaccharides (SPs), primarily fucoidan and chondroitin sulfate. Moreover, electron microscopy images revealed that these bacteria can synthesize and store large amounts of glycogen. These polysaccharide degradation and synthesis capacities also exist but differ under nitrogen-deficient conditions, indicating that <i>Verrucomicrobiota</i> may have the potential to maintain their normal metabolism by nitrogen fixation under aerobic conditions. Given that polysaccharides and their degradation products are particularly crucial carbon sources for marine microorganisms, <i>Verrucomicrobiota</i> are thought to be important contributors to biogeochemical cycling in the ocean.
40111027	Temporal expression classes and functions of vaccinia virus and mpox (monkeypox) virus genes.	Poxviruses comprise pathogens that are highly pathogenic to humans and animals, causing diseases such as smallpox and mpox (formerly monkeypox). The family also contains members developed as vaccine vectors and oncolytic agents to fight other diseases. Vaccinia virus is the prototype poxvirus and the vaccine used to eradicate smallpox. Poxvirus genes follow a cascade temporal expression pattern, categorized into early, intermediate, and late stages using distinct transcription factors. This review comprehensively summarized the temporal expression classification of over 200 vaccinia virus genes. The relationships between expression classes and functions, as well as different branches of immune responses, were discussed. Based on the vaccinia virus orthologs, we classified the temporal expression classes of all the mpox virus genes, including a few that were not previously annotated with orthologs in vaccinia viruses. Additionally, we reviewed the functions of all vaccinia virus genes based on the up-to-date published papers. This review provides a readily usable resource for researchers working on poxvirus biology, medical countermeasures, and poxvirus utility development.
40111021	Lactate dehydrogenase is the Achilles' heel of Lyme disease bacterium <i>Borreliella burgdorferi</i>.	As a zoonotic pathogen, the Lyme disease bacterium <i>Borreliella burgdorferi</i> has evolved unique metabolic pathways, some of which are specific and essential for its survival and thus present as ideal targets for developing new therapeutics. <i>B. burgdorferi</i> dispenses with the use of thiamin as a cofactor and relies on lactate dehydrogenase (BbLDH) to convert pyruvate to lactate for balancing NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios. This report first demonstrates that BbLDH is a canonical LDH with some unique biochemical and structural features. A loss-of-function study then reveals that BbLDH is essential for <i>B. burgdorferi</i> survival and infectivity, highlighting its therapeutic potential. Drug screening identifies four previously unknown LDH inhibitors with minimal cytotoxicity, two of which inhibit <i>B. burgdorferi</i> growth. This study provides mechanistic insights into the function of BbLDH in the pathophysiology of <i>B. burgdorferi</i> and lays the groundwork for developing genus-specific metabolic inhibitors against <i>B. burgdorferi</i> and potentially other tick-borne pathogens as well.
40111017	Nuclear warfare: pathogen manipulation of the nuclear pore complex and nuclear functions.	Viruses and bacteria exploit the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and host nuclear functions to bypass cellular barriers and manipulate essential processes. Viruses frequently engage directly with NPC components, such as nucleoporins, to enable genome import and evade immune defenses. In contrast, bacterial pathogens rely on secreted effector proteins to disrupt nuclear transport and reprogram host transcription. These strategies reflect a remarkable evolutionary convergence, with both types of pathogens targeting the NPC and nuclear functions to promote infection. This minireview explores the overlapping and unique mechanisms by which pathogens hijack the host nucleus, shedding light on their roles in disease and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.
40110641	TM-free full utilization of S atoms: synthesis of thioethers from disulfides and quaternary ammonium salts.	Disulfides are commonly used as alternatives of thiols; however, the full utilization of both S atoms of disulfides under TM-, oxidant/reductant-free conditions is still challenging. In this study, an efficient synthesis of thioethers from disulfides and quaternary ammonium salts under TM-, oxidant/reductant-free conditions has been developed. Both S atoms of disulfides can be transformed into thioether products, thus improving sulfur resource utilization. The method can be easily extended to the synthesis of valuable alkyl dithiocarbamates and can be readily scaled up to the gram scale, showing good practicality value.
40108859	Transcriptome-Based Mining of the Strong Promoters for Hyperproduction of Gibberellin GA3 in <i>Fusarium fujikuroi</i>.	Gibberellin GA3 is a plant growth regulator with significant applications in agriculture, and <i>Fusarium fujikuroi</i> has gained attention as an excellent host for the industrial production of GA3. Although numerous gene-editing tools have been developed, the precise metabolic flux regulation in <i>F. fujikuroi</i> was significantly hindered because the endogenous promoters were rarely identified. In this study, a library containing 20 potential promoters was mined and constructed for the first time through transcriptome sequencing. Using β-glucuronidase as a reporter gene, promoter <i>P</i><sub><i>10594</i></sub> showed the highest relative activity and had a stable expression in different media, which was identified as a strong constitutive promoter. Subsequently, <i>P</i><sub><i>10594</i></sub> was used to regulate the metabolic flux for GA3 overproduction. The yield reached 0.89 g/L in the shake flask, 17.1% higher than the control strain. Finally, 2.38 g/L GA3 can be obtained in a 5 L bioreactor using the engineered strain FF-2. In general, the work enriched the promoter library in <i>F. fujikuroi</i> and provided help for reshaping the complex metabolic flow.
40107477	Mechanism of ethyl acetate fraction of Amorphophallus konjac against breast cancer based on network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental validation.	Amorphophallus konjac (Sheliugu), a medicinal and edible herb from East China and regions south of the Yangtze River, exhibits significant antitumor activity. However, its active constituents and mechanisms remain poorly understood.
40107113	Study of the antimicrobial activity of carvacrol and its mechanism of action against drug-resistant bacteria.	Drug-resistant bacterial infections have been one of the critical health issues encountered worldwide currently because most conventional antibiotics are losing their effectiveness in clinical treatments. It is thus urgently to identify new antibiotics or alternatives against drug-resistant bacteria. For this purpose, we attempted to seek active compounds from commercially available natural products, which may be one of the fast-tracks to address the drug-resistant bacterial infections. In the present study, we investigated the antibacterial activity, antibacterial mechanism and synergistic effects of carvacrol against a panel of drug-resistant bacteria, including some clinical isolates. The results show that carvacrol (cymophenol), a monoterpenoid phenol, has excellent antibacterial activity. The MIC values against the bacteria examined are found to be 4-16 μg/mL. Our results also suggested that carvacrol might not likely to induce drug-resistance. More importantly, when carvacrol combined with first-line antibiotics, it exhibited good synergistic effects against drug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, in morphological studies, carvacrol could cause B. subtilis 168 elongation and S. aureus BAA-41 enlargement, which may suggest an antibacterial mechanism possibly correlated with the inhibition of bacterial cell division. We further demonstrated that carvacrol facilitated the polymerization of FtsZ that is a critically important protein for regulating bacterial cell division. Furthermore, molecular modeling predicted that carvacrol could interact with T7-loop of FtsZ. The findings of this study suggest that carvacrol may be a potential inhibitor of FtsZ and it could be utilized to combat drug-resistant bacteria in combination with existing antibiotics.
40107112	Proteome of amino acids or IGF1-stimulated pacu muscle cells offers molecular insights and suggests FN1B and EIF3C as candidate markers of fish muscle growth.	Study of fish skeletal muscle is essential to understand physiological or metabolic processes, and to develop programs searching for increased muscle mass and meat production. Amino acids (AA) and IGF1 stimulate processes that lead to muscle growth, but their signaling pathways and molecular regulation need further clarification in fish. We obtained the proteome of pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) cultured muscle cells treated with AA or IGF1, which induced the differential abundance of 67 and 53 proteins, respectively. Enrichment analyses showed that AA modulated histone methylation, cell differentiation, and metabolism, while IGF1 modulated ATP production and protein synthesis. In addition, we identified molecular networks with candidate markers that commonly regulate fish muscle cells: FN1B and EIF3C, respectively up- and down-regulated by both treatments. FN1B was related to cell proliferation, protein synthesis, and muscle repair, while EIF3C connected with negative regulators of muscle growth. Their gene expression was evaluated in pacu and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) after nutrient manipulation, with fn1b increased during refeeding and eif3c increased during fasting in both species. Our work helps clarify the molecular regulation by AA or IGF1 and suggests that FN1B and EIF3C could be potential stimulatory and inhibitory biomarkers of fish muscle growth.
40107111	Photosensitized Z-isomerization of (all-E)-carotenoids by a natural sensitizer riboflavin (vitamin B<sub>2</sub>): Experimental and quantum chemistry studies.	Recent studies have shown that the Z-isomers of carotenoids have higher bioavailability and potentially greater biological activity than the naturally predominant all-E-isomers. Therefore, the development of a safe and efficient isomerization method is required. In this study, a riboflavin-mediated photoisomerization technique was established for increasing the Z-isomer ratio of carotenoids. Initially, to understand the riboflavin-mediated photoisomerization characteristics of carotenoids, the effects of the reaction conditions (e.g., riboflavin concentration, photoirradiation wavelength, and solvent type) on the isomerization and degradation of lycopene were studied, and the total Z-isomer ratio was successfully increased by >50 %. Riboflavin-mediated photoisomerization was also observed in other carotenoids, that is, β-carotene, lutein, astaxanthin, and fucoxanthin. Subsequently, the riboflavin-mediated photoisomerization of lycopene was investigated using quantum chemical calculations, which indicated that the isomerization proceeded via triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET) from excited riboflavin to lycopene.
40107110	Raman spectroscopic modality to examine therapeutic efficacy of Galectin-3 inhibitor in prostate cancer.	Glycoproteins, such as Galectin-3 (Gal-3) and Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), are functional proteins involved in numerous biological activities that include cell apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Downregulation of both in the highly metastatic human Prostate Cancer (CaP) cell line PC-3 reduces tumor growth. We used Raman Spectroscopy (RS) to examine the effect of a potent Gal-3 inhibitor (GB1107) in CaP cell lines of varying metastatic potential, namely PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP. All three cancer lines had distinct Raman signatures. Raman spectra from PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP cells treated with GB1107, compared to the untreated cells as controls, showed significant differences corresponding to changes in phosphatidylinositol (peak at 596 cm<sup>-1</sup>), O-P-O stretching DNA (786 cm<sup>-1</sup>), lipid/phospholipid DNA backbone (1090-1100 cm<sup>-1</sup>), nucleic acid, lipid, protein (amide III) (1296-1305 cm<sup>-1</sup>), fatty acid (1440 cm<sup>-1</sup>), and protein (amid I) (1655 cm<sup>-1</sup>), suggesting that DNA phosphate backbone may become unstable with cancer progression, facilitating cancer cell metastasis. Our data suggests that Gal-3 inhibitor induces significant alterations in major biochemical constituents, such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, which may lead to structural and molecular changes in the cancerous prostate tissue. To further analyze these spectral differences, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were applied for classification, enabling effective differentiation between treated and untreated CaP cell lines. This highlights the therapeutic potential of Gal-3 inhibitor in prevention of CaP progression and metastases.
40107109	Intracellular anionic substances cause tau liquid-liquid phase separation.	Tau protein aggregation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Niemann-Pick disease type C. Liquid-liquid phase separation has emerged as a key mechanism in the early stages of protein aggregation for these disorders. Tau protein incubated with heparin undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation to form liquid droplets in vitro. However, whether tau liquid droplet formation occurs in vivo remains unresolved. To investigate cellular conditions that promote tau droplet formation, we treated tau-expressing human embryonic kidney 293T cells with reagents that introduced anionic substances or induced intracellular vesicle accumulation. Suppression of Niemann-Pick disease type C1 protein, a lysosomal membrane protein involved in mediating intracellular cholesterol trafficking, or the introduction of negatively charged dextran into cultured cells, increased the formation of tau-positive puncta with liquid droplet characteristics in a concentration-dependent manner. After prolonged observation, these puncta transitioned from a dynamic liquid state to a more solid-like gel phase, indicating progressive aggregation. Our findings suggest that intracellular enrichment of negatively charged substances or vesicles induces tau phase separation, potentially contributing to its pathological aggregation. These results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
40107108	The engineered dimer of L-arabinonate dehydratase from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii: The role of intersubunit interactions in IlvD/EDD family.	Engineering of protein oligomeric state or quaternary structure is a promising approach to adjust proteins for utilization in different applications and research. This study provides a detailed investigation of oligomerization within IlvD/EDD superfamily. A large 255 kDa tetrameric protein of the IlvD/EDD superfamily, L-arabinonate dehydratase from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, was engineered to create a dimeric form containing the [2Fe-2S] catalytic center. Four variants, which contain mutations at two locations of the dimer-dimer interface, were produced. The mutants were analyzed using UV-vis and native mass spectrometry, while iron composition and enzymatic activity with five substrates were also investigated. The three variants with mutations closer to the catalytic center showed a color change with shifted maximum absorption at 455 nm and had reduced catalytic activity. One of the variants, D39K, located farther from the active center, maintained a similar color to the wild-type enzyme. The D39K had a mild decline in the catalytic activity, and it existed in dimeric form. The three-dimensional structure analysis suggests that the D39K mutation disrupted a larger ionic-interaction network on the protein surface, thus preventing the formation of the tetramer.
40107107	The TT8 transcription factor alleviates nickel toxicity in Arabidopsis.	Nickel (Ni) is a necessary element for plants, but excessive accumulation of Ni in soil causes plant damage, one of which is oxidative stress. Plants utilize secondary metabolite polyphenols such as anthocyanins as antioxidant molecules and metal chelators to cope with heavy metal toxicity. However, the regulatory factors linking polyphenol accumulation to resistance to Ni stress in plants remain unidentified. Arabidopsis TRANSPARENT TESTA8 (TT8) is an essential transcription factor involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, especially in seeds. Here, we reported that TT8 links polyphenol accumulation to Arabidopsis tolerance to Ni stress. TT8 knockout reduced the anthocyanin content in the seed coat, leading to several aspects of Ni toxicity: low seedling survival rates, delayed seed germination, severe membrane lipid peroxidation damage, reduced antioxidant capacity, and low polyphenol (especially epicatechin) abundance. When TT8 was overexpressed, these Arabidopsis plants tolerated extreme Ni stress with high survival rates and germination rates and accumulated more polyphenols. On the basis of these data, we concluded that TT8 maintains the antioxidant capacity of Arabidopsis to avoid Ni stress-induced oxidative damage by promoting polyphenol accumulation. Moreover, TT8 not only responds to Ni stress but also positively regulates six flavonoid biosynthesis enzyme-encoding genes (CHS, CHI, F3H, F3'H, DFR, and FLS). Therefore, TT8-mediated transcriptional regulation cascades of flavonoid biosynthesis may contribute to its effects on polyphenol accumulation. Collectively, our findings provide deep mechanical insights into how specific transcription factors alleviate excessive Ni toxicity in plants and offer new approaches for the breeding of Ni stress-tolerant crops.
40106790	4D Printing: A Comprehensive Review of Technologies, Materials, Stimuli, Design, and Emerging Applications.	4D printing is a groundbreaking technology that seamlessly integrates additive manufacturing with smart materials, enabling the creation of multiscale objects capable of changing shapes and/or functions in a controlled and programmed manner in response to applied energy inputs. Printing technologies, mathematical modeling, responsive materials, stimuli, and structural design constitute the blueprint of 4D printing, all of which have seen rapid advancement in the past decade. These advancements have opened up numerous possibilities for dynamic and adaptive structures, finding potential use in healthcare, textiles, construction, aerospace, robotics, photonics, and electronics. However, current 4D printing primarily focuses on proof-of-concept demonstrations. Further development is necessary to expand the range of accessible materials and address fabrication complexities for widespread adoption. In this paper, we aim to deliver a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in 4D printing, probing into shape programming, exploring key aspects of resulting constructs including printing technologies, materials, structural design, morphing mechanisms, and stimuli-responsiveness, and elaborating on prominent applications across various fields. Finally, we discuss perspectives on limitations, challenges, and future developments in the realm of 4D printing. While the potential of this technology is undoubtedly vast, continued research and innovation are essential to unlocking its full capabilities and maximizing its real-world impact.
40105866	Strategies and Prospects for High-Performance Te-Free Thermoelectric Materials.	Thermoelectric materials hold great potential for direct conversion of ubiquitous waste heat into electricity. However, their commercialization is hindered by low efficiency, reliance on rare and expensive Te, and limited stability under operating conditions. This review explores recent advances in novel strategies for achieving high thermoelectric performance and stability in Te-free inorganic bulk materials. First, we discuss diverse innovative techniques aimed at substantially enhancing electrical transport properties. These methods encompass strategies such as charge carrier engineering, band convergence, band inversion, valley anisotropy, multiband synglisis, and the incorporation of resonant levels or midgap states. Then we focus on strategies to reduce lattice thermal conductivity, including phonon scattering induced by multidimensional defects, off-center doping, resonance scattering, and lattice softening. Additionally, this review presents strategies for decoupling electron and phonon transport to enhance the thermoelectric performance of materials further. The strategies include interface engineering, crystal symmetry manipulation, high-entropy engineering and nanostructuring, high-pressure technology, and magnetically enhanced thermoelectrics. Moreover, we highlight novel strategies for improving the chemical and thermal stability of materials under operating conditions. Last, we discuss current controversies and challenges and suggest future directions for further research to improve the thermoelectric performance of Te-free bulk materials.
40105790	Scalability of a graph neural network in accurate prediction of frictional contact networks in suspensions.	Dense suspensions often exhibit shear thickening, characterized by a dramatic increase in viscosity under large external forcing. This behavior has recently been linked to the formation of a system-spanning frictional contact network (FCN), which contributes to increased resistance during deformation. However, identifying these frictional contacts poses experimental challenges and is computationally expensive. This study introduces a graph neural network (GNN) model designed to accurately predict FCNs by two dimensional simulations of dense shear thickening suspensions. The results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the GNN model across various stress levels (<i>σ</i>), packing fractions (<i>ϕ</i>), system sizes, particle size ratios (<i>Δ</i>), and amounts of smaller particles. The model is further able to predict both the occurrence and structure of a FCN. The presented model is accurate and interpolates and extrapolates to conditions far from its control parameters. This machine learning approach provides an accurate, lower cost, and faster predictions of suspension properties compared to conventional methods, while it is trained using only small systems. Ultimately, the findings in this study pave the way for predicting frictional contact networks in real-life large-scale polydisperse suspensions, for which theoretical models are largely limited owing to computational challenges.
40105447	Highly enantio-selective synthesis of aza-spirocyclic indanones <i>via</i> rhodium catalysis.	A facile synthetic method for chiral aza-spirocyclic indanones was developed with excellent enantioselectivities (81%-98% ee) <i>via</i> rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric domino conjugate addition/1,4-Rh shift/nucleophilic addition with traditional substrates of conjugate addition. The factors that affected the selectivity for aza-spirocyclic indanones were systematically studied.
40105369	<i>Bordetella</i> adenylate cyclase toxin elicits chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming that blocks differentiation of monocytes into macrophages.	<i>Bordetella pertussis</i> infects human upper airways and deploys an array of immunosuppressive virulence factors, among which the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) plays a prominent role in disarming host phagocytes. CyaA binds the complement receptor-3 (CR3 aka α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> integrin CD11b/CD18 or Mac-1) of myeloid cells and delivers into their cytosol an adenylyl cyclase enzyme that hijacks cellular signaling through unregulated conversion of cytosolic ATP to cAMP. We found that the action of as little CyaA as 22 pM (4 ng/mL) blocks macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-driven transition of migratory human CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes into macrophages. Global transcriptional profiling (RNAseq) revealed that exposure of monocytes to 22 pM CyaA for 40 hours in culture with 20 ng/mL of M-CSF led to upregulation of genes that exert negative control of monocyte to macrophage differentiation (e.g., <i>SERPINB2, DLL1,</i> and <i>CSNK1E</i>). The sustained CyaA action yielded downregulation of numerous genes involved in processes crucial for host defense, such as myeloid cell differentiation, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and bactericidal activities. CyaA-elicited signaling also promoted deacetylation and trimethylation of lysines 9 and 27 of histone 3 (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) and triggered the formation of transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin patches in the nuclei of CyaA-exposed monocytes. These effects were partly reversed by the G9a methyltransferase inhibitor UNC 0631 and by the pleiotropic HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin-A, revealing that CyaA-elicited epigenetic alterations mediate transcriptional reprogramming of monocytes and play a role in CyaA-triggered block of monocyte differentiation into bactericidal macrophage cells.IMPORTANCETo proliferate on host airway mucosa and evade elimination by patrolling sentinel cells, the whooping cough agent <i>Bordetella pertussis</i> produces a potently immunosubversive adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) that blocks opsonophagocytic killing of bacteria by phagocytes like neutrophils and macrophages. Indeed, chemotactic migration of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes to the infection site and their transition into bactericidal macrophages, thus replenishing the exhausted mucosa-patrolling macrophages, represents one of the key mechanisms of innate immune defense to infection. We show that the cAMP signaling action of CyaA already at a very low toxin concentration triggers massive transcriptional reprogramming of monocytes that is accompanied by chromatin remodeling and epigenetic histone modifications, which block the transition of migratory monocytes into bactericidal macrophage cells. This reveals a novel layer of toxin action-mediated hijacking of functional differentiation of innate immune cells for the sake of mucosal pathogen proliferation and transmission to new hosts.
40105358	Geographic divergence of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ST5-SCC<i>mec</i>I in the aftermath of a major earthquake and tsunami: impact of a plasmid harboring heavy metal resistance genes.	Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) is a major public health menace. The global spread of MRSA is characterized by successive waves of epidemic clones dominating specific geographical regions. The acquisition of genes encoding resistance to heavy metals (HMRGs) is thought to be a key feature in the geographic divergence of MRSA. However, the cause-effect relationship between the presence of HMRGs and the divergence of MRSA clones remains to be clarified. In this study, we assessed the role that HMRGs may have played in the evolutionary divergence of the MRSA ST5-SCC<i>mec</i>I lineage in Latin America. We conducted a genomic characterization of 113 MRSA clinical isolates from six Latin American healthcare centers, including 53 isolates collected from two cities in Chile (Santiago and Concepción). We found a plasmid (pSCL4752) harboring arsenic, cadmium, and mercury resistance genes in 65% (<i>n</i> = 71) of the ST5-SCC<i>mec</i>I isolates. We also observed a geographic divergence associated with the presence of pSCL4752 in Chilean isolates, with a higher frequency in isolates from Concepción (88%) compared to Santiago (29%). Interestingly, a molecular clock analysis revealed that this divergence occurred in the aftermath of an 8.8 Mw earthquake and tsunami that struck the Concepción area in 2010. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the carriage of pSCL4752 can be beneficial or detrimental for ST5-SCC<i>mec</i>I isolates, depending on the environmental availability of these heavy metals. Our results suggest that the divergence of the ST5-SCC<i>mec</i>I MRSA lineage in Latin America could have been fostered by environmental disasters and influenced by the presence/absence of HMRGs harbored in a plasmid.IMPORTANCEMethicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) is a major cause of life-threatening infections worldwide and a growing public health concern. The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, is often linked to genetic adaptations that enhance their survival. Our research sheds light on how environmental changes, such as those triggered by a natural disaster, can influence the evolution and geographic spread of a highly resistant MRSA lineage in Latin America. We identified a plasmid carrying genes for resistance to arsenic, cadmium, and mercury, which was associated with the geographic divergence of the ST5-SCC<i>mec</i>I MRSA lineage, with striking differences in its prevalence between regions affected by a major earthquake and tsunami. By linking environmental events to pathogen evolution, our study highlights the role of ecological pressures in the spread of MRSA. These findings emphasize the need to integrate environmental monitoring into public health strategies to better understand the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance.
40105351	Penton blooming, a conserved mechanism of genome delivery used by disparate microviruses.	Microviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses infecting bacteria, characterized by T = 1 shells made of single jelly-roll capsid proteins. To understand how microviruses infect their host cells, we have isolated and studied an unusually large microvirus, Ebor. Ebor belongs to the proposed "Tainavirinae" subfamily of <i>Microviridae</i> and infects the model Alphaproteobacterium <i>Rhodobacter capsulatus</i>. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we show that the enlarged capsid of Ebor is the result of an extended C-terminus of the major capsid protein. The extra packaging space accommodates genes encoding a lytic enzyme and putative methylase, both absent in microviruses with shorter genomes. The capsid is decorated with protrusions at its 3-fold axes, which we show to recognize lipopolysaccharides on the host surface. Cryogenic electron tomography shows that during infection, Ebor attaches to the host cell via five such protrusions. This attachment brings a single pentameric capsomer into close contact with the cell membrane, creating a special vertex through which the genome is ejected. Both subtomogram averaging and single particle analysis identified two intermediates of capsid opening, showing that the interacting penton opens from its center via the separation of individual capsomer subunits. Structural comparison with the model <i>Bullavirinae</i> phage phiX174 suggests that this genome delivery mechanism may be widely present across <i>Microviridae</i>.
40105344	Nanopore sequencing for precise detection of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and drug resistance: a retrospective multicenter study in China.	Tuberculosis (TB) management in endemic regions often grapples with resource constraints, including the scarcity of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>) culture laboratories. The emergence of <i>M.tb</i> strains with complex drug resistance profiles necessitates rapid and comprehensive drug susceptibility testing (DST) to guide patient treatment. However, traditional phenotypic DST (pDST) for <i>M.tb</i> is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we retrospectively enrolled 829 participants from six specialized TB treatment hospitals in China from September 2022 to July 2023. The diagnostic performance of TBseq test, a targeted-nanopore sequencing assay, was compared head-to-head with <i>M.tb</i> culture, acid-fast bacillus smear, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra by using clinical diagnosis as the reference standard. Subsequently, pDST for seven anti-TB drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, streptomycin, levofloxacin, amikacin, and capreomycin) was performed. The resistance predictions provided by the TBseq test were compared with pDST results, which were used as a reference standard. The performance estimates of TBseq test were quantified through sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), providing a comprehensive assessment of its diagnostic accuracy. We found that TBseq test demonstrated significantly superior diagnostic performance for TB compared to other methods, achieving a sensitivity of 90.9% (95% CI: 88.9%-93.0%), specificity of 93.0% (95% CI: 97.2%-99.5%), and an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.876-0.963). TBseq test also exhibited robust predictive capabilities for drug resistance to the seven anti-TB drugs, with sensitivity and specificity consistently above 90% for all drugs. The AUC values ranged from 0.919 to 0.998, indicative of high diagnostic accuracy in forecasting drug resistance.IMPORTANCEOur results show that TBseq test offers excellent identification performance for tuberculosis (TB), significantly outperforming <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb)</i> culture, acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear, qPCR, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Its diagnostic accuracy for anti-TB drug resistance is also superior, with sensitivity and specificity above 90% for all drugs tested. This method can be integrated into routine clinical diagnostic workflows, enabling early diagnosis and reporting of drug resistance simultaneously.
40104845	Design, synthesis, and apoptotic evaluation of spiro[indoline-3,3'-pyrazolo[1,2-<i>a</i>]indazole] derivatives <i>via</i> [3 + 2] <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-cycloaddition.	An efficient protocol for the synthesis of spiro[indoline-3,3'-pyrazolo[1,2-<i>a</i>]indazole] derivatives was developed <i>via</i> a [3 + 2] <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-cycloaddition strategy, utilizing substituted 2-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)malononitrile derivatives and 1,2-dihydro-3<i>H</i>-indazol-3-one under mild conditions, yielding excellent results (3a-3l). Furthermore, selected derivatives (3e and 3h-3l) were evaluated for cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines, including MCF-7 (breast cancer), A549 (lung cancer), Colo-205 (colon cancer), and A2780 (ovarian cancer). The IC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from 1.34 ± 0.21 μM (for 3l against MCF-7) to 8.53 ± 1.49 μM (for 3h against A2780). Notably, derivative 3l demonstrated the most potent apoptotic activity, exhibiting the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> values across all four cancer cell lines. Additionally, molecular docking studies corroborated the observed biological activity, suggesting that these compounds may interact with relevant cellular targets, potentially accounting for their cytotoxic effects.
40101857	Shuangxia Decoction attenuates sleep disruption in 5×FAD mice through neuroinflammation inhibition: An integrative analysis of transcriptomic and molecular biology investigations.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory and learning deficits. Circadian rhythm disruption-induced sleep disruption is frequently observed in AD patients. The Shuangxia Decoction (SXD) comprising Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit. (Banxia) and Prunella vulgaris L. (Xiakucao), has been effectively used to treate sleep disruption for thousands of years. However, the mechanisms by which SXD treated AD through circadian rhythm-related pathways remain unexplored.
40101652	Histone variant H2A.Z is a conserved regulator of RBOH expression and ROS production during innate immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum.	Histone variant H2A.Z, a conserved variant of core histone H2A, has been widely accept as a master regulator of plant gene transcription and plant-environment interactions including pathogen resistance. Yet the exact roles of H2A.Z in mediating stepwise plant immune such as ROS production are not known, which is a pivotal step in plant-pathogen interactions and is predominantly controlled by the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOGUE (RBOH) family. In this research, we found that mutation of three and two H2A.Z genes in Arabidopsis and tomato both reduced the plant pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)-triggered ROS burst. Further study proved that AtRbohD and SlRbohB are constitutively upregulated in H2A.Z mutants, however the PAMP-induced activation of RBOHs are largely lost, which is accompanied with direct eviction of H2A.Z on AtRbohD. Besides, in tomato, mutation of H2A.Z resulted in compromised resistance to Pst. DC3000. To summarize, our results revealed a conserved role of H2A.Z in regulating PAMP-triggered RBOH activation, ROS production and immunity during pathogen invasion in Arabidopsis and tomato.
40099907	The human microbiome-derived antimicrobial lugdunin self-regulates its biosynthesis by a feed-forward mechanism.	Many human microbiome members inhibit bacterial competitors by production of antimicrobial compounds whose expression needs to be tightly controlled to balance the costs and benefits of compound biosynthesis. The nasal commensal <i>Staphylococcus lugdunensis</i> outcompetes <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> using the antimicrobial lugdunin. The lugdunin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encodes two potential regulators whose roles have remained unknown. Deletion of the regulator genes <i>lugR</i> or <i>lugJ</i> led to increased lugdunin production and/or immunity. While LugR was found to repress the transcription of the biosynthetic <i>lugRABCTDZ</i> operon, LugJ repressed the <i>lugIEFGH</i> export and immunity genes. Both regulators bound to different inverted repeats in the controlled promoter regions. Notably, both repressors were released from cognate promoters to allow transcription upon addition of exogenous lugdunin. Even minor structural changes disabled lugdunin derivatives to induce expression of its BGC, which is consistent with inferior binding to the predicted LugR and LugJ binding pockets. Thus, lugdunin controls its own biosynthesis through a feed-forward mechanism probably to avoid futile production.IMPORTANCEBiosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are usually tightly controlled to avoid production of costly goods at inappropriate time points or unfavorable conditions. However, in most cases, the regulatory signals of these clusters have remained unknown. Frequently, quorum sensing or two-component regulatory systems are involved in BGC expression control. This study elucidates the sophisticated regulation of lugdunin biosynthesis and secretion via two independent regulators, LugR and LugJ. Although belonging to different families of repressors, both directly interact with the antimicrobial lugdunin and thereby enhance biosynthesis and secretion in a feed forward-like mechanism.
40099881	Metagenomic and transcriptomic investigation of pediatric acute liver failure cases reveals a common pathway predominated by monocytes.	In 2022, a cluster of severe childhood hepatitis was detected primarily in Europe and North America, leading to a global alert by the World Health Organization. An association with adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) in conjunction with human adenoviruses was found. Five percent of the cases progressed to acute liver failure, necessitating transplantation. The mechanism of disease that accounts for fulminant liver failure in these patients remains incompletely described. An upsurge was observed of in the five total cases of acute liver failure that presented to the Dutch national referral center for pediatric liver transplantation in the spring of 2022. An in-depth molecular analysis of the mechanism of pediatric acute liver failure was performed using targeted transcriptomics and metagenomics to identify any virus present in the cases, immune profile haplotypes, and differentially expressed gene groups. Explanted liver tissue and plasma samples (<i>n</i> = 15) were subjected to viral metagenomic and human transcriptomic profiling, targeting >600 inflammatory genes. Liver transcriptomic signatures of transplanted cases were compared with those of pediatric controls from a liver biobank (<i>n</i> = 6). AAV2, adenoviruses, and herpesviruses were detected in liver explant tissue and plasma samples of the cases. Epstein-Barr virus and varicella zoster virus infection with pathognomonic clinical symptomatology preceded liver failure in two respective cases. AAV2 was detected in one-third of control livers. Excessive activation of monocyte pathways was detected in liver explants from cases compared with controls. Remarkably, this signature was comparable for AAV2, adenoviruses, and/or herpesviruses-positive transplant cases. Our multi-omic findings suggest a common transcriptomic profile, with an upregulation of monocyte pathways in the presented transplanted cases, which had similar severe clinical outcomes. In the cohort presented, AAV2 was not exclusively associated with acute liver failure, suggesting that other processes may have contributed to a uniform cascade of irreversible pathology.
40099750	One-pot synthesis of diaroyl benzothiepine-1,1-dioxides.	We report the one-pot two-step synthesis of diaroyl benzothiepine-1,1-dioxides <i>via</i> rongalite-mediated double sulfination of α-bromoacetophenones followed by double condensation of the resulting 1,3-diaroyl sulfones and <i>o</i>-phthalaldehydes. In the (1C + 1C + 1S + 4C) reaction process, a seven-membered ring system could be constructed by two carbon-sulfur (C-S) single bonds and two carbon-carbon double bonds (CC) under mild conditions. A related putative mechanism is proposed and discussed in this article.
40098544	A mechanoresponsive heterochiral hydrogelator as a potential matrix metalloproteinase-2 inhibitor: unravelling its anti-inflammatory efficacy <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.	Inflammations are innate and adaptive immune responses that get instigated in reciprocation to infection. However, if left unchecked, they pose a formidable challenge in clinical settings. In search of user-friendly solutions, our work delineated a rational combinatorial strategy, harnessing chiral orchestration in a triphenylalanine fragment and appending it to δ-amino valeric acid at the N-terminus (hydrogelators I-VIII) such that a potential matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) inhibitor could be fished out from the design. Our rigorous investigations revealed that from a pool of eight constructs, hydrogelator VIII, with a DLL configuration at the triphenylalanines, displayed excellent MMP2 inhibitory activities <i>in vitro</i>, which was further supported by molecular modelling studies. Besides, the β-sheet structured scaffold not only showed substantial antibacterial efficacy against the Gram-positive pathogens <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>S. mutans</i>, <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>E. fecalis</i> but also exhibited proteolytic stability and biocompatibility towards mammalian cells. Furthermore, the scaffold possessed high mechanical strength at physiological pH and mechanical stress-triggered gel-sol-gel transition properties. Finally, the <i>in vivo</i> efficacy was evaluated using an air pouch model of acute inflammation in albino mice that certified hydrogelator VIII as a promising anti-inflammatory therapeutic to pave the path for future healthcare management.
40097149	Clinical Phenotype and Genetic Analysis of a Family with Hereditary Antithrombin Deficiency Caused by SERPINC1 Gene Mutation.	Inherited deficiency of the antithrombin (hereditary antithrombin deficiency, AT deficiency, OMIM #613118) is a relatively rare (1:2,000-3,000) autosomal-dominant disorder with high risk of venous thromboembolism. The molecular basis of this condition has not yet fully understood, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the underlying pathological mechanisms.This study aimed to investigate coagulation parameters and genetic phenotypes in a proband with hereditary antithrombin deficiency and her family members. Additionally, the investigation sought to provide preliminary insights for the molecular pathogenesis of this condition.Blood coagulation parameters, including plasma antithrombin activity (AT:A), antithrombin antigen (AT:Ag), protein C activity (PC:A), and protein S activity (PS:A) were measured in the peripheral blood of each family member by a Stago instrument. Peripheral blood was also extracted and sequenced to identify possible genetic mutation sites. The functional impact of variants on protein was subsequently analyzed by bioinformatics software.The proband, her mother, and brother all exhibited decreased activity and antigen of AT but normal PC and PS activity. The proband's father had normal activity and antigen levels of AT, PC, and PS. Sequencing revealed the proband's mother inherited the SERPINC1:c.661T > C,p.(Trp221Arg) heterozygous variant and her father harbored PROC:c.572_574del,p.(Lys193del) heterozygous variant while the proband as well as her brother carried both. Conservation analysis revealed that Trp221 is highly conserved across homologous species. Bioinformatics tools consistently classify the p.Trp221Arg mutation as "pathogenic" or "deleterious." Protein modeling indicated that the p.Trp221Arg variant does not alter the protein structure but may modify glycosylation sites to affect its function.The proband and family members exhibited varying degrees of decreased levels of AT and thrombosis, which were closely associated with inheritance of SERPINC1:c.661T > C,p.(Trp221Arg).
40096900	Tongmai Yangxin pill alleviates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by regulating mitochondrial fusion and fission through the estrogen receptor alpha/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha signaling pathway.	The Tongmai Yangxin Pill (TMYX) is derived from the Zhigancao decoction recorded in Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders (Shang Han Lun) by Zhang Zhongjing during the Han dynasty. The prescription of TMYX reflects a therapeutic rationale and efficacy unique to traditional Chinese medicine. TMYX is clinically effective in alleviating myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI). However, the precise active ingredients and underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
40096787	Gene expression and characterization of an antimicrobial peptide from Medicago sativa "Sazova" cultivar.	In recent years, the discovery of new antimicrobial agents has become necessary because of the increase in antibiotic resistance, the development of herbicides and fungicides resistance. Among the antimicrobial agents, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) stand out due to their stable structure. In this study, the aim was to identify a thermostable AMP from the seeds of M. sativa "Sazova" cultivar and to analyze gene expression during germination. Antimicrobial tests were performed for the seed peptides after heat treatment (85 °C for 10 min), revealing antimicrobial effects against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans. Subsequently, the peptide band corresponding to the inhibition zone was identified as M. sativa Defensin 2.1 (MsDef2.1, MW: 5.2048 kDa). The gene expression analysis of MsDef2.1 in Sazova cultivar showed that the gene was expressed different plant organs, and the expression was decreased over time. As a result of the gene analysis of two cultivars (Sazova and LegenDairy) it was found that there are 5 base differences in the coding sequence and 3 amino acid differences between the sequences of MsDef2.1 isoforms from the LegenDairy and Sazova cultivars. The physiochemical properties, secondary, and tertiary structure of the Sazova Defensin 2.1 were predicted by using bioinformatic tools. Due to the amino acid substitutions in γ-core structures, the antimicrobial activity of the isoforms is expected to differ from each other. These findings demonstrated that the defensin MsDef2.1 can differ in M. sativa cultivars in respect of the gene and amino acid sequences and has a potential for future applications.
40096644	Extending the Influence of Terroir through the Spontaneous Fermentation of Pinot Noir in the Vineyard: A Case Study of Greystone Vineyard Fermentation.	This study investigates the influence of vintage and fermentation environment on the microbial diversity, chemical composition, and volatile profiles of Pinot Noir wines, with a focus on comparing vineyard (outdoor) and winery (indoor) fermentations across two consecutive vintages, 2019 and 2020. Grapes were hand-harvested from a single vineyard and subjected to spontaneous fermentations in three tanks for each fermentation environment. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and PERMANOVA analyses revealed significant differences in fungal community composition between fermentation environments and vintages. Vineyard fermentations consistently exhibited higher levels of non-<i>Saccharomyces</i> yeasts during fermentation, which contributed to increased production of microbial-derived esters, such as hexyl acetate and isobutyl acetate. Winery fermentations, in contrast, showed higher concentrations of anthocyanins, contributing to enhanced color intensity and stability. Vintage effects were more evident than fermentation environment, with the 2019 vintage favoring higher concentrations of phenolics, anthocyanins, higher alcohols (e.g. isoamyl alcohol), and volatile phenols (e.g. guaiacol and eugenol), while the 2020 vintage enhanced the retention of esters and floral terpenes (e.g. linalool). These findings highlight the distinct wine styles achievable through vineyard and winery fermentations, as well as the interplay between climatic conditions and fermentation environment. This work provides novel insights into the potential of vineyard fermentations for expressing microbial terroir and offers practical strategies for optimizing wine production under varying climatic and site-specific conditions.
40094473	Dual-Bessel-Beam Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy for Super-resolution Volumetric Projection Imaging of Lipid Droplet Dynamics.	Volumetric imaging efficiently captures comprehensive spatial structures and dynamic function information on organisms in biomedical research. However, optical diffraction limit restricts the visualization of fine structure details at nanoscale. To address this limitation, we developed dual-Bessel-beam stimulated emission depletion (DB-STED) microscopy to enhance the information throughput and lateral resolution. This technique combines a zeroth-order Bessel beam for excitation with a first-order hollow Bessel beam for depletion, aligned both spatially and temporally to achieve super-resolution volumetric projection imaging. We validated this approach using fluorescent beads embedded in agarose, achieving a resolution of 69 nm over a depth of 10 μm with a numerical aperture of 1.4. The high-throughput and super-resolution capability enables detailed observation of lipid droplet motion within entire cells, providing valuable insights into lipid dynamics.
40094367	<i>Piscirickettsia salmonis</i> pathogenicity: using the damage-response framework to look beyond smoke and mirrors.	<i>Piscirickettsia salmonis</i> is a globally distributed aquatic bacterium and a component of the normal salmon microbiome. It has significant biological and economic impact on Chilean salmon aquaculture due to the highly fatal disease, piscirickettsiosis. Unsuccessful attempts to prevent and treat this disease have resulted in heavy use of antimicrobials with adverse effects on the aquatic environment and piscine and human health. Evidence suggests <i>P. salmonis</i> could be a bacterium with relative pathogenic potential on farmed salmonids and other fishes that triggers piscirickettsiosis under particular conditions in the salmon and its environment. Application of a damage-response framework analysis could define the steps from asymptomatic <i>P. salmonis</i> infection to symptomatic disease, help tailor improved approaches to disease prevention and management, and, in turn, help avoid heavy use of antimicrobials which have global effects on animal health, human health, and environmental biodiversity (the One Health concept).
40094363	<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> secondary metabolite pyripyropene is important for the dual biofilm formation with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.	The human pathogenic fungus <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> establishes dual biofilm interactions in the lungs with the pathogenic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Screening of 21 <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> null mutants revealed seven mutants (two G protein-coupled receptors, three mitogen-activated protein kinase receptors, a Gα protein, and one histidine kinase receptor) with reduced biofilm formation, specifically in the presence of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Transcriptional profiling and metabolomics analysis of secondary metabolites produced by one of these mutants, Δ<i>gpaB</i> (<i>gpaB</i> encodes a Gα protein), showed GpaB controls the production of several important metabolites for the dual biofilm interaction, including pyripyropene A, a potent inhibitor of mammalian acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase. Deletion of <i>pyr2</i>, encoding a non-reducing polyketide synthase essential for pyripyropene biosynthesis, showed reduced <i>A. fumigatus</i> Δ<i>pyr2-P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm growth, altered macrophage responses, and attenuated mouse virulence in a chemotherapeutic murine model. We identified pyripyropene as a novel player in the ecology and pathogenic interactions of this important human fungal pathogen.IMPORTANCE<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> are two important human pathogens. Both organisms establish biofilm interactions in patients affected with chronic lung pulmonary infections, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Colonization with <i>A. fumigatus</i> is associated with an increased risk of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> colonization in CF patients, and disease prognosis is poor when both pathogens are present. Here, we identified <i>A. fumigatus</i> genetic determinants important for the establishment of <i>in vitro</i> dual <i>A. fumigatus-P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm interactions. Among them, an <i>A. fumigatus</i> Gα protein GpaB is important for this interaction controlling the production of the secondary metabolite pyripyropene. We demonstrate that the lack of pyripyropene production decreases the dual biofilm interaction between the two species as well as the virulence of <i>A. fumigatus</i> in a chemotherapeutic murine model of aspergillosis. These results reveal a complete novel role for this secondary metabolite in the ecology and pathogenic interactions of this important human fungal pathogen.
40094360	Plant salicylic acid signaling is inhibited by a cooperative strategy of two powdery mildew effectors.	Powdery mildew is a global threat to crops and economically valuable plants. Salicylic acid (SA) signaling plays a significant role in plant resistance to biotrophic parasites; however, the mechanisms behind how powdery mildew fungi circumvent SA-mediated resistance remain unclear. Many phytopathogenic microbes deliver effectors into the host to sustain infection. In this study, we showed that the rubber tree powdery mildew fungus <i>Erysiphe quercicola</i> inhibits host SA biosynthesis by employing two effector proteins, EqCmu and EqPdt. These effector proteins can be delivered into plant cells to hydrolyze chorismate, the main precursor of SA, through their enzymatic activities. Notably, EqCmu and EqPdt can interact with each other, providing mutual protection against protein degradation mediated by the plant ubiquitin-proteasome system. This interaction enhances their activities in the hydrolysis of chorismate. Our study reveals a new pathogenic strategy by which two powdery mildew effector proteins cooperate to evade recognition by dampening the host immune system.
40091822	Kaempferol Induces DNA Damage in Colorectal Cancer Cells by Regulating the MiR-195/miR-497-PFKFB4-Mediated Nonoxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway.	Kaempferol is a flavonoid widely found in fruits and vegetables. Our previous studies have shown that kaempferol has a good inhibitory effect on colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo, significantly inhibiting proliferation and inducing cycle arrest and apoptosis. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a branch of glucose catabolism, that provides the raw material ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) for biosynthesis for the rapid proliferation of tumor cells and is closely related to DNA damage. DNA damage has been shown to play an important role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, we speculate whether kaempferol exerts the antitumor effect by inducing DNA damage. Herein we actually found that kaempferol treatment induced DNA damage, as indicated by increased γH2AX expression and comet assay. Furthermore, kaempferol reduced R5P production by inhibiting the nonoxidative PPP, while supplementation with nucleosides rescued DNA damage. Mechanistically, kaempferol upregulates the expression of microRNA-195/497 (miR-195/497) and then suppresses PFKFB4 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 4) expression by directly binding to its 3'-UTR, thereby inhibiting the expression of transketolase (TKT) and transaldolase (TALDO), key enzymes in the nonoxidative PPP. These data uncover new targets and pathways for the action of kaempferol and lay the foundation for its development as an adjuvant drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
40091704	The supramolecular chemistry of monodisperse 1,3,5-triazine oligomers.	Organic compounds based on 1,3,5-triazine scaffolds are utilised in practical applications in agriculture, as well as in the pharmaceutical and plastic industries. In fundamental research, 1,3,5-triazines are used as building blocks for the construction of oligomers that are relevant to the areas of supramolecular chemistry, chemical biology and polymer science. Here, we review the molecular recognition and self-assembly properties of monodisperse linear and branched oligomers, macrocycles, and dendrimers of 1,3,5-triazine. We focus mainly on experimental studies conducted in solution, describing the key interactions and structural features of these systems.

40090117	High-throughput screening unveils AMG 837 and RORγt 13 as the potent Brucella inhibitor by targeting BacA.	Brucellosis poses a major threat to the global animal husbandry, yet effective prevention and control measures remain elusive. Through High-Throughput Screening techniques, two potential anti-Brucella compounds are identified from a library comprising FDA-approved and known biological activity in this study. We unveil AMG 837 calcium hydrate and RORγt inverse antigen 13 can strongly bind with BacA, which mutants lacking BacA greatly reduce the survival rate of Brucella in macrophages. AMG 837 calcium hydrate and RORγt inverse antigen 13 as the potent inhibitor of Brucella both in vitro and in cells, which can effectively eliminate bacteria that infect into cells at a concentration of only 16 μg/mL. These results indicate the promising potential of AMG 837 calcium hydrate and RORγt inverse antigen 13 as the repurposed therapeutic agent for brucellosis. Additionally, they provide valuable insights into the antibacterial mechanisms underlying effectiveness.
40090116	BDH1 reduces apoptosis and alleviates mitochondrial damage of cardiomyocytes under high glucose condition as a downstream target of miR-125b.	Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease, characterized prominently by a persistent elevation of blood glucose level beyond the normal range. Prolonged hyperglycemia exerts deleterious effects on systems and organs of the body, leading to complications like diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Our study commenced by screening the gene 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) with low expression in DCM via Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) analysis (GSE123975). Subsequently, we cultivated AC16 human cardiomyocytes in high glucose (HG) conditions and observed a reduction in BDH1 expression. To further investigate, we constructed plasmids for BDH1 knockdown (sh-BDH1) and overexpression (OE-BDH1). When BDH1 was overexpressed in HG-treated AC16 cells, apoptosis decreased, with reduced Bax/Bcl2 and Cleaved Caspase3/Caspase3 ratios. Additionally, mitochondrial ROS decreased, while expression of mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and mitochondrial repair protein folliculin interacting protein 1 (FNIP1) increased. Notably, microRNA-125 b was upregulated in AC16 cells with hyperglycemia, and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed its targeting and inhibition of BDH1 mRNA. Inhibition of miR-125 b in HG-treated AC16 cells reversed apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS increase, yet simultaneous inhibition of both miR-125 b and BDH1 abolished this effect. In addition, we overexpressed BDH1 in diabetic mice by tail vein injection, and proved that overexpression of BDH1 could reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo. In conclusion, our findings suggested that the miR-125-BDH1 axis could inhibit the production of mitochondrial ROS, promote mitochondrial fusion and repair, and reduce the apoptosis and mitochondrial damage of cardiomyocytes in HG condition.
40089199	The main active components of Prunella vulgaris L. alleviate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and ferroptosis via the NRF2/GPX4 pathway.	Prunella vulgaris L. (PV) is a widely distributed medicinal and edible plant used in traditional Chinese medicine for its anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, hypoglycemic, and anti-hypertensive effects. Despite the numerous studies reporting on its cardiovascular protective effects, it is still unknown whether PV could relieve myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury.
40088678	Velcro-binding by cardiac troponin-I traps tropomyosin on actin in a low-energy relaxed state.	During muscle relaxation at low sarcoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration, the 40-nm long tropomyosin coiled coil is attracted by the C-terminal regulatory domain of troponin subunit-I to a "steric-blocking" B-state position on actin subunits of cardiac and skeletal muscle thin filaments. Tropomyosin located in this B-state position obstructs myosin-binding sites on actin, limiting access of myosin-crossbridge heads on actin. In turn, the steric-hindrance imposed on myosin-binding diminishes actomyosin ATPase, crossbridge movement along actin, and contractility, thus causing relaxation. In contrast, during muscle activation, at high sarcoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, the troponin-induced tropomyosin interference is relieved, the tropomyosin coiled coil returns to its default C-state position on actin, and contractility proceeds. In the current study, we examined the energetics associated with tropomyosin's shift in position from its C-state to its B-state on actin and the influence of troponin-I on this relaxed state transition. Control studies showed that in the absence of troponin, the free energy difference between B- and C-state positions of tropomyosin on actin is negligible, i.e. neither B- nor C-state is obviously preferred on troponin-free actin. In contrast, widely separated sites along the C-terminal regulatory domain of troponin-I are responsible for a favorable free energy change of about -0.75 kcal/mol, driving the tropomyosin C-state to B-state shift. Corresponding truncation and point mutations along C-terminal region of TnI lead to a less favorable regulatory transition and are linked to cardiac muscle dysfunction.
40088677	OsMADS22 interacts with OsMADS50 to regulate floral transition in rice.	Appropriate flowering time is critical for reproductive transition and is closely related to crop yield. In Arabidopsis, SVP, MADS-box containing proteins, interact with FLC to form a repressor complex to repress the expression level of SOC1 and FT to control flowering time. OsMADS22, one of three SVP-clade MADS-box genes, has been shown that functions as a negative regulator on floral transition in rice. However, the molecular mechanism of OsMADS22 in flowering time and genetic interaction between SVP and SOC1 homologs was unknown. In this study, we found that OsMADS22 could form homodimers and interact with OsMADS50, a putative rice ortholog of SOC1, to antagonistically regulate key flowering-related genes, including OsMADS14, RFT1, Ehd1, Hd3a, and OsMADS1. Notably, elevated expression levels of OsMADS22 were detected in osmads50 mutants, whereas the transcript abundance of OsMADS50 remained unchanged under OsMADS22-overexpressing line compared with wild-type controls, suggesting that OsMADS50 is not genetically epistatic to OsMADS22, unlike their homologs in Arabidopsis. Moreover, we showed that the interaction between OsMADS22 and OsMADS50 is mainly dependent on their K-box domains. OsMADS50 localize to the nucleus while its Arabidopsis homolog SVP localized in cytosol. Notably, we newly revealed additional roles for OsMADS50 in rice grain development. Taken together, our results elucidate the regulatory pathways of OsMADS22 on flowering time and reveal species-specific functional divergence between SVP and SOC1 in Arabidopsis and their homologs in rice, providing new insights into flowering time regulation in rice.
40088676	Unspliced XBP1 enhences metabolic reprogramming in colorectal cancer cells by interfering with the mitochondrial localization of MGME1.	Tumor cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, which makes them tend to utilize anaerobic glycolysis rather than oxidation to rapidly produce energy and intermediate products required for proliferation. In this process, mitochondria inevitably undergo corresponding alterations; however, the specific alterations in mitochondria across different cancer types and the mechanisms governing these changes remain poorly understood. This study demonstrated that unspliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1-u) inhibits the translocation of mitochondrial genome maintenance exonuclease 1 (MGME1) into mitochondria by binding to the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of MGME1. This interaction results in the accumulation of mitochondrial 7sDNA, a reduction in mitochondrial DNA copy number, and a decrease in mitochondrial abundance. Consequently, this shift enhances the production of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway intermediates, thereby promoting the proliferation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Our findings elucidated the critical mechanism by which XBP1-u enhances metabolic reprogramming by modulating mitochondrial biogenesis, and uncovered a novel role of MGME1 in the progression of CRC.
40088675	Collagen XII deficiency promotes ligament-specific heterotopic ossification via fibrochondrocyte differentiation.	Heterotopic ossification of tendons and ligaments causes pain and dysfunction, significantly reducing quality of life. However, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In addition to injury, tissue organization and stiffness have been implicated in heterotopic ossification. Collagen XII, a member of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family, plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of tendons and ligaments. Its deficiency alters tissue stiffness and predisposes ligaments to rupture. In this study, we investigated whether collagen XII contributes to the development of heterotopic ossification. Three-dimensional microcomputed tomography (3D-μCT) and X-ray analyses revealed heterotopic bone formation in the knee and ankle ligaments, but not in tendons, of Col12a1-deficient mice, with a 100 % incidence in mice older than 19 weeks. Histological analysis showed the presence of Alcian blue- and Toluidine blue-positive fibrochondrocyte-like cells in Col12a1-deficient ligaments, which were subsequently replaced by bone tissue, as indicated by Alizarin red staining. Real-time qPCR analysis of knee ligaments demonstrated a slight increase in chondrogenic markers and a significant upregulation of osteogenic markers in Col12a1-deficient mice compared with wild-type controls. In vitro chondrogenesis and osteogenesis assays using primary tenocytes from wild-type and Col12a1-deficient mice revealed that collagen XII deficiency enhanced osteogenic potential, whereas chondrogenic potential remained comparable. Our findings indicate that collagen XII deficiency specifically induces heterotopic bone formation in knee and ankle ligaments, occurring via fibrochondrocytes rather than through endochondral or intramembranous ossification.
40086610	The potential effective components from Danlou tablet attenuates acute myocardial infarction by restoring ALOX12-mediated perturbed oxylipins.	Danlou Tablet (DLP) was developed from the "Gualou-Xiebai-Baijiu decoction", as documented in the "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber" by Dr. Zhongjing Zhang. It is widely used for clinical treatment of different degrees of coronary heart disease (CHD).
40086609	An immune-liver microphysiological system method for evaluation and quality control of hepatotoxicity induced by Polygonum multiflorum thunb. Extract.	Clinical applications of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (PMT) have occasionally reported adverse effects on liver function, linking these instances of hepatotoxicity to PMT samples. Evaluating the hepatotoxicity of PMT, given its intricate composition and mechanisms, presents a notable challenge. Notably, three toxic components display additive/synergistic effects, further complicating the establishment of a toxicological quality control method.
40086452	Discovering Key Activation Hotspots in the M<sub>2</sub> Muscarinic Receptor.	The M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptor (M<sub>2</sub>R) is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that serves as a model system for understanding ligand recognition and GPCR activation. Here, using vibrational spectroscopy, we identify the mechanisms governing M<sub>2</sub>R activation by its native agonist, acetylcholine. Combined with mutagenesis, computational chemistry, and organic synthetic chemistry, our analyses found that the precise distance between acetylcholine and Asn404, one of the amino acids constituting the ligand-binding site, is important for M<sub>2</sub>R activation and that the N404Q mutant undergoes partial active state-like conformational changes. We discovered that a water molecule bridging acetylcholine and Asn404 forms a precise and flexible hydrogen bond network, triggering the outward movement of transmembrane helix 6 in M<sub>2</sub>R. Consistent with this observation, disruptions in this hydrogen bond network via chemical modification at the α- or β-position of acetylcholine failed to activate M<sub>2</sub>R. Collectively, our findings pinpoint Asn404 as a critical residue that both senses acetylcholine binding and induces M<sub>2</sub>R activation.
40085441	Selective Addressing of Versatile Nanodiamonds <i>via</i> Physically-Enabled Classifier in Complex Biosystems.	Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers show great potential for nanoscale biosensing and bioimaging. Nevertheless, their envisioned bioapplications suffer from intrinsic background noise due to unavoidable light scattering and autofluorescence in cells and tissues. Herein, we develop a unique all-optical modulated imaging method via a physically enabled classifier, for on-demand and direct access to NV fluorescence at pixel resolution while effectively filtering out background noise. Specifically, NV fluorescence can be modulated optically to exhibit sinusoid-like variations, providing a basis for classification. We validate our method in various complex biological scenarios with fluorescence interference, ranging from cells to organisms. Notably, our classification-based approach achieves an enhancement of signal-to-background ratio from 1.92 to 60.39 dB for fluorescent nanodiamonds in neural protein imaging. We also demonstrate a 4-fold contrast improvement in optically detected magnetic resonance measurements inside stained cells. Our technique offers a generic, explainable, and robust solution, applicable for realistic high-fidelity imaging and sensing in challenging noise-laden scenarios.
40085071	Is what I think what you think? Multilayer network-based inter-brain synchrony approach.	Social interaction plays a crucial role in human societies, encompassing complex dynamics among individuals. To understand social interaction at the neural level, researchers have utilized hyperscanning in several social settings. These studies have mainly focused on inter-brain synchrony and the efficiency of paired functional brain networks, examining group interactions in dyads. However, this approach may not fully capture the complexity of multiple interactions, potentially leading to gaps in understanding inter-network differences. To overcome this limitation, the present study aims to bridge this gap by introducing methodological enhancements using the multilayer network approach, which is tailored to extract features from multiple networks. We applied this strategy to analyze the triad condition during social behavior processes to identify group interaction indices. Additionally, to validate our methodology, we compared the multilayer networks of triad conditions with group synchrony to paired conditions without group synchrony, focusing on statistical differences between alpha and beta waves. Correlation analysis between inter-brain and group networks revealed that this methodology accurately reflects the characteristics of actual behavioral synchrony. The findings of our study suggest that measures of paired brain synchrony and group interaction may exhibit distinct trends, offering valuable insights into interpreting group synchrony.
40084898	Noncanonical amino acids as prophage inducers for protein regulation in bacteria-based delivery systems.	Genetically engineered bacteria represent a promising drug delivery tool for disease treatment. The development of new strategies for specific and independent protein regulation is necessary, especially for combination protein drug therapy. Using the well-studied <i>Escherichia coli</i> phage λ as a model system, we applied <u>n</u>on<u>c</u>anonical <u>a</u>mino <u>a</u>cid<u>s</u> (ncAAs) as novel inducers for protein regulation in a bacteria-based delivery system. Screening the permissive sites of the Cro protein revealed that incorporation of AlocK at the K8 site with the <i>Mb</i>PylRS-349F/tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> system produced a functional Cro-K8AlocK variant. Using an engineered λ lysogen expressing the <i>Mb</i>PylRS-349F/tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> pair, Cro-8X, and the reporter mNeonGreen, <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments showed that AlocK led to bacterial lysis through prophage activation and the release of mNeonGreen. If <i>mNeonGreen</i> was integrated into the λ prophage genome, λ phages released due to AlocK induction delivered the reporter gene into the recipient <i>E. coli</i> strain, enabling mNeonGreen expression. Furthermore, insertion of pIF at the F14 site with the <i>Af</i>pIFRS/tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> pair produced a functional Cro-F14pIF variant. Importantly, <i>Af</i>pIFRS/tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and <i>Mb</i>PylRS-349F/tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> pairs were confirmed to be mutually orthogonal. In a mixture of two engineered λ lysogens expressing different aaRS/tRNAs, Cro-ncAAs, and reporter proteins, AlocK and pIF independently induced bacterial lysis and activated the expression of mNeonGreen and mCherry in the recipient <i>E. coli</i> strain. Collectively, the proposed bacteria-based delivery system provides two options for protein delivery and enables independent regulation of multiple proteins with ncAAs, offering a novel approach for <i>in situ</i> protein regulation and combination therapy.
40084888	Cell envelope polysaccharide modifications alter the surface properties and interactions of <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> with innate immune cells in a morphotype-dependent manner.	<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> is one of the leading causes of pulmonary infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The ability of <i>M. abscessus</i> to establish a chronic infection in the lung relies on a series of adaptive mutations impacting, in part, global regulators and cell envelope biosynthetic enzymes. One of the genes under strong evolutionary pressure during host adaptation is <i>ubiA</i>, which participates in the elaboration of the arabinan domains of two major cell envelope polysaccharides: arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM). We here show that patient-derived UbiA mutations not only cause alterations in the AG, LAM, and mycolic acid contents of <i>M. abscessus</i> but also tend to render the bacterium more prone to forming biofilms while evading uptake by innate immune cells and enhancing their pro-inflammatory properties. The fact that the effects of UbiA mutations on the physiology and pathogenicity of <i>M. abscessus</i> were impacted by the rough or smooth morphotype of the strain suggests that the timing of their selection relative to morphotype switching may be key to their ability to promote chronic persistence in the host.IMPORTANCEMultidrug-resistant pulmonary infections caused by <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> and subspecies are increasing in the U.S.A. and globally. Little is known of the mechanisms of pathogenicity of these microorganisms. We have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene involved in the biosynthesis of two major cell envelope polysaccharides, arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, in lung-adapted isolates from 13 patients. Introduction of these individual SNPs in a reference <i>M. abscessus</i> strain allowed us to study their impact on the physiology of the bacterium and its interactions with immune cells. The significance of our work is in identifying some of the mechanisms used by <i>M. abscessus</i> to colonize and persist in the human lung, which will facilitate the early detection of potentially more virulent clinical isolates and lead to new therapeutic strategies. Our findings may further have broader biomedical impacts, as the <i>ubiA</i> gene is conserved in other tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterial pathogens.
40084853	The <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> T3SS can contribute to traversal of an <i>in situ</i> epithelial multilayer independently of the T3SS needle.	Multilayered epithelia lining our tissue surfaces normally resist traversal by opportunistic bacteria. Previously, we developed a strategy to experimentally perturb this resistance <i>in situ</i> in the corneas of mouse eyes and used it to show that traversal of a multilayered epithelium by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> requires ExsA, the transcriptional activator of its type 3 secretion system (T3SS). Here, we developed a novel strategy for quantitatively localizing individual traversing bacteria within the <i>in situ</i> multilayered corneal epithelium and explored the contributions of T3SS components. The results showed that T3SS translocon and T3SS effector mutants had reduced epithelial traversal efficiency. Surprisingly, a Δ<i>pscC</i> mutant unable to assemble the T3SS needle traversed as efficiently as wild-type <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, while a Δ<i>exsD</i> mutant "constitutively on" for T3SS expression was traversal defective. The dispensability of the T3SS needle for effector-mediated traversal was confirmed using a mutant lacking the T3SS operon except for the effector genes (Δ<i>pscU-L</i> mutant). That mutant reacquired the ability to traverse if complemented with rhamnose-inducible <i>exsA</i>, but not if the effector genes were also deleted (Δ<i>pscU-L</i>Δ<i>exoSTY</i>). Western immunoblot confirmed ExoS in culture supernatants of rhamnose-induced <i>exsA</i>-complemented Δ<i>pscU-L</i> mutants lacking all T3SS needle protein genes. Together, these results show that epithelial traversal by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> can involve T3SS effectors and translocon proteins independently of the T3SS needle previously thought essential for T3SS function. This advances our understanding of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> pathogenesis and has relevance to the development of therapeutics targeting the T3SS system.IMPORTANCEWhile the capacity to cross an epithelial barrier can be a critical step in bacterial pathogenesis, our understanding of the mechanisms involved is derived largely from cell culture experimentation. The latter is due to the practical limitations of <i>in vivo</i>/<i>in situ</i> models and the challenge of visualizing individual bacteria in the context of host tissue. Here, factors used by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to traverse an epithelial multilayer <i>in situ</i> were studied by (i) leveraging the transparent properties and superficial location of the cornea, (ii) using our established method for enabling bacterial traversal susceptibility, and (iii) developing a novel strategy for accurate and quantitative localization of individual traversing bacteria <i>in situ</i>. Outcomes showed that T3SS translocon and T3SS effector proteins synergistically contribute to epithelial traversal efficiency independently of the T3SS needle. These findings challenge the assumption that the T3SS needle is essential for T3SS effectors or translocon proteins to contribute to bacterial pathogenesis.
40084838	External quality assessment of molecular detection and variant typing of SARS-CoV-2 in European expert laboratories in 2023.	The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of laboratory preparedness. Regular monitoring of diagnostic tools via external quality assessments (EQAs) is key to maintaining robust public health response service. We hereby conducted a third SARS-CoV-2 EQA assessing the diagnostic capabilities of European expert public health laboratories. A 10 samples panel containing Alpha (used in previous EQA), BA.4, BA.5, and BQ.1.18 variants along with human seasonal coronaviruses and negative controls was produced and validated. Participants were invited by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and asked to submit results and assay details via electronic forms. Thirty-eight laboratories from 31 European countries participated. Most (<i>n</i> = 32, 84%) identified all panel samples correctly and used in-house (11, 29%), commercial assays (22, 58%), or both (5, 13%). Compared to previous EQAs, correct detection of the SARS-CoV-2 samples in the panels increased: 8 (12%) in 2020, 45 (75%) in 2021, and 34 (90%) laboratories in 2023, respectively. The number of participants decreased to an average of one laboratory per country (range 1-3) compared to two (1-7) laboratories in both previous EQAs. The usage of commercial assays gradually increased in contrast to the usage of in-house or both approaches. The capacity for SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics has markedly improved in Europe as evidenced by three consecutive EQAs carried out by expert public health laboratories. Routine monitoring of diagnostic and surveillance assays via EQAs remains key to maintaining rapid public health laboratory response systems.IMPORTANCEExternal quality assessments (EQAs) are crucial to ensure the reliability and consistency of diagnostic laboratories. They provide an objective framework for evaluating the performance of testing systems, enabling laboratories to identify weaknesses and implement improvements promptly. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, EQAs have become even more critical due to the high demand for accurate molecular diagnostics and the emergence of new variants. Accurate detection and typing of variants are especially essential for monitoring viral evolution. EQAs help standardize methodologies, ensuring that results across laboratories remain comparable and trustworthy. Moreover, they play a pivotal role in minimizing errors such as false positives or negatives. In this rapidly evolving landscape, regular EQAs are indispensable for maintaining high-quality standards in molecular diagnostics and variant surveillance. We demonstrate here that regular EQAs improve the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in European laboratories.

40080126	Non-electronic activation of aromatic frameworks by steric repulsion between <i>peri</i>-substituents.	Distortion of coplanarity has been known as one of the activation methods for planar aromatic rings, and a great deal of effort has been devoted to experimental and computational studies. However, there is no study on systematic evaluation for distortion by steric repulsion between substituents. Inspired by this fact, several studies have focused on non-electronic activation caused by steric interactions between <i>peri</i>-substituents. These studies indicated systematically and quantitatively how varying the bulkiness of substituents affects the distortion and the resulting dearomatization, and changes in reactivity due to the distortion (<i>e.g.</i>, non-electronic activation) were also compared. Furthermore, this concept is applied to 1,8-dihalonaphthalenes to afford unsymmetrical products <i>via</i> the halogen dance reaction.
40079219	The zebrafish ETS transcription factor Fli1b functions upstream of Scl/Tal1 during embryonic hematopoiesis.	During embryonic development, vascular endothelial and hematopoietic cells are thought to originate from a common precursor, the hemangioblast. The evolutionarily conserved ETS transcription factor FLI1 has been previously implicated in hemangioblast formation and hematopoietic and vascular development. However, its role in regulating the hemangioblast transition into hematovascular lineages is still incompletely understood. Its zebrafish paralog Fli1b (also known as Fli1rs) functions partially redundantly with the ETS transcription factor Etv2 (also known as Etsrp) during vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. However, its role in embryonic hematopoiesis has not been previously investigated. Here, we show that zebrafish fli1b mutants have a reduced formation of primitive erythrocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and display reduced expression of key regulators of hematopoiesis, including scl (also known as tal1), gata1a and runx1. Expression of scl was sufficient to partially rescue defects in erythroid differentiation in fli1b mutants, arguing that scl functions downstream of fli1b during primitive erythropoiesis. In addition, myelopoiesis was strongly misregulated in fli1b mutants. Although the formation of the earliest myeloid progenitors - neutrophils and macrophages - was greatly reduced in fli1b mutants, this was compensated by the increased emergence of myeloid cells from the alternative hematopoietic site - the endocardium. Intriguingly, myeloid cells in fli1b mutants retained vascular endothelial marker expression, suggesting that they are present in a hemangioblast-like state. In summary, our results demonstrate a novel role of fli1b transcription factor in regulating embryonic hematopoiesis.
40078055	Modulated-Illumination Intermittent-Contact Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.	This article presents a proof-of-concept for a new imaging method that combines tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy with intermittent-contact atomic force microscopy to provide simultaneous nanometer-scale mechanical imaging with chemical contrast. The foremost difference from a standard tip-enhanced Raman microscope is the Raman illumination, which is modulated by the cantilever drive signal so that illumination is only active when the tip is close to the surface. This approach significantly reduces contact forces and thermal damage due to constant illumination while simultaneously reducing background Raman signals. Near-field optical and dynamic cantilever simulations highlight the effect of the imaging parameters on the tip-sample force and the evanescent field enhancement. The experimental images obtained with this new imaging method demonstrate a lateral resolution sufficient to identify single-walled carbon nanotube bundles with a full width at half-maximum of 20 nm.

40072277	Tuning higher order structure in colloidal fluids.	Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen, <i>Nature</i>, 2003, <b>421</b>, 513]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and computer simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. We probe the higher-order structure using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. The latter constitutes a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three-body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes 8 ≤ <i>m</i> ≤ 12.
40072252	Conjugation Effects in the Generation of Dynamic Covalent Libraries of Bis-Imines from Substituted Aromatic Aldehyde and Amine Components.	The conjugation-driven stability and reactivity of bis-imine formation from the reaction of substituted aromatic aldehydes and amines bearing electron donor and acceptor groups were studied in two approaches involving aldehydes and amines with the substituents either conjugated (para position) or non-conjugated (meta position) to the reacting functional groups. The bis-imine from the reaction of a bis-amine (B) with different types of aldehydes (A) constituted an ABA module, whereas the reaction of bis-aldehydes with different amines resulted in a BAB module. The competitive reactions were also studied for a specified bis-amine (B1 or B2) in similar conditions with a mixture of different aldehydes, and the time-dependent generations of dynamic covalent libraries were followed. The results indicated that conjugation modulated the bis-imine formation. The reaction of the conjugated bis-amine B1 with a mixture of two different aldehydes A1 and A2 favoured the formation of the bis-imine A1B1A2 involving different aldehydes. The results of the study provide insights into the effect of conjugation on the reactivity and stability of bis-imines and provide a basis for inducing selectivity features in the formation of bis-imines from different types of aldehyde and amine groups. They provide an entry into the design of dynamic covalent libraries generated from extended multicomponent systems.
40071993	Myxosortase: an intramembrane protease that sorts MYXO-CTERM proteins to the cell surface.	Cell surface proteins determine how cells interact with their biotic and abiotic environments. In social myxobacteria, a C-terminal protein sorting tag called MYXO-CTERM is universally found within the Myxococcota phylum, where their genomes typically contain dozens of proteins with this motif. MYXO-CTERM harbors a tripartite architecture: a short signature motif containing an invariant cysteine, followed by a transmembrane helix and a short arginine-rich C-terminal region localized in the cytoplasm. In <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i>, MYXO-CTERM is predicted to be posttranslationally lipidated and cleaved for subsequent cell surface localization by the type II secretion system. Here, following our bioinformatic discovery, we experimentally show that myxosortase (MrtX, MXAN_2755) is responsible for the C-terminal cleavage and cell surface anchoring of TraA, a prototypic cell surface receptor. The cleavage by MrtX depends on conserved cysteines within the MYXO-CTERM motif of TraA. <i>M. xanthus</i> mutants lacking myxosortase are defective in TraA-mediated outer membrane exchange and exhibit cell envelope defects. In a heterologous <i>Escherichia coli</i> expression system, the MYXO-CTERM motif is cleaved when MrtX is co-expressed. Therefore, MrtX represents a new family of sorting enzyme that enables cell surface localization of MYXO-CTERM proteins.IMPORTANCEThe CPBP (CaaX protease and bacteriocin processing) protease family is widespread across the three domains of life. Despite considerable research on eukaryotic homologs, prokaryotic CPBP family members remain largely unexplored. In this study, we experimentally reveal the function of a novel CPBP protease called myxosortase. Our findings show that myxosortase is responsible for the C-terminal cleavage and cell surface anchoring of substrate proteins containing MYXO-CTERM motifs in <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i>. MYXO-CTERM cleavage also occurred in a heterologous <i>Escherichia coli</i> host when myxosortase is co-expressed. This is the first report that a CPBP protease is involved in protein sorting in prokaryotes. This work provides important insights into the biogenesis and anchoring of cell surface proteins in gram-negative bacteria.
40071954	Pneumococcal genotype 23B1 as a driver of increased 23B serotype carriage, penicillin non-susceptibility, and invasive disease in Belgium: a retrospective analysis.	<i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> serotype 23B, a non-vaccine serotype, has shown an increasing prevalence and penicillin non-susceptibility among carriage and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) isolates. Recently, a novel penicillin non-susceptible genotype has emerged, named 23B1. In the framework of the Belgian pneumococcal carriage study, we studied the prevalence of 23B<sub>0</sub>/23B1 among 586 23B strains (2016-2022) in 172 day care centers from 6- to 30-month-old children and among 130 pediatric 23B IPD isolates (2007-2021). Pneumococci were whole genome sequenced to determine the capsular polysaccharide genotype and sequence type (ST). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing determined penicillin and amoxicillin MICs, as well as resistance to co-trimoxazole and levofloxacin. 23B carriage was stable during 2016 ̶ 2022 except in the 2020-2021 winter season when it increased. The proportion of genotype 23B1 compared to 23B<sub>0</sub> decreased from 2016 ̶ to 2022 but remained consistently higher than 23B<sub>0</sub>. In 2020-2021, an increase in the proportion of 23B1 was reflected in an overall increase in 23B carriage. All increases in 23B IPD cases were almost entirely driven by 23B1. The median penicillin MICs were significantly different for 23B<sub>0</sub> (0.03 mg/L) and 23B1 (0.25 mg/L). In 2021, increased intermediate levofloxacin susceptibility was noted in 23B. 23B1-associated ST2372 was the most prevalent ST in carriage and IPD during 2013-2022. We show that an increase in 23B carriage among children was paralleled in pediatric IPD in Belgium, reiterating the utility of pneumococcal surveillance in the day care population. Serotype 23B is reported worldwide as an important pediatric non-PCV13 serotype with reduced penicillin susceptibility, with 23B1 as the presumed driver for the increased prevalence.IMPORTANCEDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the 23B serotype of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> has increased in prevalence in healthy carriage isolates from Belgian day care centers and pediatric (younger than 18 years of age) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) isolates. Additionally, an increase in penicillin non-susceptibility was also observed within this serotype. Recently, a genetic variant of 23B, named 23B1, was discovered, which is known to be related to decreased penicillin susceptibility. We showed that increases in 23B prevalence in healthy carriage and IPD cases always coincided with 23B1 expansions, leading to higher penicillin non-susceptibility rates. Increases in 23B in the day care population paralleled pediatric 23B IPD increases, indicating the vital role of day care monitoring of pneumococcal carriage. Countries should stay vigilant for prevalence increases in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> serotype 23B, given the decreased susceptibility to penicillin and co-trimoxazole of the 23B1 variant.
40071948	SENP1-SIRT3 axis mediates glycolytic reprogramming to suppress inflammation during <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection.	<i>Listeria monocytogenes,</i> a foodborne pathogen, has the ability to invade intestinal mucosal cells, undergo intracellular proliferation, activate host immune responses, and induce diseases such as colitis. We have demonstrated that sentrin-specific protease 1 (SENP1) functions as a protective gene in the host, suppressing the inflammatory response triggered by <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>. The host's SENP1-SIRT3 axis plays a critical role in regulating inflammation during <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection. Our findings reveal that overexpression of SENP1, particularly under <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection conditions (MOI = 20), effectively suppresses inflammation through modulation of glycolysis. Mechanistically, during <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> infection, SENP1 accumulates in the mitochondria, facilitating the de-SUMOylation and activation of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). Activated SIRT3 then regulates the deacetylation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), leading to a decrease in glycolytic intermediates, downregulation of glycolysis-related gene expression, and suppression of inflammation. Taken together, our study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanistic role of the SENP1-SIRT3 axis in the regulation of inflammation, offering novel insights, and strategies for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory diseases.

40071916	E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 positively regulates Japanese encephalitis virus infection by catalyzing the K27-linked polyubiquitination of viral E protein and inhibiting MAVS-mediated type I interferon production.	Membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger (MARCH) proteins, a class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, have been reported to be involved in the infection of multiple viruses and the regulation of type I interferon (IFN) production. However, the specific role and mechanisms by which MARCH proteins influence Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate the functional relevance of MARCH proteins in JEV replication by examining the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of MARCHs on viral infection. We identified MARCH5 as a positive regulator of JEV replication. The knockout of MARCH5 dramatically reduced viral yields, whereas its overexpression significantly enhanced JEV replication. Mechanistically, MARCH5 specifically interacts with the JEV envelope (E) protein and promotes its K27-linked polyubiquitination at the lysine (K) residues 136 and 166. This ubiquitination enhances viral attachment to permissive cells. Substituting these lysine residues with arginine (R) attenuated JEV replication <i>in vitro</i> and reduced viral virulence <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, JEV infection upregulated the expression of MARCH5. We also discovered that MARCH5 degrades mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by catalyzing its K48-linked ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting type I IFN production in JEV-infected cells. This suppression of type I IFN further facilitates JEV infection. In conclusion, these findings disclosed a novel role of MARCH5 in positively regulating JEV infection and revealed an important mechanism employed by MARCH5 to regulate the innate immune response.IMPORTANCEJEV is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 100,000 clinical human cases and causes economic loss to the swine industry. Until now, there is no clinically approved antiviral for the treatment of JEV infection. Although vaccination prophylaxis is widely regarded as the most effective strategy for preventing Japanese encephalitis (JE), the incidence of JE cases continues to rise. Thus, a deeper understanding of virus-host interaction will enrich our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying JEV infection and identify novel targets for the development of next-generation live-attenuated vaccines and antiviral therapies. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify MARCH5 as a pro-viral host factor that facilitates JEV infection. We elucidated two distinct mechanisms by which MARCH5 promotes JEV infection. First, MARCH5 interacts with viral E protein and mediates the K27-linked ubiquitination of E protein at the K136 and K166 residues to facilitate efficient viral attachment. Furthermore, double mutations of K136R-K166R attenuated JEV infection <i>in vitro</i> and reduced viral virulence in mice. Second, the upregulated expression of MARCH5 induced by JEV infection further suppresses the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway to benefit viral infection. MARCH5 downregulates type I IFN production by conjugating the K48-linked polyubiquitin at the K286 of MAVS, which leads to MAVS degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In summary, this study provides novel insights into the role played by MARCH proteins in JEV infection and identifies specific ubiquitination sites on JEV E protein that could be targeted for viral attenuation and the development of antiviral therapeutics.
40071578	Ultra-slow self-similar coarsening of physical fibrillar gels formed by semiflexible polymers.	Biopolymers tend to form fibrils that self-assemble into open network structures. While permanently crosslinked flexible polymers are relatively well understood, structure-property relationships of open networks and pseudo-gels formed by bundles of biopolymers are still controversial. Here we employ a generic coarse-grained bead-spring chain model incorporating semiflexibility and cohesive nonbonded interactions, that forms physical instead of chemical crosslinks. For flexible chains, the cohesive forces lead to the formation of a droplet phase while, at the same concentration, stiffer chains form bundles that self-assemble into percolated networks. From comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations we find that the reversible crosslinks allow for permanent relaxation processes. However, the associated reorganization of the filamentous network is severely hindered, leading to aging of its topology. Based on morphometric analyses, the ultra-slow coarsening in these systems is proven to be self-similar, which implies a number of scaling relations between structural quantities as the networks age. The percolated structures are characterized by different dynamic regimes of slow, anomalous diffusion with highly non-Gaussian displacements. Relaxation dynamics is found to become extremely slow already on moderate length scales and further slowing down as coarsening proceeds. Using a minimal model supported by observations on filament rupture and rearrangement, our study helps to shed light on various interrelated structural and dynamical aspects of coarsening nonergodic systems relevant for fibrous networks, pseudo-gels, and physical fibrillar gels.
40068893	Evaluating the Merit and Applications of the Caprini Risk Score as a Complications Predictor.	Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is considered a complication of free flap surgery. Prior studies investigating the use of the Caprini Risk Score (CRS) to estimate the risk of complications in free flap reconstruction are confounded by small sample sizes, varying surgical sites, and disparate classification of risk. This study evaluates the predictive merit of CRS for complications in free flap reconstructions.A retrospective review of patients (<i>n</i> = 502) who underwent free flap reconstruction from January 2015 to April 2022 collected patient medical history, type and location of free tissue transfer, CRS, and prior and perioperative anticoagulation (AC). Reconstructive outcomes and complications were analyzed in low (CRS <8) and high (CRS ≥8) cohorts using chi-square tests. Complications were also analyzed by flap sites in sufficient cohort populations (<i>n</i> > 10).Of 502 patients, the high CRS cohort (<i>n</i> = 71) was associated with upper (<i>p</i> < 0.005) and lower (<i>p</i> < 0.001) extremity reconstructions while the low CRS (<i>n</i> = 431) cohort was associated with breast reconstructions (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The high CRS cohort demonstrated an increased need for intraoperative blood transfusions (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Other intraoperative or postoperative complications such as flap loss, intraoperative AC, return to operating room (OR), or VTE had no significant correlations. High CRS patients were more likely to be discharged on AC (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and have a longer length of stay (LOS; <i>p</i> < 0.001). By flap site, there was a significant association between CRS and LOS >14 days in breast and head and neck flaps (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and discharge on AC in head and neck flaps only (<i>p</i> < 0.001).CRS may have utility in predicting the need for blood transfusion and AC requirements in free flap reconstruction but does not seem to predict the incidence of flap complications. A larger, higher-powered study may be used to assess the validity of CRS in risk of VTE and anticoagulant prophylaxis.
40068891	Microsurgery Education among U.S. Plastic Surgery Residency Programs.	Microsurgery is a core component of U.S. plastic surgery residency curriculum. This study compares publicly available information on microsurgery curricula and training among U.S. plastic surgery residency programs, while evaluating the background and experience of microsurgeon faculty at these institutions.The authors performed a cross-sectional web search on 103 accredited U.S. plastic surgery residency programs in March 2023. Publicly available information evaluated for each program included nonclinical microsurgery education, clinical microsurgical exposure, and the number of microsurgeon faculty. The perceived gender and race, professorship title, previous training, academic productivity, and scope of practice were determined for each individual faculty member.While approximately one-half of programs had evidence of microsurgical skill labs with anastomosis models (<i>n</i> = 56; 54%), fewer had a formal microsurgery curriculum (<i>n</i> = 36; 35%), or benchmark examinations (<i>n</i> = 25; 24%). Significantly more home institutions provided clinical exposure to breast, trauma or cancer, head and neck, and hand-related microsurgery than gender (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and lymphedema microsurgery (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Of the 724 faculty microsurgeons, most were male (<i>n</i> = 543), Caucasian (<i>n</i> = 488), and assistant professors (<i>n</i> = 316). Faculty underrepresented in plastic surgery were most often assistant professors with significantly fewer years of experience than their male (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and Caucasian counterparts (<i>p</i> < 0.023).Great variability exists in clinical and nonclinical microsurgery training among U.S. plastic surgery residency programs. As the demand for microsurgery continues to rise, we can expect microsurgery education to become more uniform. Most microsurgeon faculty underrepresented in plastic surgery were earlier in their career, suggesting a potential shift in diversity as these individuals ascend the academic ladder.
40067021	Intravacuolar persistence in neutrophils facilitates <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> spread to co-cultured cells.	The bacterium <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> (<i>Lm</i>) causes listeriosis in humans and ruminants. Acute lesions are predominantly infiltrated by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), considered to be the efficient bactericidal arm of innate immunity. However, recent evidence suggests that PMNs cannot achieve antilisterial sterilizing immunity and that <i>Lm</i> may persist within PMNs. Despite this, interactions between PMNs and <i>Lm</i> remain poorly understood. In this study, we characterized the listericidal activity and interaction dynamics of bovine PMNs with <i>Lm ex vivo</i>. Phagocytosed <i>Lm</i> failed to escape into the PMN cytosol and was primarily targeted by phagolysosomal mechanisms. However, PMNs enabled prolonged intravacuolar survival of a resilient <i>Lm</i> subpopulation, largely as viable but non-culturable (VBNC) bacteria. This resilient <i>Lm</i> population could spread from PMNs to a cell line, resuscitate, and complete its canonical life cycle, thereby perpetuating the infection. Therefore, we identify PMNs as a mobile niche for <i>Lm</i> survival and provide evidence that PMNs harbor VBNC bacteria, potentially facilitating <i>Lm</i> dissemination within the host.
40066998	Deficiency in peptidoglycan recycling promotes β-lactam sensitivity in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>.	Peptidoglycan (PG)-modifying enzymes play a crucial role in cell wall remodeling, essential for growth and division. Cell wall degradation products are transported to the cytoplasm and recycled back in most gram-negative bacteria, and PG recycling is also linked to β-lactam resistance in many bacteria. <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> is intrinsically resistant to β-lactams. Recently, it was shown that a soluble lytic transglycosylase, SdpA, is essential for β-lactam resistance. However, the precise role of SdpA in β-lactam resistance is unknown. This study investigated the PG recycling pathway and its role in antibiotic resistance in <i>C. crescentus</i>. Anhydromuropeptides generated by the action of lytic transglycosylases (LTs) are transported to the cytoplasm by the permease AmpG. <i>C. crescentus</i> encodes an <i>ampG</i> homolog, and deletion mutants of <i>sdpA</i> and <i>ampG</i> are sensitive to β-lactams. The <i>ampG</i> deletion mutant displays a significant accumulation of anhydromuropeptides in the periplasm of <i>C. crescentus,</i> demonstrating its essential role in PG recycling. While single knockout mutants of <i>sdpA</i> and <i>ampG</i> exhibit no growth defects, double-deletion mutants (∆<i>sdpA</i>∆<i>ampG</i>) exhibit severe growth and morphological defects. These double mutants also show enhanced sensitivity to β-lactams. Analysis of soluble muropeptides in wild-type (WT), ∆<i>sdpA</i>, and ∆<i>ampG</i> mutants revealed reduced levels of PG precursors (UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-MurNAc, and UDP-MurNAc-P5), suggesting that PG recycling products contribute toward <i>de novo</i> PG biosynthesis. Furthermore, supplementing the growth media with GlcNAc sugar enhanced the fitness of ∆<i>sdpA</i> and ∆<i>ampG</i> mutants under β-lactam stress. In conclusion, our study indicates that defects in PG recycling compromise cell wall biogenesis, leading to antibiotic sensitivity in <i>C. crescentus</i>.<b>IMPORTANCE</b>β-lactam antibiotics target the peptidoglycan cell wall biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. In response to antibiotic pressures, bacteria have developed various resistance mechanisms. In many gram-negative species, cell wall degradation products are transported into the cytoplasm and induce the expression of β-lactamase enzymes. In this study, we investigated the cell wall recycling pathway and its role in antibiotic resistance in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. Based on our data and prior studies, we propose that cell wall degradation products are utilized for the synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors in the cytoplasm. A deficiency in cell wall recycling leads to cell wall defects and increased antibiotic sensitivity in <i>C. crescentus</i>. These findings are crucial for understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms in bacteria.

40064099	Wireless motion control of a swimming eel-machine hybrid robot.	This study presents a flexible aquatic swimming robot, which is a promising candidate for underwater search and detection missions. The robot is a living eel fitted with a wireless electronic backpack stimulator attached to its dorsal region. Leveraging the eel's inherent self-balancing and self-adaptation abilities, the robot can adapt seamlessly to complex underwater environments without the need for sophisticated controllers. Lateral line stimulation allows the robot to execute forward and backward swimming, as well as left and right curls. We graded the forward and backward swimming speed by varying the stimulus frequency and pulse width. The optimal stimulus parameters are as follows: amplitude 3.0-4.5 V, frequency 5-20 Hz, and pulse width 40-60 ms. The maximum success rates for forward and backward swimming responses to stimuli were approximately 96% and 77%, respectively. Utilizing lower pulse frequencies (5-20 Hz) and wider pulse widths (40-60 ms) facilitated sustained and efficient activation of the lateral line neural system. Electrical stimulation of the lateral line increases the eel's forward swimming speed by approximately 70%, while the electronic backpack draws only 48.1 mW of external power. Compared to bio-inspired robots, the eel-machine hybrid robot consumes 1.5-1100 times less external power per unit mass. The remarkable efficiency of this bio-robot enhances its performance in tasks such as underwater cave exploration.
40062864	Influence of environmental exposures on T follicular helper cell function and implications on immunity: a comparison of Bangladeshi and American children.	T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial for B cell activation and subsequent antibody production. This functionality is influenced by surface markers such as CD40L, a costimulatory factor which promotes B cell activation, and CD57, which is a well-known marker of senescence. This study examined age-specific differences in Tfh cell function in Bangladeshi and American children. At age two, Bangladeshi children displayed impaired CD40L upregulation and significant CD57 downregulation upon stimulation. These patterns, not observed in American children of the same age, suggested an exhaustion-like phenotype potentially driven by environmental factors. Random forest and generalized estimating equations (GEE) modeling was used to analyze predictors of Tfh cell response to stimulation. Days since the last antibiotic treatment, total antibiotic treatments, diarrheal episodes, and malnutrition were identified as variables that significantly impacted the Tfh response to stimuli. To assess Tfh cell ability to promote antibody responses, we correlated Tfh functionality with antibody concentration post-vaccination and in response to infection with <i>Cryptosporidium</i>, an endemic apicomplexan parasite. Increased CD40L expression upon stimulation correlated positively with anti-Poliovirus type 2/3 neutralizing antibody and anti-Cp17 (a <i>Cryptosporidium</i> sporozoite antigen) IgA concentrations. In contrast, increased CD57 expression was significantly correlated with decreased anti-Cp17 IgA. This indicates that an activation-supportive phenotype (CD40L+) may be more effective in promoting immunity than a senescent phenotype (CD57+). Together, these findings suggest that early-life environmental exposures may program Tfh cell functionality, impacting immune response potential in settings with high pathogen exposure.
40062772	The physical biogeography of <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> in health and disease.	<i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> (<i>Fn</i>) is an oral commensal inhabiting the human gingival plaque that is rarely found in the gut. However, in colorectal cancer (CRC), <i>Fn</i> can be isolated from stool samples and detected in metagenomes. We hypothesized that ecological characteristics of the gut are altered by disease, enabling <i>Fn</i> to colonize. Multiple genomically distinct populations of <i>Fn</i> exist, but their ecological preferences are unstudied. We identified six well-separated populations in 133 <i>Fn</i> genomes and used simulated metagenomes to demonstrate sensitive detection of populations in human oral and gut metagenomes. In 9,560 samples from 11 studies, <i>Fn</i> population C2 animalis is elevated in gut metagenomes from CRC and Crohn's disease patients and is observed more frequently in CRC stool samples than in the gingiva. Polymorphum, the most prevalent gingival <i>Fn</i> population, is significantly increased in Crohn's stool samples; this effect was significantly stronger in male hosts than in female. We find polymorphum genomes are enriched for biosynthetic gene clusters and fluoride exporters, while C2 animalis are high in iron transporters. <i>Fn</i> populations thus associate with specific clinical and demographic phenotypes and harbor distinct functional features. Ecological differences in closely related groups of bacteria inform microbiome impacts on human health.
40059731	Dengue virus and lipid metabolism: unravelling the interplay for future therapeutic approaches.	In recent years, Dengue virus (DENV) has continued to pose significant health risks in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide, raising health alerts worldwide. It can cause hyperviremia in humans and can even lead to fatal clinical diseases. The life cycle of DENV is intricately linked to cellular lipids, and the virus selectively utilizes relevant enzymes involved in lipid metabolism to modulate the existing metabolic system in host cells during entry, replication, assembly, and other stages, thereby creating an environment conducive to its complete replication cycle. At present, there is a lack of effective and specific anti-DENV treatment measures. This review summarizes the recently identified lipid metabolism molecules and metabolic related diseases that affect DENV infection, explores the dependence of DENV on lipid metabolism and provides potential targets for the treatment of dengue fever (DF).
40059351	Excited-State Aromatization Drives Nonequilibrium Planarization Dynamics.	Excited-state aromaticity is one of the most widely applied concepts in the field of chemistry, often used as a rational guideline for predicting conformational changes of cyclic π-conjugated systems induced by photoexcitation. Yet, the details of the relationship between the corresponding photoinduced electronic and structural dynamics have remained unclear. In this work, we applied femtosecond transient absorption and time-resolved time-domain Raman spectroscopies to track the nonequilibrium planarization dynamics of a cyclooctatetraene (COT) derivative associated with the excited-state aromaticity. In the femtosecond time-resolved Raman data, the bent-to-planar structural change was clearly captured as a continuous peak shift of the marker band, which was unambiguously identified with <sup>13</sup>C labeling. Our findings show that the planarization occurs after a significant change in the electronic structure, suggesting that the system first becomes aromatic, followed by a conformational change. This work provides a unique framework for understanding the excited-state aromaticity from a dynamical aspect.

40052808	Standard E TB-Feron ELISA and Standard F TB-Feron FIA positivity rates and agreement with QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus among TB high-risk population in Bandung, Indonesia.	Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health problem. The determination of tuberculosis infection (TBI) using interferon-gamma release assay has now been used widely. We aim to evaluate the positivity rates of Standard E TB-Feron enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TB-Feron ELISA) and Standard F TB-Feron fluorescent immunoassay (TB-Feron FIA) and their agreement with QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) among TB high-risk populations in Bandung City, Indonesia. We conducted a cross-sectional study, including people with a high risk of acquiring TB. We screened subjects for TB symptoms and offered chest X-ray (CXR). Anyone with cough or CXR suggestive of TB was asked to give sputum samples for GeneXpert MTB/RIF Ultra test. The positivity rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated among patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB and among patients with no evidence of TB, no history of TB, and no known contact with TB patient (low risk of TBI). The agreement with QFT-Plus was calculated using Cohen's κ score. We enrolled 527 subjects, and the proportion of positive results among bacteriologically confirmed TB patients were 8 (53.3%; 95% CI 26.6-78.7), 9 (60.0%, 95% CI 32.3-83.7), and 10 (66.7%, 95% CI 38.4-88.8) by TB-Feron FIA, TB-Feron ELISA and QFT-Plus. The agreement between TB-Feron FIA and QFT-Plus among all subjects was similar to that of TB-Feron ELISA and QFT-Plus (84.1%, κ = 0.66, 95% CI 0.59-0.72). TB-Feron FIA and TB-Feron ELISA showed an acceptable clinical performance compared with QFT-Plus. These tests are useful alternatives for detecting TB infection.IMPORTANCEThis study evaluates the performance of two alternative interferon-gamma release assays, Standard E TB-Feron enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Standard F TB-Feron fluorescent immunoassay, for diagnosing tuberculosis infection (TBI) among high-risk populations in Bandung, Indonesia. Both assays demonstrated comparable clinical performance to the widely used QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus). Given the global burden of tuberculosis, particularly in resource-limited settings, these findings suggest that the TB-Feron assays could serve as reliable alternatives to QFT-Plus for TBI detection. This research highlights the potential for these assays to improve tuberculosis diagnosis, offering a more accessible and efficient screening tool, especially for high-risk populations, and supporting broader tuberculosis surveillance.
40052805	Clinical significance and antifungal susceptibility profile of 103 clinical isolates of <i>Scedosporium</i> species complex and <i>Lomentospora prolificans</i> obtained from NIH patients.	Reduced susceptibility to antifungals is common among members of genera <i>Scedosporium</i> and <i>Lomentospora</i>, with optimal treatments still not fully defined. <i>In vitro</i> antifungal susceptibility results and clinical data do not comprehensively account for the advent of new <i>Scedosporium</i> species identified by molecular phylogenetics. Using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methodology, we tested a total of 103 clinical isolates obtained from patients at the NIH Clinical Center. The most frequent species were <i>Scedosporium apiospermum</i> (63%) and <i>Scedosporium boydii</i> (11%), followed by <i>Lomentospora prolificans</i> (7%). The novel antifungal olorofim showed the lowest MICs against all <i>Scedosporium</i> spp. and <i>L. prolificans</i>, followed by micafungin. Among the triazoles, voriconazole showed lower MICs against <i>Scedosporium</i> spp. Amphotericin B and posaconazole demonstrated species-specific and inter-species variable activity. Itraconazole, isavuconazole, and terbinafine had higher MIC values against <i>Scedosporium</i> spp. and <i>L. prolificans</i>. Clinical data were retrospectively reviewed for 90 isolates, of which nine patients (28 isolates) had active disease/infection and received antifungal treatment that included voriconazole or posaconazole. Five of these patients (56%) died, while three patients (33%) with chronic granulomatous disease were cured following hematopoietic cell transplantation. In 24 patients (62 isolates), the presence of the fungus was considered airway colonization. In conclusion, our data support the existence of species-specific and inter-species differences in the antifungal susceptibility patterns among members of genera <i>Scedosporium</i> and <i>L. prolificans</i>. The novel investigational antifungal olorofim may be a promising therapy. Our clinical data suggest that host status and administration of antifungal therapy most effective for each <i>Scedosporium</i> species complex are important determinants of outcomes.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of infections caused by <i>Scedosporium</i> species complex and <i>Lomentospora prolificans</i> is integral to improving outcomes, particularly in severely ill and immunocompromised patients. <i>In vitro</i> antifungal susceptibility testing can provide an estimate of antifungal activity against fungal pathogens. Our study showed that species-specific and inter-species differences exist in the distribution of antifungal susceptibility patterns between <i>Scedosporium</i> and <i>L. prolificans</i>. Our clinical data also highlight that host status, along with effective antifungal therapy, plays a crucial role in determining treatment outcomes.
40052803	Novel type II toxin-antitoxin systems with VapD-like proteins.	Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread in prokaryotes. They consist of neighboring genes encoding two small proteins: a toxin that inhibits a critical cellular process and an antitoxin that binds to and neutralizes the toxin. The VapD nuclease and the VapX antitoxin comprise a type II TA system that contributes to the virulence of the human pathogen <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>. We analyzed the diversity and evolution of VapD-like proteins. By examining loci adjacent to genes coding for VapD-like proteins, we identified two novel families of antitoxins, which we named VapY and VapW. VapD toxins cognate to novel antitoxins induce the SOS response when overproduced, suggesting they target cellular processes related to genomic DNA integrity, maintenance, or replication. Though VapY has no sequence similarity to VapX, they share the same SH3 fold characterized by the five anti-parallel β sheets that form a barrel. VapW is a homolog of VapD without conserved catalytic residues required for nuclease activity. The crystal structure of the VapD-VapW complex reveals that VapW lacks the dimerization interface essential for the catalytic activity of VapD but retains the second interaction interface that enables VapD hexamerization. This allows VapW to bind VapD in the same manner that VapD dimers bind to each other in hexamers. Thus, though the VapD catalytic cleft remains accessible in the VapD-VapW complex, VapW may disrupt VapD oligomerization. To our knowledge, VapWD provides a unique example of TA systems evolution when a toxin loses its activity and becomes an antitoxin to itself.
40051172	A Comprehensive Review of Anode Materials in Rechargeable Calcium-Ion Batteries.

This paper presents a systematic review of recent research advancements in anode materials, including alloys, organic materials, carbon-based materials, and transition metal oxide. First, the basic properties of CIBs and the challenges associated with anode materials are described. Then, the reaction mechanism and improvement strategies of anode materials for CIBs are highlighted. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the identified anode materials are summarized, and potential future research directions are highlighted.
40049341	Proteomic analysis reveals that Acalypha australis L. mitigates chronic colitis by modulating the FABP4/PPARγ/NF-κB signaling pathway.	Acalypha australis L. (AAL), a traditional medicinal herb from the Euphorbiaceae family, has been widely used in Chinese medicine for its heat-clearing, detoxifying, and diuretic properties, as well as for treating gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea and dysentery. Its reported anti-inflammatory and hemostatic effects are closely linked to inflammatory pathways. While previous studies have demonstrated AAL's efficacy in acute colitis, its therapeutic potential in chronic colitis and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored.
40047413	3D meshwork architecture of the outer coat protein CotE: implications for bacterial endospore sporulation and germination.	<i>Bacillus cereus,</i> a Gram-positive aerobic bacterium commonly found in soil, food, and water, forms endospores that can withstand harsh environmental conditions. The endospores are encased in a protective spore coat consisting of multiple layers of proteins, among which, CotE serves as a crucial morphogenetic protein within the outer coat. In this study, we observed that the homotrimeric CotE protein underwent further oligomerization induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and was subsequently dissociated by dipicolinic acid, a compound released from the spore core during germination. Through cryo-electron microscopy and tomography analyses of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced CotE oligomer, combined with structural predictions and biochemical studies, we propose a three-dimensional meshwork organization facilitated by tryptophan-based interactions between CotE trimers. The resulting meshwork was organized in a defective diamond-like tetrahedral configuration. These insights enhance our understanding of how CotE contributes to endospore morphogenesis and germination through the rapid disassembly of these layers.
40047311	Triple Biomimetic Surfaces with Patterned Anisotropic Wettability for Multiscale Droplets Manipulation.	Droplets manipulation has attracted increasing attention for its increasingly widespread applications. However, current droplet manipulation usually needs complex preparation methods. Here, inspired by lotus leaves, rive leaves, and desert beetles, triple biomimetic surfaces are prepared through laser and heating. The mastoid structures contribute to the construction of superwettability. Within effective cycles, patterned scanning laser processing helps to achieve various interlaced wettability. The groove structure compensates for the decrease in droplet manipulation ability caused by the attenuation of superwettability. Meanwhile, the groove structure endows the scanning regions with good durability. The groove structure and interlaced wettability together constitute the anisotropic suface patterns. Macroscopic and microscopic droplet manipulation has been successfully achieved, demonstrating widespread applications. This work not only provides a titanium surface with triple biomimetic properties but also provides new insights for various droplet manipulations on metal surfaces.
40044149	Capturing CDKs in action: Live-cell biosensors pioneer the new frontiers in cell cycle research.	Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) orchestrate cell cycle progression through precise temporal control of substrate phosphorylation. While traditional biochemical approaches and phosphoproteomics have provided valuable insights into CDK-mediated regulation, these methods require cell population analyses and cannot capture real-time dynamics in individual cells. The recent development of fluorescent biosensors has revolutionized our ability to monitor CDK activity in living cells with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we comprehensively review genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors for measuring CDK activity. The two major modes of action in CDK activity biosensors-FRET-based and translocation-based biosensors-enable researchers to select appropriate tools for their specific experimental objectives. These biosensors have revealed precise spatiotemporal CDK activity dynamics across diverse model systems, including yeast, cultured mammalian cells, worms, flies, frog egg extract, fish, and mice. Such technological advances are transforming our understanding of quantitative principles underlying cell cycle control and opening new avenues for investigating cell cycle regulation in various biological contexts.Key words: CDK, FRET, cell cycle, live imaging, biosensor.
40043828	Tangshenning formula alleviates tubular injury in diabetic kidney disease via the Sestrin2/AMPK/PGC-1α axis: Restoration of mitochondrial function and inhibition of ferroptosis.	Tangshenning (TSN) is a traditional Chinese medicinal formula developed on principles of kidney tonification and collateral unblocking. TSN, formulated from Astragalus mongholicus Bunge, Rheum palmatum L., Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort., and Rosa laevigata Michx., has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Our previous studies have suggested that TSN mitigates tubular injury in DKD by inhibiting ferroptosis, however, the precise molecular targets and mechanistic pathways underlying these effects remain to be fully elucidated.
40043826	Study on the mechanism of Jieduquyuziyin prescription improving the condition of MRL/lpr mice by regulating T cell metabolic reprogramming through the AMPK/mTOR pathway.	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease associated with T cell metabolic reprogramming. The traditional Chinese medicine Jieduquyuziyin prescription (JP) has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in SLE, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. This study evaluates the therapeutic effects of JP on SLE, focusing on T cell metabolic reprogramming.

However, the influence and mechanisms by which THSG affects skin flap survival remain unclear.
40043824	Qingre Huayu Jianpi prescription alleviates the inflammatory transformation of colitis-associated colorectal cancer by inhibiting the IL-17RA/ACT1/NF-κB axis.	Inflammation-to-cancer transformation is critical for the progression of ulcerative colitis to colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC).
40042377	Advancements in regenerative medicine: a comprehensive review of stem cell and growth factor therapies for osteoarthritis.	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a widely encountered degenerative joint disorder marked by gradual cartilage deterioration, inflammation, and pain, which collectively impose considerable strain on global healthcare systems. While traditional therapies typically offer relief from symptoms, they do not tackle the core pathophysiological aspects of the disease. Regenerative medicine has recently risen as a promising field for addressing OA, capitalizing on the regenerative capabilities of stem cells and growth factors to foster tissue healing and renewal. This thorough review delves into the most recent progress in stem cell and growth factor treatments for OA, covering preclinical studies, clinical trials, and novel technological developments. We discuss the diverse origins of stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), underscoring their therapeutic actions and effectiveness in both preclinical and clinical environments. Moreover, we explore contributions of growth factors like transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in modifying OA's pathology and enhancing tissue restoration. Additionally, this review discusses the hurdles and constraints tied to current regenerative strategies, including the standardization of cell sources, the refinement of delivery techniques, and considerations for long-term safety. By meticulously assessing the latest research outcomes and technological breakthroughs, this review aims to shed light on the potential of stem cell and growth factor therapies as forthcoming therapeutic options for OA, thereby propelling forward the domain of regenerative medicine and enhancing clinical results for individuals afflicted with this incapacitating ailment.
40042313	XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine induces lasting cross-reactive responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants such as HV.1 and JN.1, as well as SARS-CoV-1, but elicits limited XBB.1.5 specific antibodies.	The evolution of the antibody response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is impacted by the nature and number of antigenic exposures. First-generation coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines encoded an ancestral spike protein. Updated bivalent vaccines and breakthrough infections have shaped the intricate diversity of the polyclonal antibody response and specificity of individual antibody clones. We and others previously showed that bivalent vaccines containing the ancestral and Omicron (BA.5) spikes induce high levels of cross-reactive antibodies but undetectable BA.5-specific antibodies in serum. Here, we assessed sera collected before as well as 1 and 3 months following administration of an updated XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine to individuals with diverse infection and vaccination histories. Vaccination increased neutralization against recent variants of concern, including HV.1, JN.1, and the vaccine-homologous XBB.1.5. Antibody binding and avidity against ancestral and XBB.1.5 antigens significantly increased after vaccination. However, antibody depletion experiments showed that most of the response was cross-reactive to the ancestral spike, and only low levels of XBB.1.5-specific antibodies to the spike or the receptor-binding domain were detected. Importantly, increased antibody levels were still detectable in circulation 3 months post-vaccination and cross-reacted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) as measured by pseudovirus neutralization and binding assays. Overall, our data suggest that the XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine predominantly elicits a cross-reactive response imprinted by viral spike antigens encountered early during the pandemic.IMPORTANCEUpdated COVID-19 vaccine formulations and SARS-CoV-2 exposure history affect the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. High titers of antibodies are induced in serum by XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccination. Antibody depletion experiments reveal that the majority of the antibody response is cross-reactive to the ancestral spike, despite vaccination increasing neutralization against recently circulating Omicron variants. Vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies cross-react with SARS-CoV-1 and remain in the bloodstream for at least 3 months after immunization.
40042312	SUN-domain proteins of the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> are essential for proper nuclear division and DNA repair.	The protozoan parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, which is responsible for the deadliest form of human malaria, accounts for over half a million deaths a year. These parasites proliferate in human red blood cells by consecutive rounds of closed mitoses called schizogony. Their virulence is attributed to their ability to modify the infected red cells to adhere to the vascular endothelium and to evade immunity through antigenic switches. Spatial dynamics at the nuclear periphery were associated with the regulation of processes that enable the parasites to establish long-term infection. However, our knowledge of components of the nuclear envelope (NE) in <i>Plasmodium</i> remains limited. One of the major protein complexes at the NE is the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that forms a connecting bridge between the cytoplasm and the nucleus through the interaction of SUN and KASH domain proteins. Here, we have identified two SUN-domain proteins as possible components of the LINC complex of <i>P. falciparum</i> and show that their proper expression is essential for the parasite's proliferation in human red blood cells, and their depletion leads to the formation of membranous whorls and morphological changes of the NE. In addition, their differential expression highlights different functions at the nuclear periphery as PfSUN2 is specifically associated with heterochromatin, while PfSUN1 expression is essential for activation of the DNA damage response. Our data provide indications for the involvement of the LINC complex in crucial biological processes in the intraerythrocytic development cycle of malaria parasites.
40042302	Effects of cellular membranes and the precore protein on hepatitis B virus core particle assembly and DNA replication.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core particle is critical for the transport and replication of the viral DNA genome. By characterizing HBV core particles in different subcellular compartments, we found that when the HBV core protein was expressed by itself, it formed core particles with a uniform and fast mobility on a non-denaturing agarose gel. However, when the core protein was expressed from a replication-competent 1.3mer HBV genome, it formed particles with more heterogeneous structures. The presence of the precore protein, a protein related to the core protein, led to the formation of chimeric particles in the cytoplasm that consisted of both precore and core proteins. When the precore protein was expressed by itself, it could also form particulate structures in association with cellular RNAs in the nucleus. Our further analysis revealed that, in cells with replicating HBV, only the fast-migrating core particles on the gel contained the viral RNA and DNA, and the membrane-associated core particles contained more mature HBV DNA than the cytosolic core particles. In addition, the precore protein reduced the level of core particle-associated HBV DNA. Interestingly, the precore protein level in the cells could be increased by the degradative autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 but not by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that autophagy might regulate the biological activities of the precore protein. In conclusion, our results indicated that membranes and the precore protein could regulate HBV core particle assembly and DNA replication and suggested a role of autophagy in the regulation of HBV precore protein activities.
40042280	Lost in translation: conserved amino acid usage despite extreme codon bias in foraminifera.	Analyses of codon usage in eukaryotes suggest that amino acid usage responds to GC pressure so AT-biased substitutions drive higher usage of amino acids with AT-ending codons. Here, we combine single-cell transcriptomics and phylogenomics to explore codon usage patterns in foraminifera, a diverse and ancient clade of predominantly uncultivable microeukaryotes. We curate data from 1,044 gene families in 49 individuals representing 28 genera, generating perhaps the largest existing dataset of data from a predominantly uncultivable clade of protists, to analyze compositional bias and codon usage. We find extreme variation in composition, with a median GC content at fourfold degenerate silent sites below 3% in some species and above 75% in others. The most AT-biased species are distributed among diverse non-monophyletic lineages. Surprisingly, despite the extreme variation in compositional bias, amino acid usage is highly conserved across all foraminifera. By analyzing nucleotide, codon, and amino acid composition within this diverse clade of amoeboid eukaryotes, we expand our knowledge of patterns of genome evolution across the eukaryotic tree of life.IMPORTANCEPatterns of molecular evolution in protein-coding genes reflect trade-offs between substitution biases and selection on both codon and amino acid usage. Most analyses of these factors in microbial eukaryotes focus on model species such as <i>Acanthamoeba, Plasmodium,</i> and yeast, where substitution bias is a primary contributor to patterns of amino acid usage. Foraminifera, an ancient clade of single-celled eukaryotes, present a conundrum, as we find highly conserved amino acid usage underlain by divergent nucleotide composition, including extreme AT-bias at silent sites among multiple non-sister lineages. We speculate that these paradoxical patterns are enabled by the dynamic genome structure of foraminifera, whose life cycles can include genome endoreplication and chromatin extrusion.
40042272	Spontaneous lung colonization in the cystic fibrosis rat model is linked to gastrointestinal obstruction.	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene, resulting in CFTR protein dysfunction. CFTR dysfunction has multi-organ consequences, leading to dehydrated mucus that is adherent to epithelia. In the lungs, this leads to recalcitrant infections with bacteria such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. In the gut, mucus-laden feces can adhere to the intestines, resulting in distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). There is limited information on how lung colonization and DIOS are correlated in people with CF (pwCF). In this novel work, we describe the development of spontaneous lung colonization of CF pathogens in young (<3 months old) CF rats, preceding the development of DIOS. Once DIOS is established, the lung microbiome becomes predominated by taxa also observed in the feces. Induced infection with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in the CF rats reflects data found in pwCF, as once CF rats are infected, they retain a higher relative abundance of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> than their healthy agemates. Finally, we found that ivacaftor treatment favors a healthier gut microbiome in CF rats, decreasing the relative abundance of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. These results indicate that the CF rat model is recapitulative of human CF disease with the spontaneous lung colonization of traditional CF pathogens and maintenance of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> after induced infection. Furthermore, these results indicate a possible role for the gut-lung axis in lung colonization and DIOS in CF.IMPORTANCEThese data describe for the first time the development of spontaneous lung colonization in the cystic fibrosis (CF) rat model, a hallmark aspect of human CF disease. We also find that CF rats infected with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> maintain higher relative abundance following chronic infection as compared to healthy rats, similar to those is seen in people with CF. Additionally, we describe the possible contribution of the gut-lung axis linking lung health with distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, a relationship largely unexplored in the context of CF.
40042268	Cryo-EM structure of the <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> MexY multidrug efflux pump.	<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a Gram-negative pathogen, has emerged as one of the most highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria worldwide and subsequently has become a leading cause of healthcare-associated, life-threatening infections. <i>P. aeruginosa</i> multidrug efflux Y (MexY) is an efflux pump that belongs to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily. It is a major determinant for resistance to aminoglycosides in this opportunistic pathogen. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in aminoglycoside recognition and extrusion by MexY have not been elucidated. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of MexY to a resolution of 3.63 Å. The structure directly indicates two plausible pathways for drug export. It also suggests that MexY is capable of picking up antibiotics via the ceiling of the central cavity formed by the MexY trimer. Molecular dynamics simulations depict that MexY is able to use a tunnel connecting the central cavity to the funnel of the trimer to export its substrates.
40040377	Thionated Coumarins: Study of the Intersystem Crossing and the Zero-field Splitting of the Triplet State Using Time-Resolved Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopies.	To study the effect of thionation of the carbonyl groups in a chromophore, i. e. replacing the O atom with S atom, on the photophysics, we studied two thionated coumarin derivatives (Cou-S and Cou-6-S) with various steady state and transient spectroscopic methods. Both compounds exhibit red-shifted absorption (up to 4900 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and strong fluorescence quenching as compared to the unthionated analogues. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast ISC (ca. 10 ps) in the thionated coumarin derivatives, while negligible ISC was observed in the unthionated coumarin. Interestingly, triplet excited state lifetimes of the thionated coumarin (0.14 μs) is much shorter than the unthionated analogues (53.4 μs). Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate much larger zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameters (up to 0.287 cm<sup>-1</sup>) for the T<sub>1</sub> state of the thionated coumarins than the unthionated analogues (D=0.1001 cm<sup>-1</sup>). This large D value is attributed to the strong spin orbital coupling effect. These results demonstrate the advantage and the drawback of thionation-enhanced ISC, i. e. the ISC is efficient, but triplet state lifetimes become substantially shorter. This information is useful for the future design of heavy atom-free triplet photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, photon upconversion, photocatalytic organic synthesis and photopolymerization, etc.
40037475	Maimendong decoction modulates the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway alleviates type 2 alveolar epithelial cells senescence and enhances mitochondrial autophagy to offer potential therapeutic effects for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.	Maimendong decoction (MMDD) originates from the ancient Chinese medical text Synopsis of the Golden Chamber and is a well-established remedy for treating lung diseases. It has demonstrated efficacy in the long-term clinical management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
40035593	RNA toehold switch-based reporter assay to assess bacterial uptake of antisense oligomers.	Antisense oligomers (ASOs) hold promise as antibiotics for the selective targeting of bacterial pathogens and as tools for the modulation of gene expression in microbes that are not amenable to genetic engineering. However, their efficient delivery across the complex bacterial envelope remains a major challenge. There are few methods to assess the efficiency of carrier-mediated ASO uptake by bacteria. Here, we have developed a "switch-on" reporter assay to measure ASO uptake efficiency in a semi-quantitative manner. The assay uses a synthetic RNA toehold switch fused to the mRNA of a fluorescent reporter protein, which is activated <i>in vivo</i> by a peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based ASO upon delivery into the bacterial cytosol. We have used this assay to screen different cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) as ASO carriers in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> and observed up to 60-fold activation, depending on the CPP and bacterial strain used. Our assay shows high dynamic range and sensitivity, which should enable high-throughput screens for bacterial ASO carriers. We also show that the reporter can be used to study routes of PNA uptake, as demonstrated by reduced reporter activity in the absence of the inner membrane protein SbmA. In summary, we present a tool for the discovery of species-specific and efficient ASO carriers that will also be useful for a broader investigation of cellular uptake mechanisms of antibacterial ASOs.IMPORTANCEThe rise of antimicrobial resistance presents a major global health challenge. If not addressed, the death toll from resistant infections is expected to rise dramatically in the coming years. As a result, it is essential to explore alternative antimicrobial therapies. One promising approach is to target bacterial mRNAs using antisense oligomers (ASOs) to silence genes involved in essential functions, virulence, or resistance. However, delivering ASOs across bacterial membranes remains a major challenge and effective methods to monitor their uptake are limited. In this study, we develop a reporter assay to facilitate the high-throughput discovery of bacterial ASO carriers. This research paves the way for developing novel precision antisense-based antibacterial therapies.
40035590	Adaptive evolution of <i>Candida albicans</i> through modulating TOR signaling.	<i>Candida albicans</i> stably colonizes humans but is a major fungal pathogen that occupies a wide range of divergent niches within the host. Rapid and effective adaptation to dynamic and contrasting host niches is associated with its pathogenicity. Recent studies have focused on genome evolution implicated in adaptive processes. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of TOR signaling is a mechanism underlying adaptive evolution in <i>C. albicans</i>. Clinical isolates of <i>C. albicans</i> exhibited enhanced commensal fitness in competition with the lab reference strain SC5314, which could be attributed to the diminished GlcNAc-responsive hypha-associated transcription in the gut. <i>In vitro</i> passaging of clinical isolates confers a reduction in TOR signaling, which is detrimental to fitness attributes in evolved strains, including stress response, antifungal drug tolerance, as well as <i>in vivo</i> commensal fitness and invasive infection. This phenomenon is observed independent of strain background and passaging environment. Importantly, inhibition of TOR signaling by rapamycin suppresses the fitness advantage observed in clinical isolates relative to their <i>in vitro</i> passaged derivatives. Thus, <i>C. albicans</i> undergoes rapid evolution via modulating TOR signaling that enables this fungus to adapt to diverse host niches.

40035535	Role of human herpesvirus homologs of infected cell protein 27 (ICP27) in the biogenesis, processing, and maturation of mRNAs.	Herpesviruses are enveloped viruses with large double-stranded DNA genomes that are highly prevalent in the human population and elicit numerous types of clinical manifestations, from mild to severe. These viruses are classified into three subfamilies: <i>alpha</i>-, <i>beta</i>-, and <i>gammaherpesvirinae</i>, all capable of establishing life-long persistent infections in the host. As strict intracellular parasites, these viruses have evolved molecular determinants to support and modulate viral and host gene transcription processes during infection and the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to synthesize proteins that participate in cellular pathways promoting their replication cycles and virion formation. Notably, some of these proteins have functional RNA-binding domains consisting of arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) amino acid (aa) sequences that, when methylated, regulate their nucleic acid-binding capacities and can influence the export of mRNAs lacking introns from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Additional domains and motifs in these proteins mediate their interactions with regulatory proteins related to RNA splicing, either promoting or repressing mRNA processing. Notably, all human herpesviruses (HHVs) encode in their genomes proteins that share homology with infected cell protein 27 (ICP27) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which can significantly impact the biogenesis of mRNAs and their processing during infection. Here, we review and discuss the roles of ICP27 and the corresponding homologs encoded in different human herpesviruses, focusing on their similarities and differences in structure and function. A more profound knowledge of the role of key viral factors required for effective herpesvirus replication could aid in the design and identification of novel antivirals to treat the diseases produced by these viruses.
40032524	Rapid and Stimulus-Specific Deviance Detection in the Human Inferior Colliculus.	Auditory deviance detection, the neural process by which unexpected stimuli are identified within repetitive acoustic environments, is crucial for survival. While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in the cortex, recent evidence indicates that it also occurs in subcortical regions, including the inferior colliculus (IC). However, compared with animal studies, research on subcortical deviance detection in humans is often constrained by methodological limitations, leaving several important questions unanswered. This study aims to overcome some of these limitations by employing auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to investigate the earliest neural correlates of deviance detection in humans, with a focus on the IC. We presented healthy participants of either sex with low- and high-frequency chirps in an oddball paradigm and observed significant deviance detection effects in the ABR, specifically when low-frequency chirps were used as deviants within a context of high-frequency standards. These effects manifested as larger and faster ABRs to deviant stimuli, with the strongest responses occurring at higher stimulation rates. Our findings suggest that the human IC exhibits rapid, stimulus-specific deviance detection with differential modulation of response amplitude and latency. The data indicate that the temporal dynamics of novelty detection in humans align well with the data reported in animals, helping to bridge the gap between animal and human research. By uncovering previously unknown characteristics of subcortical deviance detection in humans, this study highlights the value of ABR recordings with excellent temporal resolution in investigating subcortical deviance detection processes.
40032522	Hippocampal Place Cell Sequences Are Impaired in a Rat Model of Fragile X Syndrome.	Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause impairments in spatial cognition and memory. The hippocampus is thought to support spatial cognition through the activity of place cells, neurons with spatial receptive fields. Coordinated firing of place cell populations is organized by different oscillatory patterns in the hippocampus during specific behavioral states. Theta rhythms organize place cell populations during awake exploration. Sharp wave-ripples organize place cell population reactivation during waking rest. Here, we examined the coordination of CA1 place cell populations during active behavior and subsequent rest in a rat model of FXS (<i>Fmr1</i> knock-out rats). While the organization of individual place cells by the theta rhythm was normal, the coordinated activation of sequences of place cells during individual theta cycles was impaired in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out rats. Furthermore, the subsequent replay of place cell sequences was impaired during waking rest following active exploration. Together, these results expand our understanding of how genetic modifications that model those observed in FXS affect hippocampal physiology and suggest a potential mechanism underlying impaired spatial cognition in FXS.
40031684	Implicit Shape and Appearance Priors for Few-Shot Full Head Reconstruction.	Recent advancements in learning techniques that employ coordinate-based neural representations have yielded remarkable results in multi-view 3D reconstruction tasks. However, these approaches often require a substantial number of input views (typically several tens) and computationally intensive optimization procedures to achieve their effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations specifically for the problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. We accomplish this by incorporating a probabilistic shape and appearance prior into coordinate-based representations, enabling faster convergence and improved generalization when working with only a few input images (even as low as a single image). During testing, we leverage this prior to guiding the fitting process of a signed distance function using a differentiable renderer. By incorporating the statistical prior alongside parallelizable ray tracing and dynamic caching strategies, we achieve an efficient and accurate approach to few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. Moreover, we extend the H3DS dataset, which now comprises 60 high-resolution 3D full-head scans and their corresponding posed images and masks, which we use for evaluation purposes. By leveraging this dataset, we demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art results in geometry reconstruction while being an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches.
40029617	Broadband near-infrared phosphor LiTi<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>:<i>x</i>Cr<sup>3+</sup> realized <i>via</i> multi-site occupation.	Near-infrared phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (NIR pc-led) have wide applications in fields of biological imaging and food detection. However, developing an efficient, inexpensive, and broadband near-infrared fluorescent phosphor with sufficient spectral coverage remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of broadband near-infrared phosphors, LiTi<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>:<i>x</i>Cr<sup>3+</sup> (LTP), and analyze their crystal structure, luminescent properties, and thermal quenching mechanism. The experimental results indicated that at <i>x</i> = 0.07, the luminescence intensity of the LTP:0.07Cr<sup>3+</sup> sample reached its maximum value, followed by the concentration quenching phenomenon, which resulted from the energy transfer between the adjacent Cr<sup>3+</sup>-Cr<sup>3+</sup>. Under 455 nm excitation, LTP:0.07Cr<sup>3+</sup> exhibited a broadband emission spectrum in the range of 700-1250 nm, with a peak centered at 890 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 210 nm. The analyses of the crystal structure and PL spectra as well as the calculation of Cr<sup>3+</sup> crystal field intensity indicated that the realization of a broadband near-infrared emission was attributed to the occupancy of Cr<sup>3+</sup> at multiple sites of Li<sup>+</sup> and Ti<sup>4+</sup> in a weak crystal field (<i>Dq</i>/<i>B</i> = 1.92). At a high temperature of 373 K, the luminescence intensity of LTP:0.07Cr<sup>3+</sup> was 41% of that observed at room temperature, indicating that the thermal stability of the fluorescent phosphor needed further improvement. Finally, NIR pc-LED devices were prepared using the fluorescent phosphor and blue LED chips, confirming the potential application value of the fluorescent phosphor in biomedical imaging, night vision, and food detection.
40029092	Direct thin-layer agar for bedaquiline-susceptibility testing of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> at BSL2 level yields high accuracy in 15 days from sputum processing.	This study evaluated thin-layer agar (TLA) as a faster alternative for both indirect minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination of bedaquiline (BDQ) from culture isolates and direct drug-susceptibility testing (DST) from sputum samples. Indirect BDQ-MIC results from TLA were compared to the established 7H11 solid DST. Direct-TLA-DST performance was assessed using 143 baseline sputum samples from rifampicin-resistant TB cases. Direct-TLA tested susceptibility to rifampicin, isoniazid, levofloxacin, and BDQ, with results compared to Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) and MGIT. For indirect BDQ-MIC determination, TLA accurately identified H37Rv MICs within the WHO control range (0.015-0.12μg/mL). Optimal results were obtained with standard incubation and day 7 reading of the plates. TLA correctly classified all wild-type clinical strains as BDQ-susceptible and detected 9 out of 10 BDQ-resistant strains with elevated MICs. Direct-TLA-DST detected MTB in 53.8% of samples, compared to 55.9% on LJ and 69.4% in MGIT. Uninterpretable results due to contamination or medium drying were low (4.9%). The median time to result was 15 days for smear-positive and 22 days for smear-negative samples, faster than WHO-endorsed methods. Sensitivity was 100% for rifampicin and 87.8% for isoniazid, with a specificity of 100% for all drugs except isoniazid (96.2%). No BDQ nor levofloxacin resistance was detected, thus direct TLA sensitivity could not be assessed. In conclusion, direct-TLA-DST offers a reliable and faster alternative to conventional DST methods for BDQ and other anti-TB drugs. Essentially, this technique can be operated at BioSafety Level 2, allowing decentralization of pDST for managing drug-resistant TB in settings with limited laboratory infrastructure.
40028926	Direct Cyclization of 1,3-Diketones with Malonate-Based Iodonium Ylides to Generate Dihydrofurans.	While iodonium ylides are important reactants in a wide range of reactions, the exploration of electron-transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Herein, we describe a direct cyclization of 1,3-diketones with malonate-based iodonium ylides to give a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields. The control experiments suggest that the electron transfer between enol and iodonium ylide gives reactive species, thus enabling a cyclization cascade process to take place to give dihydrofurans.
40025696	Precision Self-assembly of 3D DNA Crystals Using Microfluidics.	Controlling the uniformity in size and quantity of macroscopic three-dimensional (3D) DNA crystals is essential for their integration into complex systems and broader applications. However, achieving such control remains a major challenge in DNA nanotechnology. Here, we present a novel strategy for synthesizing monodisperse 3D DNA single crystals using microfluidic double-emulsion droplets as nanoliter-scale microreactors. These uniformly sized droplets can shrink and swell without leaking their inner contents, allowing the concentration of the DNA solution inside to be adjusted. The confined volume ensures that, once a crystal seed forms, it rapidly consumes the available DNA material, preventing the formation of additional crystals within the same droplet. This approach enables precise control over crystal growth, resulting in a yield of one DNA single crystal per droplet, with a success rate of up to 98.6% ± 0.9%. The resulting DNA crystals exhibit controlled sizes, ranging from 19.3 ± 0.9 μm to 56.8 ± 2.6 μm. Moreover, this method can be applied to the controlled growth of various types of DNA crystals. Our study provides a new pathway for DNA crystal self-assembly and microengineering.
40024904	Regulating the Ligand N-Heterocyclic Coordination in Bismuth-Based MOFs for Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction.	The increasing global concern over environmental degradation and resource depletion has driven the search for sustainable technologies to mitigate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Recently, bismuth-based metal organic frameworks (Bi-MOFs) have garnered significant attention due to their high stability, adjustable porosity, and excellent light absorption properties. However, weak visible light absorption and charge recombination are still obstacles to wide application. In this study, a new class of Bi-MOFs based on tribenzoic acid with different ligand N-atom number was synthesized by solvothermal method. Experimental and computational results indicated that the introduction of one N-heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO<sub>2</sub> molecules, thus improving photocatalytic activity. This study highlights the potential of pyridine-functionalized ligands for the design of high-performance MOFs for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, providing valuable insights for the development of advanced materials in environmental sustainability efforts.
40024889	Synthesis of Derivatives of the Antibiotic Albicidin: The N-Terminal Fragment as Key to Control Potency and Resistance Mediated by the Binding Protein AlbA.	The peptide albicidin represents a highly promising lead structure which is a first-in-class antibiotic with remarkable potency against gram-negative bacteria. Past efforts in the synthesis of albicidin analogs focused on increasing hydrophilicity, broadening of the antibacterial profile and overcoming resistance. Herein, we present synthetic albicidin derivatives with variations in the N-terminal building block and characterize their antibacterial activity and DNA gyrase inhibition. Furthermore, we show that the N-terminus of albicidin greatly affects binding to the resistance factor AlbAL. This transcription regulator senses albicidin and triggers the biosynthesis of the binding protein AlbAS, thus reducing the free concentration of the antibiotic. Here we demonstrate uncoupling of the binding event from transcription activation for some derivatives, and even a few derivatives seemed insensitive to sequestration by AlbA. This approach could be a strategy to develop albicidin analogs escaping AlbA resistance.

Sanghuangporus, the dried fruiting body of Sanghuangporus vaninii (Ljub) L.W.Zhou et Y.C.Dai. As the main species of Sanghuang, it has been well-known and used commonly as a traditional medicinal and edible macrofungi for thousands of years in many countries, including China, Korea and Japan. Although it has good hepatoprotective activity, its potential efficacy and mechanism on liver fibrosis remain elusive.

40019100	Gas-phase, conformer-specific infrared spectra of 3-chlorophenol and 3-fluorophenol.	Conformational isomerism of phenol derivatives has been a subject of extensive spectroscopic study. Combining the capabilities of the widely tuneable infrared free-electron laser FELIX with molecular beam technologies allows for revisiting existing data and gaining additional insights into far-IR spectroscopy of halogenated phenols. Here we present conformer-resolved infrared spectra of the <i>syn</i> and <i>anti</i> conformers of 3-chlorophenol and 3-fluorophenol recorded <i>via</i> IR-UV ion-dip spectroscopy. The experimental work is complemented by density functional theory calculations to aid in assignment of the observed bands. The experimental spectra for the two conformers of each molecule show overall a great similarity, but also include some distinct conformer-specific bands in the spectral range investigated. Our spectra confirm previously reported OH torsional mode frequencies for the <i>syn</i> and <i>anti</i> conformers of 3-chlorophenol (3CP) at 315 cm<sup>-1</sup>, (Manocha <i>et al.</i>, <i>J. Phys. Chem.</i>, 1973, <b>77</b>, 2094) but reverse their assignment of the 311 and 319 cm<sup>-1</sup> bands for 3-fluorophenol. 1D torsional mode calculations were performed for 3CP to help assign possible OH torsion overtones.
40017298	Computer-Aided Design and Pharmacophore-Based Screening of a Diverse Combinatorial Library of Phytoselective Aryloxyacetic Acid Derivatives as HPPD Inhibitors.	We investigated the inhibitory potency of aryloxyacetic acid derivatives (AADs) on 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), a crucial enzyme target for HPPD herbicide development. Developing a wide-ranging approach combining reported structure-activity relationships (SARs with the observed inhibitory potencies of the enzyme <i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup>), our simulations for molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann (MM-PB) complexation quantitative SAR (QSAR) (computed relative Gibbs free energies of the HPPD-AADx complex formation ΔΔ<i>G</i><sub>com</sub>), and three-dimensional (3D)-QSAR pharmacophore (PH4) models for screening the chemical subspace of aryloxyacetic acid derivatives (a virtual library of AADs, VL), we come out with a handful of novel AADs with promising predictive HPPD inhibitory potency and confirmed molecular dynamics (MD) conformational stability. The 3D-QSAR model revealed a correlation (p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup> = <i>a</i> × ΔΔ<i>G</i><sub>com</sub> + <i>b</i>) between computed data and observed inhibition ones: p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup> = -0.0544 × ΔΔ<i>G</i><sub>com</sub> + 6.93, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.87 for a training set (TS) of 30 AAD (AAD1-30). The subsequent 3D-QSAR pharmacophore (PH4) of HPPD inhibition by AADs confirmed the correlation (p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup> = 0.863 × p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>pre</sup> + 7.92, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.86) between PH4-predicted p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>pre</sup> and the observed ones p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup>. The structural information derived from these models suggested suitable substituents for building a virtual library (VL) of AAD analogues representing a chemical subspace of 79,500 compounds to be PH4-screened in search of more potent inhibitors; the best predicted <i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>pre</sup> of them reached 40 pM. Finally, the good stability of the <i>At</i>HPPD-AADx complex and the flexibility of the active conformation of the inhibitor for selected top-ranked AAD analogues were checked with the help of molecular dynamics (MD, 200 ns runs). This computational study proposed a set of new predicted potent inhibitors with herbicidal effects.
40015986	Molecular and Anatomical Strengthening of "Winner" Climbing Fiber Synapses in Developing Mouse Purkinje Cells.	Neural circuits are refined by strengthening frequently used or advantaged synapses while eliminating redundant connections. In neonatal mice, cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are initially innervated by multiple climbing fibers (CFs) of similar strength. By postnatal day 7 (P7), one CF, the "winner," is selectively strengthened and begins dendritic translocation by P9, while both "winner" and "loser" CFs temporarily maintain somatic synapses. Although the functional differentiation of CF inputs is well understood, their structural differentiation is less clear. In this study, we examined "winner" CF synapses in dendrites and both "winner" and "loser" synapses in the soma using serial electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in C57BL/6 mice. We found that "winner" CF synapses, both in the soma and dendrites, developed more complex pre- and postsynaptic structures than "loser" CFs, with an expanded area of postsynaptic density. Additionally, "winner" CF synapses expressed significantly higher levels of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Notably, only dendritic "winner" synapses showed increased levels of Rab3-interacting molecule RIM, a key presynaptic regulator of neurotransmitter release. These findings reveal the molecular and structural features that enable "winner" CFs to reinforce their synaptic strength and innervation, allowing them to outcompete other inputs during early development.
40015985	Dorsal-Ventral Reinforcement Learning Network Connectivity and Incentive-Driven Changes in Exploration.	Probabilistic reinforcement learning (RL) tasks assay how individuals make decisions under uncertainty. The use of internal models (model-based) or direct learning from experiences (model-free), and the degree of choice stochasticity across alternatives (i.e., exploration), can all be influenced by the state space of the decision-making task. There is considerable individual variation in the balance between model-based and model-free control during decision-making, and this balance is affected by incentive motivation. The effect of variable reward incentives on the arbitration between model-based and model-free learning remains understudied, and individual differences in neural signatures and cognitive traits that moderate the effect of reward on model-free/model-based control are unknown. Here we combined a two-stage decision-making task utilizing differing reward incentives with computational modeling, neuropsychological tests, and neuroimaging to address these questions. Results showed the prospect of greater reward decreased exploration of alternative options and increased the balance toward model-based learning. These behavioral effects were replicated across two independent datasets including both sexes. Individual differences in processing speed and analytical thinking style affected how reward altered the dependence on both systems. Using a systems neuroscience-inspired approach to resting-state functional connectivity, we found reduced exploration of the options during the first stage of our task under high relative to low incentives was predicted by increased cross-network coupling between ventral and dorsal RL circuitry. These findings suggest that integrity of functional connections between stimulus valuation (ventral) and action valuation (dorsal) RL networks is associated with changes in the balance between explore-exploit decisions under changing reward incentives.

40013779	Spatiotemporal binding of cyclophilin A and CPSF6 to capsid regulates HIV-1 nuclear entry and integration.	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid, which is the target of the antiviral lenacapavir, protects the viral genome and binds multiple host proteins to influence intracellular trafficking, nuclear import, and integration. Previously, we showed that capsid binding to cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6) in the cytoplasm is competitively inhibited by cyclophilin A (CypA) binding and regulates capsid trafficking, nuclear import, and infection. Here, we determined that a capsid mutant with increased CypA binding affinity had significantly reduced nuclear entry and mislocalized integration. However, disruption of CypA binding to the mutant capsid restored nuclear entry, integration, and infection in a CPSF6-dependent manner. Furthermore, relocalization of CypA expression from the cell cytoplasm to the nucleus failed to restore mutant HIV-1 infection. Our results clarify that sequential binding of CypA and CPSF6 to HIV-1 capsid is required for optimal nuclear entry and integration targeting, providing insights for the development of antiretroviral therapies, such as lenacapavir.
40013778	HPSE-mediated proinflammatory signaling contributes to neurobehavioral deficits following intranasal HSV-1 infection.	Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus that can infect the brain, and an uncontrolled infection can lead to a range of diseases, including chronic nerve pain, encephalitis, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. These outcomes are often severe and have lasting consequences, highlighting the need to identify host factors that contribute to disease severity. In this study, we report that intranasal HSV-1 infection in murine model, which promotes viral dissemination into the brain, implicates the host protein heparanase (HPSE) as a key mediator of neuroinflammation. Specifically, we observed that the HPSE activity during HSV-1 infection in naïve animals promotes the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, enhances microglial activity in the brain, and contributes to cognitive impairment, anxiety, and motor coordination deficits. Such effects are significantly less detectable in heparanase deficient (<i>Hpse-/</i>-) mice. Additionally, we found that moderate activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly in <i>Hpse+/+</i> mice, may contribute to the activation of the inflammasome pathway. This, in turn, leads to the activation of caspase-1 (<i>Casp1</i>) and caspase-3 (<i>Casp3</i>), which may play a role in nerve function loss. Our findings position HPSE as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating virus-induced neuroinflammation and neurobehavioral defects.
40011448	Encoded Display of Chemical Libraries on Nanoparticles as a Versatile Selection Tool To Discover Protein Ligands.	DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology is a powerful tool for discovering potent ligands for biological targets but constrained by limitations, including the insolubility of DNA in organic solvents and its instability under various reaction conditions, which restrict the reactivity scope and structural diversity achievable in library synthesis. Here, we present a new strategy called nanoDEL, where library molecules and DNA tags are displayed on the surface of nanoparticles. Since nanoparticles disperse well in both organic solvents and aqueous solutions, DEL synthesis can be accomplished using well-established organic solvent-based conditions, eliminating the need for aqueous conditions. Moreover, nanoDEL enables air-sensitive reactions that are inaccessible with conventional DEL methods relying on aqueous conditions. Notably, in nanoDEL, multiple copies of a DNA tag are attached to an individual nanoparticle to encode a single compound, significantly enhancing tolerance to DNA-damaging conditions. Even when most DNA tags are damaged, sequence analysis remains feasible via amplification of intact tags. Consequently, nanoDEL facilitates the convenient use of existing organic reactions without the necessity to develop DNA-compatible reactions. The potential of nanoDEL was validated by affinity selection against streptavidin as a model system and successfully applied to the discovery of potent small-molecule inhibitors for a kinase and stapled peptide inhibitors targeting a protein-protein interaction, exhibiting dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a large combinatorial library can be efficiently synthesized on nanoparticles using a synthetic scheme including moisture-sensitive reaction steps, which are not feasible with conventional DELs.
40011222	Functionalized Thorium-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of 1, 5-Dihydroxynaphthalene.	It is still a challenging task to rationally design metal-organic framework (MOF) crystal catalysts with excellent light absorption and charge transfer for efficient photocatalytic reactions. In this work, the hexanuclear thorium clusters, porphyrin derivative ligands, and linear carboxylic acid ligands were assemed into Th-based metal-organic frameworks (Th<sub>6</sub>-TCPP, Th<sub>6</sub>-Co-TCPP, and Th<sub>6</sub>-Ni-TCPP) by the mixed ligand method. The three prepared MOF crystals were applied in the photocatalytic oxidation of 1, 5-dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 5-DHN) for the synthesis of juglone. Among them, Th<sub>6</sub>-TCPP exhibited optimum photodynamic activity for production of reactive oxygen species. Under lillumination, Th<sub>6</sub>-TCPP resulted in photochemical reaction conversion rate up to 95 % for 9, 10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) and 54.5 % for 1, 5-DHN. The good catalytic effect was attributed to the large conjugate system of porphyrin and the enhanced photosensitivity of bipyridine.
40011211	Asymmetric Amination of 1,2-Diol through Borrowing Hydrogen: Synthesis of Vicinal Amino α-Tertiary Alcohol.	Methods to prepare vicinal amino alcohols are important because of their presence in biologically active compounds. Despite the development of various methods for vicinal amino alcohol synthesis, C(sp3)-rich oxygen-containing β-amine compounds continue to pose great challenge. While ring-opening reaction of epoxides with amine nucleophile is the prime method for vicinal amino alcohol preparation, epoxides are highly reactive and sometimes difficult to make, resulting in drawbacks regarding selectivity of this approach. Here, we report a catalytic enantio-convergent amination of α-tertiary 1,2-diols for the efficient access to vicinal amino α-tertiary alcohols. The racemic α-tertiary 1,2-diol substrates of different alkyl/aryl or alkyl/alkyl backbone, can be converted to chiral vicinal amino α-tertiary alcohols through diphenyl phosphate-mediated RuCl<sub>3</sub> catalysed asymmetric borrowing hydrogen (ABH) pathway. This simple ABH reaction can be scaled up to the synthesis of chiral ligands, synthetic intermediates, and other medicinally-relevant compounds. Overall, this catalytic redox-neutral procedure broadens the scope of Ru-catalysed amination of alcohols and discloses an underexplored step- and atom-economical synthetic strategy for the synthesis of vicinal amino α-tertiary alcohols and provides a practicable alternative to the present benchmark procedures.

Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury stands as a significant contributor to cardiovascular disease.

40008897	Clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 neuraminidase has a long stalk, which is in contrast to most highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses circulating between 2002 and 2020.	Since 2020, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b have been rapidly spreading in wild birds but have also caused a large number of mammalian infections and more than 70 known human cases. Importantly, this H5N1 clade has also crossed the species barrier into dairy cattle in the US in late 2023/early 2024. The neuraminidase (NA) protein of the N1 subtype can feature truncations in its stalk domain, which have been identified as putative virulence factors in poultry but seem to have a negative impact on transmission in mammals. Since its emergence, the vast majority of HPAI H5N1 A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996-lineage isolates have featured this truncated version of the NA stalk domain. Here, we report that this changed with the 2020 expansion of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 and that the majority of isolates-including the strains circulating in dairy cattle-feature a long NA stalk domain.IMPORTANCEWhile the truncated version of the N1 neuraminidase stalk domain may be associated with increased virulence in poultry, the long version of the stalk domain has been associated with increased transmissibility in mammals. The vast majority of highly pathogenic H5N1 of clade 2.3.4.4b that is currently circulating globally features the long stalk version of the neuraminidase, which may increase the risk for these viruses to become human-to-human transmissible.
40008873	Use of gastrointestinal syndromic multiplex molecular assays and detection of <i>Escherichia coli</i> pathotypes in pediatric wards.	<i>Escherichia coli</i> pathotypes are enteric pathogens detected in gastrointestinal multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR), with controversial clinical relevance. Our study aimed to describe clinical features and therapeutic decisions associated with <i>E. coli</i> detections in gastrointestinal mPCR. Children with positive mPCR for enteroaggregative (EAEC)<i>,</i> enteropathogenic (EPEC)<i>,</i> enterotoxigenic (ETEC), Shiga toxin-producing <i>E. coli</i> (STEC), and enteroinvasive <i>E. coli</i> (EIEC)/<i>Shigella</i> identified in two pediatric hospitals over 18 months (2020-2021) were included. We described the frequency of <i>E. coli</i> detection and subsequent modifications in antibiotic strategies. Among the 2,471 mPCRs performed, 338 (14%) tested positive for at least one <i>E. coli</i> pathotype. The patient's mean age was 4.2 years, with 95% experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical presentation was generally comparable between <i>E. coli</i> pathotypes. A recent travel abroad was reported in 68/338 (20%) cases and was mainly observed in EIEC/<i>Shigella</i> infections. An <i>E. coli</i> was detected alone in 177/338 (52%) cases and with another virus, bacteria, or parasite in 161 (48%) cases. Multiple enteric pathogens were mainly detected with ETEC (<i>n</i> = 24/26, 92%) and EAEC (<i>n</i> = 82/121, 68%) detections. Antibiotic therapy was prescribed in 136/338 (40%) cases, with initiation based on mPCR results in 69/338 (20%). No antibiotic therapy was discontinued following positive mPCR results. Among the 69 initiations, 31 were deemed inappropriate after retrospective chart review. <i>E. coli</i> detection with mPCR tests may lead to inappropriate antibiotic initiation. Caution is advised when interpreting results from gastrointestinal mPCRs in children, as clinicians may be unaware of their often unclear or irrelevant clinical significance.IMPORTANCE<i>Escherichia coli</i> pathotypes are increasingly detected through the widely used syndromic gastrointestinal multiplex PCR panels. However, their clinical significance and impact on antibiotic therapy in children remain uncertain. This study describes the clinical and microbiological characteristics associated with <i>E. coli</i> detections, as well as the subsequent modifications in antibiotic strategies. It highlights the frequent detection of <i>E. coli</i> pathotypes, often in association with other enteric pathogens, and reveals that nearly half of the antibiotics prescribed following these results were deemed inappropriate. These results underscore the need to enhance clinicians' interpretation of <i>E. coli</i>-positive results and reassess treatment strategies to optimize patient care.
40008587	Adaptive Coordination Behavior of Bisphosphanylphosphanido-Ligands Toward Group 2, 11 and 12 Metal Ions.	A series of alkaline earth metal complexes (Mg-Ba) with the anionic ferrocenylene-bridged bisphosphanylphosphanide ligand [Fe(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>PC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>2</sub>P]<sup>-</sup> has been prepared by metalation of the corresponding bisphosphanylhydrophosphane (Fe(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>PC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PH). The resulting complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and SC-XRD. Furthermore, the closely related zinc phosphanide, and rare, mononuclear coinage metal phosphanides were synthesized and investigated for comparison. The range of coordination modes observed for the phosphanide ligand included mono-, bi-, and tridentate modi and their respective combinations, whereas no μ<sub>2</sub>-bridging of the phosphanide center has been observed. The value of the <sup>1</sup>J<sub>PP</sub> coupling constant was found to be a good probe to track the coordination motif consistent with the situation in solid state.
40008493	Simultaneous Construction of Axial and Central Stereogenicity by Cobalt-Catalyzed Stereoconvergent Reductive Coupling of Heterobiaryl Triflates and Aldehydes.	Catalytic stereoconvergent coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available chiral cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable simultaneous construction of axial and central stereogenicity through diastereo- and enantioselective dynamic kinetic transformations and introduction of a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl cores without the requirement of preforming stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents, affording densely functionalized secondary alcohols in up to 96 % yield, >98 : 2 dr and >99.5:0.5 er. Preliminary investigations on the application of the products demonstrate their potential for serving as a new class of chiral catalysts and ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that a dynamic kinetic stereoselective process induced by chiral cobalt catalysis is involved.
40000398	Twisted Amide-Mediated Synthesis and Rapid Structure-Activity Relationship Study of Medium-Sized Cyclic Peptides.	Medium-sized cyclic peptides are expected to be ideal drug leads because these peptides combine the advantages, while compensating for the disadvantages, of small molecules and antibodies. Although medium-sized peptides can be produced by chemical synthesis, two major problems, namely (i) Cα-epimerization during C-terminal modification and (ii) side reactions in the cyclization, remain to be solved. These issues have hampered the synthesis of pure materials for bioassays, making it difficult to accomplish accurate structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of medium-sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide-mediated amidation strategy. First, a variety of linear peptides were synthesized by the "inverse" peptide synthesis and fragment coupling. Second, the C-terminus of the linear peptides were converted to twisted amides, which were then reacted with a variety of α-amino acyl sulfonamides, realizing the rapid C-terminal diversification of peptides. Finally, the resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide-mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides. Using this strategy, total synthesis of acyl-surugamide A, the stereoselective synthesis of 13 non-natural analogs, and the discovery of potent antimicrobial/antifungal peptides beyond the natural product were also achieved.
40000232	Brain-Wide Impacts of Sedation on Spontaneous Activity and Auditory Processing in Larval Zebrafish.	Despite their widespread use, we have limited knowledge of the mechanisms by which sedatives mediate their effects on brain-wide networks. This is, in part, due to the technical challenge of observing activity across large populations of neurons in normal and sedated brains. In this study, we examined the effects of the sedative dexmedetomidine, and its antagonist atipamezole, on spontaneous brain dynamics and auditory processing in zebrafish larvae, a stage when sex differentiation has not yet occurred. Our brain-wide, cellular-resolution calcium imaging reveals the brain regions involved in these network-scale dynamics and the individual neurons that are affected within those regions. Further analysis reveals a variety of dynamic changes in the brain at baseline, including marked reductions in spontaneous activity, correlation, and variance. The reductions in activity and variance represent a "quieter" brain state during sedation, an effect inducing highly correlated evoked activity in the auditory system to stand out more than it does in unsedated brains. We also observe a reduction in the persistence of auditory information across the brain during sedation, suggesting that the removal of spontaneous activity leaves the core auditory pathway free of impingement from other nonauditory information. Finally, we describe a less dynamic brain-wide network during sedation, with a higher energy barrier and a lower probability of brain state transitions during sedation. Overall, our brain-wide, cellular-resolution analysis shows that sedation leads to a quieter, more stable, and less dynamic brain and, that against this background, responses across the auditory processing pathway become sharper and more prominent.
39999939	Kinsenoside alleviates experimental acute pancreatitis by suppressing M1 macrophage polarization via the TLR4/STAT1 signaling pathway.	Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease that can progress to systemic immune responses and multi-organ damage in its severe forms. Anoectochilus roxburghii (Wall.) Lindl. (AR), a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, and analgesic properties. Kinsenoside (KD), the primary bioactive glycoside in AR, is responsible for many of its therapeutic effects. Given its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, KD may have the potential to mitigate pancreatic inflammation in AP. However, its protective role in AP has not yet been investigated.
39999321	Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis Under Confinement.	Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potent means to conduct synthetic chemistry. Leveraging light to achieve challenging organic transformations has led to many developments, both of fundamental and industrial nature. Despite their potency, photoredox processes are inherently diffusion controlled, which can limit their ability to enable both reactivity and selectivity. Relevant to this is the idea of colocalizing cocatalysts in architectures that enable spatial proximity, promoting 'catalysis under confinement.' In this Concept review, we summarize recent designs and advancements using well-defined heterogeneous and homogeneous frameworks that enable dual photoredox catalysis, such as metal-organic frameworks, heterogeneous organic polymeric systems, and single-chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs). These advances generally stem from the material's inherent ability to enforce catalyst communication, typically resulting in expedient radical, electron, or energy transfer that accelerates reactivity. Whereas heterogeneous systems are comprehensively investigated, the design space arising from the modularity and versatility of a SCNP is quite large making the recyclable platform an intriguing candidate to investigate for confinement-enabled photoredox catalysis. We expect that both heterogeneous and homogeneous platforms systems detailed herein will continue to exhibit superior performance, while underscoring the importance of confinement to tackle diffusion-limited reactions.
39998273	Two different sulfotransferases modify sugars of the N-linked tetrasaccharide decorating <i>Halobacterium salinarum</i> glycoproteins.	Despite providing the first example of archaeal N-glycosylation almost 50 years ago, detailed insight into the pathway used by <i>Halobacterium salinarum</i> to assemble and attach an N-linked tetrasaccharide decorating glycoproteins in this haloarchaea has only recently appeared. Still, numerous components of this pathway remain to be identified, including sulfotransferase(s), which modify the third and fourth tetrasaccharide sugars. In the present report, a series of bioinformatics, genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches served to reveal how membrane-associated VNG1056C and soluble VNG1057C respectively sulfate the iduronic acid at tetrasaccharide position three and the terminal glucuronic acid, seemingly independent of each other. Deletion of <i>VNG1056C</i> but not of <i>VNG1057C</i> reduced cell motility to a minor degree and did not cause archaellum filament bundling. Finally, transcription of <i>VNG1056C</i> or <i>VNG1057C</i> was augmented upon deletion of the other when cells were grown in low but not high salinity conditions possibly in an attempt to compensate for the loss of sugar sulfation resulting from the deletion. This augmented transcription, however, had no effect on the extent of tetrasaccharide sulfation. With demonstrated roles in <i>Hbt. salinarum</i> N-glycosylation, VNG1056C and VNG1057C were respectively re-annotated as Agl30 and Agl31, employing the nomenclature used to define archaeal N-glycosylation pathway components.
39998268	Classical swine fever virus recruits ALIX and ESCRT-III to facilitate viral budding.	Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) incurs substantial economic losses in the global swine industry due to its persistent emergence and re-emergence across various countries. However, the precise mechanisms governing CSFV budding remain inadequately understood. Our study elucidates that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-associated protein ALIX, in conjunction with ESCRT-III, plays a pivotal role in orchestrating CSFV budding. Genomic sequence analysis identified a critical interaction between the YPXnL late domain on the E2 protein and ALIX. Through immunoprecipitation and structural domain deletion assays, we demonstrated that the ALIX Bro1 domain specifically recognized viral particles by binding to the YPXnL motif. Immunoelectron and transmission electron microscopy further confirmed that, upon infection, ALIX accumulated at the periphery of subcellular organelles, including COPII vesicles, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus, thereby facilitating CSFV budding. Our findings also revealed that ESCRT-III subunits CHMP2B, CHMP4B, CHMP7, and VPS4A interacted with ALIX to expedite CSFV budding. Notably, Rab8 activated by Kif4A contributed to the release of CSFV particles by interacting with ALIX and directing ALIX-containing vesicles along microtubules toward the cytosol. Our study demonstrates that ALIX specifically recognizes E2 and orchestrates the recruitment of ESCRT-III and Rab8 to facilitate the vesicular budding of CSFV particles from the Golgi apparatus to the cytosol. Ultimately, virus-laden vesicles propelled by Kif4A are transported along microtubules to the plasma membrane for release. Our findings offer the first comprehensive elucidation of the CSFV budding process and contribute to the identification of antiviral targets, thereby advancing the development of antiviral therapeutics.IMPORTANCEThe endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery plays a pivotal role in the sorting of membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells and regulating various stages of infection for numerous viruses. Previous studies have underscored the indispensable role of ESCRT in the cellular entry and replication of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). However, the precise mechanisms by which ESCRT recognizes CSFV particles and initiates viral vesicle budding have remained elusive. This study reveals that the Bro1 domain of ALIX initiates viral budding proximal to the Golgi apparatus by specifically recognizing the YPXnL late domain on the CSFV E2 protein. Mechanistically, ALIX and ESCRT-III facilitate Rab8-regulated endosomal transport of CSFV particles from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Subsequently, virions are propelled by the kinesin Kif4A along microtubules for egress into the extracellular space. In summary, these findings significantly advance our understanding of CSFV pathogenesis and offer valuable insights into the vesicular transport and budding mechanisms of CSFV particles.
39998267	Quorum sensing employs a dual regulatory mechanism to repress T3SS gene expression.	The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a needle-like complex used by numerous bacterial pathogens in host infection to inject exotoxins into the host cell cytoplasm. The T3SS is a known virulence factor in the shrimp pathogen <i>Vibrio campbellii</i>. The ~40 genes comprising the <i>V. campbellii</i> T3SS are regulated by a network of transcription factors in response to changes in the cell's environment: cell density (quorum sensing; QS), temperature, calcium, and host cell contact. Under positive environmental stimuli, the master T3SS transcription factor ExsA activates the expression of the four structural T3SS operons required for needle formation. Previous studies identified a key role of the master QS transcription factor LuxR: repression of <i>exsA</i> transcription via DNA binding at the <i>exsBA</i> promoter. Here, we uncovered a new regulatory role of LuxR: post-translational repression of ExsA activity via transcriptional repression of the gene encoding the anti-anti-activator ExsC. In <i>V. campbellii</i>, ExsC is a positive regulator of T3SS transcription; deletion of <i>exsC</i> decreases ExsA-dependent transcription activation of the T3SS structural promoters. Through genetic epistasis and <i>in vitro</i> biochemical assays, we show that LuxR directly binds the <i>exsC</i> promoter upstream of ExsA and represses transcription of <i>exsC</i>. Our findings collectively show that <i>V. campbellii</i> responds to high cell density signals to shut down ExsA-dependent expression of the T3SS via two mechanisms. We postulate that this dual regulatory mechanism by LuxR enables both the rapid inactivation of existing ExsA protein and blocks its further synthesis, leading to a rapid shutdown of T3SS activity at high cell density.
39998264	Essential genes encoded by the mating-type locus of the human fungal pathogen <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>.	Fungal sexual reproduction is controlled by the mating-type (<i>MAT</i>) locus. In contrast to a majority of species in the phylum Basidiomycota that have tetrapolar mating-type systems, the opportunistic human pathogen <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> employs a bipolar mating-type system, with two mating types (<b>a</b> and α) determined by a single <i>MAT</i> locus that is unusually large (~120 kb) and contains more than 20 genes. While several <i>MAT</i> genes are associated with mating and sexual development, others control conserved cellular processes (e.g., cargo transport and protein synthesis), of which five (<i>MYO2</i>, <i>PRT1</i>, <i>RPL22</i>, <i>RPL39</i>, and <i>RPO41</i>) have been hypothesized to be essential. In this study, through genetic analysis involving sporulation of heterozygous diploid deletion mutants, as well as in some cases construction and analyses of conditional expression alleles of these genes, we confirmed that with the exception of <i>MYO2</i>, both alleles of the other four <i>MAT</i> genes are indeed essential for cell viability. We further showed that while <i>MYO2</i> is not essential, its function is critical for infectious spore production, faithful cytokinesis, adaptation for growth at high temperature, and pathogenicity <i>in vivo</i>. Our results demonstrate the presence of essential genes in the <i>MAT</i> locus that are divergent between cells of opposite mating types. We discuss possible mechanisms to maintain functional alleles of these essential genes in a rapidly evolving genomic region in the context of fungal sexual reproduction and mating-type evolution.IMPORTANCESexual reproduction is essential for long-term evolutionary success. Fungal cell-type identity is governed by the <i>MAT</i> locus, which is typically rapidly evolving and highly divergent between different mating types. In this study, we show that the <b>a</b> and α alleles of four genes encoded in the <i>MAT</i> locus of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen <i>C. neoformans</i> are essential. We demonstrate that a fifth gene, <i>MYO2</i>, which had been predicted to be essential, is in fact dispensable for cell viability. However, a functional <i>MYO2</i> allele is important for cytokinesis and fungal pathogenicity. Our study highlights the need for careful genetic analyses in determining essential genes, which is complementary to high-throughput approaches. Additionally, the presence of essential genes in the <i>MAT</i> locus of <i>C. neoformans</i> provides insights into the function, maintenance, and evolution of these fast-evolving genomic regions.
39998252	HIV-1 Gag-protease-driven replicative capacity influences T-cell metabolism, cytokine induction, and viral cell-to-cell spread.	High replicative capacity (RC) HIV-1 strains are associated with elevated viral loads and faster disease progression in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Understanding the mechanisms by which high RC strains adversely affect the host is essential for developing novel anti-HIV interventions. This study investigates cellular metabolism, cytokine induction, and cell-to-cell spread as potential mechanisms differentiating clinical outcomes between low and high RC strains of HIV-1. We constructed chimeric viruses containing patient-derived <i>gag-proteases</i> from HIV-1 subtypes B and C in the NL4-3 backbone. Viral RC was determined using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter T-cell line assay and cytokine production in T-cells was assessed using Luminex. Virus cell-to-cell spread efficiency was measured through flow cytometry-based detection of p24, while nutrient uptake assays and mitotracker dye detection served as surrogate markers for T-cell metabolism and mitochondrial function. Chimeric subtype C viruses exhibited significantly lower RC compared to subtype B viruses (<i>P</i> = 0.0008). Cytokine profiling revealed distinct cytokine signatures associated with low RC subtype C viruses. Viral RC negatively correlated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-8, and IL-13 induction, while it positively correlated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-bb), IL-7, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-basic levels, viral spread efficiency (<i>P</i> = 0.008, <i>r</i> = 0.5), and cellular glucose uptake (<i>P</i> = 0.02, <i>r</i> = 0.5). Conversely, RC was negatively correlated with glutamine levels (<i>P</i> = 0.001, <i>r</i> = -0.7), indicating a link between RC and nutrient utilization. Furthermore, mitochondrial depolarization was elevated in subtype B infections when compared to subtype C infections (<i>P</i> = 0.0008). These findings indicate that high RC strains exert distinct cellular effects that may influence HIV-1 pathogenesis, highlighting the need to develop novel therapeutic strategies.IMPORTANCEVirus replicative capacity (RC) influences disease progression following HIV-1 transmission; however, the mechanisms underlying the differential clinical outcomes remain poorly understood. Our study reveals variations in cytokine induction and cellular metabolism in T-cells infected with HIV-1 subtype B and C viruses exhibiting high or low RC. T-cells infected with high RC strains showed increased induction of IL-7 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-bb), along with heightened glucose uptake and elevated glutamine consumption compared to those infected with low RC strains. By contrast, low RC strains induced higher levels of IL-8, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and demonstrated reduced efficiency in modulating cellular metabolism and virus cell-to-cell spreadability. These findings highlight distinct biological differences between high and low RC viruses, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms that may underpin varying clinical outcomes. This knowledge may inform the development of novel interventions aimed at limiting viral virulence or transmission.
39998238	Engineering of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with an HIV-specific synthetic notch receptor to secrete broadly therapeutic antibodies for combining antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses.	The application of immunotherapeutic strategies, such as chimeric antigen receptor-T cells and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is hindered by the latent reservoirs and viral escape. Achieving long-term control of viral load in the absence of antiretroviral therapy requires a combination approach utilizing these immunotherapeutic strategies. For this purpose, we developed novel anti-HIV-1 synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor-T cells, termed CD4-17b-VN, which express both a bNAb (VRC01) and a bispecific T cell-engaging protein (N6-αCD3) with antigenic control. The synNotch receptor-expressing cells can sense the viral antigen presented on both HIV-1 particles and the surface of target cells. A human T cell line equipped with the CD4-17b-VN circuit could effectively control VRC01 and N6-αCD3 secretion upon sensitization, suppress the infection of diverse subtypes of HIV-1 strains, and mediate specific bypass cytotoxic activity against infected and latency-reactivated cells. Additionally, CD4-17b-VN CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited long-lasting suppression of infected cells and stronger killing effect on latency-reactivated cells <i>in vitro</i>. Importantly, we demonstrated that the synNotch receptor did not increase susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in the engineered cells. Our study validates the concept of a synNotch platform-based T cell therapeutic approach that can deliver broadly therapeutic antibodies in an HIV-1 antigen-controlled manner, which may have important implications for the functional cure of AIDS.IMPORTANCEAdoptive transfer of effector T cells modified with a chimeric antigen receptor has been proposed as an applicable approach to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The synNotch receptor (SNR) system serves as a versatile tool, enabling customized programming of input and output functions in mammalian cells. Herein, we report a novel synNotch platform-based approach for T cell engineering targeting both cell-free particles and infected cells by coupling antibody neutralization with cytotoxicity. Our findings demonstrate that the engineered CD4-17b SNR enables controllable production of functional anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody and bispecific T cell-engaging protein upon recognition of the viral particle and cell surface antigens by the bifunctional synNotch-T cells. Human primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells equipped with the bifunctional synNotch circuit CD4-17b-VN can effectively suppress long-term viral replication and reduce latency-reactivated cells <i>in vitro</i>, without the undesired risk of being infected by the virus, suggesting their potential candidacy for AIDS therapy with prospects for future clinical applications.
39998230	<i>Aspergillus terreus</i> sectorization: a morphological phenomenon shedding light on amphotericin B resistance mechanism.	Prolonged cultivation of certain filamentous fungi, including <i>Aspergillus terreus</i>, on drug-free medium leads to degeneration and morphological heterogeneity, marked by the emergence of fluffy mycelium-type sectors. This phenomenon may indicate alterations in antifungal susceptibility profiles (particularly to amphotericin B (AmB) in <i>A. terreus</i>), as well as reductions or losses in conidiation, sexuality, secondary metabolite production, and/or virulence. In the present study, various characteristics of an AmB-resistant wild-type (WT) strain and its AmB-susceptible sectorized derivative (ATSec) were characterized. Compared to WT, ATSec exhibited increased susceptibility to AmB, reduced sporulation, and comparable sterol contents and virulence in <i>Galleria mellonella</i>. To elucidate the genes involved in AmB resistance, gene expression levels were compared between WT and ATSec with and without AmB treatment. The expression of P-type ATPase-related genes, which are implicated in membrane composition changes and consequently in AmB resistance, was significantly higher in the WT strain compared to ATSec. Moreover, the up-regulation of genes involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides-a diverse group of secondary metabolites-was higher in WT compared to ATSec, with a significant number of these genes also carrying at least one mutation. The findings of this study indicate that P-type ATPases may significantly be involved in AmB susceptibility and resistance observed in ATSec and WT strains. Additionally, mutations in polyketide synthase genes in ATSec may contribute to the phenotypic alterations associated with the sectorized phenotype.
39998229	HilD-regulated chemotaxis proteins contribute to <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium colonization in the gut.	In the enteric pathogen <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium, invasion and motility are coordinated by HilD, a master regulator that activates expression of genes encoding the type III secretion system 1 and some motility genes, including the chemotaxis gene <i>mcpC</i>. Previously, we have shown that McpC induces smooth swimming, which is important for type III secretion system 1-dependent invasion of epithelial cells. Here, we have studied another <i>Salmonella</i>-specific chemotaxis gene, <i>mcpA</i>, and demonstrate that it is also HilD regulated. Whereas HilD induction of <i>mcpC</i> occurs by direct derepression of H-NS, <i>mcpA</i> induction requires neither H-NS derepression nor the flagellar-specific sigma factor <i>fliA</i>; instead it occurs through a HilD-SprB regulatory cascade, providing experimental confirmation of previous transcriptional regulatory mapping. McpA and McpC contain methyl-accepting domains characteristic of bacterial chemoreceptors, and McpA also contains a chemoreceptor zinc-binding (CZB) protein domain found in a variety of bacterial proteins, many of which are involved in signaling or regulatory roles. Here, we show that, in a mouse model for acute <i>Salmonella</i> colitis, both <i>mcpA</i> and <i>mcpC</i> deletion mutants are outcompeted by wild-type <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium in the gut lumen. CZB domains bind Zn<sup>2+</sup> through a conserved cysteine residue and are thought to perform redox-sensing through redox-initiated alterations in zinc homeostasis. We found that the conserved cysteine is required for McpA function in the mouse gut, thus demonstrating a virulence role for the CZB Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding site during infection.
39998228	Fission yeast metabolome dynamics during phosphate starvation and replenishment.	Inorganic phosphate is an essential nutrient acquired by cells from their environment and assimilated into myriad intracellular metabolites and macromolecules. Here, we characterize the metabolic responses of fission yeast to a 24 h interval of phosphate starvation, during which cells enter a state of G0 quiescence. Time-resolved profiling revealed that many key phosphometabolites were progressively depleted, including (i) NTPs, NDPs, and dNTPs; (ii) coenzyme A, NAD<sup>+</sup>, NADP<sup>+</sup>, NADH, and ADP-ribose; (iii) glycolysis pathway intermediates upstream of pyruvate; (iv) pentose phosphate pathway intermediates from 6-phosphogluconate to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate; (v) nucleotide sugars GDP-hexose, UDP-glucose/galactose, and UDP-GalNAc/GlcNAc; and (vi) phospholipid precursors glycerol-3-phosphate, CDP-choline, and glycerophosphocholine. By contrast, early Krebs cycle intermediates accumulated during phosphate starvation. Other metabolic changes included the following: (i) interdiction of <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine synthesis; (ii) depletion of <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine and <i>S</i>-adenosylhomocysteine; (iii) transient accumulation of polyamine biosynthetic intermediates putrescine and 5-methylthioadenosine; (iv) accumulation of betaine (correlating with an increase in expression of <i>atd1</i> mRNA encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase); and (v) depletion of aminoadipate pathway intermediates 2-oxoadipate, 2-aminoadipate, and saccharopine. Replenishing phosphate after 24 h of starvation resulted in restoration of the pre-starvation metabolome (over 2 to 12 h) as cells exited quiescence and resumed growth.
39998227	LncRNA gm40262 promotes liver fibrosis and parasite growth through the gm40262-miR-193b-5p-TLR4/Col1α1 axis.	Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a severe and life-threatening parasitic disease caused by <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i>. Liver fibrosis is a significant pathological feature of advanced AE, characterized by the excessive production and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the precise underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that the long noncoding RNA gm40262, predominantly expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), is upregulated in AE. Interestingly, its knockdown leads to liver fibrosis resolution, accompanied by a substantial suppression of parasite growth. Gm40262 functions by targeting miR-193b-5p to activate HSCs and stimulate their proliferation in a TGF-β-dependent manner, thereby promoting ECM production by upregulating Col1α1. Moreover, gm40262 is also involved in inflammation through the gm40262-miR-193b-5p-TLR4 axis. Our findings suggest that gm40262 plays a pivotal role in parasite-induced liver fibrosis through multiple mechanisms, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for hepatic fibrosis.
39998226	SARS-CoV-2 infectivity can be modulated through bacterial grooming of the glycocalyx.	The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a site of replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and GI symptoms are often reported by patients. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends upon heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, which commensal bacteria that bathe the human mucosa are known to modify. To explore human gut HS-modifying bacterial abundances and how their presence may impact SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a task-based analysis of proteoglycan degradation on large-scale shotgun metagenomic data. We observed that gut bacteria with high predicted catabolic capacity for HS differ by age and sex, factors associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, and directly by disease severity during/after infection, but do not vary between subjects with COVID-19 comorbidities or by diet. Gut commensal bacterial HS-modifying enzymes reduce spike protein binding and infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bacterial grooming of the GI mucosa may impact viral susceptibility.IMPORTANCESevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, can infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and individuals who exhibit GI symptoms often have more severe disease. The GI tract's glycocalyx, a component of the mucosa covering the large intestine, plays a key role in viral entry by binding SARS-CoV-2's spike protein via heparan sulfate (HS). Here, using metabolic task analysis of multiple large microbiome sequencing data sets of the human gut microbiome, we identify a key commensal human intestinal bacteria capable of grooming glycocalyx HS and modulating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity <i>in vitro</i>. Moreover, we engineered the common probiotic <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) to effectively block SARS-CoV-2 binding and infection of human cell cultures. Understanding these microbial interactions could lead to better risk assessments and novel therapies targeting viral entry mechanisms.
39998225	A proteomic and functional view of intrabacterial lipid inclusion biogenesis in mycobacteria.	During infection and granuloma formation, pathogenic mycobacteria store triacylglycerol as intrabacterial lipid inclusions (ILIs). This accumulation of nutrients provides a carbon source for bacterial persistence and slows down intracellular metabolism. <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> (<i>Mab</i>), a rapidly growing non-tuberculous actinobacterium, produces ILI throughout its infection cycle. Here, <i>Mab</i> was used as a model organism to identify proteins associated with ILI accumulation on a global scale. By using the APEX2 proximity labeling method in an <i>in vitro</i> model for ILI accumulation, we identified 228 proteins possibly implicated in ILI biosynthesis. Fluorescence microscopy of strains overexpressing eight ILI-associated proteins (IAP) candidates fused to superfolder green fluorescent protein showed co-localization with ILI. Genetic inactivation of these potential IAP-encoding genes and subsequent lipid analysis emphasized the importance of MAB_3486 and MAB_4532c as key enzymes influencing triacylglycerol storage. This study underscores the dynamic process of ILI biogenesis and advances our understanding of lipid metabolism in pathogenic mycobacteria. Identifying major IAP in lipid accumulation offers new therapeutic perspectives to control the growth and persistence of pathogenic mycobacteria.
39998224	Natural compounds target the M23B zinc metallopeptidase Mpg to modulate <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> Type IV pilus expression.	<i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> uses the Type IV pilus (T4p) to colonize several sites within humans by adhering to host cells and tissues. Previously, we identified a periplasmic M23B zinc metallopeptidase, Mpg, that is necessary to protect from oxidative and nonoxidative killing and these phenotypes are mediated by Mpg activities on T4p expression. Here, we use a high-throughput, target-based screening approach to identify novel inhibitors of Mpg's enzymatic activity. We identified two natural compounds, punicalagin and chebulinic acid, which inhibit the peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing activity of Mpg in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, treatment of <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> with these compounds leads to a concomitant decrease in the number of T4p, similar to an <i>mpg</i> mutant. However, these compounds are not toxic to <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>. These compounds exhibit activity against Mpg orthologs from other bacterial species. Notably, these natural compounds inhibit <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> colonization and survival in cell culture models of infection. This work provides the characterization of two natural compounds with activity against <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> T4p through the Mpg M23B class zinc metallopeptidase.
39998223	Viral protease binds to nucleosomal DNA and cleaves nuclear cGAS that attenuates type I interferon.	Nuclear cyclic GMP-AMP synthetase (cGAS) binds to nucleosome with high affinity to prevent its activation by self-DNA. Upon stimulation with double-stranded DNA, cGAS is activated and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, guided by its N-terminal domain. However, it remains unclear whether viruses can hijack cGAS translocation and regulate its activation. Here, we discovered that the protease 3C of picornavirus Seneca Valley virus (SVV) translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon viral infection and binds to nuclear DNA. Protease 3C specifically cleaves histone H2A while leaving other histone proteins unaffected. Additionally, DNA binding enhances the protease 3C's ability to cleave nuclear cGAS, leading to its retention in the nucleus. This, in turn, suppresses the induction of type I interferon (IFN-I) following poly(dA:dT) stimulation. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which a viral protease binds nuclear DNA, cleaves nuclear cGAS and histone H2A, and thereby mislocalizes cGAS, facilitating immune evasion.
39998222	Blanking on blanks: few insect microbiota studies control for contaminants.	Research on insect-microbe relationships is booming, with DNA sequencing being the most commonly used method to describe insect microbiota. However, sequencing is vulnerable to contamination, especially when the sample has low microbial biomass. Such low-biomass samples are common across insect taxa, developmental stages, and tissue types. Identifying putative contaminants is essential to distinguish between true microbiota and introduced contaminant DNA. It is therefore important that studies control for contamination, but how often this is done is unknown. To investigate the status quo of contamination control, we undertook a systematic literature review to quantify the prevalence of negative control usage and contamination control across the literature on insect microbiota (specifically bacterial communities) over a 10 year period. Two-thirds of the 243 insect microbiota studies evaluated had not included blanks (negative controls), and only 13.6% of the studies sequenced these blanks and controlled for contamination in their samples. Our findings highlight a major lack of contamination control in the field of insect microbiota research. This result suggests that a number of microbes reported in the literature may be contaminants as opposed to insect-associated microbiota and that more rigorous contamination control is needed to improve research reliability, validity, and reproducibility. Based on our findings, we recommend the previously developed guidelines outlined in the RIDE checklist, with the addition of one more guideline. We refer to this as the RIDES checklist, which stands for Report methodology, Include negative controls, Determine the level of contamination, Explore contamination downstream, and State the amount of off-target amplification.IMPORTANCEOur systematic review reveals a major lack of methodological rigor within the field of research on insect-associated microbiota. The small percentage of studies that control for contamination suggests that an unknown but potentially considerable number of bacteria reported in the literature could be contaminants. The implication of this finding is that true microbiota may be masked or misrepresented, especially in insects with low microbial biomass.
39998221	The African swine fever virus gene MGF_360-4L inhibits interferon signaling by recruiting mitochondrial selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1 degrading MDA5 antagonizing innate immune responses.	Multigene family (MGF) 360 genes, which are African swine fever virus (ASFV) virulence genes, primarily target key host immune molecules to suppress host interferon (IFN) production and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) transcription, impairing host innate immune responses for efficient viral replication. However, the interactions between MGF 360 virulence genes and host molecules, as well as the mechanisms through which MGF 360 genes regulate host immune responses and IFN signaling, require further elucidation. In this study, we discovered that ASFV MGF_360-4L interacts with MDA5 and recruits the mitochondrial selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1 to degrade MDA5, thus impairing IFN signaling and compromising host innate immune responses. Furthermore, MGF_360-4L inhibits the interaction between MDA5 and MAVS, blocking ISG15-mediated ISGylation of MDA5. MGF_360-4L deficiency significantly attenuated virus-induced mitochondrial autophagy <i>in vitro</i>. Additionally, OAS1 ubiquitinates MGF_360-4L at residues K290, K295, and K327. Finally, a recombinant ASFV lacking the MGF_360-4L gene (ASFV-∆MGF_360-4L) was generated using ASFV-CN/SC/2019 as the backbone, which demonstrated that the replication kinetics of ASFV-∆MGF_360-4L in PAM cells were like those of the highly virulent parental ASFV-WT <i>in vitro</i>. Domestic pigs infected with ASFV-∆MGF_360-4L exhibited milder symptoms than those infected with parental ASFV-WT, and ASFV-∆MGF_360-4L-infected pigs presented with enhanced host innate antiviral immune response, confirming that the deletion of the MGF_360-4L gene from the ASFV genome highly attenuated virulence in pigs and provided effective protection against parental ASFV challenge. In conclusion, we identified a novel ASFV virulence gene, MGF_360-4L, further elucidating ASFV infection mechanisms and providing a new candidate for vaccine development.IMPORTANCEAfrican swine fever virus (ASFV) infection causes acute death in pigs, and there is currently no effective vaccine available for prevention. Multigene family (MGF) virulence genes have been shown to be crucial for ASFV's ability to evade host innate immune responses. However, the functions of most MGF genes remain unknown, which poses significant challenges for the development of ASFV vaccines and antiviral drugs. In this study, we identified a virulence gene of ASFV, MGF_360-4L, that targets and recruits the selective autophagy receptor p62 to mediate the degradation of the dsRNA sensor MDA5, thereby blocking interferon signaling. Additionally, it inhibits the ISG15-mediated ISGylation activation of MDA5. ASFV lacking MGF_360-4L showed reduced virulence and provided protection in pigs. Our data identify a novel virulence gene and provide new insights for ASFV vaccine development.
39998220	A dual insect symbiont and plant pathogen improves insect host fitness under arginine limitation.	Some facultative bacterial symbionts are known to benefit insects, but nutritional advantages are rare among these non-obligate symbionts. Here, we demonstrate that the facultative symbiont <i>Candidatus Liberibacter psyllaurous</i> enhances the fitness of its psyllid insect host, <i>Bactericera cockerelli</i>, by providing nutritional benefits. <i>L. psyllaurous</i>, an unculturable pathogen of solanaceous crops, also establishes a close relationship with its insect vector, <i>B. cockerelli</i>, increasing in titer during insect development, vertically transmitting through eggs, and colonizing various tissues, including the bacteriome, which houses the obligate nutritional symbiont, <i>Carsonella. Carsonella</i> supplies essential amino acids to its insect host but has gaps in some of its essential amino acid pathways that the psyllid complements with its own genes, many of which have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria. Our findings reveal that <i>L. psyllaurous</i> increases psyllid fitness on plants by reducing developmental time and increasing adult weight. In addition, through metagenomic sequencing, we reveal that <i>L. psyllaurous</i> maintains complete pathways for synthesizing the essential amino acids arginine, lysine, and threonine, unlike the psyllid's other resident microbiota, <i>Carsonella,</i> and two co-occurring <i>Wolbachia</i> strains. RNA sequencing reveals the downregulation of a HGT collaborative psyllid gene (<i>ASL</i>), which indicates a reduced demand for arginine supplied by <i>Carsonella</i> when the psyllid is infected with <i>L. psyllaurous</i>. Notably, artificial diet assays show that <i>L. psyllaurous</i> enhances psyllid fitness on an arginine-deplete diet. These results corroborate the role of <i>L. psyllaurous</i> as a beneficial insect symbiont, contributing to the nutrition of its insect host.IMPORTANCEUnlike obligate symbionts that are permanently associated with their hosts, facultative symbionts rarely show direct nutritional contributions, especially under nutrient-limited conditions. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that <i>Candidatus Liberibacter psyllaurous</i>, a facultative symbiont and a plant pathogen, enhances the fitness of its <i>Bactericera cockerelli</i> host by supplying an essential nutrient arginine that is lacking in the plant sap diet. Our findings reveal how facultative symbionts can play a vital role in helping their insect hosts adapt to nutrient-limited environments. This work provides new insights into the dynamic interactions between insect hosts, their symbiotic microbes, and their shared ecological niches, broadening our understanding of symbiosis and its role in shaping adaptation and survival.
39998219	Amplicon sequencing and culture-dependent approaches reveal core bacterial endophytes aiding freezing stress tolerance in alpine Rosaceae plants.	Wild plants growing in alpine regions are associated with endophytic microbial communities that may support plant growth and survival under cold conditions. The structure and function of endophytic bacterial communities were characterized in flowers, leaves, and roots of three alpine Rosaceae plants in Alpine areas using a combined amplicon sequencing and culture-dependent approaches to determine the role of core taxa on plant freezing stress tolerance. Amplicon sequencing analysis revealed that plant tissue, collection site, and host plant are the main factors affecting the richness, diversity, and taxonomic structure of endophytic bacterial communities in alpine Rosaceae plants. Core endophytic bacterial taxa were identified as 31 amplicon sequence variants highly prevalent across all plant tissues. Psychrotolerant bacterial endophytes belonging to the core taxa of <i>Duganella</i>, <i>Erwinia</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, and <i>Rhizobium</i> genera mitigated freezing stress in strawberry plants, demonstrating the beneficial role of endophytic bacterial communities and their potential use for cold stress mitigation in agriculture.IMPORTANCEFreezing stress is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting fruit production in Rosaceae crops. Current strategies to reduce freezing damage include physical and chemical methods, which have several limitations in terms of costs, efficacy, feasibility, and environmental impacts. The use or manipulation of plant-associated microbial communities was proposed as a promising sustainable approach to alleviate cold stress in crops, but no information is available on the possible mitigation of freezing stress in Rosaceae plants. A combination of amplicon sequencing, culture-dependent, and plant bioassay approaches revealed the beneficial role of the endophytic bacterial communities in alpine Rosaceae plants. In particular, we showed that culturable psychrotolerant bacterial endophytes belonging to the core taxa of <i>Duganella</i>, <i>Erwinia</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, and <i>Rhizobium</i> genera can mitigate freezing stress on strawberry seedlings. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential use of psychrotolerant bacterial endophytes for the development of biostimulants for cold stress mitigation in agriculture.
39998218	<i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> resistance to human milk involves the acyl carrier protein AcpP.	<i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> is a common foodborne pathogen worldwide that is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality among infants in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). Human milk provides infants with an important source of nutrients and contains antimicrobial components for protection against infection. However, recent studies, including our own, have found significantly higher levels of <i>Campylobacter</i> in diarrheal stool samples collected from breastfed infants compared to non-breastfed infants in LMICs. We hypothesized that <i>C. jejuni</i> has unique strategies to resist the antimicrobial properties of human milk. Transcriptional profiling found human milk exposure induces genes associated with ribosomal function, iron acquisition, and amino acid utilization in <i>C. jejuni</i> strains 81-176 and 11168. However, unidentified proteinaceous components of human milk prevent bacterial growth. Evolving both <i>C. jejuni</i> isolates to survive in human milk resulted in mutations in genes encoding the acyl carrier protein (AcpP) and the major outer membrane porin (PorA). Introduction of the PorA/AcpP amino acid changes into the parental backgrounds followed by electron microscopy showed distinct membrane architectures, and the AcpP changes not only significantly improved growth in human milk, but also yielded cells surrounded with outer membrane vesicles. Analyses of the phospholipid and lipooligosaccharide (LOS) compositions suggest an imbalance in acyl chain distributions. For strain 11168, these changes protect both evolved and 11168∆<i>acpP</i><sup>G33R</sup> strains from bacteriophage infection and polymyxin killing. Taken together, this study provides insights into how <i>C. jejuni</i> may evolve to resist the bactericidal activity of human milk and flourish in the hostile environment of the gastrointestinal tract.
39998217	Inter-protomer opening cooperativity of envelope trimers positively correlates with HIV-1 entry stoichiometry.	HIV-1 entry to host cells is fulfilled by fusion, mediated by surface glycoprotein envelope (Env) trimers upon interaction with host receptors. The entry stoichiometry (T) defining the number of Env trimers required for fusion remains elusive. Stoichiometry was previously estimated using mathematical modeling of infectivity curves of pseudoviruses surface-decorated with heterotrimers containing wild-type and entry-deficient Env. Nevertheless, previous models rarely co-considered inter-protomer opening cooperativity (S, reflecting how CD4-induced conformational changes in one protomer affect the opening of adjacent protomers) and virion trimer number distributions, while experiments were limited to pseudoviruses. Here, we factored these two parameters into our models and included replication-competent virions. We provided simultaneous estimates of T and S under varying trimer number distributions and offered 2D stoichiometry maps for different Env strains. Our results depicted the interplay between viral infectivity and stoichiometry tuned by the number of trimers per virion. The estimates for all tested Env strains were prevalently higher (T ≥ 7 for BG505 or JR-FL, T ≥ 13 for NL4-3) than reported. A high degree of inter-protomer opening cooperativity was observed for the neutralization-sensitive NL4-3, while neutralization-resistant BG505 and JR-FL showed a low to intermediate degree. Entry stoichiometry and opening cooperativity were strikingly positive-correlated, implying tied inter-protomer and inter-Env cooperative interactions. Our findings provided an in-depth view of Env cooperativities during HIV-1 entry.IMPORTANCEThe sparsely distributed envelope (Env) trimers on the surface of HIV-1 work collaboratively to mediate viral entry into the host, the early step of infection. The number of interacting trimers with host receptors required for entry awaits elucidation. Here, we explored the cooperative interplay among and within Env trimers, shedding light on a previously overlooked dimension of HIV-1 entry. For the first time, we presented distributions of estimated parameters depicting the number of Env trimers and degrees of inter-protomer opening cooperativities using biologically relevant mathematic models combined with virion infectivity measurements. Our results demonstrated that the quantity of required functional trimers positively correlates with inter-protomer opening cooperativity, a feature conserved across various strains. Our findings underscore cooperative behavior as an inherent characteristic of Env dynamics during HIV-1 entry. These insights enhance our understanding of HIV-1 infection mechanisms and could inform strategies for developing effective inhibitors or neutralizing agents.
39998216	CsrA-mediated regulation of a virulence switch in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.	CsrA is an RNA binding protein that functions as a global regulator in bacteria. We demonstrate that, in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, CsrA acts as a positive regulator of the switch from virulent (VIR-O) to avirulent (AV-T) subpopulations. This regulation is mediated, in part, by CsrA interfering with Rho-dependent termination in the mRNA leader region of the <i>ABUW_1645</i> gene, encoding the primary TetR-type transcriptional regulator that drives cells from the VIR-O to the AV-T state. We demonstrate that CsrA directly binds to the <i>ABUW_1645</i> mRNA leader region and interferes with Rho binding. We identify three small RNAs (sRNAs) designated CsrB, CsrC, and CsrD that bind to CsrA and inhibit its activity. Individual overexpression of each sRNA greatly decreased the rate of VIR-O to AV-T switching. Individual deletions of each sRNA increased the frequency of VIR-O to AV-T switching, with loss of CsrB giving the highest increase at 2.4-fold. The expression of each sRNA was strongly dependent on the GacA response regulator and the expression of each sRNA was higher in VIR-O cells than in AV-T variants. This regulation provides a mechanism for the differential control of CsrA activity between VIR-O and AV-T variants.
39998215	A novel plasmid-encoded transposon-derived small RNA reveals the mechanism of sRNA-regulated bacterial persistence.	Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria are crucial for controlling various cellular functions and provide immediate response to the environmental stresses. Antibiotic persistence is a phenomenon that a small subpopulation of bacteria survives under the exposure of a lethal concentration of antibiotics, potentially leading to the development of drug resistance in bacteria. Here, we reported a novel transposon-derived sRNA called stnpA, which can modulate fosfomycin persistence of the bacteria. The stnpA sRNA located in the transposon with its own promoter is highly conserved among the prevalent multidrug resistance (MDR) plasmids in various pathogenic bacteria and expressed in response to the fosfomycin stress. It can directly bind to the ABC transporter, YadG, whereas this protein-RNA interaction modulated the export of fosfomycin and led to the enhancement of bacterial persistence. According to our knowledge, stnpA is the first identified transposon-derived sRNA, which controlled antibiotic persistence of bacteria, and our work demonstrated that nonresistance genes on MDR plasmids such as plasmid-encoded sRNA can provide additional survival advantages to the bacterial host against the antibiotics. In addition, the stnpA sRNA can be potentially utilized as the druggable target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome bacterial persistence.
39998214	A <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> effector regulates plant cell death by disrupting the homeostasis of the BPA1-ACD11 complex.	Effectors secreted by phytopathogenic bacteria can suppress ETI responses induced by avirulence effectors, thereby overcoming crop resistance. However, the detailed mechanisms remain largely unknown. We report that the effector RipD from <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> regulates plant cell death in a protein abundance-dependent manner. RipD targets <i>Arabidopsis</i> BPA1, which directly interacts with the key cell death negative regulator ACD11. RipD competes with ACD11 for binding to BPA1, leading to the selective degradation of BPA1 via autophagy, sparing ACD11. A lower dose of RipD promotes BPA1 degradation but leads to ACD11 accumulation, thereby inhibiting RipAA-induced cell death. Conversely, higher levels of RipD degrade both BPA1 and ACD11, resulting in autophagy-dependent cell death. Visualization of RipD delivery by <i>R. solanacearum</i> indicated that it reaches levels sufficient to promote ACD11 accumulation and inhibit cell death. Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which an effector inhibits ETI and, for the first time, highlights the critical role of protein abundance in its function.IMPORTANCE<i>R. solanacearum</i> infects major economic crops, notably tomato, potato, and tobacco, leading to substantial yield reductions and economic losses. This pathogen utilizes various type III effectors to suppress host resistance, often resulting in weakened or lost resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal a novel mechanism by which RipD targets the BPA1-ACD11 complex, which is involved in host immunity and cell death. RipD regulates ACD11 protein homeostasis in a dose-dependent manner by competitively binding and activating autophagy, thereby modulating plant cell death. Importantly, visualization analysis revealed that the amount of RipD secreted by <i>R. solanacearum</i> into host cells is sufficient to inhibit Avr effector-induced cell death. Our study highlights for the first time the critical role of effector dosage, deepening the understanding of how <i>R. solanacearum</i> suppresses host ETI-related cell death and providing guidance and resources for breeding bacterial wilt resistance.
39998213	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> OmpA hinders host autophagy via the CaMKK2-reliant AMPK-pathway.	Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) plays a vital role in the interactions between <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and host cells. Autophagy is a defense mechanism that hinders the intracellular replication of bacteria, thereby safeguarding cells against microbial infections. While it has been observed that <i>A. baumannii</i> triggers cellular autophagy, the precise role of its virulence protein OmpA in this process remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated the effects of <i>A. baumannii</i> OmpA (AbOmpA) on autophagy and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that AbOmpA exerted its autophagy-suppressive effect through inhibition of CaMKK2 phosphorylation. Compared to the wild-type strain, the <i>ompA</i>-deletion mutant strain displayed considerably enhanced autophagy induction, <i>via</i> the AMPK-ULK1 pathway. AbOmpA hindered starvation-induced autophagy, while <i>A. baumannii</i>-Omp33 (AbOmp33) and <i>Escherichia coli</i>-OmpA (EcOmpA) did not. Importantly, we confirmed that exogenous AbOmpA suppressed autophagy through the CaMKK2-AMPK-ULK1 pathway during <i>A. baumannii</i> infection. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for AbOmpA-mediated autophagy evasion, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of <i>A. baumannii</i> infection.IMPORTANCE<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a significant clinical pathogen notorious for causing infections in hospitals. Its outer membrane protein A acts as a virulence factor and helps the bacteria evade host defenses. Autophagy is a defense mechanism that hinders the intracellular replication of bacteria. While it has been observed that <i>A. baumannii</i> triggers cellular autophagy, the precise role of its AbOmpA in this process remains uncertain. Our studies demonstrate the AbOmpA of <i>A. baumannii</i> inhibits the cellular defense process, autophagy, through the CaMKK2-AMPK-ULK1 signaling cascade, thereby enhancing bacterial survival. This insight into how AbOmpA bypasses autophagy sheds light on <i>A. baumannii</i> infection's novel virulence strategy and suggests possible treatments.
39998212	Investigation of the <i>Cyanothece</i> nitrogenase cluster in <i>Synechocystis</i>: a blueprint for engineering nitrogen-fixing photoautotrophs.	The nitrogenase gene cluster of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria, such as <i>Cyanothece</i>, is frequently selected by nature for nitrogen-fixing partnerships with eukaryotic phototrophs. The essential cluster components that confer an advantage in such partnerships remain underexplored. To use this cluster for the development of synthetic, phototrophic nitrogen-fixing systems, a thorough and systematic analysis of its constituent genes is necessary. An initial effort to assess the possibility of engineering this cluster into non-diazotrophic phototrophs led to the generation of a <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 strain with significant nitrogenase activity. In the current study, a refactoring approach was taken to determine the dispensability of the non-structural genes in the cluster and define a minimal gene set for constructing a functional nitrogenase for phototrophs. Using a bottom-up strategy, the <i>nif</i> genes from <i>Cyanothece</i> 51142 were re-organized to form new operons. The genes were then seamlessly removed to determine their essentiality in the nitrogen fixation process. We demonstrate that besides the structural genes <i>nifHDK</i>, <i>nifBSUENPVZTXW</i>, as well as <i>hesAB</i>, are important for optimal nitrogenase function in a phototroph. We also show that optimal expression of these genes is crucial for efficient nitrogenase activity. Our findings provide a solid foundation for generating synthetic systems that will facilitate solar-powered conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen-rich compounds, a stride toward a greener world.IMPORTANCEIntegrating nitrogen fixation genes into various photosynthetic organisms is an exciting strategy for converting atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen-rich products in a green and energy-efficient way. In order to facilitate this process, it is essential that we understand the fundamentals of the functioning of a prokaryotic nitrogen-fixing machinery in a non-diazotrophic, photoautotrophic cell. This study examines a nitrogenase gene cluster that has been naturally selected on multiple occasions for a nitrogen-fixing partnership by eukaryotic photoautotrophs and provides a basic blueprint for designing a photosynthetic organism with nitrogen-fixing ability.
39998211	Mefloquine reduces the bacterial membrane fluidity of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and distorts the bacterial membrane when combined with polymyxin B.	<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is a high-priority organism for the development of new antibacterial treatments. We found that the antimalarial medication mefloquine (MFQ) permeabilized the bacterial cell membrane of <i>A. baumannii</i>, decreased membrane fluidity, and caused physical injury to the membrane. MFQ also maintained activity across different pH conditions (pH range: 5-8). Structure-activity relationship analysis using MFQ analogs demonstrated that piperidin-2-yl methanol is required for antibacterial activity. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the compromised morphological and membrane integrity in MFQ-treated cells. MFQ synergized with the membrane permeabilizers polymyxin B and colistin and the MFQ + polymyxin B combination killed bacterial cells more effectively than either treatment alone. MFQ + polymyxin B was effective against other gram-negative bacteria including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Bodipy-cadaverine displacement assays confirmed the active interaction of MFQ with other membrane lipid components, such as lipopolysaccharide, lipid A, lipoteichoic acids, and fatty acids. In all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, lipid interactions facilitated the permeation of MFQ into the simulated Gram-negative membrane. Additionally, positively charged nitrogen in the piperidine group of MFQ seems to enhance interactions with the negatively charged components of the bacterial membrane. MFQ + polymyxin B caused significantly greater curvature in the simulated membrane, indicating greater damage than standalone drug treatment. Finally, <i>in vivo</i> assays showed that MFQ + polymyxin B rescued <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae infected with <i>A. baumannii</i>. In conclusion, membrane-active agents such as MFQ may warrant further investigation as a potential components of gram-negative infection treatment, particularly in combination with polymyxin B.
39998210	Endogenous nitric oxide promotes <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> virulence by activating autophagy.	Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) is a small molecule that has been demonstrated to affect the physiology and survival of bacteria. The role of endogenous NO for <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> survival inside host cells remains unclear. Here, we show that the production of endogenous NO by bacterial nitrate reductase (NR) is affected by molybdopterin biosynthesis protein A (MoeA), which is essential for molybdenum cofactor synthesis in <i>S. aureus</i>. During the infection, the production of endogenous NO promotes <i>S. aureus</i> survival inside macrophages by initiating cellular autophagy. Mechanistically, bacterial endogenous NO can modify the host regulatory protein thioredoxin vis S-nitrosylation, subsequently triggering the phosphorylation of the JNK-Bcl-2 pathway and promoting the initiation of autophagy through the release of Beclin1. Moreover, we confirmed the critical role of MoeA in bacterial survival <i>in vivo</i> by using bloodstream infection, pneumonia, and skin abscess model on both wild-type and autophagy-deficient mice. Interestingly, we observed the significantly increased production of NO and activation of cellular autophagy of sequence type (ST)5 compared with ST239, suggesting that the initiation of autophagy is involved in the clone shift of <i>S. aureus</i>. Our data offered new insights on the role of bacterial endogenous NO in regulating the host signal pathway during infection inside host cells.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the mechanism underlying <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> pathogenesis is essential for developing innovative strategies for the prevention and treatment of infection. In this study, we underscore the critical role of molybdopterin biosynthesis protein A and nitric oxide (NO) in inducing autophagy during <i>S. aureus</i> survival within macrophage and <i>in vivo</i> infection. We demonstrate that host regulatory protein can be modified by bacterial metabolites, which may influence cellular processes. Furthermore, our findings indicated that increased endogenous NO production may contribute to the stable prevalence of <i>S. aureus</i> ST5 in the healthcare-associated environment. These findings highlight the significance of bacterial metabolism in modulating the host immune system, thereby facilitating <i>S. aureus</i> survival and persistence.
39998209	Heparanase, a host gene that potently restricts retrovirus transcription.	Heparanase (HPSE) is a heterodimeric β-D-glucuronidase that is critical in mammalian cells for the enzymatic cleavage of membrane-associated heparan sulfate moieties. Apart from its enzymatic function, HPSE has important non-enzymatic functions, which include transcriptional regulation, chromatin modification, and modulation of various signaling pathways. Interestingly, while <i>HPSE</i> is an interferon-stimulated gene, past reports have shown that it has proviral properties for many different viruses, including herpes simplex virus 1, as it assists virus release from infected cells. However, as of yet, no antiviral functions associated with HPSE have been described. Here, we show that HPSE utilizes a hitherto unknown mechanism to restrict retroviruses by targeting the step of proviral transcription. Moreover, we demonstrate that HPSE blocks transcription initiation by targeting the SP1 transcription factor. Finally, we illustrate that the antiretroviral effect of HPSE is independent of its enzymatic activity. This report describes a novel antiviral mechanism utilized by HPSE to inhibit retrovirus infection.IMPORTANCEHeparanase (HPSE) has emerged as an important factor that has proviral functions for a number of viruses, including herpes simplex virus and hepatitis C virus, by assisting in virus egress. However, HPSE is an interferon-stimulated gene and, thus, is a part of the host antiviral defense. Nothing is known about the antiviral functions of HPSE. Here, we examine in depth the role of HPSE during retrovirus infection using two retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and murine leukemia virus. In this report, we show that mouse, but not human, HPSE blocks retrovirus infection by targeting provirus transcription. HPSE sequesters the SP1 transcription factor away from the proviral promoter, thereby inhibiting transcription initiation. In conclusion, our findings identify a novel antiviral function of HPSE and its potential role as an inhibitor of zoonotic transmission of retroviruses.
39998208	The HOPS and vCLAMP protein Vam6 connects polyphosphate with mitochondrial function and oxidative stress resistance in <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>.	<i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is considered one of the most dangerous fungal threats to human health, and the World Health Organization recently ranked it in the critical priority group for perceived public health importance. Proliferation of <i>C. neoformans</i> within mammalian hosts is supported by its ability to overcome nutritional limitations and endure stress conditions induced by the host immune response. Previously, we reported that the Vam6/Vps39/TRAP1-domain protein Vam6 was crucial for vacuolar morphology, iron acquisition, and virulence. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic phenotypes resulting from loss of Vam6 remain poorly understood. In this study, we determined that Vam6 has roles in the HOPS complex for endomembrane trafficking to the vacuole and in the vCLAMP membrane contact site between the vacuole and mitochondria. Importantly, both of these roles regulate polyphosphate (polyP) metabolism, as demonstrated by a defect in trafficking of the VTC complex subunit Vtc2 for polyphosphate synthesis and by an influence on mitochondrial functions. In the latter case, Vam6 was required for polyP accumulation in response to electron transport chain inhibition and for overcoming oxidative stress. Overall, this work establishes connections between endomembrane trafficking, mitochondrial functions, and polyP homeostasis in <i>C. neoformans</i>.IMPORTANCEA detailed understanding of stress resistance by fungal pathogens of humans may provide new opportunities to improve antifungal therapy and combat life-threatening diseases. Here, we used a <i>vam6</i> deletion mutant to investigate the role of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex in mitochondrial functions and polyphosphate homeostasis in <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, an important fungal pathogen of immunocompromised people including those suffering from HIV/AIDS. Specifically, we made use of mutants defective in late endocytic trafficking steps to establish connections to oxidative stress and membrane trafficking with mitochondria. In particular, we found that mutants lacking the Vam6 protein had altered mitochondrial function, and that the mutants were perturbed for additional mitochondria and vacuole-related phenotypes (e.g., membrane composition, polyphosphate accumulation, and drug sensitivity). Overall, our study establishes connections between endomembrane trafficking components, mitochondrial functions, and polyphosphate homeostasis in an important fungal pathogen of humans.
39998207	Mono- and multidomain defense toxins of the RelE/ParE superfamily.	Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules are widely distributed across prokaryotes, often existing in large numbers despite their associated fitness costs. Most type II TA modules are bicistronic operons encoding a monodomain toxin and its cognate protein antitoxin. The RelE/ParE superfamily encompasses toxins with a conserved Barnase-EndoU-ColicinE5/D-RelE (BECR) fold. Yet, their cellular targets differ remarkably: RelE toxins function as ribosome-dependent RNases, while ParE toxins act as DNA gyrase inhibitors. Using a comprehensive bioinformatics approach, this study analyzed 13 BECR-fold toxin families as classified in the Pfam database. Intriguingly, the ParE family was found to include a subcluster of mRNA-cleaving toxins, challenging its conventional role as solely DNA-targeting. This study identified a novel tripartite operon encoding a PtuA-like defense ATPase, a homolog of type IV restriction endonucleases, and a RelE homolog, suggesting a coordinated role in defense mechanisms. Multidomain BECR-fold toxins, including transmembrane variants, were also discovered, extending the functional repertoire of type II TA modules to membrane-associated systems. These findings clarify the evolutionary relationships and functional diversity within the RelE/ParE superfamily and discover novel, putative defense systems that can now be investigated experimentally.IMPORTANCEToxin-antitoxin modules play critical roles in prokaryotic survival and adaptation, contributing to genome stabilization and defense against phages and invading plasmids. The RelE/ParE superfamily exemplifies the structural and functional diversity of these systems, with members targeting distinct cellular processes, such as translation and DNA supercoiling. By elucidating the relationships among the 13 BECR-fold toxin families, this study enhances our understanding of microbial resistance mechanisms and reveals potential new opportunities for research into prokaryotic defense and regulation. These insights may have significant implications for medical and biotechnological applications, particularly in understanding bacterial responses to genetic invaders.
39998206	Dual function of <i>Candida auris</i> mannosyltransferase, MNT5, in biofilm community protection from antifungal therapy and the host.	Screen of mutants from a mannosyltransferase family identified the importance of <i>MNT5</i> for <i>C. auris</i> biofilm drug resistance and neutrophil evasion. Biochemical analysis of the <i>mnt5∆</i> mutant matrix and cell wall identified alterations in the mannan structures. Resistance and matrix for <i>mnt5∆</i> were restored with delivery of wild-type matrix via extracellular vesicles. Analysis of the <i>mnt5</i>∆ cell wall revealed a reduction in mannan and compensatory increase in cell surface glucan and chitin, suggesting a role for <i>MNT5</i> in mannan masking of pathogen-associated molecular patterns.
39998205	Carbon source, cell density, and the microbial community control inhibition of <i>V. cholerae</i> surface colonization by environmental nitrate.	The intestinal diarrheal pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> colonizes the host terminal ileum, a microaerophilic, glucose-poor, nitrate-rich environment. In this environment, <i>V. cholerae</i> respires nitrate and increases transport and utilization of alternative carbon sources via the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), a transcription factor that is active during glucose scarcity. Here, we show that <i>V. cholerae</i> nitrate respiration in aerated cultures is under control of CRP and, therefore, glucose availability. <i>V. cholerae</i> nitrate respiration results in extracellular accumulation of nitrite because <i>V. cholerae</i> does not possess the machinery for nitrite reduction. This nitrite inhibits <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilm formation via an as-yet unelucidated mechanism that depends on the high cell density master regulator HapR. The genome of <i>Paracoccus aminovorans</i>, an intestinal microbe identified in the microbiome of cholera patients that has been shown to enhance <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilm accumulation in the neonatal mouse gut, encodes enzymes that reduce nitrite to nitrogen gas. We report that, in nitrate-supplemented co-cultures, <i>P. aminovorans</i> metabolizes the nitrite generated by <i>V. cholerae</i> and, thereby, enhances <i>V. cholerae</i> surface accumulation. We propose that <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilm formation in the host intestine is limited by nitrite production but can be rescued by intestinal microbes such as <i>P. aminovorans</i> that have the capacity to metabolize nitrite. Such microbes increase <i>V. cholerae</i> colonization of the host ileum and predispose to symptomatic infection.IMPORTANCE<i>Vibrio cholerae</i> colonizes the terminal ileum where both oxygen and nitrate are available as terminal electron acceptors. <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilm formation is inhibited by nitrate due to its conversion to nitrite during <i>V. cholerae</i> respiration. When co-cultured with a microbe that can further reduce nitrite, <i>V. cholerae</i> surface accumulation in the presence of nitrate is rescued. The contribution of biofilm formation to ileal colonization depends on the composition of the microbiota. We propose that the intestinal microbiota predisposes mammalian hosts to cholera by consuming the nitrite generated by <i>V. cholerae</i> in the terminal ileum. Differences in the intestinal abundance of nitrite-reducing microbes may partially explain the differential susceptibility of humans to cholera and the resistance of non-human mammalian models to intestinal colonization with <i>V. cholerae</i>.
39998204	Deployment of a <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> ordered transposon mutant library in a quorum-competent genetic background.	<i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, the causative agent of cholera, has sparked seven pandemics in recent centuries, with the current one being the most prolonged. <i>V. cholerae's</i> pathogenesis hinges on its ability to switch between low- and high-cell-density gene regulatory states, enabling transmission between the host and the environment. Previously, a transposon mutant library for <i>V. cholerae</i> was created to support investigations aimed toward uncovering the genetic determinants of its pathogenesis. However, subsequent sequencing uncovered a mutation in the gene <i>luxO</i> of the parent strain, rendering mutants unable to exhibit high-cell-density behaviors. In this study, we used chitin-independent natural transformation to move transposon insertions from these low-cell-density mutants into a wild-type genomic background. Library transfer was aided by a novel gDNA extraction method we developed using thymol, which also showed high lysis specificity for <i>Vibrio</i>. The resulting Grant Library comprises 3,102 unique transposon mutants, covering 79.8% of <i>V. cholerae's</i> open reading frames. Whole-genome sequencing of randomly selected mutants demonstrates 100% precision in transposon transfer to cognate genomic positions of the recipient strain in every strain analyzed. Notably, in no instance did the <i>luxO</i> mutation transfer into the wild-type background. Our research uncovered density-dependent epistasis in growth on inosine, an immunomodulatory metabolite secreted by gut bacteria that is implicated in enhancing gut barrier functions. Additionally, Grant Library mutants retain the plasmid that enables rapid, scarless genomic editing. In summary, the Grant Library reintroduces organismal-relevant genetic contexts absent in the low-cell-density-locked library equivalent.Ordered transposon mutant libraries are essential tools for catalyzing research by providing access to null mutants of all non-essential genes. Such a library was previously generated for <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, but whole-genome sequencing revealed that this library was made using a parent strain that is unable to exhibit cell-cell communication known as quorum sensing. Here, we utilize natural competence combined with a novel, high-throughput genomic DNA extraction method to regenerate the signaling incompetent <i>V. cholerae</i> ordered transposon mutant library in quorum-sensing-competent strain. Our library provides researchers with a powerful tool to understand <i>V. cholerae</i> biology within a genetic context that influences how it transitions from an environmentally benign organism to a disease-causing pathogen.
39998203	Passage-attenuated Powassan virus LI9P protects mice from lethal LI9 challenge and links envelope residue D308 to neurovirulence.	Powassan virus (POWV) is an emergent tick-borne flavivirus that causes lethal encephalitic disease and chronic neurologic deficits in surviving patients. POWV-LI9 is a tick-derived isolate that causes neurovirulent disease and age-dependent lethality in mice. Serial passage of VeroE6 cells infected with LI9 resulted in eight amino acid changes in a POWV strain LI9P. LI9P fails to cause neurological sequelae, or lethality in C57BL/6 mice yet elicits neutralizing POWV antibody responses and protects mice from lethal LI9 challenge. Analysis revealed that LI9, but not LI9P, is present at high levels in the CNS, suggesting that LI9P is restricted from neuroinvasion or CNS replication. LI9 and LI9P are distinguished by a D308N envelope change within a domain associated with cell attachment. We evaluated the roles of Env-Domain III residue changes in LI9 virulence and LI9P attenuation using recombinant POWVs (recPOWVs) generated by reverse genetics. Remarkably, mutating D308N in LI9 completely abolished viral lethality and neuroinvasion in 50-week-old mice, reflecting the avirulent phenotype of LI9P. Analysis of the reciprocal N308D change in LI9P only partially restored neuroinvasion and lethality to the LI9P-N308D mutant, indicating that further LI9P residue changes contribute to LI9P attenuation. Consistent with differences in neuroinvasion, we found that rapid LI9P RNA synthesis and corresponding early IFN induction may contribute to LI9P clearance. Collectively, these findings define D308 as a determinant of POWV neuroinvasion and lethality, suggest potential mechanisms for restricted LI9P CNS entry, and reveal passage-attenuated LI9P as a candidate POWV vaccine platform.
39998180	Nutrition-induced changes in the microbiota can cause dysbiosis and disease development.	Eukaryotic organisms are associated with complex microbial communities. Changes within these communities have been implicated in disease development. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of disease. Here, we report a causal link between environment-induced shifts in the microbiota and disease development. Using the model organism <i>Hydra</i>, we observed changes in microbial composition when transferring laboratory-grown <i>Hydra</i> to natural lake environments. These shifts were caused not only by new colonizers, through the process of community coalescence (merging of previously separate microbial communities), but also by lake water nutrients. Moreover, selective manipulation of the nutrient environment induced compound-specific shifts in the microbiota followed by disease development. Finally, L-arginine supplementation alone caused a transition in <i>Pseudomonas</i> from symbiotic to pathogenic, leading to an upregulation of immune response genes, tissue degradation, and host death. These findings challenge the notion that the host-associated microbiota is exclusively controlled by the host, highlighting the dynamic interplay between host epithelial environment, microbial colonizer pool, and nutrient conditions of the surrounding water. Furthermore, our results show that overfeeding of the microbiota allows for uncontrolled microbial growth and versatile interactions with the host. Environmental conditions may thus render symbionts a potential hazard to their hosts, blurring the divide between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes.IMPORTANCEThis study highlights the critical need to understand the dynamic interplay between host-associated microbiota and environmental factors to obtain a holistic view on organismal health. Our results demonstrate that ecosystem-wide microbial trafficking (community coalescence) and environmental nutrient conditions reshape microbial communities with profound implications for host health. By exploring nutrient-driven changes in microbial composition, our research finds experimental support for the "overfeeding hypothesis," which states that overfeeding alters the functionality of the host microbiota such that an overabundance in nutrients can facilitate disease development, transforming non-pathogenic microbes into pathogens. These findings emphasize the critical role of metabolic interactions driving microbial pathogenicity. Furthermore, our research provides empirical evidence for the "pathogenic potential" concept, challenging traditional distinctions between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes and supporting the idea that any microbe can become pathogenic under certain conditions.
39998178	Reduced prevalence of phage defense systems in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strains from cystic fibrosis patients.	Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects mucus clearance, particularly of the lungs. As a result, cystic fibrosis patients often experience infections from bacteria, which contribute to the disease progression. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is one of the most common opportunistic pathogens associated with cystic fibrosis. The presence of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> complicates the treatment due to its high antibiotic resistance. Thus, research is ongoing to treat these infections with bacterial viruses instead, known as bacteriophages. Notably, <i>P. aeruginosa</i> clinical strains possess a variety of phage defense mechanisms that may limit the effectiveness of phage therapy. In this study, we compared the defense system repertoire of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients with those from non-cystic fibrosis patients. Our findings reveal that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients have fewer phage defense mechanisms per strain than from non-cystic fibrosis patients, suggesting altered phage selection pressures in strains colonizing CF patient lungs.IMPORTANCECystic fibrosis patients often experience chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> lung infections, which are challenging to treat with antibiotics and contribute to disease progression and eventual respiratory failure. Phage therapy is being explored as an alternative treatment strategy for these infections. However, assessing strain susceptibility to phage treatment is essential for ensuring efficacy. To address this, we investigated whether CF-associated clinical <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains have a distinct phage defense repertoire compared with those isolated from other lung patients. We observed that CF-associated <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strains have significantly fewer phage defenses, possibly affecting the susceptibility of these strains to phage infection.
39998177	Pyruvate kinase directly generates GTP in glycolysis, supporting growth and contributing to guanosine toxicity.	Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is essential for macromolecular biosynthesis, and its intracellular levels are tightly regulated in bacteria. Loss of the alarmone (p)ppGpp disrupts GTP regulation in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, causing cell death in the presence of exogenous guanosine and underscoring the critical importance of GTP homeostasis. To investigate the basis of guanosine toxicity, we performed a genetic selection for spontaneous mutations that suppress this effect, uncovering an unexpected link between GTP synthesis and glycolysis. In particular, we identified suppressor mutations in <i>pyk</i>, which encodes pyruvate kinase, a glycolytic enzyme. Metabolomic analysis revealed that inactivating pyruvate kinase prevents guanosine toxicity by reducing GTP levels. Although traditionally associated with ATP generation via substrate-level phosphorylation, <i>B. subtilis</i> pyruvate kinase <i>in vitro</i> was found to produce GTP and UTP approximately 10 and three times more efficiently than ATP, respectively. This efficient GTP/UTP synthesis extends to <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, challenging the conventional understanding of pyruvate kinase's primary role in ATP production. These findings support a model in which glycolysis directly contributes to GTP synthesis, fueling energy-demanding processes, such as protein translation. Finally, we observed a synergistic essentiality of the Δ<i>ndk</i> Δ<i>pyk</i> double mutant specifically on glucose, indicating that pyruvate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase are the major contributors to nucleoside triphosphate production and complement each other during glycolysis. Our work highlights the critical role of nucleotide selectivity in pyruvate kinase and its broader implications in cellular physiology.
39998174	Toward the consensus of definitions for the phenomena of antifungal tolerance and persistence in filamentous fungi.	Antifungal drug tolerance and persistence are being increasingly recognized in fungal pathogens. Accordingly, more and more research is being carried out to characterize and understand these phenomena. However, the terminology and methodology employed in the fungal community lack consensus, particularly for filamentous fungi, as they present further complexities when compared to single-celled microorganisms. Hence, with the aim to ensure consistency in the literature, in this Perspective article, we propose tailored definitions for tolerance and persistence in filamentous fungi and suggest methods to detect and investigate these phenomena in the laboratory.
39998162	Low-dose interleukin 2 therapy halts the progression of post-streptococcal autoimmune complications in a rat model of rheumatic heart disease.	Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an autoimmune disease triggered by antibodies and T cells targeting the group A <i>Streptococcus</i> (GAS, Strep A) bacterium, often leading to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and Sydenham's chorea. Long-term monthly penicillin injections are recognized as a cornerstone of public health programs to prevent Strep A reinfection and progression of ARF. However, compliance is poor, and better tools are required to slow disease progression. Preclinical evidence suggests that this can be achieved. Using a rat model that replicates post-streptococcal autoimmune complications, we explored the potential of low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) as an immunotherapeutic intervention for ARF/RHD. In this model, injections of recombinant M protein from Strep A type 5 (rM5) to Lewis rats induce cardiac tissue inflammation, conduction abnormalities, and cross-reactive antibodies against cardiac and brain proteins central to disease pathogenesis. In animals injected with rM5 and treated with LD-IL-2, no cardiac functional or histological changes was observed. LD-IL-2 therapy effectively reduced the production of cross-reactive antibodies raised against host proteins and significantly increased regulatory T cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes. These novel findings suggest that LD-IL-2 will be an effective immunotherapeutic agent for treating ARF and has the potential to replace the standard monthly penicillin injections.
39996614	4-Exo-Trig Radical Cyclization: A Promising Approach to Four-Membered Rings.	The 4-exo-trig radical cyclization represents a formidable challenge owing to the unfavorable thermodynamics associated with the formation of highly strained four-membered rings. Stimulated by the explosive advancements of radical chemistry over the past decades, significant progresses have been made in this area, including the SmI<sub>2</sub>-mediated 4-exo-trig carbonyl-alkene cyclization, n-Bu<sub>3</sub>SnH-mediated 4-exo cyclization of functionalized alkenes or alkynes, transition metal-catalyzed 4-exo-trig ring closures, and visible light-induced 4-exo-trig cyclization cascade, providing efficient protocols to overcome the inherent limitations and expand the synthetic utility of this methodology. Representative examples, reaction mechanism, scope and limitations, and synthetic applications are presented and discussed in detail. We believe that the systematic review of recent advances on 4-exo-trig radical cyclization will provide more insights in this field, and may enable further development of this cyclization process for the concise synthesis of four-membered carbo- and heterocycles that are difficult to access via traditional methods.
39996376	Sulfide Synthesis via A Bioinspired C-S σ-Bond Metathesis.	In this manuscript, inspired by the natural S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised a mixed σ-bond metathesis between the (sp<sup>3</sup>)C-S bond of organic sulfides with the C-O bond of alcohols. This reaction is mediated by a readily available and operationally facile mixture of AlCl<sub>3</sub> and ZnI<sub>2</sub>, which allows fast access to various challenging organic sulfides by directly editing the (sp<sup>3</sup>)C-S bond of easily available ones. Like multiple bond metathesis, this method could also be rendered intramolecular and extended to ether (sp<sup>3</sup>)C-O bond metathesis as well as amine (sp<sup>3</sup>)C-N bond metathesis to provide saturated heterocycles such as cyclic thioethers, cyclic ethers, as well as cyclic amines. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle. We anticipate this bioinspired design of C-S/C-O metathesis will infuse the area of a σ-bond metathesis with more insights and provide opportunities for further advances in areas that have been facilitated by traditional C-X bond forming reactions.
39995241	Skeletal Editing of Isoindolines to Tetralins.	We present a skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins via a cascade N-atom removal deconstruction followed by a Diels-Alder reaction between in situ generated o-quinodimethanes and activated alkenes. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent stereoselectivity, and high yields, demonstrating its applicability to complex bioactive compounds and natural products. Notably, case studies showcase the efficient construction of challenging spirocyclic and bridged systems, underscoring the method's versatility and potential for advancing applications in synthetic chemistry.
39995115	Confined Structural Water Molecules as Alternative Potential Emitters for Bright Photoluminescence of Thiolate-Gold Complexes.	The debate about water as an emitter has spanned nearly a century, but how it emits bright colors remains elusive. In this report, using the widely used Au(I)-alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)-SRs, R=-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>12</sub>H) with AIE properties as a model system, by carefully manipulating the delicate surface-ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigation and an isotopic diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D<sub>2</sub>O), we demonstrated that the structural water molecules (SWs) trapped in the nanoscale interface or space are the true emission centers of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and the aggregates of Au(I)-SRs complexes, instead of a well-organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Unlike conventional hydrogen-bonded water molecules, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the p-orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form strong electronic interactions through spatial overlap, thus constructing a set of interfacial states, one of which is characterized by π-bonding, thus providing alternative channels (or paths) for the relaxation decay of the excited electrons. Using the one-dimensional free-electron gas model, the energy levels calculated by the Schrödinger equation are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, further validating the SWs model.
39993971	Development of Diverse Ligands and Catalysts Derived from Axially Chiral Cyclic Biphenyldiols.	The development of suitable chiral ligands and catalysts is a key factor in asymmetric organic synthesis. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols, and four representative examples were performed well including enantioselective alkynylation of benzo[e][1,2,3]oxathiazine 2,2-dioxide under catalysis of (R)-cyclic [1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-diol/ZnMe<sub>2</sub>, palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4-phenyl-4-vinyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one with 2-arylidenemalononitriles in the presence of axially chiral cyclic phosphoramidite ligand, and axially chiral cyclic phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric Diels-Alder cycloaddition of styryl-1H-indole with cyclic 2,4-dienones and asymmetric Michael addition of indolizine to cyclopentenediones. The experiments showed that variation of 2,2'-substituent groups could provide different kinds of axially chiral cyclic ligands and catalysts, variation of steric and electronic properties (by changing substituent groups at the 3,3',5,5'-positions) and dihedral angles (by changing ring sizes at 6,6'-positions) could greatly change catalytic efficiency of ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols. The high reactivity and stereoselectivity of the reactions were effectively achieved through the precise regulation of multi-sites on our axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols.
39993963	A Luminescent Stable Triarylmethyl Diradical with an Axially Chiral Spacer.	Two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged using a chiral octahydrobinaphthyl moiety, resulting in a diradical with sufficient stability to enable the measurement of its chiroptical properties. To synthesize this diradical, a novel boronic ester radical precursor, αH-PyBTM-B(Epin), was designed. The use of this precursor significantly improved the yield and streamlined the preparation of stable luminescent radical-substituted molecules. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diradical was measured to be 10 % in chloroform. Furthermore, both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were successfully observed.
39993955	Methods for Theoretical Treatment of Local Fields in Proteins and Enzymes.	Electric fields generated by protein scaffolds are crucial in enzymatic catalysis. This review surveys theoretical approaches for detecting, analyzing, and comparing electric fields, electrostatic potentials, and their effects on the charge density within enzyme active sites. Pioneering methods like the empirical valence bond approach rely on evaluating ionic and covalent resonance forms influenced by the field. Strategies employing polarizable force fields also facilitate field detection. The vibrational Stark effect connects computational simulations to experimental Stark spectroscopy, enabling direct comparisons. We highlight how protein dynamics induce fluctuations in local fields, influencing enzyme activity. Recent techniques assess electric fields throughout the active site volume rather than only at specific bonds, and machine learning helps relate these global fields to reactivity. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules captures the entire electron density landscape, providing a chemically intuitive perspective on field-driven catalysis. Overall, these methodologies show protein-generated fields are highly dynamic and heterogeneous, and understanding both aspects is critical for elucidating enzyme mechanisms. This holistic view empowers rational enzyme engineering by tuning electric fields, promising new avenues in drug design, biocatalysis, and industrial applications. Future directions include incorporating electric fields as explicit design targets to enhance catalytic performance and biochemical functionalities.
39992262	Global Spectral Analysis of Polaritonic Coupling of Multiple Organic Dyes to a Tunable Fabry-Pérot Resonator Operating with Mirror Separations up to 10 μm.	We study strong optical coupling and the formation of hybrid polaritons by a donor-acceptor pair of J-aggregated dyes separated by up to 11 μm in a tunable Fabry-Pérot resonator. Fitting a phenomenological Hamiltonian to the white light transmission spectra of different cavity-J-aggregate-configurations, for which several hundred spectra were recorded sequentially as function of cavity length, allows us to determine coupling energies as a function of the effective cavity distances. The theoretical analysis shows that certain hybrid polaritons contain contributions from both dyes, making this system a promising platform for polariton-mediated energy transfer at very large distances.
39992199	Highly Defined Layered 2D Sulfur Nanosheets from 0D Sulfur Dots and their use in the Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Aryl Amines to Aromatic Azo Compounds.	A highly defined multi-layered 2D sulphur nanosheets have been prepared from 0D sulphur dots by hydrothermal based growth process. Slow transformation of sulphur dots to sulphur sheets allow reorganization of elemental sulphur and sulphur containing functional groups, resulting higher crystallinity in sulphur nanosheets with respect to sulphur dots. It is further correlated with the detailed photophysical studies. Low temperature photoluminescence spectra confirm that the exciton binding energy of 2D sulphur sheets are lower than 0D sulphur dots. The exciton-phonon coupling is also higher in sulphur sheet with respect to sulphur dots. Overall, the photoinduced charge separation process improves throughout the highly defined 2D matrix of sulphur sheets. It is further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photocurrent studies. Finally, both sulphur dots and sulphur sheets have been used for photocatalytic azo bond formation where both photoinduced electrons and holes have been utilized simultaneously. Results suggest almost 3 folds enhancement in catalytic efficiency for sulphur sheets with respect to sulphur dots without any metal co-catalyst. Controlled experiments suggest that the azo bond formation happens through complete photocatalysis process. Detailed mechanism has been proved by identifying the intermediates and free radicals through photo-responsive EPR studies and various chemical scavenging experiments.
39992164	Multigram Scale Synthesis of Mechanically-Interlocked Derivatives of SWNT using Mechanochemical Methods.	The grinding of chemical reagents enables mixing, promotes molecular collisions, and provides the thermal energy required for chemical reactions, while reducing the need for solvent (often to none) and significantly speeding up reactions. This has made mechanochemistry a powerful alternative to traditional solution chemistry. Here, we show that mechanically interlocked derivatives of single-walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) can be made via mechanochemistry in a multigram scale. Compared to the previously reported method in suspension, mechanochemistry allows us to reduce the amount of solvent by two orders of magnitude and the reaction time from 72 h to 5 min. The mechanochemical synthesis of MINTs is proven to work both with purified (6,5)-SWNTs and affordable Tuball<sup>TM</sup> SWNTs, enabling the cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly multigram scale synthesis of MINTs. With this new synthetic methodology, we open the door to the real-world applications of MINTs in fields such as polymer composites.
39991862	Ultrafast Switching of Whispering Gallery Modes in Quantum Dot Superparticles.	Microscopic dielectric structures can leverage geometry and photophysics to confine light, acting as microresonators. However, the use of light to reversibly manipulate the spectral pattern of photonic resonances on ultrafast time scales has hardly been explored. Here, we use femtosecond light pulses to drive reversible changes in the photonic resonances of optical microresonators over a broad spectral range. We employ pump-probe microscopy to investigate the dynamic modulation of the photonic response of whispering-gallery microresonator superparticles self-assembled from colloidal quantum dots. Our findings provide crucial insight into the photophysics of semiconductor superstructures, paving the way to their prospective application as ultrafast optical switches for photonics, optoelectronics, and communication technologies. In particular, we demonstrate that ultrafast photoexcitation can initiate ultrafast excitation transfer between neighboring superparticles, forming a dimer, and induce electronically and thermally driven changes in the refractive index of individual superparticles, dynamically modulating their resonances on distinctive time scales.
39989449	Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of Aldehydes with Acyl-Stabilized Sulfur Ylides.	Herein, we described a novel [1+1+1] deoxygenative cyclopropanation between sulfur ylides and aldehydes, which is distinctive from traditional epoxidation reactions. The method offers a straightforward approach for the synthesis of highly stereoselective, functionalized, and structurally diverse tertiary cyclopropyl thioethers. The reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope and excellent compatibility with various functional groups, rendering it particularly suitable for the late-stage modifications of pharmaceuticals and natural products, as well as the synthesis of structurally diverse compounds. Additionally, β,β-disubstituted enals can also engage in the deoxygenative cyclopropanation reaction, instead of undergoing classic cyclopropanation through a Michael addition reaction-induced cyclization with sulfur ylides, thus yielding synthetically important vinylcyclopropanes with excellent chemoselectivity and diastereoselectivity.
39989207	Design and Properties of Azaacene-Fused Porphyrins: Extending π-Systems for NIR-II Absorption.	A series of porphyrins featuring various azaacene moieties were designed with the aim to explore the structure-property relationships in extended azaacene systems. The introduction of azaacene groups significantly enhanced the solubility of these chromophores while directly influencing their electronic absorption and emission properties, enabling absorption at longer wavelengths. Protonation of the azaacene-fused porphyrins further extended their absorption into the NIR-II region. The π system extension provided by the new appended diamino aromatic groups were therefore investigated through electrochemical, photophysical, X-ray diffraction structural studies and complemented by theoretical calculations.
39989204	Design, Synthesis, and Biophysical Characterization of Pyridine Bis-Quinazoline Derivatives as Selective G-Quadruplex DNA Stabilizers.	Non-canonical G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures play key roles in cellular regulation and are promising targets for cancer therapy. This study reports the design, synthesis, and biophysical evaluation of 15 novel pyridine bis-quinazoline derivatives for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G4 DNA structures. The pyridine-bis-quinazoline central fragment was synthesized with various amine side chains via a 4-5 step sequence in high yields. Comprehensive analyses using different fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, fluorescence intercalator displacement (FID), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assays revealed strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double-stranded DNA. The presence and composition of the aliphatic amine side chain proved critical and propylamine linkers exhibited superior performance, achieving ΔT<sub>m</sub> values exceeding 20 °C and dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Structural preferences were observed for parallel and hybrid G4 topologies, and the ligands induced minimal conformational changes in G4 DNA upon binding. Finally, cell viability assays on HCT-8 and HepG2 cancer cell lines revealed that most ligands effectively entered the cells and decreased cancer cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. These findings underline the potential of pyridine bis-quinazoline derivatives as selective G4-stabilizing agents, paving the way for further exploration in anticancer drug development.
39988556	Ring-Toughened Polymer Networks: The Mighty Impact of Specially Designed Rings on Mechanical Properties.	Polymer network materials are gaining significance in daily life and industrial applications. Improving polymer network materials' mechanical properties has long been a focus for chemists and materials scientists. Generally, rings in networks are viewed as adverse elements leading to reduced mechanical performance. In this conceptual article, recent advancements and related strategies in utilizing specially designed rings to enhance the mechanical properties of polymer networks are summarized and discussed. The article concludes by discussing current challenges and future prospects in this field. We aim for this article to offer readers an overview of ring-toughened polymer networks and to catalyze swift progress in this burgeoning area.

Doyerea emetocathartica is a Cucurbitaceae known as ''cabeça de negro'' and used by North-eastern Brazil and South-eastern Mexico communities to treat rheumatism, inflammation and pain. Despite ethnopharmacological reports, there is currently a lack of evidence about its chemical composition, toxicity and pharmacological effects.

39985130	Kinetic Steering of Amyloid Formation and Polymorphism by Canagliflozin, a Type-2 Diabetes Drug.	Amyloid formation is involved in widespread health conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type-2 diabetes. Amyloid fibrils have a similar cross-β architecture, but fibrils formed by a single protein sequence can have diverse structures, varying with time, self-assembly conditions, and sequence modifications. Fibril structure has been proposed to be diagnostic of disease, but why different structures result under different conditions, especially in vitro, remains elusive. We previously identified a small molecule, YX-I-1, which inhibits in vitro amyloid formation by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a peptide hormone whose amyloid formation is involved in type-2 diabetes. Here, using YX-I-1 as a lead, we identified regulator-approved drugs with similar structures by chemical similarity analysis and substructure searches and monitored the effect of 24 of these potential ligands on IAPP amyloid assembly in vitro. We show that one such compound, canagliflozin (Invokana), a type-2 diabetes drug already in clinical use, can strongly delay the kinetics of IAPP amyloid formation, an activity independent of its intended mode of action [sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor] that may have important therapeutic implications. Combining analysis of amyloid self-assembly kinetics, biophysical characterization of monomer and fibril binding, and cryo-EM of the assembly products, we show that YX-I-1 and canagliflozin target IAPP early in aggregation, remodeling the energy landscape of primary nucleation and profoundly altering the resulting fibril structures. Early binding events thus imprint long-lasting effects on the amyloid structures that form.
39984203	The Medial Olivocochlear Efferent Pathway Potentiates Cochlear Amplification in Response to Hearing Loss.	The mammalian cochlea receives efferent feedback from the brain. Many functions for this feedback have been hypothesized, including on short timescales, such as mediating attentional states, and long timescales, such as buffering acoustic trauma. Testing these hypotheses has been impeded by an inability to make direct measurements of efferent effects in awake animals. Here, we assessed the role of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent nerve fibers on cochlear amplification by measuring organ of Corti vibratory responses to sound in both sexes of awake and anesthetized mice. We studied long-term effects by genetically ablating the efferents and/or afferents. Cochlear amplification increased with deafferentation using VGLUT3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but only when the efferents were intact, associated with increased activity within OHCs and supporting cells. Removing both the afferents and the efferents using VGLUT3<sup>-/-</sup> Alpha9<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not cause this effect. To test for short-term effects, we recorded sound-evoked vibrations while using pupillometry to measure neuromodulatory brain state. We found no state dependence of cochlear amplification or of the auditory brainstem response. However, state dependence was apparent in the downstream inferior colliculus. Thus, MOC efferents upregulate cochlear amplification chronically with hearing loss, but not acutely with brain state fluctuations. This pathway may partially compensate for hearing loss while mediating associated symptoms, such as tinnitus and hyperacusis.
39984201	Ultra-high Field fMRI Reveals Effect of Ketamine on Vocal Processing in Common Marmosets.	Auditory deficits are a well-known symptom in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The noncompetitive <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has been used to model sensory and cognitive deficits in nonhuman primates, but its whole-brain effects remain largely unknown. Here we employed ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4 T in awake male and female marmoset monkeys (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) to compare brain activations to conspecific vocalizations, scrambled vocalizations, and nonvocal sounds following the administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Our findings reveal a broad suppression of activations across auditory regions following ketamine compared with saline. Additionally, we observed differential effects depending on the type of sound, with notable changes in the mediodorsal thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex, particularly during the processing of vocalizations. These findings suggest a potential overlap between the effects of ketamine and neural disruptions observed in schizophrenia, particularly affecting vocalization processing.
39982386	Base-Induced Apparent Inverted Solvatochromism in Pyridinium Phenolates.	Due to conflicting reports regarding the solvatochromism of π-extended pyridinium-phenolate dyes, the choice of base (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylguanidine or 1 M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in methanol) used to deprotonate the dyes was investigated. Three known dyes were synthesized and their UV-vis absorbance spectra were measured in a range of solvent using the two bases and the zwitterionic forms of the dyes. It was found that the methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide could cause the appearance of inverted solvatochromism in negatively solvatochromic dyes when used in solvents of sufficiently low polarity. This was attributed to the presence of the polar, hydrogen bond donating methanol which preferentially solvates the dye, increasing the polarity it observes. Informed by these results, recommendations are presented for the methods used to compare solvatochromic dyes.
39981902	Oxidative Addition-Reductive Elimination Supported by a Ligand-Element Cooperation at the Arsinidene and Stibinidene Center.	The treatment of pnictinidenes [2-(RNHCH<sub>2</sub>)-6-(RN=CH)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]E (1As/Sb) (where E=As or Sb) with benzoyl peroxide provided compounds [2-(DippNCH<sub>2</sub>)-6-(DippN=CH)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]E(O<sub>2</sub>CPh) (2As/Sb) as a result of two step procedure, i. e. oxidation of the pnictogen centre followed by the elimination of benzoic acid. The reaction between 1As and diphenyl disulfide proceeded in the same vein yielding thiophenol and [2-(DippNCH<sub>2</sub>)-6-(DippN=CH)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]As(SPh) (3As). Analogous reaction of 1Sb furnished a mixture of [2-(DippNHCH<sub>2</sub>)-6-(DippN=CH)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]Sb(SPh)<sub>2</sub> (3'Sb), [2-(DippNCH<sub>2</sub>)-6-(DippN=CH)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]Sb(SPh) (3Sb) and PhSH, while NMR studies proved the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between all three compounds in solution and removal of incipient PhSH was necessary for the isolation of 3Sb. Both 1As/Sb smoothly reacted with 2-nitrosotoluene leading to [2-(DippNCH<sub>2</sub>)-6-(DippN=CH)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]E(O-NH-2-Me-Ph) 4As/Sb and with 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione giving [2-(DippNCH<sub>2</sub>)-6-(DippN=CH)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]E[(N(CO)-NH(CO))N-Ph] 5As/Sb. All compounds were characterized by IR, Raman, NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular structures, except for 3As and 5Sb, were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, we scrutinized the thermally induced reductive elimination of benzoic acid and thiophenol from 2-3As/Sb, respectively, and that of 4-phenylurazole from 5As. These eliminations involve C-H activation at the CH<sub>2</sub>N group, and the recovery of the pnictinidene center in [2,6-(RN=CH)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]E (6As/Sb). Using DFT calculations a plausible mechanism was suggested for all the investigated reactions, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations.
39981893	Base-Promoted Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (BHAS) Reactions and Hydrodehalogenations Driven by Green Light and an Iron(III)-NHC Photoredox Catalyst.	An Fe(III)-NHC complex has been employed for the green light driven catalysis of base-promoted homolytic aromatic substitution (BHAS) reactions. Tributylamine was used as a sacrificial electron donor, together with potassium carbonate as base in dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. In contrast to previously studied photocatalysts, the excited Fe(III)-NHC complex is not reducing the arylhalide substrates. Instead, the latter are activated by α-aminoalkyl radicals formed upon reductive quenching of the photocatalyst by tributylamine. Avoiding strongly reducing photocatalysts as well as strong base, these mild reaction conditions allowed for the expansion of the substrate scope to accommodate also aldehyde and ester substituents. 100 % conversion was obtained after 48 h of irradiation. In this way a wide variety of cyclized products and their corresponding hydrodehalogenated products were obtained as isolated and pure compounds, in the vast majority of cases.
39981617	New Cytotoxic Derivatives by the Phosphorylation and Phosphinoylation of Diethyl α-Amino-α-Aryl-Methylphosphonates.	In order to make available new derivatives, diethyl α-amino-α-aryl-methylphosphonates were subjected to phosphorylation, phosphinoylation and even thiophosphinoylation by reaction with phosphoryl chlorides, diphenylphosphinoyl chloride, and with the mixture of diphenylchlorophosphine and elemental sulfur, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of the diphenylphosphinoyl and the diphenylthiophosphinoyl derivatives revealed molecular and supramolecular similarities, as well as a few differences too. An essential conformation change, along with packing differences are attributable to a change of one heteroatom: an oxygen for a sulfur in one of the P=X function. The diethyl diethylphosphoryl-aminobenzylphosphonates showed the highest antiproliferative effects on multiple myeloma cells, while the thiophosphinoylated diethyl aminobenzylphosphonate was the most effective on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.
39980311	Synthesis and Stimuli-Responsive Luminescent Properties of Phenylene-Bridged and Non-Bridged Boron β-Dialdiminate Dimers.	We report synthesis and optical properties of the dimers of boron β-dialdiminate (DAI) complexes with different connection manners. The series of dimers, o-, m-, p- and d-BisDAI, were prepared, and their photophysical properties were compared with the single unit, DAI. It was found that the dimers show characteristic optical properties: o-BisDAI showed bathochromic shifts in absorption and emission spectra and emission quenching because of the through-space interactions, while the photophysical properties of m-BisDAI and DAI were almost identical. The extension of π-conjugation in p-BisDAI could induce not only the bathochromic shifts of its absorption and emission bands but also the solvatochromism originating from the symmetry-breaking charge transfer character. d-BisDAI showed the weak low-energy emission in solution and the mechanochromic luminescence which might stem from the rotational degree of freedom between the adjacent two DAI units.
39979123	Technetium and Rhenium Auto-reduction, Polymerization and Lability towards Group VII Polyoxometalate Chemistry.	Group VII Tc and Re have long been studied to develop both radiopharmaceuticals and technologies for nuclear materials management. Fundamental research has targeted understanding this periodic table crossroads where polyoxometalates meets metal-metal bonded complexes. Here we have isolated green hygroscopic and metastable crystals of (Re<sup>VI,oct</sup>)<sub>2</sub>(Re<sup>VII,tet</sup>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(O)<sub>12</sub>⋅H<sub>2</sub>O (Re<sup>VI,VII</sup>-green, tet=tetrahedral, oct=octahedral), determined by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. In addition to color, Re-L<sub>1</sub> X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy confirms the reduced oxidation state. Re<sup>VI,VII</sup>-green provides the first demonstration of Re autoreduction, long-observed for Mn and Tc. We also isolated and structurally characterized [Tc<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>(ReO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>14</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> (Tc<sub>4</sub>Re<sub>14</sub>) polyanion crystals that contain Tc(V) and Re(VII), consistent with greater stability of reduced Tc compared to reduced Re. Small angle X-ray scattering of both compounds and prior-reported polyanion [Tc<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>(TcO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>14</sub>]<sup>4-</sup> (Tc<sub>20</sub>) dissolved in acetonitrile indicated a qualitative lability order of oxo-linkages of Re-O-Re > Re-O-Tc >Tc-O-Tc, and lability of Tc<sub>20</sub> was also probed by <sup>99</sup>Tc nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Computation provided insight into <sup>99</sup>Tc chemical shifts as well as lability. Based on both reducibility and solution phase dynamics of polynuclear compounds investigated here, Re is an imperfect surrogate for Tc, and further expansion of group VII polyoxometalate chemistry seems promising.

39965931	Sleep Modulates Neural Timescales and Spatiotemporal Integration in the Human Cortex.	Spontaneous neural dynamics manifest across multiple temporal and spatial scales, which are thought to be intrinsic to brain areas and exhibit hierarchical organization across the cortex. In wake, a hierarchy of timescales is thought to naturally emerge from microstructural properties, gene expression, and recurrent connections. A fundamental question is timescales' organization and changes in sleep, where physiological needs are different. Here, we describe two measures of neural timescales, obtained from broadband activity and gamma power, which display complementary properties. We leveraged intracranial electroencephalography in 106 human epilepsy patients (48 females) to characterize timescale changes from wake to sleep across the cortical hierarchy. We show that both broadband and gamma timescales are globally longer in sleep than in wake. While broadband timescales increase along the sensorimotor-association axis, gamma ones decrease. During sleep, slow waves can explain the increase of broadband and gamma timescales, but only broadband ones show a positive association with slow-wave density across the cortex. Finally, we characterize spatial correlations and their relationship with timescales as a proxy for spatiotemporal integration, finding high integration at long distances in wake for broadband and at short distances in sleep for gamma timescales. Our results suggest that mesoscopic neural populations possess different timescales that are shaped by anatomy and are modulated by the sleep/wake cycle.
39964217	Unlocking New Frontiers: Photo-Isomerism and Magnetic Properties in Multifunctional Hetero-Tetra-Metallic Complexes.	Hetero-tetra-metallic complexes, Fe<sub>NO</sub>CuLnCo (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy), combining magnetic properties and photo-isomerism, were obtained through the rational assembly of the photo-switching nitroprusside anion Fe<sub>NO</sub> with new magnetic Schiff base CuLnCo precursors. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of these compounds followed by a demonstration of their multifunctional character. Particularly noteworthy is the Fe<sub>NO</sub>CuTbCo complex which is one of the few examples of a photo-isomerisable SMM.
39963954	Factors influencing the establishment of hospital accreditation programs in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review.	Hospital accreditation programs are globally recognized as an important tool for enhancing quality and safety in health care; however, many programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are discontinued shortly after their establishment. This scoping review synthesized published evidence on factors influencing the establishment and sustainability of hospital accreditation programs in LMICs, to provide guidance to health stakeholders involved in these processes. Six databases were searched using the terms "accreditation," "health," "hospital," and the country list of LMICs. Screening was undertaken collaboratively for validation. A framework to guide data extraction was developed by amalgamating eight existing classifications, theories, models, and frameworks concerning policy diffusion and implementation. The framework comprised the following domains: antecedent influences (A), contextual factors (C), establishment factors (E), standards, surveyors, stimulants (incentives), and survey-related factors (S-4S), governance (G), legislation (L), execution (implementation; E), and assessment and monitoring (AM), forming the ACES-GLEAM framework. Thirty-two sources were identified, with an increasing publication trend over time. The included studies reported upon a broad range of patterns, innovations, influencers, enablers, and barriers concerning accreditation program establishment in LMICs. Key questions emerged, including the degree of government involvement, incorporation of international standards versus development of bespoke standards, the use of local versus external surveyors, the use of financial and other incentives to promote engagement, and mandatory versus voluntary approaches of program implementation. Resource constraints were recognized as the most important barriers to sustainable establishment, while the influence of global accreditation and donor agencies were viewed as presenting both positive and negative impacts. Health stakeholders are encouraged to reflect upon and apply the ACES-GLEAM framework, incorporating the guiding principles outlined in this paper, to help establish hospital accreditation programs in LMICs in a way that facilitates sustainability and effectiveness over time.
39953777	Community health worker payment processes: a qualitative assessment of experiences in two Indian states.	Community health worker (CHWs) remuneration has received some attention in terms of the design of incentives, however, there is a lack of systematic data on the processes by which CHWs are paid. We aimed to study existing payment processes including the role of digitization and its effects on CHW experiences with receiving full and timely compensation, and identify barriers and facilitators to the payment process. We studied payment processes for the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) in India in two states with varying levels of performance and payment systems and conducted 53 in-depth interviews and eight focus group discussions across three categories of respondents (37 ASHA workers, 46 supervisors, and 34 managers/health system leaders). The data was coded thematically using inductive and deductive coding methods organized around five steps of the payment process: (i) recording of work, (ii) claim submission, (iii) claim verification, (iv) claim processing, and (v) payment disbursement. We observed complex sub-processes within each stage of the payment process that adversely impacted payment timelines, CHW workload, and motivation, even where digital tools provide support. Local administrative initiative and positive organizational culture overcame these challenges to standardize and simplify processes for recording work, submitting claims, and maintaining adequate funds, facilitating timely payments. Complete digitization of disbursement through the public financial management system improved timeliness, transparency, and satisfaction among CHWs compared to earlier cash and cheque-based payments. The potential digitization of service delivery records for claim submission was met with mixed perceptions among CHWs and their supervisors. Our study contributes to the body of knowledge on CHW compensation by delineating the processes by which financial incentives are paid and offering insights for low and middle-income countries to improve the efficiency of payment systems.
39952668	Distributed Intracranial Activity Underlying Human Decision-making Behavior.	Value-based decision-making involves multiple cortical and subcortical brain areas, but the distributed nature of neurophysiological activity underlying economic choices in the human brain remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the nature of the neurophysiological representation of reward-guided choices, as well as whether they are represented in a subset of reward-related regions or in a more distributed fashion, is unknown. Here, we hypothesize that reward choices, as well as choice-related computations (win probability, risk), are primarily represented in high-frequency neural activity reflecting local cortical processing and that they are highly distributed throughout the human brain, engaging multiple brain regions. To test these hypotheses, we used intracranial recordings from multiple areas (including orbitofrontal, lateral prefrontal, parietal, cingulate cortices as well as subcortical regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala) from neurosurgical patients of both sexes playing a decision-making game. We show that high-frequency activity (HFA; ɣ and HFA) represents both individual choice-related computations (e.g., risk, win probability) and choice information with different prevalence and regional representation. Choice-related computations are locally and unevenly present in multiple brain regions, whereas choice information is widely distributed and more prevalent and appears later across all regions examined. These results suggest brain-wide reward processing, with local HFA reflecting the coalescence of choice-related information into a final choice, and shed light on the distributed nature of neural activity underlying economic choices in the human brain.
39947921	The Serotonergic Dorsal Raphe Promotes Emergence from Propofol Anesthesia in Zebrafish.	The mechanisms through which general anesthetics induce loss of consciousness remain unclear. Previous studies have suggested that dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic (DRN<sup>5-HT</sup>) neurons are involved in inhalational anesthesia, but the underlying neuronal and synaptic mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons in propofol-induced anesthesia in larval zebrafish (sex undetermined at this developmental stage) using a combination of in vivo single-cell calcium imaging, two-photon laser ablation, optogenetic activation, in vivo glutamate imaging, and in vivo whole-cell recording. We found that calcium activity of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons reversibly decreased during propofol perfusion. Ablation of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons prolonged emergence from 30 µM propofol anesthesia, while induction times were not affected under concentrations of 1, 3, and 30 µM. Additionally, optogenetic activation of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons strongly promoted emergence from propofol anesthesia. Propofol application to DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons suppressed both spontaneous and current injection-evoked spike firing, abolished spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, and decreased membrane input resistance. Presynaptic glutamate release events in DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons were also abolished by propofol. Furthermore, the hyperpolarization of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons caused by propofol was abolished by picrotoxin, a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, which shortened emergence time from propofol anesthesia when locally applied to the DRN. Our results reveal that DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons in zebrafish are involved in the emergence from propofol anesthesia by inhibiting presynaptic excitatory glutamate inputs and inducing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated hyperpolarization.

39930833	Cellulose-based bioactive material and turmeric-impregnated flexible and biocompatible scaffold for bone tissue engineering applications.	Metal transplants, autografts, and allografts are currently used for the treatment of bone-related problems, but each comes with inherent limitations. However, advances in science and technology have underscored the need for the development of cost-effective, eco-friendly, and customized architectural scaffolds with desirable porosity and mechanical strength. Additionally, the synthesis of sustainable scaffolds using biowaste is being studied to decrease environmental pollution. Green fabrication of scaffolds has an inestimable influence on decreasing production costs and toxicity while increasing biological compatibility. With this motivation, in the present study, a 70S30C calcium silicate bioactive material (BM) was synthesized through a simple precipitation method, using recycled rice husk (as a silica source) and eggshells (as a calcium source). Further, the BM and turmeric powder (Tm) were impregnated onto cellulose-based cotton fabric (CF), considering its easy availability, flexibility, mechanical strength, and cost-effective nature. The prepared scaffolds were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy, XRD, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, and EDS mapping. Further, <i>in vitro</i> bioactivity and degradation studies were performed in simulated body fluid (SBF). The <i>in vitro</i> haemolysis study revealed less than 5% haemolysis. <i>Ex ovo</i> CAM results showed good neovascularization. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> biocompatibility studies demonstrated non-toxic nature. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> osteogenesis results showed bone regeneration capacity, as confirmed by X-ray and histological analysis. Thus, the CF template impregnated with BM and Tm acts as a porous, flexible, bioactive, degradable, haemocompatible, osteogenic, antibacterial, cost-effective, and eco-friendly scaffold for bone tissue engineering applications.

39919832	Projection Motifs and Wiring Logic of Medial Pulvinar Thalamocortical Axons in the Marmoset Monkey.	The medial pulvinar thalamic nucleus (MPu) is an evolutionary novelty of the primate thalamus, prominently expanded in humans. Piecemeal data from studies in various monkey species indicate that MPu axons reach prefrontal, inferior parietal, cingulate, insular, or temporal areas; however, the precise wiring and functional logic of such brain-wide connections remain obscure. In marmoset monkeys (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) of both sexes, we visualized the axons originated from specific pulvinar domains by means of biotinylated dextran amine microinjections and compared them across multiple cases. In addition, by injecting retrograde tracers in the cortical areas targeted by the pulvinar axons, we investigated the organization of projection cells within MPu and the existence of long-range branched axons. Specific projection motifs reveal a caudal MPu subnucleus that innervates inferior and ventral temporal areas and a rostral MPu subnucleus that innervates temporal, ventral prefrontal, premotor, inferior posterior parietal, and cingulate areas. We demonstrate numerous MPu neurons that innervate through branched axons prefrontal and parietal or prefrontal and temporal areas; other cells with different projection patterns are closely intermingled with them. Our findings support the notion that MPu is a hub of the brain-wide networks that support complex visual and social cognition, sensory-guided reaching, working memory, and attention. Moreover, the finding of long-range branching MPu axons and dense terminal arborizations suggest that MPu cells may regulate functional connectivity among high-level cortical areas at different spatial scales. Besides, the anatomical "ground truth" provided by our study is relevant for functional imaging and distributed network modeling studies.
39913199	Institutionalizing linkages between informal healthcare providers and the formal health system in Nigeria: what are the facilitating and constraining contextual influences?	With most households in rapidly urbanizing cities in low- and medium-income countries using private and informal providers for basic healthcare, the need to establish linkages with the formal sector is paramount in the drive for universal health coverage. Successful and effective linkage of informal healthcare providers to the formal health system requires an understanding of prevailing contextual factors and how they can be modulated to support the linkages. Context plays a pivotal role in shaping the nature and success of any integration efforts. This paper, based on a qualitative study, explored the facilitating and constraining contextual influences shaping the linkage of informal healthcare providers into the formal health system in governance, service delivery, and data reporting. The research was conducted in Enugu and Anambra states in southeastern Nigeria. In-depth interviews were held with 12 senior healthcare managers, 16 primary healthcare facility managers, 32 informal providers, and 16 community leaders. Eight sex-disaggregated focus group discussions were held with health service users. Transcripts were coded in NVivo using a pre-defined coding framework comprising facilitators and constraints at the individual, organisational, and environmental levels. Individual factors that influence linkage of informal providers into the formal health system include personal attitudes towards linkage, capacity of informal providers to deliver quality services, nature of existing relationships between formal and informal providers, and trust in the formal health system. Organizational factors include leadership structure, coordination and accountability mechanisms, functional management capacity of the formal health system, and multiple regulatory frameworks. External factors include supportive health policies on integration, sustainable funding for continuous training and supportive supervision, and global agenda/support for integration. This study has provided valuable insights for decision makers and practitioners for harnessing the contextual factors to link informal healthcare providers successfully and effectively to the formal health system in order to improve access to quality health services in urban slums.
39907472	Use of Photon-Counting Detector CT to Visualize Liver-Specific Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents: A Phantom Study.	<b>BACKGROUND.</b> The low clinically approved doses of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) do not generate sufficient enhancement on CT for diagnostic purposes. Photon-counting detector (PCD) CT offers improved spectral resolution and could potentially enable visualization of hepatocyte-specific GBCAs, given their associated high gadolinium concentrations within hepatocytes. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of gadoxetate disodium in combination with PCD CT and low-energy virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) reconstructions to achieve an increase in attenuation in a phantom. <b>METHODS.</b> A series of solutions was prepared of diluted gadoxetate disodium (concentrations of 0.250-2.5 μmol/mL, corresponding with doses of 25-200 μmol/kg). These solutions, along with deionized water, were evaluated in an anthropomorphic abdominal phantom using a clinical PCD CT scanner; VMI reconstructions at 40, 50, 60, and 70 keV and virtual noncontrast (VNC) imaging reconstructions were generated. Attenuation measurements were obtained; a linear regression model combined these values with previously reported in vivo data to estimate hepatic enhancement and CNR across doses. <b>RESULTS.</b> Attenuation increased with increasing concentration at a given energy level and with decreasing energy level for a given concentration; VNC images had the lowest attenuation. The maximum attenuation reached in the abdominal phantom was 45.2 HU for a concentration of 2.5 μmol/mL at 40 keV. A concentration of 0.25 μmol/mL had attenuation at 40 keV of 13.0 HU. The model yielded estimated in vivo hepatic enhancement at 40 keV of 4.9 HU for a dose of 25 μmol/kg, 19.9 HU for 100 μmol/kg, and 30.8 HU for 200 μmol/kg; corresponding CNRs were 0.13, 0.52, and 0.81, respectively. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> The combination of gadoxetate disodium and PCD CT could theoretically allow appreciable hepatic enhancement at a 200-μmol/kg dose; such effect was not observed for the clinically approved 25-μmol/kg dose. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> PCD CT achieved attenuation increases for gadoxetate disodium at considerably lower doses than previously documented for CT of GBCAs, albeit at approximately eight times greater than clinical doses, which were thus too high for clinical use. Additional research exploiting PCD CT technology could seek to reduce further doses required for sufficient visualization into a clinically feasible range, to potentially allow CT using a liver-specific agent.
39902904	Isomerisation of phosphabutyne and a photochemical route to phosphabutadiyne (HC<sub>3</sub>P), a phosphorus analogue of cyanoacetylene.	The photochemistry of phosphabut-1-yne, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CP, was investigated by means of infrared spectroscopy assisted by theoretical (DFT) predictions. The UV-irradiated compound, isolated in a cryogenic argon matrix, undergoes isomerization and dissociation. Several isomers of phosphabutyne, in addition to phosphabutadiyne (HC<sub>3</sub>P), ethynylphosphinidene (HCCP), and phoshaethyne (HCP) are formed as the main photoproducts. Vibrational spectra of astrochemically relevant molecules HC<sub>3</sub>P and CH<sub>2</sub>CHCP (vinylphosphaethyne), have been detected and analyzed here for the first time.
39882935	A political economy analysis of health policymaking in Nigeria: the genesis of the 2014 National Health Act.	This article explores the ideologies, interests, and institutions affecting health policymaking in Nigeria, and the role of the private sector therein. It covers the period from the late-1950s, the years leading up to independence, to 2014, when the country enacted its first-ever law to govern its healthcare system. The National Health Act (NHAct) was adopted after a decade of preparation and civil society-driven advocacy, making the objective of universal health coverage (UHC) explicit. However, in its final version, the NHAct earmarked only a small share of public funds for UHC, solidifying the country's reliance on private healthcare and out-of-pocket payments. To examine the specific set of ideologies, interests, and institutions defining Nigeria's pathway toward UHC and the contribution of the private sector, we adopted the political economy framework, situating the genesis of the 2014 NHAct within the broader political and economic context of Nigeria's health system reform process since the 1950s. Drawing on qualitative data collected during interviews and focus groups, we found that the deep entrenchment of private-sector healthcare in Nigeria is the result of a path-dependent process. This implies that Nigeria's current reliance on the private sector is influenced by historical patterns, competing interests, and institutional practices that have reinforced the role of private actors over time. We identified three major explanatory factors that have shaped health policymaking in Nigeria. First, since the 1980s, the ideology that private healthcare is the solution to an underfunded and underperforming public healthcare system has been reinforced by leading international organizations. Second, private actors in Nigeria have been in a strong position to influence health policymaking since independence. Third, Nigeria's challenging socio-economic context and the limitations of its federal governance structure have fostered a general level of public distrust in the capacity of the public sector to provide quality healthcare.
39880682	MuSK Regulates Neuromuscular Junction Nav1.4 Localization and Excitability.	The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the linchpin of nerve-evoked muscle contraction. Broadly, the NMJ transduces nerve action potentials into muscle fiber action potentials (MFAPs). Efficient neuromuscular transmission requires cholinergic signaling, which generates endplate potentials (EPPs), and excitation, the amplification of an EPP by postsynaptic voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.4) to generate the MFAP. Compared to the cholinergic component, the signaling pathways that organize Nav1.4 are poorly characterized. Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), in addition to its Ig1 domain-dependent role as the main organizer of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), also binds BMPs via its Ig3 domain and shapes BMP-induced signaling. Using mice lacking the MuSK Ig3 domain ("ΔIg3-MuSK"), we probed the role of this domain at the NMJ. NMJs formed in ΔIg3-MuSK animals with pre- and postsynaptic specializations aligned at all ages examined. However, the ΔIg3-MuSK postsynaptic apparatus was fragmented from an early age. Synaptic electrophysiology showed that spontaneous and nerve-evoked acetylcholine release, AChR density, and endplate currents were comparable at WT and ΔIg3-MuSK NMJs. However, single fiber electromyography revealed that nerve-evoked MFAPs in ΔIg3-MuSK muscle were abnormal, exhibiting jitter and blocking. Nerve-evoked compound muscle action potentials and muscle force were also diminished. Finally, Nav1.4 levels were reduced at ΔIg3-MuSK NMJs, but not extrasynaptically, indicating that the observed excitability defects result from impaired synaptic localization of this ion channel. We propose distinct, domain-specific roles for MuSK at the NMJ: the Ig1 domain mediates agrin-LRP4-mediated AChR localization, while the Ig3 domain maintains postsynaptic Nav1.4 density, conferring the muscle excitability required to amplify cholinergic signals and trigger action potentials.

39875327	Near-Neutral pH Sensing by Azoheteroarene Dyes.	We serendipitously discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes capable of detecting pH variations in near-neutral solutions. These dyes feature thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls linked to hydroxyphenyl azo groups. They exhibit distinctive light absorption properties in aqueous solutions and show notable color changes in a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye. Both experimental data and quantum calculations suggest a plausible mechanism for their function as pH indicators. Additionally, these azoheteroarene dyes effectively monitor pH in complex environments, and we show their use for detecting the pH change of culture medium containing growing cancer cells.
39873293	Fluorescent nucleobase analogue for cellular visualisation and regulation of immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides.	In this study, we explored the chemical modification of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist DNA using a highly fluorescent thymine analogue, ThexT, focusing on its structural and photophysical characteristics. ThexT-labelled CpG oligonucleotides effectively demonstrated intracellular localisation within macrophage cell lines. Notably, immunostimulatory activity varied depending on the site of ThexT incorporation within the TLR9 agonist sequence. The introduction of fluorescent nucleobases offers a useful approach for visualising immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and for modulating immune responses.
39851238	Diverse alleles of Photoperiod-H1 directly and indirectly affect barley yield-related traits under contrasting photoperiods and PHYTOCHROME C backgrounds.	Barley traits that determine grain number are established between jointing and flowering. The timing of flowering is critical for adaptation and yield as it affects the fertility of both the main shoot and tiller spikes. The Photoperiod-H1 (PPD-H1) gene controls flowering time and impacts spike fertility and yield in barley; however, it is not known if these effects are truly pleiotropic or indirect. Recent findings indicated that under extremely long photoperiods, barley near-isogenic lines (NILs) with contrasting PPD-H1 alleles tend to flower simultaneously, allowing any genetic effects to be determined independently of flowering time. We examined the direct impact of PPD-H1 on barley spike fertility and yield in two PHYC genetic backgrounds. Experiments combined (i) two NILs for PPD-H1 alleles (ppd-H1 or Ppd-H1) under two contrasting PHYTOCHROME C genetic backgrounds (PhyC-l and PhyC-e), and (ii) two photoperiod conditions (12 h and 24 h). Under a 24 h photoperiod, the PPD-H1 gene had a minimal impact on flowering time. The ppd-H1 allele increased grain number by enhancing spike fertility, irrespective of the PHYC background, through better resource allocation to juvenile spikes and more efficient production of fertile florets. These findings support a pleiotropic effect of ppd-H1 in determining flowering time and establishment of yield component traits.
39844779	Amino-Substituted Azoxybenzenes as Potential Redox-Active Catholyte Materials.	Aryl diazenes, particularly azobenzenes (AB), represent a versatile class of compounds with significant historical and practical relevance, ranging from dyes to molecular machines, solar thermal and electrochemical storage. Their oxygen-substituted counterparts, azoxybenzenes (AOB), share structural similarities but have been less explored, especially in energy storage applications. This study investigates the redox properties of AOB, comparing them to AB, and evaluates their potential as redox-active materials for energy storage systems. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectro-electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that AOBs exhibit a distinct redox behaviour, influenced by the solvent and electrolyte environment, with a reversible oxidation process. Despite their promising redox characteristics, AOBs suffer from capacity decay during galvanostatic cycling, likely due to the instability of the radical cation intermediate. These findings suggest that while AOBs offer intriguing redox properties, further investigation into stabilization strategies are needed for their application in energy storage.
39835468	Functionalized amino acid-based injectable hydrogels for sustained drug delivery.	Drug delivery vehicles optimize therapeutic outcomes by enhancing drug efficacy, minimizing side effects, and providing controlled release. Injectable hydrogels supersede conventional ones in the field of drug delivery owing to their less invasive administration and improved targeting. However, they face challenges such as low biodegradability and biocompatibility, potentially compromising their effectiveness. To address these limitations, a modified amino acid-based pH-responsive injectable shear-thinning hydrogel <i>cl</i>-β-CD-<i>g</i>-p(Gly-MA) has been developed as an efficient drug carrier. In the two-step synthetic approaches, first, the well-known amino acid glycine (Gly) is modified to form glycine methacrylate (Gly-MA). Afterward, Gly-MA is chemically crosslinked with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), an oligosaccharide, using an ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) crosslinker. The presence of these biomaterials as building blocks enhances the biocompatibility, hemocompatibility, and biodegradability of the hydrogel. They also reduce the risk of immunogenicity. The unique property of easy injectability enables minimally invasive administration. This feature also helps prolong drug retention at the target site, further optimizing drug delivery efficiency. Moreover, the pH-responsive feature of the developed <i>cl</i>-β-CD-<i>g</i>-p(Gly-MA) hydrogel ensures controlled drug release in response to the physiological conditions of the target site, enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

Di Dang Tang is a classic formula from Shang Han Lun, originally used to treat conditions such as blood stasis and heat accumulation. It is widely applied in the treatment of diabetes and its complications, but its effects on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus-related Cognitive Dysfunction (T2DM-CD) remain unclear.
39825861	Can public education campaigns equitably counter the use of substandard and falsified medical products in African countries?	Substandard and falsified (SF) medical products are a serious health and economic concern that disproportionately impact low- and middle-income countries and marginalized groups. Public education campaigns are demand-side interventions that may reduce the risk of SF exposure, but the effectiveness of such campaigns, and their likelihood of benefitting everybody, is unclear. Nationwide pilot risk communication campaigns, involving multiple media, were deployed in Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda in 2020-21. Focus group discussions (n = 73 with n = 611 total participants) and key informant interviews (n = 80 individual interviews and n = 4 group interviews with n = 111 total informants) were conducted within each of the four countries to ascertain the reach and effectiveness of the campaign. Small proportions of focus group discussants (8.0-13.9%) and key informants (12.5-31.4%) had previously encountered the campaign materials. Understandability varied: the use of English and select local languages, combined with high rates of illiteracy, meant that some were not able to understand the campaign. The capacity for people to act on the messages was extremely limited: inaccessibility, unavailability, and unaffordability of quality-assured medicines from official sources, as well as illiteracy, constrained what people could realistically do in response to the campaign. Importantly, reach, understandability, and capacity to respond were especially limited among marginalized groups, who are already at the greatest risk of exposure to SF products. These findings suggest that there may be potential for public education campaigns to help combat the issue of SF medicines through prevention, but that the impact of public education is likely to be limited and may even inadvertently widen health inequities. This indicates that public education campaigns are not a single solution; they can only be properly effective if accompanied by health system strengthening and supply-side interventions that aim to increase the effectiveness of regulation.
39798149	Unveiling shared genetic regulators of plant architectural and biomass yield traits in the Sorghum Association Panel.	Sorghum is emerging as an ideal genetic model for designing high-biomass bioenergy crops. Biomass yield, a complex trait influenced by various plant architectural characteristics, is typically regulated by numerous genes. This study aimed to dissect the genetic regulators underlying 14 plant architectural traits and 10 biomass yield traits in the Sorghum Association Panel across two growing seasons. We identified 321 associated loci through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), involving 234 264 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These loci include genes with known associations to biomass traits, such as maturity, dwarfing (Dw), and leafbladeless1, as well as several uncharacterized loci not previously linked to these traits. We also identified 22 pleiotropic loci associated with variation in multiple phenotypes. Three of these loci, located on chromosomes 3 (S03_15463061), 6 (S06_42790178; Dw2), and 9 (S09_57005346; Dw1), exerted significant and consistent effects on multiple traits across both growing seasons. Additionally, we identified three genomic hotspots on chromosomes 6, 7, and 9, each containing multiple SNPs associated with variation in plant architecture and biomass yield traits. Chromosome-wise correlation analyses revealed multiple blocks of positively associated SNPs located near or within the same genomic regions. Finally, genome-wide correlation-based network analysis showed that loci associated with flowering, plant height, leaf traits, plant density, and tiller number per plant were highly interconnected with other genetic loci influencing plant architectural and biomass yield traits. The pyramiding of favorable alleles related to these traits holds promise for enhancing the future development of bioenergy sorghum crops.
39798141	Distinct and redundant roles of the Arabidopsis OCTOPUS gene family in plant growth beyond phloem development.	The Arabidopsis root apical meristem is an excellent model for studying plant organ growth. This involves a coordinated process of cell division, elongation, and differentiation, with each tissue type developing according to its own schedule. Among these tissues, the protophloem is particularly important, differentiating early to supply nutrients and signalling molecules to the growing root tip. The OCTOPUS (OPS) protein and its homologue OPS-LIKE 2 (OPL2) are essential for proper root protophloem differentiation and, probably through this role, indirectly promote root growth. Here, we explored the roles of the other three OPS homologues in Arabidopsis, OPL1, OPL3, and OPL4. OPS/OPL genes exhibited overlapping expression patterns and functions, with a high degree of redundancy among them. Although higher order mutants did not display more severe phloem defects, they exhibited significantly reduced root growth compared with the ops opl2 mutant. These results indicate a direct contribution of the investigated OPL genes to meristematic activity. While our focus was on root growth, the OPS/OPL gene family also plays a positive role in regulating shoot growth, emphasizing its broader impact on plant development. Furthermore, our analyses reiterate the central role of OPS and the phloem domain in controlling overall plant growth.
39798077	Protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β promote pollen wall construction partially through BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1-activated cysteine protease gene CEP1 in Arabidopsis.	A well-constructed pollen wall is essential for pollen fertility, which relies on the contribution of the tapetum. Our results demonstrated an essential role of the tapetum-expressed protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) B'α and B'β in pollen wall formation. The b'aβ double mutant pollen grain harboured sticky remnants and tectum breakages, resulting in failed release. B'α and B'β functioned partially through dephosphorylating and activating BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1). The bzr1 bes1 double and higher-order mutants of this BZR1/BES1 family displayed similar defects in the pollen wall, while bzr1-1D, having an active form of the BRZ1 protein, exhibited fertile pollen grains in a B'α and B'β dependent manner. Correspondingly, the level of phospho-BZR1 was increased and dephospho-BZR1 was decreased in b'aβ and bzr1-1D/b'aβ at anther stages 8-9 as compared with Col-0 and bzr1-1D, respectively. A cysteine protease gene CEP1 was identified as a BZR1 target, whose transcriptional activation necessitates brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive elements in the promoter region and the BZR1 DNA binding domain. The mRNA level of CEP1 at stages 8-9 was extremely low in bzr1 and bzr1 bes1, but higher in Col-0 and bzr1-1D depending on B'α and B'β. Furthermore, cep1 mutants displayed similar defects in the pollen wall. In brief, this study uncovered a PP2A-BZR1-CEP1 regulatory module, providing a new insight into pollen maturation mechanisms.
39774931	Increasing photosynthetic benefit with decreasing irrigation frequency in an Australian temperate pasture exposed to elevated carbon dioxide.	Elevated atmospheric CO2 (e[CO2]) often enhances plant photosynthesis and improves water status. However, the effects of e[CO2] vary significantly and are believed to be influenced by water availability. With a future warmer climate expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme rainfall, the response of plants to e[CO2] under changing precipitation patterns remains uncertain. We examined the effects of e[CO2] and different irrigation regimes on perennial ryegrass in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment. Immediately after irrigation, the mean net photosynthetic rate was 21.2% higher under e[CO2] compared with ambient conditions. This benefit increased over time, reaching a 31.3% higher rate as days since watering increased, indicating a substantial increase in photosynthetic benefit with longer intervals between watering. Mean stomatal conductance was 21% lower in ryegrass under e[CO2] immediately after irrigation compared with ambient plots. However, the reduction in stomatal conductance under e[CO2] decreased as the interval between irrigation events increased, showing no difference 7-10 d after an irrigation event. These results imply that plants benefit most from carbon fertilization, assimilating relatively more carbon and losing less water, during periods with less frequent rainfall. These findings have significant implications for understanding leaf-level responses to climate change.

39731752	Useful or merely convenient: can enzymatic antioxidant activity be used as a proxy for abiotic stress tolerance?	During their lifespan, plants are often exposed to a broad range of stresses that change their redox balance and lead to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The traditional view is that this comes with negative consequences to cells structural integrity and metabolism and, to prevent this, plants evolved a complex and well-coordinated antioxidant defence system that relies on the operation of a range of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants (AO). Due to the simplicity of measuring their activity, and in light of the persistent dogma that stress-induced ROS accumulation is detrimental for plants, it is not surprising that enzymatic AOs have often been advocated as suitable proxies for stress tolerance as well as potential targets for improving tolerance traits. However, there are a growing number of reports showing either no changes or even down-regulation of AO systems in stressed plants. Moreover, ROS are recognized now as important second messengers operating in both local and systemic signalling, synergistically interacting with the primary stressor, to regulate gene expression needed for optimal acclimatization. This work critically assesses the suitability of using enzymatic AOs as a proxy for stress tolerance or as a target for crop genetic improvement. It is concluded that constitutively higher AO activity may interfere with stress-induced ROS signalling and be a disadvantage for plant stress tolerance.
39726278	The nuclear sulfenome of Arabidopsis: spotlight on histone acetyltransferase GCN5 regulation through functional thiols.	In aerobic life forms, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by the partial reduction of oxygen during energy-generating metabolic processes. In plants, ROS production increases during periods of both abiotic and biotic stress, severely overloading the antioxidant systems. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a central role in cellular redox homeostasis and signalling by oxidizing crucial cysteines to sulfenic acid, which is considered a biologically relevant post-translational modification (PTM). Until now, the impact of the nucleus on cellular redox homeostasis has been relatively unexplored. The regulation of histone-modifying enzymes by oxidative PTMs at redox-sensitive cysteine or tyrosine residues is particularly intriguing because it allows the integration of redox signalling mechanisms with chromatin control of transcriptional activity. One of the most extensively studied histone acetyltransferases is the conserved GENERAL CONTROL NONDEPRESSIBLE 5 (GCN5) complex. This study investigated the nuclear sulfenome in Arabidopsis thaliana by expressing a nuclear variant of the Yeast Activation Protein-1 (YAP1) probe and identified 225 potential redox-active proteins undergoing S-sulfenylation. Mass spectrometry analysis further confirmed the S-sulfenylation of GCN5 at Cys293, Cys368, and Cys400, and their functional significance and impact on the GCN5 protein-protein interaction network were assessed using cysteine-to-serine mutagenesis.
39724305	Receptor kinase LecRK-I.9 regulates cell wall remodelling during lateral root formation in Arabidopsis.	Assembling and remodelling the cell wall is essential for plant development. Cell wall dynamics are controlled by cell wall proteins, polysaccharide biosynthesis, and a variety of sensor and receptor systems. LecRK-I.9, an Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane-localized lectin receptor kinase, was previously shown to be involved in cell wall-plasma membrane contacts and to play roles in plant-pathogen interactions, but until now its role in development was not known. LecRK-I.9 is transcribed at a high level in root tissues including the pericycle. Comparative transcript profiling of a loss-of-function mutant versus the wild type identified LecRK-I.9 as a regulator of cell wall metabolism. Consistently, lecrk-I.9 mutants displayed an increased pectin methylesterification level correlated with decreased pectin methylesterase and increased polygalacturonase activities. Also, LecRK-I.9 negatively impacted lateral root development through the direct or indirect regulation of genes encoding (i) cell wall remodelling proteins during early events of lateral root initiation, and (ii) cell wall signalling peptides (CLE2 and CLE4) repressing lateral root emergence and growth. Furthermore, low nitrate reduced LecRK-I.9 expression in roots, particularly in the lateral root emergence zone: even in these conditions, the control of CLE2 and CLE4 expression is maintained. Altogether, the results show that LecRK-I.9 is a key player in negatively regulating both pre-branch site formation and lateral root emergence.
39724286	Millets for a sustainable future.	Our current agricultural system faces a perfect storm-climate change, a burgeoning population, and unpredictable outbreaks such as COVID-19 which disrupt food production, particularly for vulnerable populations in developing countries. A paradigm shift in agriculture practices is needed to tackle these issues. One solution is the diversification of crop production. While ~56% of the plant-based protein stems from three major cereal crops (rice, wheat, and maize), underutilized crops such as millets, legumes, and other cereals are highly neglected by farmers and the research community. Millets are one of the most ancient and versatile orphan crops with attributes such as fast growing, high yielding, withstanding harsh environments, and rich in micronutrients such as iron and zinc, making them appealing to achieve agronomic sustainability. Here, we highlight the contribution of millet to agriculture and focus on the genetic diversity of millet, genomic resources, and next-generation omics and their applications under various stress conditions. Additionally, integrative omics technologies could identify and develop millets with desirable phenotypes having high agronomic value and mitigating climate change. We emphasize that biotechnological interventions, such as genome-wide association, genomic selection, genome editing, and artificial intelligence/machine learning, can improve and breed millets more effectively.
39721982	A pipeline for validation of Serendipita indica effector-like sRNA suggests cross-kingdom communication in the symbiosis with Arabidopsis.	Bidirectional communication between pathogenic microbes and their plant hosts via small RNA (sRNA)-mediated cross-kingdom RNAi (ckRNAi) is a key element for successful host colonization. Whether mutualistic fungi of the Serendipitaceae family, known for their extremely broad host range, use sRNAs to colonize plant roots is still under debate. To address this question, we developed a pipeline to validate the accumulation, translocation, and activity of fungal sRNAs in post-transcriptional silencing of Arabidopsis thaliana genes. Using stem-loop quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we detected the expression of a specific set of Serendipita indica (Si) sRNAs, targeting host genes involved in cell wall organization, hormonal signalling regulation, immunity, and gene regulation. To confirm the gene silencing activity of these sRNAs in plant cells, SisRNAs were transiently expressed in protoplasts. Stem-loop PCR confirmed sRNA expression and accumulation, while qPCR validated post-transcriptional gene silencing of their predicted target genes. Furthermore, Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE 1 immunoprecipitation revealed the loading of fungal SisRNAs into the plant RNAi machinery, suggesting the translocation of SisRNA from the fungus into root cells. In conclusion, this study provides a blueprint for rapid selection and analysis of sRNA effectors and further supports the model of cross-kingdom communication in the Sebacinoid symbiosis.
39708362	Transposable element-driven evolution of herbicide resistance in plants.	NA
39707161	Root RADAR: how 'rhizocrine' signals allow roots to detect and respond to their soil environment and stresses.	Agricultural intensification coupled with changing climate are causing soils to become increasingly vulnerable to stresses such as drought, soil erosion, and compaction. The mechanisms by which roots detect and respond to soil stresses remain poorly understood. Recent breakthroughs show that roots release volatile and soluble hormone signals into the surrounding soil, then monitor their levels to sense soil stresses. Our review discusses how hormones can act 'outside the plant' as 'rhizocrine' signals that function to improve plant resilience to different soil stresses. We also propose a novel signalling paradigm which we term 'root RADAR' where 'rhizocrine' levels change in soil in response to environmental stresses, feeding back to roots and triggering adaptive responses.
39706157	Recent developments on 2D-materials for gas sensing application.	The industrialization has severely impacted the ecosystem because of intensive use of chemicals and gases, causing the undesired outcomes such as hazardous gases, e.g. carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and even volatile organic compounds. These hazardous gases are not only impacting the living beings but also the entire ecosystem. Thus, it becomes essential to monitor these gases for their efficient management. There are continuous efforts to realize such sensors, which rely on the functional materials properties. The widely used such sensors use metal oxide nanomaterials. However, these are not very sensitive and operate at higher temperatures. In contrast, two-dimensional (2D) materials such as Graphene, Borophene, MXenes, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) including doping, functionalization, and heterostructures offer unique physical, chemical, and optoelectronic properties. The chemical properties with high specific surface area of 2D materials make them suitable for gas sensing applications. The present review covers the recent developments on 2D-layered material, including MoS<sub>2</sub>, WS<sub>2</sub>, h-BN, and Graphene, as well as their heterostructures for gas sensing applications. The review article also emphasizes their synthesis and characterization techniques, especially for 2D materials. The electronic properties of these materials are highly sensitive to any chemical changes, resulting in significant changes in their resistance. It led to the development of the highly scalable chemiresistive-based gas sensor. The sensing parameters such as sensitivity, selectivity, gas concentration, limit of detection, temperature, humidity, response, reproducibility, stability, recovery, and response time are discussed in detail to understand the gas sensing characteristics of these 2D materials. This review also includes the past developments, current status, and future scope of these 2D materials as highly efficient gas sensors. Thus, this review article may lead the researchers to design and develop highly sensitive gas sensors based on 2D materials.
39699630	Turgor pressure affects transverse stiffness and resonant frequencies of buzz-pollinated poricidal anthers.	Several agriculturally valuable plants store their pollen in tube-like poricidal anthers, which release pollen through buzz pollination. In this process, bees rapidly vibrate the anther using their indirect flight muscles. The stiffness and resonant frequency of the anther are crucial for effective pollen release, yet the impact of turgor pressure on these properties is not well understood. Here, we performed three-point flexure tests and experimental modal analysis to determine anther transverse stiffness and resonant frequency, respectively. Dynamic nanoindentation was used to identify the anther storage modulus as a function of excitation frequency. We subsequently developed mathematical models to estimate how turgor pressure changes after the anther is removed from a flower, thereby emulating zero water availability. We found that anther stiffness decreased by 60% at 30 min post-ablation and anther resonant frequency decreased by 20% at 60 min post-ablation. Models indicated that turgor pressure in the fresh anther was ~0.2-0.3 MPa. Our findings suggest that natural fluctuations in turgor pressure due to environmental factors such as temperature and light intensity may require bees to adjust their foraging behaviors. Interestingly, the anther storage modulus increased with excitation frequency, underscoring the need for more sophisticated mechanical models that consider viscous fluid transport through plant tissue.

39688908	Intrinsic cues guiding changes in division orientation in the Arabidopsis root meristem: a formative experience.	The orientation of cell division is crucial for normal development of all plant organs throughout their life cycle. Despite the importance of understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms guiding this process, relatively few pathways have been characterized to date. Here we want to outline what is known about the molecular regulation guiding changes in division orientation in the root apical meristem of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, from the upstream transcriptional modules to the downstream executors that lead to division plane establishment. We specifically focus on the gaps in our knowledge about this highly coordinated process and propose that a new approach should be taken to characterize how changes in division orientation are controlled in more holistic detail.
39680058	Unveiling the virulence mechanism of Leptosphaeria maculans in the Brassica napus interaction: the key role of sirodesmin PL in the induction of cell death.	Leptosphaeria maculans is the causal agent of blackleg disease in Brassica napus, leading to substantial yield losses. Sirodesmin PL, the principal toxin produced by L. maculans, has been implicated in the infection process in plants. However, the precise molecular and physiological mechanisms governing its effects remain elusive. This study investigates the changes induced by sirodesmin PL at the transcriptomic, physiological, and morphological levels in B. napus cotyledons. Sirodesmin PL treatment up-regulated genes associated with plant defense processes, including response to chitin, sulfur compound biosynthesis, toxin metabolism, oxidative stress response, and jasmonic acid/ethylene synthesis and signaling. Validation of these transcriptomic changes is evidenced by several typical defense response processes, such as the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and callose deposition. Concomitantly, oxidized sirodesmin PL induced concentration- and exposure duration-dependent cell death. This cellular death is likely to be attributed to diminished activity of PSII and reduced number of chloroplasts per cell. In agreement, a down-regulation of genes associated with the photosynthesis process is observed following sirodesmin PL treatment. Thus, it is plausible that L. maculans exploits sirodesmin PL as a virulence factor to instigate cell death in B. napus during its necrotrophic stage, favoring the infection process.
39679950	The homeodomain leucine zipper protein RhHB22 promotes petal senescence by repressing ascorbic acid biosynthesis in rose.	Premature petal senescence dramatically reduces flower quality and value. Ethylene and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key players in accelerating rose petal senescence, but the molecular mechanism by which ethylene antagonizes ROS scavenging is not well understood. Here, we showed that ethylene reduces ascorbic acid (AsA) production, leading to the accumulation of ROS and hastening petal senescence. Ethylene treatment suppressed the expression of GDP-l-galactose phosphorylase 1 (RhGGP1), encoding the rate-controlling enzyme in AsA biosynthesis. A HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP) II transcription factor, RhHB22, directly bound to the promoter of RhGGP1 and inhibited its transcription. RhHB22 is induced by ethylene, and silencing of RhHB22 increased RhGGP1 expression and AsA production, resulting in reduced H2O2 accumulation and delayed petal senescence. Additionally, the delayed petal senescence symptoms of RhHB22-silenced plants were suppressed by silencing RhGGP1. Moreover, the expression of RhGGP1, which is suppressed by ethylene in wild-type petals, was significantly compromised in RhHB22-silenced petals. These findings uncover the transcriptional regulatory mechanism by which ethylene promotes ROS accumulation and petal senescence by inhibiting AsA biosynthesis, enhance our understanding of ethylene-induced petal senescence, and provide novel insights for improving the longevity of cut flowers.
39657133	Floret development and fertility of barley as affected by Photoperiod-H1 under contrasting photoperiods and PHYTOCHROME C backgrounds.	The photoperiod-insensitive allele of Photoperiod-H1 (ppd-H1) increases spike fertility in barley, both indirectly by lengthening flowering time and directly when flowering time is accelerated under extra long photoperiods. To determine if the effect of PPD-H1 on spike fertility is related to the initiation or the mortality of spikelets/florets, we performed detailed analysis of the dynamics of floret development along the barley spikes. Four near-isogenic lines (NILs) combining ppd-H1 and Ppd-H1 alleles with two PHYTOCHROME C (PhyC-l and PhyC-e) backgrounds were compared under 12 h and 24 h photoperiods. The ppd-H1 line consistently showed higher survival rates of floret primordia. Fertility differences were observed within spikes, with the insensitive ppd-H1 line improving fertility in the less favoured distal florets, and even inducing more developmental progress before floret mortality in apical spikelets. The ppd-H1 allele constitutively enhanced floret primordia survival, as the effect was seen even under long photoperiods when lines had similar phenology. The dynamics of floret development affecting spike fertility resulted in a parallel effect on grain setting. Together, these results indicate that photoperiod insensitivity in barley contributes to greater yield potential by reducing floret primordia mortality and improving spike fertility.
39673465	Apomixis at high resolution: unravelling diplospory in Asteraceae.	Apomictic plants are able to produce clonal seeds. This reproductive system allows the one-step fixation of any valuable trait for subsequent generations and would pave the way for a revolution in the agricultural system. Despite this, the introduction of apomixis in sexually reproducing crops has been hampered due to the difficulty in characterizing its genetic regulation. In this study, we described the high-resolution characterization of apomeiosis in the apomictic model species Erigeron annuus, Chondrilla juncea, and Taraxacum officinale. We showed that apomeiosis differs from meiosis in a few critical steps, including homologous chromosome synapsis and segregation during meiosis I. We then compared megasporogenesis in three T. officinale genetic backgrounds, showing that diplospory is superimposed on the sexual pathway without severely altering the expression of crucial meiotic genes. Our findings will contribute to the identification of pivotal players controlling this intriguing asexual reproductive strategy.
39673241	Catalytically inactive subgroup VIII receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases regulate the immune-triggered oxidative burst in Arabidopsis thaliana.	Protein kinases are key components of multiple cell signaling pathways. Several receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) have demonstrated roles in immune and developmental signaling across various plant species, making them of interest in the study of phosphorylation-based signal relay. Here, we present our investigation of a subgroup of RLCKs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Specifically, we focus on subgroup VIII RLCKs: MAZ and its paralog CARK6, as well as CARK7 and its paralog CARK9. We found that both MAZ and CARK7 associate with the calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK28 in planta and, furthermore, that CPK28 phosphorylates both MAZ and CARK7 on multiple residues in areas that are known to be critical for protein kinase activation. Genetic analysis suggested redundant roles for MAZ and CARK6 as negative regulators of the immune-triggered oxidative burst. We provide evidence that supports homo- and heterodimerization between CARK7 and MAZ, which may be a general feature of this subgroup. Multiple biochemical experiments indicated that neither MAZ nor CARK7 demonstrate catalytic protein kinase activity in vitro. Interestingly, we found that a mutant variant of MAZ incapable of protein kinase activity can complement maz-1 mutants, suggesting non-catalytic roles of MAZ in planta. Overall, our study identifies subgroup VIII RLCKs as new players in Arabidopsis immune signaling and highlights the importance of non-catalytic functions of protein kinases.
39673238	Multiple gatekeeping steps in pollination lock species specificity.	In flowering plants, pollen grains must undergo a series of critical processes, including adhesion, hydration, and germination, which are dependent on the stigma, to develop a pollen tube. This pollen tube then penetrates the stigma to reach the internal tissues of pistil, facilitating the transport of non-motile sperm cells to the embryo sac for fertilization. However, a dry stigma, characterized by the absence of an exudate that typically envelops a wet stigma, functions as a multi-layered filter in adhesion, hydration, germination, and penetration that permits the acceptance of compatible pollen or tubes while rejecting incompatible ones, thereby protecting the embryo sac from ineffective fertilization and maintaining species specificity. Given the significance of these selective events, related research has consistently been at the forefront of reproductive studies, with notable advancements being made in recent times. In this review, we systematically synthesize the selective events and provide comprehensive, up-to-date summaries of occurrences on dry stigmas with a particular focus on the Brassicaceae family, following the chronological sequence of these events. Our objective is to update and elucidate the critical points within pollination, identify unresolved questions, and propose potential avenues for future research in other plant families.
39657585	Haplotyped genome mapping and functional characterization of a blueberry anthocyanin acetyltransferase (AAT) controlling the accumulation of acylated anthocyanins.	Blueberry has a diversity of anthocyanins that confer its characteristic blue-coloured skin. Whilst most cultivars produce only anthocyanin glycosides, some can add aliphatic or aromatic groups to the sugar moiety to create acylated anthocyanins. Due to their enhanced stability, acylated anthocyanins represent an attractive breeding target in blueberry. In this study, a haplotype-resolved assembly of a previously identified quantitative trait locus on chromosome 2 of 'Hortblue Petite' (Vaccinium corymbosum) was created to identify candidate anthocyanin acyltransferase genes. One full-length gene (VcAAT1a) was selected based on quantitative PCR expression profiling and transient expression in tobacco leaves and in strawberry and blueberry fruit flesh. In all three systems, VcAAT1a was able to produce a range of acylated anthocyanins in planta. Recombinant VcAAT1a protein demonstrated that, while VcAAT1a was able to act on both anthocyanin 3-O-glucosides and 3-O-galactosides, it could only utilize acetyl-CoA as an acyl donor. Protein modelling using AlphaFold suggested that this restricted range in acyl donors may be due to a spatially restricted sub-pocket in the acyl-binding site of VvAAT1. Finally, LUC/REN promoter activation assays revealed that the VcAAT1a promoter was transactivated by the VcMYBPA1 and VcMYBPA2 transcription factors, further expanding our knowledge of anthocyanin regulation in blueberry.
39655719	Structural complexity of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonate metal complexes.	Small differences in the structure and subsequent reactivity of glyphosate complexes can have a highly consequential impact due to the enormous quantities of glyphosate used globally. The gas phase metal speciation of glyphosate and its abundant metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), were determined using cross-platform electrospray ionisation ion mobility mass spectrometry. Monomeric [M + L - H]<sup>+</sup> complexes, and both larger, and/or higher order clusters formed with divalent metals (M = Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>; and L = glyphosate and AMPA). Complexation occurred at more than one ligand donor site for [M + L - H]<sup>+</sup>, resulting in multidentate complexes. The type of complex depended on M, with central positions maximizing the interactions of the M with donor sites of the L preferred. The isomers were separated by ion mobility and experimental collisional cross sections (<sup>N2</sup>CCS<sub>exp</sub>) were derived for all isolated species. An energy threshold DFT approach located the structural families and potential lowest energy forms; these were found to be consistent with confirmed condensed phase (reported crystal structures) and gas phase structures (<i>via</i> infrared multiple photon dissociation, IRMPD). Theoretical nitrogen collisional cross sections (<sup>N2</sup>CCS<sub>calc</sub>) of these confirmed structures tended to underestimate the <sup>N2</sup>CCS<sub>exp</sub> for both [M + glyphosate - H]<sup>+</sup> and [M + AMPA - H]<sup>+</sup> complexes. Underestimation ranged between 1-20%, and was not uniform between species. By comparison, helium collisional cross sections (<sup>He</sup>CCS<sub>exp</sub> and <sup>He</sup>CCS<sub>calc</sub>) were in better agreement (within 1-3%). These findings suggest further refinements are needed to collisional cross section modelling for metal containing species, in particular for nitrogen drift gas.
39626055	Linking phenology, harvest index, and genetics to improve chickpea grain yield.	Understanding phenology and its regulation is central for the agronomic adaptation of chickpea. We grew 24 chickpea (Cicer arietinum) genotypes in 12 environments to analyse the environmental and genotypic drivers of phenology, associations between phenology and yield, and phenotypes associated with allelic variants of three flowering related candidate loci: CaELF3a, a cluster of three FT genes on chromosome 3, and an orthologue of the floral promoter GIGANTEA on chromosome 4. A simple model with three genotype-specific parameters explained the differences in flowering response to daylength. Environmental factors causing flower abortion, such as low temperature and radiation and high humidity, led to a longer flowering-to-podding interval. Late podding associated with poor partition to grain, limiting yield in favourable environments. The genotype Sonali, carrying the early allele of Caelf3a (elf3a), was generally the earliest to set pod and had low biomass but the highest harvest index. Genotypes combining the early variants of GIGANTEA and FT orthologues featured early reproduction and high harvest index, returning high yield in favourable environments. Our results emphasize the importance of pod set, rather than flowering, as a target for breeding, agronomic, and modelling applications.

Nasogastric tube (NGT) intubation is a common yet critical clinical procedure. However, complications arising from tube friction result in awful pain and morbidity. Here, we report a straightforward surface modification of slender NGT utilizing highly hydrated micelles that were composed of hyaluronic acid and Pluronic. The strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding facilitated the assembly of the micelles on NGT <i>via</i> a one-step dip coating process. The micelle coating conferred excellent hydrophilic, lubrication, anti-protein adhesive, and biocompatible properties. The <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of the micelle coating in alleviating catheterization irritation and mucosal injury was demonstrated using an NGT intubation model of rabbits. More importantly, compared to the paraffin oil coating (the current clinical means), the micelle coating possessed superior capability to reduce the inflammatory reaction caused by NGT intubation. The underlying mechanism was attributed to the suppression of the TLR4-IKBα-NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway. This work provides a promising solution for developing lubricant medical coatings.
39460399	Potential of the Small Molecules Piperidine and Pyrrolidine Against Copper-Resistant <i>Xanthomonas perforans</i>, Causal Agent of Bacterial Spot of Tomato.	Bacterial spot of tomato (BST), caused by <i>Xanthomonas perforans</i>, is an economically important disease of tomatoes in Florida. Because of the heavy reliance on copper-based bactericides for control of BST, copper-resistant strains of <i>X. perforans</i> are widely distributed in Florida, leading to reduced efficacy of copper-based bactericides for disease control. There is a need for alternative chemical control strategies to effectively manage this disease in tomato production. In this study, two small molecules, piperidine and pyrrolidine, were evaluated for their efficacy against the copper-resistant <i>X. perforans</i> strain GEV 485 in laboratory, greenhouse, and field experiments. In in vitro experiments, piperidine and pyrrolidine at concentrations as low as 2 and 16 mg/liter, respectively, significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.001) reduced bacterial populations within 4 h of incubation compared with the untreated control, whereas Kocide 3000, the grower copper-based bactericide standard, at 0.9 and 2.1 g/liter (full label rate) did not significantly reduce bacterial populations. When tested as foliar sprays in the greenhouse, pyrrolidine at 128 mg/liter significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.001) reduced disease severity compared with the untreated control, with an equivalent efficacy to Kocide 3000 (copper hydroxide at 2.1 g/liter). Kocide 3000 at 1.0 g/liter, in combination with piperidine at 64 mg/liter and pyrrolidine at 64 and 128 mg/liter, significantly improved the efficacy in disease control compared with untreated controls and Kocide 3000 at 1.0 g/liter alone. In field trials, both small molecules demonstrated equivalent or superior efficacy to ManKocide (copper hydroxide + mancozeb) against <i>X. perforans</i> compared with the untreated control. This study demonstrated for the first time the potential of piperidine and pyrrolidine for controlling BST.

In 2017, nurse practitioners (NPs) became the first non-physician healthcare providers authorised to independently provide medication abortion (MA) in Canada. We aimed to report on demographic and clinical characteristics of NPs providing mifepristone/misoprostol MA in Canada and to identify context-specific barriers and enablers to NP provision of mifepristone/misoprostol MA in Canada among MA providers and non-providers.
39352507	Nectriaceae Species Associated with Root Rot of Nursery and Young <i>Eucalyptus smithii</i> Trees in Uruguay with <i>Ilyonectria charruensis</i> as Novel Species.	Forestry constitutes an important agronomical activity in Uruguay, involving the cultivation of exotic trees mainly for cellulose pulp production with <i>Eucalyptus</i> species<i>.</i> Over the last decade, <i>E. smithii</i> emerged as a species of interest for cellulose pulping. However, its rapid expansion has coincided with high mortality rates among young trees ranging from 5 to 85%, especially during the first and second summer after plantation. Disease surveys conducted on nine <i>E. smithii</i> commercial fields and three nurseries in southern and eastern Uruguay yielded a collection of 25 isolates from <i>E. smithii</i> root rot belonging to the Nectriaceae family. In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize these isolates employing phenotypical and molecular studies and to assess their pathogenicity on <i>E. smithii</i> seedlings. Based on morphological features, the Nectriaceae isolates were subdivided into two groups, one resembling <i>Calonectria</i> (<i>n</i> = 15) and the other <i>Cylindrocarpon</i>-like (<i>n</i> = 10). DNA sequences of the partial histone H3 (<i>his3</i>), actin, calmodulin, RNA polymerase II second largest subunit, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (<i>tef1</i>), and β-tubulin (<i>tub2</i>) genes were amplified for <i>Calonectria</i>, as well as partial <i>his3</i>, <i>tef1</i>, <i>tub2</i>, and internal-transcribed spacer and intervening 5.8S (<i>ITS</i>) gene regions for the <i>Cylindrocarpon</i>-like group. Based on phylogenetic analysis and phenotypical features, three species were identified and characterized: <i>Calonectria pauciramosa</i> (<i>n</i> = 15), <i>Dactylonectria novozelandica</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), and a novel taxon which we describe here as <i>Ilyonectria charruensis</i> sp. nov. (<i>n</i> = 8). The pathogenicity trials revealed that isolates from the three species significantly reduced both shoot and root dry weights of inoculated <i>E. smithii</i> seedlings compared with control plants.
39349009	A qualitative study which aims to explore the factors influencing the delivery of both theory and practice of contraception and sexual health on pre-registration midwifery programmes in England.	Pregnancy offers an opportunity to provide equitable access to contraception information and provision, and professional bodies advocate provision of contraception in the immediate postpartum period. This study examines the contribution of pre-registration midwifery education in preparing student midwives for this aspect of their role.
39322285	General practice preconception care invitations: a qualitative study of women's acceptability and preferences.	In general practice, primary care providers can potentially use electronic medical records (EMRs) to identify and invite reproductive-aged women with preconception health risk factors to increase their engagement in preconception care (PCC). However, the acceptability of receiving PCC invitations and women's preferences about the invitation process are poorly understood. This study aims to investigate women's acceptability and preferences for receiving PCC invitations from general practice settings.
39319672	Physiological and molecular insights into alternate bearing in mango using next-generation sequencing approaches.	The productivity of the mango crop in India is hindered by many factors, one of the most important factors is our limited understanding of the genomic complexities behind the regular versus alternate bearing habit of fruit. In this study, we quantified carbohydrate fractions, protein content, and macro- and micronutrient storage pools together with their transportation and contributions to a regular bearing variety, Totapuri, and to an alternate-bearer, Bombay Green during the 'off' year. RNA-sequencing was used to assess gene expression dynamics between buds and flowers of these varieties. Differential pathway analysis showed the greatest number of differentially expressed genes in metabolic processes, followed by oxidoreductase, hormone, oxidative stress, starvation, alternate bearing, flowering, meristem, and cellular component pathways. Bioinformatics analysis showed that, among 15 highly differentially expressed genes between varieties representing alternate bearing, hormone, and carbohydrate metabolism pathways, 12 were up-regulated in Totapuri and 3 in Bombay Green, and this was confirmed by qRT-PCR. In addition, 202 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in 32 genes related to alternate bearing. Our results confirmed the strong ability of reproductive buds to import sugars, proteins, and starch in the regular-bearer variety, thereby enhancing flowering and fruiting during 'off' years. Thus, our study shows a potential role for the mineral nutrient and biochemical constituents of buds and leaves in determining the regular versus alternate bearing fruiting habit in mango.

Self-injectable contraceptives, namely subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 104 mg micronised formulation delivered via uniject system, reduce the need to travel to a facility for contraceptive access, but the initial, in-person, training may be a barrier to starting this method. This article reports on a small, exploratory pilot in Kenya to test the feasibility and acceptability of digital self-injection training.
39046138	Contrast Media in Pregnant and Lactating Patients, From the <i>AJR</i> Special Series on Contrast Media.	IV contrast media improve the diagnostic power of radiology examinations. These media include gadolinium-based contrast media and iron oxide nanoparticles for MRI, iodinated contrast material for CT, microbubbles for ultrasound, and radiopharmaceuticals for nuclear medicine. As do all medications, contrast media carry risks, which may be heightened in the conditions of pregnancy and lactation. Radiologists must understand the potential risks from contrast media exposure to the pregnant patient, fetus, and nursing infant, as well as understand these administrations' impact on the clinical utility of examinations. This article reviews the available literature on these media, along with key regulatory bodies' and professional societies' current recommendations for their use, in the settings of pregnancy and lactation. This knowledge should help radiologists make well-reasoned risk-benefit analyses regarding contrast media administration and allow informed consent discussions with pregnant and nursing patients for whom contrast media administration is being considered. This information and analysis can also assist facilities in designing policies and standard operating procedures of possible clinical benefit to the pregnant patient, fetus, or nursing infant, balancing contrast media exposure considerations against augmented diagnostic capabilities.
38960413	What do Australian primary care clinicians need to provide long-acting reversible contraception and early medical abortion? A content analysis of a virtual community of practice.	Uptake of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is lower in Australia compared with other high-income countries, and access to early medical abortion (EMA) is variable with only 11% of general practitioners (GPs) providing EMA. The AusCAPPS (Australian Contraception and Abortion Primary Care Practitioner Support) Network is a virtual community of practice established to support GPs, nurses and pharmacists to provide LARC and EMA in primary care. Evaluating participant engagement with AusCAPPS presents an opportunity to understand clinician needs in relation to LARC and EMA care.
38889960	Seeking abortion accompaniment: experiences and self-managed abortion preferences of hotline callers after abortion legalisation in Argentina.	Until the legalisation of abortion in Argentina in 2021, the Socorristas en Red, a network of feminist collectives, provided support and information ('accompaniment') to people self-managing their abortion with medications. Following legalisation, the Socorristas continued accompanying people self-managing or accessing abortion through the healthcare system. We conducted a cross-sectional study to understand preferences, experiences and choices about abortion when contacting a Socorristas hotline after legalisation of abortion in Argentina.

38175795	Exploring Racial Disparities in the 1918 Influenza Pandemic: A Case Study of Durham, North Carolina.	The paradox of excess mortality among White Americans during the 1918 influenza pandemic has long puzzled historians and scientists. Recent scholarship has suggested that this disparity was not true for the country as a whole, but rather regional variation was observed. The factors influencing these disparities remain speculative. A case study was conducted of Durham, North Carolina, a city known nationally for the achievements of its Black middle class, to further explore these themes relying on numerous sources including newspapers and death certificates. Though Durham's overall mortality was lower than many places in North Carolina, the White mortality rate greatly exceeded that of the Black population. Previously described theories, including Alfred Crosby's exposure hypothesis and segregation, were explored. The most notable difference between Durham's pandemic narrative and other comparable towns was the robust healthcare response, which was made possible by the excellence of the Black nursing force from Lincoln Hospital. Nursing care was the best treatment available for the 1918 influenza, but most of the nation experienced severe nursing shortages due to the war effort. This study thus provides an example of how the Black health community has proven an active agent in countering the structural forces driving racial disparities.
38006351	"A Vile Custom": The Strange Career of William Osler's "Professional Notes".	In 1882, William Osler wrote "Professional Notes among the Indian Tribes about Great Slave Lake, NWT," a fantastical essay that purportedly described the sexual and obstetric customs of Indigenous peoples residing in the Canadian Northwest. Originally prepared as a prank, "Professional Notes," along with Osler's alter ego Egerton Yorrick Davis, became an elaborate inside joke that circulated widely among the medical elite for decades after Osler's death. In this essay, I trace the history and afterlife of "Professional Notes," considering both the colonial context of its creation as well as the reasons for its enduring popularity. I argue that "Professional Notes" both reflected and reinforced the anti-Indigenous racism that permeated the medical profession, particularly during its consolidation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. I also make a methodological argument for the study of joking within the history of medicine, presenting "Professional Notes" as a powerful example of the role humour has played in shaping medical culture.
37951715	Pathologizing Pathos: Suffering, Technocentrism, and Law in Twentieth-Century American Medicine.	In the second half of the twentieth century, concerns about problems in the doctor-patient relationship gave way to a new medical discourse on suffering, owed largely to the work of American physician Eric Cassell. This article tracks the development of his theory of suffering and its global success in transforming tragic medical experiences into diagnosable clinical entities. Beginning with his intellectual development in the 1960s, this article traces Cassell's initial interest in suffering first to his early research on truth-telling and autonomy, followed by his pioneering work in bioethics. Although closely aligned with philosophy, much of the institutional success of bioethics came from American law, which affected Cassell's theorizing. At the same time, doctors experienced a growth in medical malpractice lawsuits, driven in large part by costly "pain and suffering" awards, which the medical community sought to curb by encouraging legislatures to codify informed consent. The success of these efforts mandated that doctors disclose previously withheld bad news capable of causing suffering. The cultural changes that followed these disclosures became Cassell's impetus, while legal pain and suffering supplied much of his theory's language and concepts.

37837654	Operative Innovation and Surgical Conservatism in Twentieth-Century Ulcer Surgery.	Peptic ulcers were a common, and seemingly intractable, problem for surgeons in the US through the early twentieth century. Initial surgical efforts reduced operative mortality and achieved short term successes but failed to establish a definitive solution. The flawed successes of early ulcer surgery drove sustained effort to improve, producing a stream of novel operations over the decades. An examination of the history of ulcer surgery confirms the recent observation that surgical operations of this period were malleable entities subject to constant tinkering and repurposing. Yet, this dynamism in surgical practice remained in tension with conservative pressures, as surgeons hung on to familiar practices and sought to codify agreement on which operation served best for which purpose. Ulcer surgery became a workshop for attempts to resolve this tension. In this context, a canon of recognized operations emerged that accommodated novelties while preserving in surgical discourse an awareness of older operations. Established operations that fell from use literally remained on the books for decades. This compromise between innovation and operative conservatism favored the creative reuse of older ulcer operations, some repurposed, and some combined with other operations in new modular configurations. Ulcer surgery demonstrated recurring patterns of operative repurposing, reconfiguration, and modular recombination. This feature of twentieth-century ulcer surgery also highlights the attachment in modern surgical culture to the historicity of their endeavor, manifested for example in the wide use of eponyms and a fondness for deep genealogies of mentoring and training.
