40029899	Mucilage produced by aerial roots hosts diazotrophs that provide nitrogen in Sorghum bicolor.	Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is an important food, feed, and fodder crop worldwide and is gaining popularity as an energy crop due to its high potential for biomass production. Some sorghum accessions develop many aerial roots and produce an abundant carbohydrate-rich mucilage after rain. This aerial root mucilage is similar to that observed in landraces of maize (Zea mays) from southern Mexico, which have been previously shown to host diazotrophs. In this study, we characterized the aerial root development of several sorghum accessions and the impact of humidity on this trait. We conducted a microbiome study of the aerial root mucilage of maize and sorghum and isolated numerous diazotrophs from field sorghum mucilage. We observed that the prevailing phyla in the mucilage were Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, and Bacillota. However, bacterial abundances varied based on the genotype and the location. Using acetylene reduction, 15N2 gas feeding, and 15N isotope dilution assays, we confirmed that these sorghum accessions can acquire about 40% of their nitrogen from the atmosphere through these associations on aerial roots. Nitrogen fixation in sorghum aerial root mucilage offers a promising avenue to reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers and promote sustainable agricultural practices for food, feed, fodder, and bioenergy production.
40051883	Wood density can best predict carbon stock in the forest aboveground biomass following restoration in a post open limestone mining in a tropical region.	Reforestation has been widely considered to best solve this problem, but this requires an accurate estimation of carbon stocks in the forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at a large scale. AGB models based on traits and remote sensing indices (moisture vegetation index (MVI)) are the two good methods for this purpose. But limited studies have developed them to estimate carbon stock in AGB during restoration of degraded mining areas.

40052072	﻿Just the tip of the iceberg: uncovering a hyperdiverse clade of African <i>Russula</i> (<i>Basidiomycota</i>, <i>Russulales</i>, <i>Russulaceae</i>) species with signs of evolutionary habitat adaptations.	The diversity within the ectomycorrhizal genus Russula (Basidiomycota) in West Africa is largely unexplored. The study area was Benin, where only ten out of the 159 species endemic to tropical Africa have been previously reported. We focused on "<i>Afrovirescentinae</i>", which is a monophyletic lineage within Russulasubgen.Heterophyllidiaesister tosubsect.Virescentinae. The phylogenetic placement of this clade was analysed using sequence data from ITS, LSU, mtSSU, <i>tef1</i>, <i>rpb1</i> and <i>rpb2</i> regions. Ten "<i>Afrovirescentinae</i>" species are recognised, described and illustrated from Benin. Four of them, <i>R.carmesina</i>, <i>R.hiemisilvae</i>, <i>R.inflata</i> and <i>R.sublaevis</i>, were previously published. Five species, <i>Russulaacrialbida</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, <i>R.beenkenii</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, <i>R.coronata</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, <i>R.florae</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> and <i>R.spectabilis</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, are newly described. Species within this group are characterised by densely reticulated spore ornamentation, but they exhibit considerable variation in field appearance and pileipellis structure. In gallery forests, their basidiomata are ephemeral, small and their basidiospores have prominent ornamentation; while in savannah woodlands, the basidiomata are fleshy, large and basidiospores present low ornamentation. We suggest that these morphological traits may represent evolutionary adaptations to a specific environmental condition. We analysed the species richness, ecological range and distribution of the "<i>Afrovirescentinae</i>" clade globally based on data from the UNITE database, estimating a total diversity of 94 species primarily distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in the Neotropics. Four additional previously described species not detected in Benin were assigned to this clade, based on holotype sequencing. Several species are widely distributed across tropical Africa and do not show specificity regarding their associated plant symbionts.
40052075	﻿Characterisation and comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes of false, yellow, black and blushing morels provide insights on their structure and evolution.	<i>Morchella</i> species have considerable significance in terrestrial ecosystems, exhibiting a range of ecological lifestyles along the saprotrophism-to-symbiosis continuum. However, the mitochondrial genomes of these ascomycetous fungi have not been thoroughly studied, thereby impeding a comprehensive understanding of their genetic makeup and ecological role. In this study, we analysed the mitogenomes of 30 <i>Morchellaceae</i> species, including yellow, black, blushing and false morels. These mitogenomes are either circular or linear DNA molecules with lengths ranging from 217 to 565 kbp and GC content ranging from 38% to 48%. Fifteen core protein-coding genes, 28-37 <i>tRNA</i> genes and 3-8 <i>rRNA</i> genes were identified in these <i>Morchellaceae</i> mitogenomes. The gene order demonstrated a high level of conservation, with the <i>cox1</i> gene consistently positioned adjacent to the <i>rnS</i> gene and <i>cob</i> gene flanked by <i>apt</i> genes. Some exceptions were observed, such as the rearrangement of <i>atp6</i> and <i>rps3</i> in <i>Morchellaimportuna</i> and the reversed order of <i>atp6</i> and <i>atp8</i> in certain morel mitogenomes. However, the arrangement of the <i>tRNA</i> genes remains conserved. We additionally investigated the distribution and phylogeny of homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) of the LAGLIDADG (LAGs) and GIY-YIG (GIYs) families. A total of 925 LAG and GIY sequences were detected, with individual species containing 19-48HEGs. These HEGs were primarily located in the <i>cox1</i>, <i>cob</i>, <i>cox2</i> and <i>nad5</i> introns and their presence and distribution displayed significant diversity amongst morel species. These elements significantly contribute to shaping their mitogenome diversity. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the phylogeny and evolution of the <i>Morchellaceae</i>.
40052080	﻿Fungal fairy rings: history, ecology, dynamics and engineering functions.	Fungal fairy rings (FFR) are fascinating natural phenomena that have intrigued people and scientists for centuries. These patterns, often represented by circular distributions of altered vegetation, are found in grasslands and forest habitats. Fairy rings occur when fungi grow radially in the soil, raising from a central point, progressively degrading organic matter and thus affecting vegetation. The observation of such spatial patterns allows mycologists to conduct an in-depth analysis of the role of fungi in ecosystems. This review presents the current knowledge and scientific advancement of the studies of FFRs. An historical appraisal from the most representative pioneer studies until recent works is presented in different scientific fields, including microbiology, chemistry, botany and ecology. Based on a deep analysis of bibliographic data, we synopsised different aspects of FFRs: i) history of studies, ii) taxonomy, iii) ecology (environmental conditions and biogeography), iv) classification of vegetation patterns, v) spatial dynamics, vi) role as ecosystem engineer (impact on soil chemistry, plants and microbiota). In conclusion, beside still open research areas requiring further investigation, a schematic functional model of fungal fairy rings is proposed, in which on one hand the dynamics of the fungal mycelium is explained by self-DNA accumulation and the build-up of autotoxicity. On the other hand, the effects of fungi on plants are related to the intermingled and differently spatially distributed effects of hydrophobicity, phytotoxicity and phytostimulation.

40052202	Timescale Matters: Finer Temporal Resolution Influences Driver Contributions to Global Soil Respiration.	Understanding the dynamics of soil respiration (R<sub>s</sub>) and its environmental drivers is crucial for accurately modeling terrestrial carbon fluxes. However, current methodologies often lead to divergent estimates and rely on annual predictions that may overlook critical interactions occurring at seasonal scales. A critical knowledge gap lies in understanding how temporal resolution affects both R<sub>s</sub> predictions and their environmental drivers. Here, we employ deep learning models to predict global R<sub>s</sub> at monthly (MRM) and annual (ARM) scales from 1982 to 2018. We then consider three main drivers potentially affecting R<sub>s</sub>, including temperature, precipitation, and a vegetation proxy (leaf area index; LAI). Our models demonstrate strong predictive capabilities with global R<sub>s</sub> estimation of 79.4 ± 5.7 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> for the MRM and 78.3 ± 7.5 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> for ARM (mean ± SD). While the difference in global estimations between both models is small, there are notable disparities in the spatial contribution of dominant drivers. The MRM highlights an influence of both temperature and LAI, while the ARM emphasizes a dominant role of precipitation. These findings underscore the critical role of temporal resolution in capturing seasonal variations and identifying key R<sub>s</sub>-environment relationships that annual models may obscure. High temporal resolution R<sub>s</sub> predictions, such as those provided by the MRM, are essential for capturing nuanced seasonal interactions between R<sub>s</sub> and its drivers, refining carbon flux models, detecting critical seasonal thresholds, and enhancing the reliability of future Earth system predictions. This work highlights the need for further research into monthly and seasonal R<sub>s</sub> variations, as well as higher timescale resolutions, to advance our understanding of ecosystem carbon dynamics in a rapidly changing climate.
40052218	MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 synergistically regulate arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and the transcription of MdPHT1;13, enhancing phosphorus uptake in apple rootstocks.	Phosphorus in the soil is easily chelated into forms that are unavailable to plants, leading to phosphorus deficiency, which severely affects the growth, development, and fruit quality of apple trees. To address phosphorus deficiency, we used four different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to investigate their effects on the growth and development of apple rootstocks and phosphorus uptake in the soil. We identified Glomus mosseae (Gm) fungi as the most effective AMF for promoting growth and found that under phosphorus-deficient conditions, inoculating with Gm fungi promoted the growth of the above-ground parts of the plants and phosphorus absorption, while it inhibited root growth. After inoculating with Gm fungi, we found phosphorus starvation response factors (PHRs) and auxin response factors (ARFs) were upregulated. Knockdown of MdPHR2 or MdARF6-4 resulted in decreased root arbuscular structures, total mycorrhizal colonization rate, and root phosphorus content, indicating that MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 positively regulate the symbiosis of Gm fungi and phosphorus absorption. In contrast, overexpressing MdARF6-4 led to reduced root development but increased root phosphorus content under Gm fungi inoculation, suggesting that MdARF6-4 is involved in Gm-mediated phosphorus absorption and root development. Moreover, both MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 directly bound to the promoter area of the downstream phosphorus transporter MdPHT1;13, and these two transcription factors interacted with each other in vivo and in vitro. In summary, our study demonstrates that the interaction between MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 synergistically regulates the Gm symbiosis and the transcription of MdPHT1;13, thereby promoting phosphorus absorption in apple rootstocks.
40052246	Stomata-Photosynthesis Synergy Mediates Combined Heat and Salt Stress Tolerance in Sugarcane Mutant M4209.	Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is an economically important long-duration crop which is currently facing concurrent heat waves and soil salinity. The present study evaluates an inducible salt-tolerant sugarcane mutant M4209, developed via radiation-induced mutagenesis of elite check variety Co 86032, under heat (42/30°C; day/night), NaCl (200 mM) or heat + NaCl (HS)-stress conditions. Though heat application significantly improved plant growth and biomass in both genotypes, this beneficial impact was partially diminished in Co 86032 under HS-stress conditions, coinciding with higher Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation and lower triacylglycerol levels. Besides, heat broadly equalised the negative impact on NaCl stress in terms of various physiological and biochemical attributes in both the genotypes, indicating its spaciotemporal advantage. The simultaneous up- and downregulation of antagonistic regulators, epidermal patterning factor (EPF) 9 (SoEPF9) and SoEPF2, respectively attributed to the OSD (Open Small Dense) stomatal phenotype in M4209, which resulted into enhanced conductance, transpirational cooling and gaseous influx. This led to improved photoassimilation, which was supported by higher plastidic:nonplastidic lipid ratio, upregulation of SoRCA (Rubisco activase) and better source strength, resulting in overall plant growth enhancement across all the tested stress scenarios. Taken together, the present study emphasised the knowledge-driven harnessing of stomatal-photosynthetic synergy for ensuring global sugarcane productivity, especially under "salt-heat" coupled stress scenarios.
40052297	Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics of Plant-Soil Feedbacks Explain the Spread Potential of a Plant Invader Under Climate Warming and Biocontrol Herbivory.	Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) can contribute to the success of invasive plants. Despite strong evidence that plant genetic traits influence soil microbial communities and vice versa, empirical evidence exploring these feedbacks over evolutionary timescales, especially under climate change, remains limited. We conducted a 5-year field study of the annual invasive plant, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., to examine how selection under climate warming and biocontrol insect herbivory shapes plant population genetics, soil properties, and microbial communities. After four generations under warming and herbivory, we collected seeds of the F<sub>4</sub> plant populations together with their conditioned soil for a common garden PSF experiment to explore how resulting PSFs patterns are influencing the performance and spread potential of Ambrosia under changing environmental conditions. This is especially relevant because our recent predictions point to a northward spread of Ambrosia in Europe and Asia under climate change, outpacing the spread of its insect biocontrol agent. We discovered that warming and herbivory significantly but differentially altered plant genetic composition and its soil microbial communities, with less pronounced effects on soil physicochemical properties. Our results indicate that both herbivory and warming generated negative PSFs. These negative PSFs favored plant growth of the seeds from the persistent soil seed bank growing in the conditioned soil under insect herbivory, and by this maintaining the Ambrosia population genetic diversity. They also enhanced the spread potential of warming-selected plant offspring, especially from warmer (southern) to colder (northern) climates. This can be explained by the observed decrease in soil pathogens occurrence under insect herbivory and by the especially strong genetic changes in plant populations under climate warming. Our findings provide insights into how climate warming and biocontrol management affect eco-evolutionary interactions between invasive plant populations and their soil environments, which are critical for predicting invasion dynamics in the context of global change.
40052326	Human activity, not environmental factors, drives Scedosporium and Lomentospora distribution in Taiwan.	Scedosporium and Lomentospora species are emerging fungal pathogens capable of causing severe infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Previous environmental surveys have suggested potential associations between these fungi and various soil chemical parameters, though the relative influence of human activity versus environmental factors has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we conducted a comprehensive survey of 406 soil samples from 132 locations across Taiwan, analyzing fungal abundance alongside soil physicochemical parameters and the Human Footprint Index (HFI). We recovered 236 fungal isolates comprising 10 species, with S. boydii (32.2%), S. apiospermum (30.9%), and S. dehoogii (14.4%) being the most prevalent. The highest fungal burdens were observed in urban environments (up to 1293 CFU/g), particularly in public spaces and healthcare facilities. Statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between fungal abundance and HFI (r = 0.143, P = 0.005), while soil chemical parameters including nitrogen, carbon, pH, electrical conductivity, and various base cations showed no significant associations despite their wide ranges. These findings indicate that anthropogenic disturbance of environments, rather than soil chemistry, is the primary driver of Scedosporium and Lomentospora distribution in Taiwan. This understanding holds important implications for predicting infection risks and developing targeted public health strategies, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions. Future studies incorporating more specific indicators of human impact may further elucidate the mechanisms underlying these distribution patterns.
40052334	Genome and Metagenome Skimming: Future Sequencing Methods for Environmental DNA (eDNA) Studies.	Genome skimming (GS), also referred to as low-coverage shotgun sequencing, is an efficient and cost-effective sequencing method that targets high-copy regions in genomes. It is most commonly used for species identification, phylogenetic analysis and expansion of reference libraries. GS can be applied to single species or composite DNA samples representing multiple species; the latter is termed metagenome skimming (MGS). GS/MGS shows promise as an effective approach for environmental DNA (eDNA) studies, but it is currently limited to ancient sedimentary samples. There is the potential to expand this methodology to other eDNA sources, including water, soil and airborne samples. In this paper, we introduce GS/MGS and briefly review its current applications. We also discuss the potential benefits and challenges of using GS/MGS to assay eDNA. eDNA GS/MGS is a promising technology that could broaden eDNA studies if some methodological challenges can be addressed.
40052351	Marine bacterium Cobetia sp. strain GM produces fucose-rich extracellular polymeric substance.	Several extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria have beneficial applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries as gelling agents, stabilizers, thickeners, and bioactive ingredients. Most commercialized EPS are derived from soil bacteria, but studies on EPS produced by marine bacteria are scarce. We isolated a marine bacterium Cobetia sp. strain GM, which produces viscous EPS (glycoprotein). Viscosity measurement showed that the EPS of strain GM (GM-EPS) was comparable to commercialized bacterial EPS. Among the tested Cobetia strains, GM-EPS and C. crustatorum EPS were significantly more viscous than other known Cobetia spp. The major constituents of GM-EPS polysaccharide were fucose, glucose, and galactose, which was distinct from exopolysaccharide of known Cobetia spp. This is the first report of a Cobetia sp. strain that produces fucose-rich EPS. GM-EPS protein was rich in hydrophobic and uncharged nonpolar amino acids. GM-EPS exhibited strong emulsion-stabilizing activity that was 1.5 times higher than xanthan.
40052378	Betaproteobacterial clade II nosZ activated under high N2O concentrations in paddy soil microcosms.	Microbial communities in paddy soils act as potential sinks of nitrous oxide (N2O), a notorious greenhouse gas, but their potential to reduce external N2O is unclear. The direct observation of N2O reduction in submerged field soils is technically difficult. Here, we aimed to identify soil microbial clades that underpin the strong N2O mitigation capacity.
40052550	Improving phosphorus availability in saline-alkaline agricultural soils through biochar and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) inoculation: a greenhouse experiment.	Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for life on earth and a limiting nutrient for plant growth. However, its availability in saline-alkaline soils is significantly reduced, adversely affecting plant productivity. Saline-alkaline soil is a widespread problem that severely affects plant growth and productivity. The <i>Parthenium</i>-derived biochar (PB) and Sewage sludge-derived biochar (SSB) were analyzed for pH, electric conductivity (EC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), calorific values (CV), and surface area (SSA). The phosphate solubilizing index (SI; 2.83 mM) and quantitative analysis (521.5 µg ml<sup>-1</sup>) were suggested that PSB-01 efficient and the strain identified through 16S rRNA sequencing techniques. The experiment was based on completely randomized block design (CRBD) with triplicates. The results revealed that the application of PB, SSB, and PSB-01 significantly improved <i>Spinacia oleracea</i> (<i>S. oleracea</i>) growth as compared to the control. The highest growth was observed in the combined amendments as compared to single once in both 1% and 3%. The highest reduction in cation and anion concentrations was observed in the combined applications of PB, SSB and PSB-01 for 1% and 3%. The combined application of biochar along with PSB-01 can enhance soil properties (pH, CEC, SSA anoins and cations) and promote plant growth, offering a sustainable solution for saline-alkaline agricultural soil. This study employs an innovative approach by combining biochars derived from <i>Parthenium</i> and sewage sludge with phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSBs) to address multiple issues simultaneously: mitigating saline-alkaline soil, controlling <i>Parthenium</i> overgrowth, and managing sewage sludge problems.
40052820	Checkpoint kinases regulate the circadian clock after DNA damage by influencing chromatin dynamics.	The interplay between circadian clocks, the cell cycle, and DNA repair has been extensively documented, yet the epigenetic control of circadian clocks by DNA damage responses remains relatively unexplored. Here, we showed that checkpoint kinases CHK1/2 regulate chromatin structure during DNA damage in Neurospora crassa to maintain robust circadian rhythms. Under DNA damage stress, deletion of chk1/2 disrupted the rhythmic transcription of the clock gene frq by suppressing the rhythmic binding of the transcription activator White Collar complex (WCC) at the frq promoter, as the chromatin structure remained condensed. Mechanistically, CHK1/2 interacted with WC-2 and were recruited by WCC to bind at the frq promoter to phosphorylate H3T11, promoting H3 acetylation, especially H3K56 acetylation, to counteract the histone variant H2A.Z deposition, thereby establishing a suitable chromatin state to maintain robust circadian rhythms despite DNA damage. Additionally, a genome-wide correlation was discovered between H3T11 phosphorylation and H3K56 acetylation, showing a specific function at the frq promoter that is dependent on CHK1/2. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that CHK1/2 are responsible for robust rhythmic transcription of metabolic and DNA repair genes during DNA damage. These findings highlight the essential role of checkpoint kinases in maintaining robust circadian rhythms under DNA damage stress.
40053052	Characterization of a G. max × G. soja nested association mapping population and identification of loci controlling seed composition traits from wild soybean.	Wild soybean (Glycine soja Siebold & Zucc.) has valuable genetic diversity for improved disease resistance, stress tolerance, seed protein content and seed sulfur-containing amino acid concentrations. Many studies have reported loci controlling seed composition traits based on cultivated soybean populations, but wild soybean has been largely overlooked. In this study, a nested association mapping (NAM) population consisting of 10 families and 1107 recombinant inbred lines was developed by crossing 10 wild accessions with the common cultivar NC-Raleigh. Seed composition of the F<sub>6</sub> generation grown at two locations was phenotyped, and genetic markers were identified for each line. The average number of recombination events in the wild soybean-derived population was significantly higher than that in the cultivated soybean-derived population, which resulted in a higher resolution for QTL mapping. Segregation bias in almost all NAM families was significantly biased toward the alleles of the wild soybean parent. Through single-family linkage mapping and association analysis of the entire NAM population, new QTLs with positive allele effects were identified from wild parents, including 5, 6, 18, 9, 16, 17 and 20 for protein content, oil content, total protein and oil content, methionine content, cysteine content, lysine content and threonine content, respectively. Candidate genes associated with these traits were identified based on gene annotations and gene expression levels in different tissues. This is the first study to reveal the genetic characteristics of wild soybean-derived populations, landscapes and the extent of effects of QTLs and candidate genes controlling traits from different wild soybean parents.
40053144	Research on the traceability and treatment of nitrate pollution in groundwater: a comprehensive review.	The preservation of groundwater quality is essential for maintaining the integrity of the water ecological cycle. The preservation of groundwater quality is crucial for sustaining the integrity of the water ecological cycle. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) has emerged as a pervasive contaminant in groundwater, attracting significant research attention due to its extensive distribution and the potential environmental consequences it poses. The primary sources of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution include soil organic nitrogen, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, domestic sewage, industrial wastewater, landfill leachate, as well as organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and manure. A comprehensive understanding of these sources is imperative for devising effective strategies to mitigate NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> contamination. Technologies for tracing NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-polluted groundwater include hydrochemical analysis, nitrogen and oxygen isotope techniques, microbial tracers, and numerical simulations. Quantitative isotope analysis frequently necessitates the application of mathematical models such as IsoSource, IsoError, IsoConc, MixSIR, SIAR, and MixSIAR to deduce the origins of pollution. This study provides a summary of the application scenarios, as well as the strengths and limitations of these models. In terms of remediation, pump and treat and permeable reactive barrier are predominant technologies currently employed. These approaches are designed to remove or reduce NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in groundwater, thereby restoring its quality. The study offers a systematic examination of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution, encompassing its origins, detection methodologies, and remediation approaches, highlighting the role of numerical simulations and integrating multidisciplinary knowledge. Additionally, this review delves into technological advancements and future trends concerning the detection and treatment of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution in groundwater. It proposes methods to control the spread of pollution and acts as a guide for identifying and preventing pollution sources.
40053150	pH induced incongruent-dissolution impacts Al-ferrihydrite transformations and As mobilization.	This study investigated the role of Al and As fate during the transformation process of ferrihydrite influenced by different pH values under oxic conditions. The results indicate that the Al doping greatly enhanced the transformation of ferrihydrite (Fh) to Al-substituted goethite at all acidic or alkaline pH values under oxic conditions by promoting the incongruent dissolution and reprecipitation reactions of Al-substituted ferrihydrite (AlFh). Under acidic conditions, the preferential dissolution of structural Fe (4.73 mg/L) from AlFh occurs, whereas under alkaline conditions, the preferential dissolution of structural Al (1.25 mg/L) takes place. In contrast, under neutral conditions, the low solubility of Fh and AlFh induces the significant particle assembly, with Fe/Al minerals primarily transforming into goethite through oriented aggregation. As predominantly remains in an adsorbed state at all pH values during the transformation of Fh and AlFh, with the highest proportion of adsorbed As (86.9-96.7%) observed under neutral conditions. During the aging process, the adsorbed As gradually transforms into non-extractable As, and the changes in As speciation within Fe/Al minerals are closely coupled with the transformation of AlFh and Fh. Under alkaline and acidic conditions, the proportion of non-extractable As in the transformation products of Fh and AlFh increases by 14.02-19.72% and 12.27-16.28%, respectively, while under neutral conditions, it increases only by 12-13.02%. Therefore, regulating soil pH can partially modify As speciation and mitigate its environmental impact by altering the mineral transformation process. The results of this study facilitate better understanding of the role of Al substitution in the transformation of Fh and the cycling of As in the environment.
40053521	Redox-inactive CC-type glutaredoxins interfere with TGA transcription factor-dependent repression of target promoters in roots.	Changes in nitrogen (N) availability in the soil trigger transcriptional responses in plants to optimize N acquisition, allocation, and remobilization. In roots of N-starved Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants, transcriptional activation of genes encoding, for example, low-affinity nitrate transporters, depends on 4 related C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE DOWNSTREAM (CEPD) proteins, also known as ROXY6, ROXY7, ROXY8, and ROXY9. All 21 ROXYs found in A. thaliana interact with members of the TGACG-binding (TGA) family of transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate that 2 Clade I TGAs (TGA1, TGA4) serve as molecular links between CEPDs and their target promoters in roots. In the roxy6 roxy7 roxy8 roxy9 quadruple mutant (named cepd in this manuscript), transcriptional activation of N-starvation-inducible genes is impaired, most likely due to the association of Clade I TGAs with a repressive complex at their target promoters. In wild-type plants, this repressive complex is nonfunctional, and gene expression may be regulated by the N supply-regulated ratio of CEPDs over opposing ROXYs containing the TOPLESS-interacting ALWL motif. Although CEPDs resemble glutaredoxins with glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase activity, a ROXY9 variant with a mutation in the catalytic cysteine in its putative active site can confer wild-type-like regulation of target genes. This finding demonstrates that ROXY9 does not function through redox-dependent mechanisms.
40053538	Hygroscopic effect of high clay-content shale under temperature and humidity conditions and its impact on mechanical properties.	High clay-content shale, containing hydrophilic clay minerals, is highly sensitive to environmental temperature and humidity. It readily absorbs moisture from the air, leading to increased water content and reduced mechanical strength, which poses challenges for underground structures, such as mining roadways, tunnels, and storage chambers. This study investigates the influence of temperature and humidity on the water content of high clay-content shale during its hygroscopic process and examines the evolution of its mechanical properties under variations in water content, aiming to reveal the effects of environmental temperature and humidity on the mechanical behavior of high clay-content shale. Hygroscopic experiments were conducted using a temperature and humidity chamber, with quartz sand as non-clay mineral control groups, and strength experiments were performed on reconstituted shale samples with varying water content. Results from the hygroscopic experiments showed that the equilibrium water content (EWC) of high clay-content shale decreases with lower humidity and higher temperature. When the humidity decreased from 100% RH to 80% RH, the average EWC dropped from 15.88% to 7.53%. Under high-humidity conditions (100% RH), the EWC decreased to 11.92% only after the temperature increased to 30°C. Within the experimental conditions, reducing humidity was found to be more effective than increasing temperature in reducing EWC. Based on the mechanical test results, reducing humidity can decrease the loss of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) caused by moisture absorption from approximately 50% to 15.48%. The results indicate that humidity is the primary factor influencing the EWC and mechanical properties of high clay-content shale. Reducing humidity can significantly mitigate strength loss caused by moisture absorption, while increasing temperature plays a supplementary role. These findings provide a scientific basis for controlling temperature and humidity in underground engineering to enhance structural stability.

40054134	Pseudomonas syringae exacerbates apple replant disease caused by Fusarium.	Apple replant disease (ARD) causes significant economic losses globally, including in China. Analyzing the causes of this replant disease from the perspective of rhizosphere microecology is therefore essential. In this study, we examined rhizosphere soils from apple trees subjected to continuous cropping. The mechanisms underlying ARD were elucidated through high-throughput sequencing of the soil microbiome, co-occurrence network analysis using NetShift, and correlation analyses. Core bacterial microbes were isolated, and their roles in altering the microecological environment were verified through reinoculation experiments. The results indicated that the disease indices for apple seedlings cultivated increased in continuously cropped soils. Bacterial diversity decreased in continuously cropped apple orchards for 10 years (R10) and 15 years (R15), but the relative abundance of Pseudomonas increased. In contrast, fungal diversity increased, with the relative abundance of Fusarium also increasing. As a dominant genus, Pseudomonas exhibited significant network variation after 10 years of consecutive cultivation, suggesting that this microorganism may play a key role in the occurrence of ARD. Moreover, the correlation analysis revealed, for the first time, that Pseudomonas is negatively correlated with bacterial diversity but positively correlated with the relative abundance of Fusarium, indicating a close relationship between Pseudomonas and Fusarium in continuously cropped soil. Four key Pseudomonas amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) strains were isolated from the continuously cropped rhizosphere soil of apple trees, and reinoculation experiments verified that introducing Pseudomonas exacerbated the occurrence of replant diseases in both strawberry and apple, with significantly higher disease indices compared to single Fusarium inoculation. The findings of this study provide new and timely insights into the mechanism underlying the occurrence of ARD.
40054189	Methods to optimize the collection, pretreatment, extraction, separation, and examination of microplastics in soil, groundwater, and human samples.	Microplastics (MPs) in soil, groundwater, and human (SGH) present a significant global challenge due to their ecological and human health impacts. However, current protocols for detecting MPs in these environments and humans are limited, inconsistently applied, and vary significantly, particularly during the pretreatment stages of MP analysis. Moreover, no study has investigated the impact of methodological flaws on MP detection. This study conducted a thorough global assessment of the existing soil and groundwater (SG) pretreatment methods, using statistical tests to evaluate their effectiveness. It also reviewed filtration and analytical techniques for MPs in SGH samples. The analysis included research articles from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science published between 2015 and 2024. Findings show that pretreatment using more than 100 g of soil can impact MP quantification, likely due to soil heterogeneity, while groundwater volume did not significantly affect MP quantification, likely due to the homogeneity of groundwater. During SGH pretreatment, various salts (e.g., ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl) can be used for density flotation. Fenton's reagent was found to be a better choice than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for organic material removal because less heat was released. Post treatment MPs in SGH samples can be analyzed using various instruments and resolutions such as FTIR down to 1-5 µm, ATR-FTIR down to 2 µm, micro-Raman down to 500 nm, and LDIR down to 1 µm. This study lays the foundation for developing an effective MP analysis in SGH.
40054190	Impact of microplastic concentration on soil nematode communities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: Evidence from a field-based microcosms experiment.	Microplastics are an emerging pollutant that poses a threat to local ecosystems. Recent studies have revealed that microplastics have penetrated the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. While previous studies have investigated the migration and distribution of microplastics and their effects on soil properties, their effects on soil fauna communities remain underexplored. Here, we conducted a 1-year microplastic addition experiment to evaluate the responses of soil nematode communities and employed piecewise structural equation modeling to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of microplastics on these communities. We found that: (1) nematode abundance, diversity, and metabolic footprints exhibited a hump-shaped response to microplastic treatments, peaking at the 0.1 % treatment; (2) nematode biomass was significantly affected by microplastics, with the lowest biomass observed at the 10 % treatment; (3) the direct effects of microplastics on nematode abundance outweighed indirect effects, particularly influencing fungivores and omnivorous nematodes; (4) although microplastics did not significantly alter energy flow within nematode communities, the relationship between the energy flow of fungivores and omnivorous was stronger than those among other trophic groups. Our study offers insights on microplastics' impact on nematode communities and their varied responses to microplastic concentrations, crucial for understanding ecological effects on soil ecosystems.
40054196	Biotic and abiotic drivers of soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and metal dynamic changes during spontaneous restoration of Pb-Zn mining wastelands.	The biotic and abiotic mechanisms that drive important biogeochemical processes (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and metals dynamics) in metal mine revegetation remains elusive. Metagenomic sequencing was used to explored vegetation, soil properties, microbial communities, functional genes and their impacts on soil processes during vegetation restoration in a typical Pb-Zn mine. The results showed a clear niche differentiation between bacteria, fungi and archaea. Compared to bacteria and fungi, the archaea richness were more tightly coupled with natural restoration changes. The relative abundances of CAZyme-related, denitrification-related and metal resistance genes reduced, while nitrification, urease, inorganic phosphorus solubilisation, phosphorus transport, and phosphorus regulation -related genes increased. Redundancy analysis, hierarchical partitioning analysis, relative-importance analysis and partial least squares path modelling, indicated that archaea diversity, primarily influenced by available lead, directly impacts carbon dynamics. Functional genes, significantly affected by available cadmium, directly alter nitrogen dynamics. Additionally, pH affects phosphorus dynamics through changes in bacterial diversity, while metal dynamics are directly influenced by vegetation. These insights elucidate natural restoration mechanisms in mine and highlight the importance of archaea in soil processes.
40054239	Long-term free-air-CO<sub>2</sub>-enrichment increases carbon distribution in the stable fraction in the deep layer of non-clay soils.	Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere can increase plant C input into soils. However, in dryland cropping systems, it remains unclear how eCO<sub>2</sub> may alter soil organic C content and stability in relation to potential changes in microbial community composition and whether these changes may depend on soil type and depth. Using an eight-year free-air-CO<sub>2</sub>-enrichment (SoilFACE) system, this study addressed these questions in three farming soils including a sandy Calcarosol, a clay Vertosol and a silt loam Chromosol at depths of 0-40 cm. Long-term eCO<sub>2</sub> did not change soil C content or its distribution in different C fractions in the top 30-cm soil. The majority of the relatively abundant bacterial taxa significantly affected by eCO<sub>2</sub> in the 0-10 cm layer were copiotrophic; this also occurred to fungal community, except for the Calcarosol where some saprotrophs showed a decreasing trend. These changes in microbial taxa indicate that eCO<sub>2</sub> accelerated the decomposition of both new and pre-existing C pools in the topsoil. Although eCO<sub>2</sub> did not change soil C content in the 30-40 cm layer, it increased soil C content in the stable C fraction associated with particles < 50 μm in the Calcarosol (by 39%) and particles < 2 μm in the Chromosol (by 29%). In the 30-40 cm layer of the Calcarosol, many fungal saprotrophs were enriched, and the abundance of fungal community increased under eCO<sub>2</sub>. Further investigation is warranted on whether the enhanced stability subsoil C under eCO<sub>2</sub> results from the leaching of stable organic molecules from the topsoil to the subsoil for buildup in the non-clay Calcarosol and Chromosol. Overall, these findings suggest that eCO<sub>2</sub> is likely to enhance soil C stability in the deeper parts of the profile of non-clay soils.
40054240	Scarcity of pesticide data in New Zealand with a focus on neonicotinoids: A review.	Since Europe's 2018 neonicotinoid ban on outdoor use of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, there has been growing political, scientific, and public interest in further understanding the impact of neonicotinoids on bees and the environment. Here, we assessed the trends in pesticide use in New Zealand, with a particular focus on neonicotinoids, to aid discussion on their use and associated risks. Obtaining data on annual trends in pesticide quantities is challenging, as there is no central collection of pesticide data across the agrichemical or regulatory sectors in New Zealand. Consequently, the true scale and frequency of pesticide usage, including neonicotinoids, remain largely unknown. The difference in neonicotinoid use patterns between New Zealand, where 45 % of forage brassicas (annual planting) and pastures (infrequent planting) are grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds, and northern hemisphere countries, where 56 % to over 90 % of annual food crops rely on neonicotinoid-treated seeds, indicates a lower overall neonicotinoid use in New Zealand. This difference underscores the need for region-specific approaches to pesticide management and regulation. Although residues can persist and migrate in the soil, current regulations only consider the risk of foliar spray to protect honey bees, overlooking the potential risks to native bees, which primarily live underground, as well as wider lethal and sublethal impacts of residues on non-target organisms. The lack of publicly accessible pesticide data limits scientific research on non-target and environmental effects, and the absence of readily available substitutes for neonicotinoids is the key challenge to be overcome in order to better manage the impact of these pesticides on New Zealand ecosystems.
40054241	An assessment of the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrate and trace element concentrations in groundwater in coastal districts of Bangladesh.	Groundwater is considered a significant source of drinking water around the world. However, the naturally occurring trace elements, mostly As, B, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn are proven to deteriorate the groundwater quality. This study aimed to evaluate the seasonal distribution of trace metals and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in groundwater and the associated risk to human health in the coastal region of Bangladesh. The result indicated that As exceeded the WHO and BDWS limits during wet and dry seasons in several coastal districts. Despite the abundant presence of Fe throughout the entire study area, it does not present any significant health risk. But alarming conditions of Mn have been observed all over the coastal area in both seasons. Aquifers with shallow depths showed to be more contaminated than deeper ones. The spatial distribution maps showed that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Cr were found in high concentration in some similar areas during the dry season. The studied elements showed a pattern in exceeding of WHO permissible limits such as Fe > Mn > As > Cr > NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in wet season and Mn > Fe > As > Cr > NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in dry season. Therefore, high non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk was found among adult and children population via oral exposure. Most of the samples showed cancer risk at medium to very high. The principal component analysis observed the pollution sources, revealing that groundwater contamination in this region was mostly due to geogenic sources. This study clearly showed that the groundwater in coastal districts is heavily contaminated, which is a concerning issue. The aforementioned findings have given some clarity on the coastal region's groundwater quality state, which can be beneficial in formulating a plan safe water supply.
40054248	Long-term trends of streamwater chemistry in an agricultural watershed: Effects of anthropogenic and climatic factors.	The chemistry of headwater streams is a key indicator of the health of riparian zones and surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. This chemistry is shaped by biogeochemical processes, including chemical weathering, and anthropogenic activities that interact with one another and are sensitive to climate. Elucidating trends in streamwater chemistry and the drivers that underpin them is essential for informing land-management decisions and anticipating water-quality issues that may affect downstream waters. In this work, we investigated the effects of anthropogenic and climatic factors on long-term variations in the chemistry of a first-order stream draining an agricultural catchment nested within the Sleepers River Research Watershed in Vermont, USA. We observed statistically significant increases in alkalinity and the concentrations of calcium and magnesium over a 31-year period for which 17 years of measurements were available. Through the application of generalized linear models, we found that the upward trends in alkalinity and calcium were associated with rising air temperatures, while a response to historical acid deposition played a minor role. We hypothesize that increased production of biogenic carbon dioxide and organic acids in soil and groundwater may lead to increases in chemical weathering rates under warmer climate conditions. This study emphasizes the important role of rising temperatures in the long-term increase in streamwater alkaline solutes, potentially overshadowing other influences like acidification recovery and agricultural practices. It also highlights the importance of comprehensive, long-term research to understand climate impacts on chemical weathering and inland water chemistry, which is critical for managing water quality and understanding regional and global carbon cycles.
40054280	Groundwater pollution management with source remediation and composite geomembrane cut-off wall: An analytical model and field investigation.	This study proposes a two-dimensional analytical model for contaminant migration through the composite GMB cut-off wall (CGCW) and aquifer system considering the effects of the leakage and source remediation. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol's method is conducted to investigate the key impacts of contaminant distribution and degradation rate in the source, cut-off wall retardation factor and Darcy velocity in CGCW. The results show that the performance of the CGCW significantly is controlled by the leakage. The peak contaminant concentration at the outlet of CGCW for large leakage (10<sup>-8</sup> m/s) can be 77.1 times larger than that for small leakage (10<sup>-11</sup> m/s), with a performance deterioration of 98.7 %. Additionally, the performance of the CGCW can be significantly enhanced by the source remediation technique. The CGCW will not be broken through when contaminant source degradation rate is larger than 2.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup> /s. Increasing the cut-off wall retardation factors (> 14.7) and decreasing the standard deviation of contaminant source distribution (< 0.1) can also improve the CGCW performance. Moreover, the analytical model coupled with the genetic algorithm is used for the CGCW leakage detection and performance prediction at an abandoned pesticide site based on the monitoring data. Accurate leakage detections in the field (with errors of < 5 m) can be achieved through the analytical solution, which is validated by the non-destructive high-voltage technique. The analytical solution can be an easy-to-use tool for the design, installation and construction of the CGCW at polluted sites.
40054342	Interpretation of ecotoxicity tests using Enchytraeus albidus: Weight of soil characteristics in conditions of diffuse pollution.	One way to evaluate the impact of chemical substances released in the ecosystems is the use of terrestrial organisms in ecotoxicological bioassays. Enchytraeus albidus (Oligochaeta) is a species commonly used in such standardized bioassays aiming at identifying biological responses as life traits (survival and reproduction) using artificial spiked soils or in situ contaminated soils. However, in the latter case, it is known that other factors such as soil characteristics may affect the responses in E. albidus. We hypothesized that, in cases of low diffuse pollution, soil characteristics are major confounding factors that interfere with the interpretation of life trait responses in bioassays when their influence outweighs that of the diffuse pollution itself. To evaluate these confounding factors, 20 soils were collected from a low-contamination area encompassing diverse landscapes (urban, peri-urban, and rural) that exhibited gradients in pedological characteristics, biological parameters, and organic and inorganic contaminant levels, all within the range of classical values considered optimal for reproduction. E. albidus individuals were exposed to each soil sample, and survival and reproduction were monitored as life traits. Soil clustering and multifactorial analysis were employed to identify the confounding factors. Regardless of the life trait, low and sublethal contamination was rarely an explanatory factor for the responses of E. albidus. Survival was unaffected by soil characteristics or diffuse pollution. In contrast, reproduction was significantly and positively associated with soil pH and the levels of exchangeable sodium, calcium carbonate, molybdenum, PAHs, and insecticides, while it was negatively influenced by aluminum and exchangeable manganese. These findings suggest that studies conducted under conditions of diffuse, sublethal contamination should consider multiple natural soil characteristics in ecotoxicological bioassays to enable meaningful comparisons.
40054351	Decoupled response of aboveground and belowground ecosystem multifunctionality to shrub encroachment in a semiarid grassland.	Large-scale shrub encroachment poses significant challenges for the preservation and enhancement of ecosystem functions and services in grassland ecosystems. However, the impacts of shrub encroachment on grassland ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) remain poorly understood. This study assessed the impact of shrub encroachment on 23 key ecosystem functions in a semiarid grassland, as well as the influence of plant, soil, and microbial factors on both aboveground and belowground EMF. Compared with areas with slight shrub encroachment, most individual aboveground ecosystem functions increased by 62.24%-251.05% with moderate shrub encroachment (p < 0.05). However, these functions significantly decreased (42.96-96.91%) under severe and extremely severe shrub encroachment. In contrast, individual belowground ecosystem functions consistently decreased across all stages of shrub encroachment, with reductions between 29.27% and 94.85% (p < 0.05). Shrub encroachment caused a decoupled response pattern, with the aboveground EMF initially increasing but then decreasing (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.83, p < 0.001), whereas the belowground EMF decreased linearly (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.86, p < 0.001). Soil bulk density and bacterial community composition were identified as the primary drivers of variations in aboveground EMF, whereas plant community composition and soil pH were crucial for regulating belowground EMF. Moreover, plant diversity was essential for maintaining both aboveground and belowground EMF. This study highlights the importance of considering both the stage of shrub encroachment and the specific ecosystem functions affected. These results emphasize the pivotal role of soil and microbial factors in shaping EMF, which is critical for predicting ecosystem responses to extensive changes in vegetation driven by intensifying climate change and human activities.
40054352	Combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD facilitates phytoremediation of heavy metals and carbon sequestration: A field experiment.	A field study examined the impact of γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA), both alone and in combination with dicyandiamide (DCD), on the phytoremediation of soil contaminated with Cd, Pb, and Zn. This study focused on the heavy metal (HM) accumulation, and soil CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in Cosmos sulphureus and Pennisetum americanum × P. purpureum, and soil microbial communities. The findings indicated that the application of γ-PGA, either alone or in combination with DCD, increased plant yield and HM bioavailability in the soil, leading to improved HM uptake by plants. For P. americanum × P. purpureum, compared to CK treatment, the combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD increased the Cd, Pb, and Zn extraction by 131.4%, 80.6%, and 99.7%, respectively. Compared to γ-PGA alone, the combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD reduced the soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission and global warming potential by 26.4% and 39.1%, respectively. P. americanum × P. purpureum treated with γ-PGA and DCD achieved C sequestration of 829 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the application of γ-PGA, alone or in combination with DCD, increased the abundance of soil microbes. Bacteria (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Firmicutes) as well as fungi (Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota) contributed to HM accumulation and resistance to stress by altering soil enzyme activities, C and N fractions. Additionally, Acidobacteriota and Patescibacteria are beneficial to reducing soil GHG emissions and GWP in P. americanum × P. purpureum soil treated with γ-PGA and DCD. In conclusion, P. americanum × P. purpureum with the combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD increased HM extraction and total C sequestration in the plant-soil system. This approach offers a scientific basis and promising approach for integrating phytoremediation with C sequestration.
40054356	Unveiling the nitrogen metabolism mechanism for nitrogen retention in compost via in-situ ammonia recycling strategy.	A large amount of ammonia volatilization in compost causes environmental pollution and reduces the quality of compost. Ammonia recycling composting strategy (ARCS) is new strategy for reducing ammonia volatilization by absorbing with backfilling ammonia into the compost. This study revealed the mechanism of ARCS on ammonia volatilization and nitrogen retention during chicken manure composting. The results showed that the adsorption layer containing wood vinegar had an obvious inhibition effect on ammonia volatilization. Compared to CK, ARCS treatment could reduce ammonia emissions and nitrogen loss by 20.65% and 39.6% with T3 (12d), respectively. Different adsorption time would affect the occurrence of various nitrogen components in the adsorption layer, especially the change of inorganic nitrogen content. Metagenomic analysis showed that ARCS treatment resulted in significant changes in bacterial communities, and different backfilling times had significant effects on nitrogen metabolism pathways in compost. Glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase were the key nitrogen metabolism processes during composting, which played an important role in ammonia volatilization and nitrogen retention. The suitable backfilling time (12d) promoted the acceleration of ammonia nitrogen metabolism in the early stage of composting and enhanced the ammonia assimilation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction function in the maturation stage to achieve nitrogen retention. This study provided valuable insights into the effects of in-situ ammonia absorption and backfilling on nitrogen metabolism pathways during composting.
40054359	Prioritizing microbial functions over soil quality for enhanced multifunctionality in saline-sodic soil remediation.	Paddy cultivation has become a widely adopted approach for saline-sodic wasteland reclamation, aiming to mitigate the food crisis and enhance soil quality. Nevertheless, the impact of long-term paddy cultivation on the interplay between soil quality, microbial metabolic functions, and soil ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) remains unclear. Here, we evaluated soil physicochemical properties, the abundance of 132 biomarker functional genes, and soil EMF across a 78-year period of saline-sodic paddy cultivation. After 78 years of paddy cultivation, soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) decreased by 43.38% and 93.02% compared to saline-sodic wasteland (WL), respectively. Moreover, principal component analysis was used to select a minimal dataset of soil indicators and to establish a soil quality index (SQI). Significant positive correlations were observed between SQI and rice yield, implying that soil quality was the main factor driving increases in saline-sodic farmland. The Mantel test indicates that soil microbial biomass, SQI, and the availability of nutrients exhibit a significant positive relationship with the abundance and expression of genes related to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling, encompassing crucial biogeochemical processes like hemicellulose degradation, C fixation, N degradation, and organic P mineralization. This indicates that changes in soil physicochemical properties significantly affect biogeochemical cycling in saline-sodic soils. Differences in the abundance of microbial P core functional genes explained 41.9% of variation in soil EMF, followed by key soil physicochemical indicators (EC, available potassium, microbial biomass nitrogen, etc.) selected through random forest analysis. Further, we identified a key threshold for changes in soil EMF during long-term saline-sodic paddy cultivation, with EMF increasing for the first 20 years of restoration before decreasing thereafter. Finally, partial least squares path modeling revealed the roles of microbial functional genes and SQI in driving soil EMF before and after the threshold. Soil EMF is primarily influenced by the significant negative effects of P functional genes prior to the threshold value, whereas beyond the threshold, it is mainly affected by the positive effects of C functional genes. These findings provide insights into the functional restoration and sustainable development of saline-sodic agricultural ecosystems.
40054360	Localized nutrient management practices enhance the environmental-economic sustainability in potato production of China.	Potatoes, as the fourth most important staple crop in China, play a crucial role in ensuring national food security. However, potato production is heavily reliant on inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, leading to significant environmental challenges that compromise the sustainability of this production. A systematic evaluation of the current state of potato production sustainability in China and its potential for improvement is an urgent scientific issue that needs to be addressed. This study employs emergy sustainability index (ESI), energy return on investment (EROI), energy efficiency cost (EEC), and energy exchange ratio (EnER) methods to assess the environmental and economic aspects of potato production at the county level in China. Results indicate that, in 2015, the average ESI, EROI, EEC, and EnER for potato production in China were 1.37 (0.1-5.4), 2.21 (0.18-7.44), 0.06 (0.01-0.48) $/MJ, and 13.52 (2.68-112.40) MJ/$, respectively, with considerable spatial heterogeneity at the county level. Regions with higher sustainability in potato production are primarily concentrated in the northwest, which is also China's main potato-growing area. The random forest analysis identified yield, phosphorus, and nitrogen fertilizers as key factors influencing the sustainability of potato production. Regionally differentiated fertilizer management strategies led to a 43% and 35% increase in ESI and EROI, respectively, while EEC and EnER decreased by 50% and 47%. This study systematically explores the relationship between the environmental and economic dimensions of potato production from an energy perspective and proposes optimized management strategies for synergistic environmental-economic development. It provides methodological support and scientific guidance for promoting sustainable potato production and offers insights for global potato sustainability systems.
40054362	Micro and mesofauna: Pioneering sustainable solutions for fly ash rejuvenation.	Persistent accumulation of fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion, poses significant environmental challenges due to its elevated levels of toxicity, heavy metal contamination, and ecological issues. Present review explores the ecological significance and functional potential of microfauna and mesofauna in mitigating environmental impacts, focusing on their ability to rehabilitate fly ash dump sites into biologically active and sustainable ecosystems. Microfaunal groups, including protozoa, nematodes, and other small invertebrates, play essential roles in promoting soil aggregation, pollutant biotransformation, and nutrient cycling while fostering synergistic interactions with plant communities to accelerate bioremediation processes and biodiversity recovery. The review also examines the constraints imposed by site-specific factors such as extreme pH, heavy metal toxicity, and organic matter deficiencies, offering targeted strategies to enhance remediation efficiency. It includes bioaugmentation with metal-tolerant strains, organic amendments to enrich soil fertility, and the integration of mycorrhizal fungi to optimize nutrient uptake and establishement of vegetation. The findings underscore the transformative potential of microfauna and mesofauna-based approaches for sustainable fly ash management, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary research and technological innovation to address the ecological and environmental challenges associated with fly ash disposal. This work highlights the promise of advancing microfauna-driven ecological restoration strategies to rehabilitate degraded landscapes and support long-term environmental resilience.
40054558	Assessing heavy metal pollution levels and associated ecological risks in peatland areas in the Mekong Delta region.	Heavy metal (HM) pollution in soils and sediment is a significant concern, yet its levels and ecological risks in peatland areas remain unexplored. This study evaluates these aspects in three peatland regions of the Long An province in Vietnam. Comparisons of HM concentrations in peatland sediments from Tan Thanh, Thanh Hoa, and Duc Hue provinces in the study locations revealed highest values in the Tan Thanh region. Specifically, Cu and Ni were found in sediments at levels two to three times higher than the threshold effects level (TEL) and the effects range median (ERL) guidelines. The main sources of HM pollution in the study area are predicted to include the production and use of fertilizers and pesticides, metal surface processing, mechanical engineering and electronics manufacturing, and chemical plants. Further, positive correlations between HM concentrations and factors such as pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and clay-silt ratio in the sediments were identified through Spearman correlation analysis. The results obtained from the correlation analysis were further corroborated by Bayesian network analysis, which was also applied in this study. In addition, the contamination factor (CF) index indicated that Ni has a pollution level of "moderate degree" in Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and "considerable degree" in Tan Thanh (CF = 3.2), whereas, Cu has a pollution level of "moderate degree" in both Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and Tan Thanh (CF = 2.4). The modified degree of contamination (mCd) ranked the areas as Tan Thanh > Thanh Hoa > Duc Hue, with mCd indexes of 1.3, 0.7, and 0.4, respectively. The potential ecological risk index (RI) indicated a "low risk" level, with an average RI of 35.6 across all sites. These findings address knowledge gaps in HM pollution in peatlands but also contribute to the development of strategies for the protection of peatlands.
40054564	Leaching dynamics of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> in urban soils of a semi-arid region: A quantitative analysis.	In this study, we evaluate the leaching process and movement of PTEs once they reach the soil profile in urban soils in a semiarid city in northwest Mexico. Concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> were quantified in an urban area using ion-exchange resin (IER) samplers. The IER is a passive method based on ion-exchange resins which allows sampling the transport of elements in macropores under unsaturated flow conditions. Samples were taken during three monitoring periods in a city influenced by the North American Monsoon (NAM). In the first monitoring period, the IER samplers showed leaching rates of 323.40 g Zn<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 15 wk<sup>-1</sup>, 361.90 g Pb<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>15 wk<sup>-1</sup>, and 31.9 g Cu<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>15 wk<sup>-1</sup>. The second period estimated 101.50 g Zn<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 37 wk<sup>-1</sup>, 58.20 g Pb<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 37 wk<sup>-1</sup>, and 20.00 g Cu<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 37 wk<sup>-1</sup>. Finally, in the third monitoring period concentrations of 141.90 g Zn<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>17 wk<sup>-1</sup>, 32.10 g Pb<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 17 wk<sup>-1</sup> and 20.70 g Cu<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 17 wk<sup>-1</sup> were found. The highest leaching rate of PTEs was identified in the central area of the city and its surroundings, influenced mainly by flood areas and high surface runoff. The results of this study demonstrate the role that monsoon rains and runoff plays in the movement and distribution of PTEs in urban areas.
40054568	Dissolved organic matter mitigates the toxicity of silver nanoparticles to freshwater algae: Effects on oxidative stress and membrane function.	The mechanisms underlying the destruction of cell membranes by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) remain unclear despite extensive studies on the toxicity of AgNPs to the cell membranes of aquatic organisms. This study investigated the impact of dissolved humic acid (DHA) on the toxicity of AgNPs and silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>) to Chlorella vulgaris cell membranes. Specifically, this research examined the alterations in membrane lipid peroxidation, cell membrane permeability, fatty acid (FA) profiles, membrane fluidity, and ultrastructural changes in algal cells resulting from Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs, both in the absence and the presence of DHA, as well as the potential cytoprotective effect of DHA. The results revealed that DHA promoted C. vulgaris growth, which increased the EC<sub>50</sub> of the AgNPs and Ag<sup>+</sup> from 180 μg L<sup>-1</sup> to 722 μg L<sup>-1</sup> and 25 μg L<sup>-1</sup> to 193 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. DHA addition significantly reduced algal membrane lipid peroxidation caused by Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs. Furthermore, DHA increased the permeability and potential of the algal cellular membranes, particularly in the presence of Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs. In the absence of DHA, both Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs significantly increased the relative content of saturated fatty acids (SFA), while decreasing the unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) levels (p < 0.05). Consequently, both forms of silver decreased the membrane fluidity of algal cells, which increased after adding DHA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the presence of DHA reduced cytoplasmic disintegration and vacuolization during exposure to Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs. These results suggest that DHA may regulate the FA composition of algal cell membranes, aiding C. vulgaris in maintaining membrane structure and function under the toxic stress induced by AgNPs and Ag<sup>+</sup>.
40054662	Planktonic versus colony growth of Bacillus thuringiensis affects gene expression in vitro and infectivity against an insect host, Galleria mellonella.	The entomopathogenic bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, can complete its life cycle in environments of varying densities like insects, cadavers and soil. The stationary growth phase of the bacterial lifecycle includes virulent, necrotrophic and sporulation stages, which are under the control of pleotropic regulators of quorum sensing. In addition to insecticidal Cry-toxins, B. thuringiensis can generate quorum-dependent virulence factors. Herein, we investigated the development of B. thuringiensis under conditions of planktonic and colony growth. Using an insect host, namely Galleria mellonella larvae, we observed distinct virulence profiles and differential expression of quorum regulatory genes between B. thuringiensis from liquid planktonic growth and those colonies on a solid surface/medium.
40054796	Characterization of Streptomyces species with poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) degradation capabilities isolated from rice field soil.	The shift towards sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based polymers has become essential for addressing environmental challenges. Among these alternatives, bio-plastics such as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) have gained considerable attention due to their biodegradability into water and carbon dioxide through microbial activity. PHB is one of the most widely commercialized bio-plastics. However, its excessive accumulation in the environment due to insufficient degradation remains a significant ecological concern. This study focused on isolating and characterizing PHB-degrading bacteria from soil samples collected from rice fields. Screening led to the identification of five PHB-degrading bacterial strains belonging to different genera. Among these, Streptomyces sp. AG7 and Streptomyces sp. RG41 were identified as the most effective PHB degraders. Their PHB-degrading abilities were evaluated in shake-flask cultures using PHB films as substrates. After 20 days of incubation at 37 °C, Streptomyces sp. AG7 and Streptomyces sp. RG41 achieved PHB degradation rates of approximately 74.7 % and 68.5 %, respectively. Additionally, both strains demonstrated the ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a key phytohormone that promotes plant growth, and exhibited phosphate-solubilizing activity, which enhances nutrient availability. Further analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed structural changes in the PHB films, while gel permeation chromatography (GPC) confirmed significant alterations in the polymer's molecular properties. These findings highlight the potential of utilizing soil-derived Streptomyces species for sustainable PHB waste management, in order to promote plant growth, improve soil fertility through phosphate solubilization, and contribute to agricultural sustainability.
40055365	Engineering the reversible redox electrochemistry on cuprous oxide for efficient chloride ion uptake.	To address the dual challenges of freshwater scarcity and energy storage demands, battery deionization has emerged as a promising technology for simultaneous salt removal and energy recovery. Compared to the significant research advancement in cation-storage electrodes, anion-storage counterparts remain a critical bottleneck thus limiting the industrialization of battery deionization technique. Here, we employ Cu<sub>2</sub>O as a Cl<sup>-</sup> storage electrode material, by engineering the electrochemical-driven reversible synthesis-decomposition process between Cu<sub>2</sub>O and Cu<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>Cl, the Cu<sub>2</sub>O electrode delivers the state-of-the-art high charge capacity of 286.3 ± 8.1 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> storage capacity of 203.5 ± 21.3 mg g<sup>-1</sup> in natural seawater. Ex-situ liquid cell electrochemical transmission electron microscopy and in-situ powder X-ray diffraction unveil a continuous and spatial confirmed electrochemical-driven electrode oxidation, spatial migration and crystallization mechanism engaged in the reversible structural transformation between Cu<sub>2</sub>O and Cu<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>Cl during battery deionization process. This work not only introduces a highly efficient electrode material for Cl<sup>-</sup> removal but also establishes a basis for leveraging the electrochemical-driven reversible synthesis-decomposition process and spatial confinement reversible structural transformation mechanism to design advanced electrode materials for diverse ion removal applications.
40055393	Seasonal dynamics of thraustochytrids in mangrove rhizospheres for microbial interactions, PUFA production.	This study investigated seasonal variations of thraustochytrids in rhizosphere soil collected from two mangrove species Rhizophora apiculata and Avicennia marina in natural and planted mangrove stands. Thraustochytrid counts were higher in the natural mangrove stand than in the planted site. The counts varied seasonally, being highest in the post-monsoon season followed by summer, monsoon, and pre-monsoon. Thraustochytrid counts exhibited positive correlations (p < 0.01) with counts of Total heterotrophic bacteria (THB), azotobacters, actinobacteria, fungi, yeasts, and Trichoderma. However, a negative correlation was observed with cyanobacteria. The counts also had positive correlation with silt, clay, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, chromium, copper, magnesium, cadmium, zinc and redox potential, but, negative correlations with temperature, pH, pore water salinity, total organic carbon and sand content of the soil samples. In the present study, 113 thraustochytrid strains were isolated from mangrove habitats. However, only 48 pure cultures survived after being sub-cultured three times. Based on survivability, color, and shape, two isolates from each sampling site in each season were selected. The predominant 24 isolates were identified based on their morphological, and molecular characteristics and were classified under five genera: Thraustochytrium, Schizochytrium, Botryochytrium, Parietichytrium, and Aurantiochytrium. Among the isolates, Aurantiochytrium sp. (AKTSK-06) produced the highest biomass of 15.71 g/L in the post-monsoon season (January-March, 2023), and Aurantiochytrium sp. (PVTSK-03) accumulated the highest lipid content of 61.33%. Thraustochytrids were found to contain Omega-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as EPA up to 8.89% in Aurantiochytrium sp. (VRTSK-01), DPA up to 9.65% in Aurantiochytrium sp. (AKTSK-03), and DHA up to 47.46% in Aurantiochytrium sp. (AKTSK-06). Thus, mangroves provide an ideal ecological niche for thraustochytrids with an abundant supply of omega-3 fatty acids for potential industrial applications.
40055403	Spatial interpolation of cropland soil bulk density by increasing soil samples with filled missing values.	Large sample sizes are crucial for accurately capturing spatial changes in soil properties by spatial interpolation methods. However, soil bulk density (BD) data in historical datasets is often incomplete, and it's uncertain if filled values enhance spatial interpolation accuracy. Using 2,883 cropland soil BD samples from the Sichuan Basin in China, we developed the best prediction models from traditional pedotransfer function (PTF), multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to fill missing BD values for 1,336 samples. We then applied ordinary kriging (OK) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) to map soil BD, incorporating the filled BD as modeling points. The RBFNN model, tailored for each sub-watershed, yielded the highest accuracy in filling missing BD, with an increase in coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) by 19.54-37.36% and reductions in mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square error (RMSE) by 8.91-14.81%, 9.02-16.22% and 7.71-13.61%, respectively. Incorporating filled BD data reduced the MAE, MRE, and RMSE of OK and IDW by 4.17%, 4.36%, 4.96%, and 6.54%, 6.92%, 8.15%, respectively, significantly lowering spatial interpolation uncertainty. This methodology improves the accuracy of soil property mapping in regions with incomplete historical data.
40055409	Mechanical mechanism of soil consolidation by plant roots in loess area of northern Shaanxi.	To reveal the evolution law of the mechanical failure of the root-soil composite and identify the main control factors and their coupling and mutual feeding relationship, this paper takes the most common naturally growing plants in Yan 'an area as the research object and studies the evolution process of the mechanical deformation and failure of the root-soil composite by applying the methods of in-situ pull-out test, indoor direct shear test of the root-soil composite, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis. The mechanical characteristics of root-soil interaction were analyzed, and the mechanism of root-soil fixation was explained. The results show that: (1) the root-soil composite's mechanical deformation and failure characteristics have obvious regularity and stages and are affected by plant growth state, root morphology, soil physical and mechanical properties, and other factors. (2) There are obvious evolutionary stages in the deformation and failure process of the root-soil composite, that is, the coordinated deformation stage of the root-soil, the stress redistribution stage, the secondary root break stage, the main root break stage and the complete failure stage, which correspond to the linear deformation section, the acceleration section, the shock rise section, the steep fall section and the residual deformation section of the F-S curve (Force-displacement curve)obtained by the in-situ pull out test. (3) In the in-situ pull-out test, the final failure body of the root-soil composite was inverted cone shape. The root fracture interface was basically near the boundary of the final inverted cone failure body, in which the stress state of the root system was directly affected by the stress-strain state of the microelement and the characteristics of the root material. (4) The plant roots showed obvious oblique deformation and axial tensile stress with the soil shear dislocation on the fracture surface, which verified the rationality of the "oblique root" hypothesis based on the transformation of shear stress to tensile stress.
40055491	CRISPR-Cas applications in agriculture and plant research.	Growing world population and deteriorating climate conditions necessitate the development of new crops with high yields and resilience. CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome engineering presents unparalleled opportunities to engineer crop varieties cheaper, easier and faster than ever. In this Review, we discuss how the CRISPR-Cas toolbox has rapidly expanded from Cas9 and Cas12 to include different Cas orthologues and engineered variants. We present various CRISPR-Cas-based methods, including base editing and prime editing, which are used for precise genome, epigenome and transcriptome engineering, and methods used to deliver the genome editors into plants, such as bacterial-mediated and viral-mediated transformation. We then discuss how promoter editing and chromosome engineering are used in crop breeding for trait engineering and fixation, and important applications of CRISPR-Cas in crop improvement, such as de novo domestication and enhancing tolerance to abiotic stresses. We conclude with discussing future prospects of plant genome engineering.
40055503	Ecological geological vulnerability assessment in Northern Shanxi Province (China) based on sensitivity resilience pressure (SRP) model.	Assessing ecological geological vulnerability is crucial for the protection and restoration of regional ecological environments. Considering the strategic ecological importance of Northern Shanxi Province in China, this study undertakes a thorough regional ecological geological vulnerability assessment, aiming to devise specific countermeasures and generate insightful research contributions. This methodology guides ecological environment evaluations and restorations in Northern Shanxi Province and similar Northwestern Chinese regions. Centering on Northern Shanxi Province, the study utilizes the Sensitivity-Resilience-Pressure (SRP) model to meticulously select 11 indicators, encompassing slope, soil erosion intensity, and the Enhanced Vegetation Indicator (EVI). The study establishes the ecological geological vulnerability index (EGVI) and the ecological geological vulnerability comprehensive index (EGVCI) for the first time, employing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to perform the ecological geological vulnerability assessment. The study results show that the EGVCI index for Northern Shanxi Province is approximately 3.96, which represents the ecological geological vulnerability of Northern Shanxi Province residing at a mild level. Regions with the moderate to extreme vulnerability represent about 23.7% of the total area, mainly distributed in the basin-mountain transition zones and the western low-mountain areas, with the primary ecological geological issues of environmental problems caused by open-pit mining activities, soil erosion, and land salinization. The driving factors of the vulnerability are soil erosion intensity, mineral exploitation intensity, water conservation capacity, land use type, slope, and EVI.
40055835	The universal accumulation of p-aminophenol during the microbial degradation of analgesic and antipyretic acetaminophen in WWTPs: a novel metagenomic perspective.	Acetaminophen, a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug, has become a significant aquatic micro-pollutant due to its extensive global production and increased consumption, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its high-water solubility leads to its pervasive presence in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), posing substantial risks to the environment and human health. Biological treatment is one of the promising approaches to remove such pollutants. Although previous studies have isolated acetaminophen-degrading pure cultures and proposed catabolic pathways, the interactions between microbiotas and acetaminophen, the distribution feature of acetaminophen degradation genes, and the gene-driven fate of acetaminophen in the real-world environment remain largely unexplored.
40055955	Unlocking the potential of genome editing in agriculture with tissue culture-free techniques.	Genome editing holds great promise for enhancing crop traits; however, progress has been slow due to inefficient delivery methods and reliance on tissue culture for regenerating edited plants, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address these limitations, innovative tissue culture-free techniques have been developed, including meristem editing through biolistic-mediated delivery and RNA virus-mediated delivery. New methods for de novo gene-edited meristem induction and root suckering-based cut-dip-budding have also been established. While these approaches show promise, each faces challenges that must be addressed for practical application in crop improvement. We discuss the transformative potential of these techniques for crop improvement and emphasize the need for ongoing research to refine them and maximize their agricultural impact.
40055973	Plant nitrogen uptake preference and drivers in natural ecosystems at the global scale.	Elucidating plant nitrogen (N) acquisition is crucial for understanding plant N strategies and ecosystem productivity. However, the variation in plant N uptake preference and its controlling factors on a global scale remain unclear. We conducted a global synthesis to explore plant N preference patterns and driving factors. Globally, the average contributions of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>), and glycine N to the total plant N uptake were 41.6 ± 1.1%, 32.8 ± 1.2%, and 25.6 ± 0.9%, respectively. However, plant N uptake preferences differed significantly among climatic regions and vegetation types. Soil NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> was the most preferred N form by plants in (sub)tropical regions, whereas NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference was significantly higher in high-latitude than low-latitude regions. Plant functional type was one of the most important factors driving NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference, with significantly higher NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference of nonwoody species than broadleaf-evergreen, conifer, and shrub species. Organic N preference was lowest in (sub)tropics and significantly lower than that in temperate and alpine regions. This study shows clear climatic patterns and different influencing factors of plant NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference, which can contribute to the accurate prediction of N constraints on ecosystem productivity and soil carbon dynamics.
40056020	Quantity Versus Quality: Links Between Soil Organic Matter and Bacterial Community Composition Along a Geoclimatic Gradient.	Soil organic matter (SOM) quantity drives soil bacterial community composition from the regional to global scale. Qualitative characteristics of SOM are known to affect soil bacterial communities in manipulation experiments. However, it remains unresolved how strongly SOM characteristics affect soil bacterial community composition at the macroscale. Here, we investigated how quantity versus qualitative characteristics of SOM shape community composition along a biogeochemical gradient of grassland soils. We assessed relative abundance patterns of soil bacteria and characterised SOM based on scalable methods. Soils with higher SOM content (along a continuum between 0.6% and 18.7% SOC) and acidic pH (along a continuum between pH 4.1-6.7) hosted fewer narrowly distributed taxa (i.e., taxa occurring in few sites) and therefore had lower bacterial alpha diversity. We could explain a larger fraction of bacterial community composition (up to 59.6% of 16S rRNA reads) in these soils. Consequently, we understand community composition in low-SOM soils less than in high-SOM soils, because the drivers of narrowly distributed taxa remain poorly understood. Qualitative SOM characteristics did not strongly affect biogeographical patterns of widely distributed soil bacterial taxa. This suggests that broad aspects of SOM quality do not dominate soil bacterial community composition at the investigated macroscale.
40056023	PARASITOPHYSIOART: EXPLORING THE INTERSECTION OF ART, PHYSIOLOGY, AND PARASITOLOGY ON STUDENTS´ PERCEPTION AND MOTIVATION.	This study explores the impact of integrating art into the teaching of physiology and parasitology to enhance student engagement, motivation, and perception. Thirty-seven biotechnology students from the Federal University of Paraíba, Brazil, enrolled in human physiology and parasitology courses and participated in the innovative ParasitoPhysioart project. The students were tasked with recreating artworks illustrating key parasitology concepts and their physiological effects on the human body. For instance, one group reinterpreted Wassily Kandinsky's "Several Circles" to represent the lifecycle of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and its effect on the eyes, highlighting how the parasite, transmitted through contaminated soil or food, can invade various organs, including the retina and choroid, potentially leading to blindness. Another group reimagined Clovis Jr.'s "Nossa Senhora Aparecida," replacing the original branches with drawings of <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, a parasite transmitted through contaminated fruits or vegetables. The artwork emphasized the parasite's impact on the lungs, which can cause symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. A voluntary survey answered after the project revealed that 62% of students (n=39) considered physiology challenging. However, about 86% reported that the multidisciplinary approach of combining art with scientific concepts motivated them to study and helped them better understand the disciplines. Results suggest that the artistic reinterpretations vividly illustrated the intersection of parasitology and physiology, highlighting this interdisciplinary approach's educational and creative potential.
40056261	Predicting surface soil pH spatial distribution based on three machine learning methods: a case study of Heilongjiang Province.	Comprehensive and accurate acquisition of surface soil pH spatial distribution information is essential for monitoring soil degradation and providing scientific guidance for agricultural practices. This study focused on Heilongjiang Province in China, utilizing data from 125 soil survey sampling points. Key environmental covariates were identified as modeling inputs through Pearson correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination (RFE). Three machine learning models-support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-were employed to predict surface soil pH in the study area. The modeling outcomes and distinctions among these models were then thoroughly compared. The results showed that the mean monthly temperature maximum (MMTmax), mean monthly precipitation minimum (MMPmin), mean annual precipitation (MAP), drought index (DI), and mean monthly wind speed maximum (MMWSmax) were the most important environmental covariates for modeling. Climate variables are better suited to reflect the nonlinear relationships between soil properties and the environment in large and flat areas during mapping. Among the mapping models, XGBoost exhibited the highest prediction performance (R <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mmultiscripts><mrow></mrow> <mrow></mrow> <mn>2</mn></mmultiscripts> </math> =0.705, RMSE=0.633, MAE=0.484), followed by RF (R <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mmultiscripts><mrow></mrow> <mrow></mrow> <mn>2</mn></mmultiscripts> </math> =0.688, RMSE=0.656, MAE=0.497), while SVM was considered unstable in this study. For uncertainty maps, XGBoost demonstrated lower uncertainty primarily in high-altitude mountainous forest regions, whereas RF achieved higher prediction consistency mainly in low-altitude plain areas. Each prediction model had its advantages in different terrain regions, yet XGBoost was regarded as the optimal model. According to the optimal model, the typical black soil in Heilongjiang Province generally exhibited weak acidity, with an average pH of 6.42, showing a gradual increasing trend from east to west and from north to south. Soil acidification mainly occurred in the meadow black soil and albic black soil regions of Heilongjiang Province's eastern and northeastern parts. It is imperative to rigorously control the application of nitrogen fertilizers and to focus on improving the soil's acid-base buffering capacity.
40056263	Leveraging ML to predict climate change impact on rice crop disease in Eastern India.	Rice crop disease is critical in precision agriculture due to various influencing components and unstable environments. The current study uses machine learning (ML) models to predict rice crop disease in Eastern India based on biophysical factors for current and future scenarios. The nine biophysical parameters are precipitation (Pr), maximum temperature (T<sub>max</sub>), minimum temperature (T<sub>min</sub>), soil texture (ST), available water capacity (AWC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) by Random forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Artificial Neural Net (ANN), and Support vector Machine (SVM). The multicollinearity test Boruta feature selection techniques that assessed interdependency and prioritized the factors impacting crop disease. However, climatic change scenarios were created using the most recent Climate Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 datasets. The rice crop disease validation was accomplished using 1105 field-based farmer observation recordings. According to the current findings, Purba Bardhaman district experienced a 96.72% spread of rice brown spot disease due to weather conditions. In contrast, rice blast diseases are prevalent in the north-western region of Birbhum district, affecting 72.38% of rice plants due to high temperatures, water deficits, and low soil moisture. Rice tungro disease affects 63.45% of the rice plants in Bankura district due to nitrogen and zinc deficiencies. It was discovered that the link between NDMI and NDVI is robust and positive, with values ranging from 0.8 to 1. According to SHAP analysis, Pr, T<sub>min</sub>, and T<sub>max</sub> are the top three climatic variables impacting all types of disease cases. The study's findings could have a substantial impact on precision crop protection and meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
40056274	Human health risk assessment of lead exposure from soil ingestion in a French pilot study: insights from the application of a new bioaccessibility approach.	Despite the consensus on the importance of considering the bioavailability of metal(loid)s by measuring their bioaccessibility when assessing exposure, integrating these parameters into risk calculations often involves proprietary approaches that lack adequate justification. This is the case with the in vitro unified bioaccessibility method (UBM), which is widely used in Europe to assess the bioaccessibility of metal(loid)s in the event of soil ingestion. This study proposes a comprehensive operational approach that incorporates bioaccessibility to refine human exposure and risk assessments. A pilot study of 45 Pb-contaminated soil samples collected in and around Paris highlighted the importance of carefully following soil preparation protocols. Specifically, sieving the soil to 250 µm without mechanical milling is recommended for determining both bioaccessible and total concentrations. A simplified test using dilute hydrochloric acid can predict the bioaccessibility of metal(loid)s in first-tier screening. This affordable, single-extraction method is easy to use in analytical laboratories and is both fast and reproducible. For second-tier validation studies, the UBM protocol should be applied to a limited number of samples. With the new approach, the relative bioavailability can be directly calculated using an in vivo/in vitro equation in the stomach compartment, thus, enabling UBM validation. The results of the pilot study demonstrated that to refine exposure assessments, adjusting chronic daily intake using relative bioavailability data was more effective than were classical approaches based on total concentrations. This method offers a promising perspective for stakeholders in managing polluted sites and soils.
40056345	Impact of planned urban development on urban heat island effect: resilient cities for a sustainable future.	This comprehensive study delved into the urban dynamics of Bangalore and Hyderabad, focusing on land cover changes, temperature variations, and their implications for sustainable urban development. Analyzing land cover trends from 2001 to 2021, the study revealed substantial urban expansion in both cities, with notable shifts in built-up, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies. The analysis indicated intensified urbanization, particularly in Hyderabad, raising environmental concerns. The study employed a random forest model to predict contrasting urbanization patterns for 2031, emphasizing the need for resilient and sustainable strategies. The model successfully predicted land surface temperature (LST) and land cover changes, offering insights for informed urban planning. Correlation analyses unveil the influence of factors like proximity to bare soil and built-up areas on LST. The model's performance is robust, outperforming other models, and is employed for 2021 land cover (LC) and LST predictions. Validation demonstrates the model's accuracy in predicting LC distribution and LST across diverse land cover types, urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the model is applied to forecast 2031 LC and LST, revealing contrasting urbanization trends. The study incorporates a hot spot analysis, categorizing thermal zones and highlighting the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The model showcases a capacity to project long-term temperature dynamics, making it a valuable tool for urban planning and climate resilience. The findings underscore the need for sustainable land use planning, emphasizing environmental preservation amid rapid urban growth.
40056346	Acaricides in agriculture: balancing livestock health and environmental well-being in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya.	Extensive use of chemicals in food production, although useful, has profound implications. Acaricides, extensively used to control ticks and mites in livestock farming, can leave harmful residues that pose risks to unintended organisms such as plants, insects, people, and other animals. Thus, limiting non-target exposure to acaricides is critical. This study is aimed at assessing acaricide knowledge, use, and disposal methods among farmers and agrochemical dealers in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya, which is well-known for livestock farming. A purposive survey of stakeholders, including 100 farmers and 45 agrochemical shop attendants, revealed concerning practices. The findings revealed insufficient personal protection during acaricide application, with a minority of responders using gloves (33%), safety goggles (0%), masks (42%), or overalls (51%) for agrochemical dealers and gloves (8%), overalls (48%), safety goggles (2%), and masks (28%) for farmers. Furthermore, used acaricide containers and residues were not properly disposed of after spraying, potentially contaminating water sources, soil, and plants. Insects, particularly bees and house flies, were spotted consuming leftovers from unprotected disposal sites, entering food webs. Furthermore, animal drying sections in spraying regions included grass, allowing animals to ingest residues. Recommendations include improved acaricide monitoring and management by extension field staff and educating farmers and pesticide dealers about health concerns, proper disposal techniques, and the importance of wearing personal protective equipment. A regulation requiring agrochemical dealers to sell acaricides together with protective gear is recommended to limit dangers effectively.
40056359	Rice grain size: current regulatory mechanisms and future perspectives.	Rice is a staple food for over half of the world's population. To feed the growing population, molecular breeders aim to increase grain yield. Grain size is an important factor for crop productivity, and it has been extensively studied. However, molecular breeders face a major challenge in further improving crop productivity in terms of grain yield and quality. Grain size is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes. Over the past few decades, genetic studies have identified various gene families involved in grain size development. The list of molecular mechanisms, and key regulators involved in grain size development is constantly expanding, making it difficult to understand the main regulators that play crucial roles in grain development. In this review, we focus on the major regulators of grain size, including G-protein signaling, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, transcriptional regulation, the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation (UPD) pathway, and phytohormone signaling. These molecular mechanisms directly or indirectly regulate grain size. We provided a comprehensive understanding of the genes involved in these mechanisms and cross discussions about how these mechanisms are interlinked. This review serves as a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern grain development and can aid in the development of molecular breeding strategies.
40056463	Study on the improvement of vegetated concrete substrate by biochar and limestone calcined clay cement.	Vegetated concrete has proven to be an effective technique for restoring the ecological environment of rocky slopes, but conventional formulations often suffer from excessive cement content and limited plant growth. This study proposes the use of biochar (BC) and limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) to form an improved vegetated concrete mix. Twenty-five different formulations were tested for their compressive and shear strength, pH values, and Bermuda grass growth. Microstructural studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that LC3 significantly increases the stress at small strains, while BC increases the strain at peak stresses. LC3 hydration produces cementitious material that coats soil particles, filling voids and leading to a linear increase in cohesion. The optimal mixture, with 12% LC3 and 6% BC, showed a 227% increase in cohesion and a 146% increase in internal friction angle. While LC3 increased pH, reducing the germination and growth performance of Bermuda grass, BC effectively improved these parameters, promoting faster and healthier plant growth. This study provides a reference for the application of LC3 and BC in future vegetated concrete development.
40056504	Antioxidant defense response mediated by DAF-16 attenuates toxicity of herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on Caenorhabditis elegans.	Glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are widely used herbicides in agriculture for weed elimination. These unused glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are discharged into environmental water, soil, and even in the food chain cycle, which greatly threatens ecosystems and human health. However, the toxicological mechanism of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms remains largely unknown. To investigate the toxic effects of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans which is directly exposed to various pesticides in the soil was selected as the object of study. In this study, our results showed that the locomotion, growth, reproduction, and lethality of C. elegans exposed to different concentrations of a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are suppressed. Exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium increases the production of reactive oxygen species, accelerating senescence and shortening the lifespan of C. elegans. The exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium activates antioxidant defense responses mediated by DAF-16 and autophagy mediated by SKN-1. Our research provides a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying antioxidant defense response-mediated detoxification of pesticide residues in soil non-target organisms.
40056517	Microbial degradation of polypropylene microplastics and concomitant polyhydroxybutyrate production: An integrated bioremediation approach with metagenomic insights.	The persistence of plastics, particularly polypropylene (PP), and their conversion into microplastics (MPs), specifically PP-MPs, have emerged as serious ecological threats to soil and aquatic environments. In the present study, we aimed to isolate a microbial consortium capable of degrading PP-MPs. The results revealed that three microbial consortia (CPP-KKU1, CPP-KKU2, and CPP-KKU3) exhibited the ability to degrade PP-MPs, achieving weight losses ranging from 11.6 ± 0.2 % to 17.8 ± 0.5 % after 30 days. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis confirmed the degradation through oxidation, as evidenced by the presence of new functional groups (-OH and -C=O). In particular, CPP-KKU3 showed the highest degradation efficiency, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealing surface cracking after treatment. Additionally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified various intermediate compounds, including heterocyclic aromatic compounds, phenyl groups, methylthio derivatives, and ethoxycarbonyl derivatives, indicating complex biochemical processes that were likely mediated by microbial enzymes. Furthermore, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production by these consortia was also investigated. The result showed that both CPP-KKU2 and CPP-KKU3 successfully produced PHB, with CPP-KKU3 demonstrating superior performance in terms of PP-MP degradation and PHB production. Metagenomic analysis of CPP-KKU3 revealed abundant carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), particularly glycosyl transferases and glycoside hydrolases, which are associated with MP digestion. This study presents a promising bioremediation approach that addresses plastic waste degradation and sustainable bioplastic production, offering a potential solution for environmental plastic pollution.
40056520	Remediation strategies of biochar and microbial inoculum for PAHs-contaminated soil: Quorum sensing-mediated PAHs degradation and element cycling.	The pyrolysis of straw for biochar production offers significant advantages in resource recycling and soil improvement. However, the concurrent effects of biochar on contaminant degradation and biogeochemical cycles in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-contaminated soil remain unclear. This study aims to integrate the roles of functional microorganisms, PAHs degradation pathways, and soil element cycles to elucidate the remediation characteristics of PAHs-contaminated soil. The results demonstrated that the addition of biochar increased the removal rate of phenanthrene (PHE) of PAHs in soil by 75.7 %, and microbial inoculum enhanced this rate to 93.4 %. Both treatments simultaneously improved soil physicochemical properties. Additionally, these amendments influenced the composition of the microbial community, increasing microbial diversity as evidenced by a rise in the Chao1 index by 2.75 % and 4.50 %, and the Shannon index by 8.73 % and 7.60 %, respectively. Moreover, the addition of biochar and microbial inoculum enabled quorum sensing and key microbial species to play a significant role in PHE degradation and ecological restoration. Specifically, these amendments have altered the degradation pathways of soil PHE: biochar promoted PHE degradation via the phthalate pathway, whereas microbial inoculum favored the salicylic acid pathway. Furthermore, both amendments expedited nutrient element cycling in soils. Biochar stimulated nitrate assimilation and the degradation of labile organic carbon compounds, while microbial inoculum enhanced the biodegradation of refractory organic carbon, carbon and nitrogen fixation, and concurrently reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This study presents an innovative strategy for ecologically rehabilitating PHE-contaminated soils by integrating microbial interactions with soil element circulation.
40056522	Elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying degradation of nicosulfuron and its derivative by Klebsiella jilinsis 2N3 using multiomic analysis.	Nicosulfuron is a herbicide used in agricultural production. Its prolonged application causes significant ecological risks to soil and water environment. In this study, the molecular mechanisms underlying degradation of nicosulfuron and its derivative by Klebsiella jilinsis 2N3 was determined. Strain 2N3 degraded nicosulfuron primarily via cleavage of the sulfonylurea bridge and deamination and demethoxylation of its derivative, 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine (ADMP). Multiomic analysis indicated significant alterations in genes and proteins predominantly associated with glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, quorum sensing, signal transduction, energy metabolism, and nucleotide synthesis. Heterologous expression and gene knockout confirmed that degradation of the sulfonylurea bridge in nicosulfuron by strain 2N3 was accompanied by a hydrolysis process, in which arginine hydrolase Kj-CY657_RS10725 participated in nicosulfuron degradation Deletion of its gene decreased the biodegradation rate of nicosulfuron by 11.04 % in 24 h. Moreover, our study demonstrated that nicosulfuron derivative ADMP can effectively dock within the active site of the Kj-CY657_RS01600 protein, forming hydrogen bonds that enhanced the catalytic activity. Kj-CY657_RS01600 could degrade 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> ADMP by 43.08 % within 30 min, resulting in the formation of 4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine as a byproduct. Additionally, after Kj-CY657_RS01600 knockout, the ability of strain 2N3 to biodegrade ADMP decreased by 52.48 %. This study provided molecular mechanism for comprehensive understanding the biodegradation of nicosulfuron and its derivative ADMP by strain 2N3.
40056530	Biological soil amendments can support survival of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Escherichia coli in soils and sporadic transfer to Romaine lettuce.	Biological soil amendments (BSAs) are essential agricultural inputs that provide critical nutrients in organic leafy green production. Heat-treated poultry pellets (HTPP) and seabird guano (SBG), which have been treated to reduce microbial pathogen loads, are gaining popularity among growers. Using these BSAs in the process of side-dressing, providing nutrients to crops while growing, may provide opportunities for externally introduced bacterial pathogens to survive in soil. In this study, Romaine lettuce was grown in soils in a controlled environmental growth chamber. Soils were side-dressed twice with different combinations of treated BSAs: HTPP, SBG, and corn steep liquor (CSL). Soils were co-inoculated with non-pathogenic E. coli and two E. coli O157:H7 strains at the second of two side-dressing events. Survival of E. coli in soils over 28 days was evaluated. On day 28 post inoculation, two heads of Romaine lettuce from each planter were harvested, and the presence of E. coli on leaves was determined. Four nonlinear statistical models were fit to predict survival of E. coli in soils. In all soils regardless of BSA treatment, E. coli TVS 353 declined by 4.08-4.51 log CFU/g soil over 28 days, and E. coli O157:H7 declined by 2.77-4.3 log CFU/g soil over 28 days. E. coli TVS 353 and O157:H7 were recovered from 13.3 % (6/45) and 11.1 % (5/45) of plants, respectively. Transfer of E. coli from soils to Romaine lettuce was low, sporadic, and could not be measured quantitatively. Side-dressing with treated BSAs used in organic lettuce production supported but did not enhance survival of E. coli in side-dressed soils under controlled environmental conditions.
40056548	Revealing the underestimated role of Gram-positive bacteria in iron reduction within paddy soils.	Iron reduction in paddy fields is crucial for heavy metal migration and nutrient transformation. Gram-negative iron-reducing bacteria like Geobacter and Shewanella have been widely studied due to their strong extracellular electron transfer capabilities. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium are often labeled as weak exoelectrogens, leading to their contributions being overlooked. But could their role in iron reduction have been underestimated? To explore this, we enriched paddy soils with glucose, resulting in a predominance of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Clostridiaceae and Bacillaceae) and a small presence of Gram-negative reducers (e.g., Geobacteraceae). Remarkably, despite the abundance of Gram-positive iron reducers being 880 times higher in the glucose system, their iron reduction rate was comparable to that of acetate and lactate systems with more Gram-negative bacteria. This suggests a significant contribution by Gram-positive bacteria to iron reduction. Pure culture experiments further revealed that the iron reduction rates of Bacillus and Clostridium are 15.4 and 4.0 times slower, respectively, than a Gram-negative reducer, Geobacter. However, even in natural paddy soil of this study, Gram-positive iron reducers are 9 times more abundant than Gram-negative ones. This gives us an unexpected insight: Considering both abundance and rate, Gram-positive weak exoelectrogens may actually contribute significantly to iron reduction. This study reveals the underestimated role of Gram-positive bacteria in paddy soils, highlighting the unique characteristics of paddy habitats and the need for further research on these weak exoelectrogens.
40056564	Association of infrastructure and operations with antibiotic resistance potential in the dairy environment in India.	The dairy industry in developing countries is often associated with inappropriate use of antibiotics and the subsequent contamination of the environment with co-selectors of antibiotic resistance. However, the specific factors in dairy farm environments that influence antibiotic resistance levels and the subsequent exposure risks to farm workers are unknown. We examined the link between the infrastructure and operations of the dairy farm and the antibiotic resistance potential in India, which is the highest producer and consumer of dairy products globally. We sampled sixteen dairy farms in the Dehradun district, India, that varied in their herd size, infrastructure, and operational features during winter, summer, and monsoon. We collected samples of dung, manure, wastewater, manure-amended, and control soil from these farms. We quantified six antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (sul1, sul2, parC, mcr5, ermF, and tetW), an integron integrase gene cassette (intI1), and 16S rRNA gene copies as an indicator for total bacterial count. We observed that the infrastructure and the operations of the dairy farms were significantly associated with antibiotic resistance potential in the dairy environment. For example, with increased ventilation and exposure to external weather, the levels of sul2 (x͂=10<sup>-1.63</sup>) and parC (x͂=10<sup>-4.24</sup>) in manure increased. When farmers administered antibiotics without veterinary consultation, the relative levels of intI1 (x͂=10<sup>-2.36</sup>), sul2 (x͂=10<sup>-1.58</sup>), and tetW (x͂=10<sup>-3.04</sup>) in manure were lower than the cases where professional advice was sought. Small-scale farms had lower relative ARG levels than medium- and large-scale farms, except for mcr5 (x͂=10<sup>-3.98</sup>) in wastewater. In different sample types, the relative ARG levels trended as manure-amended soil (x͂=10<sup>-2.34</sup>) > wastewater (x͂=10<sup>-2.90</sup>)> manure (x͂=10<sup>-3.39</sup>)> dung (x͂=10<sup>-2.54</sup>). ARGs correlated with the marker for horizontal gene transfer, intI1, which exacerbates overall antibiotic resistance levels. Exposure assessment showed that the agriculture farm workers working in manure-amended agriculture farms are exposed to higher antibiotic resistance potential than dairy farm workers, who manually handle dung. Our study showed that the link between the dairy infrastructure (ventilation and floor type) and operations (scale of operation and veterinary consultation) and the antibiotic resistance potential in the dairy farm environment was statistically significant. This knowledge paves the way for designing interventions that can minimize the antibiotic resistance potential on dairy farms and in affected environments and thus reduce the public health burden of antibiotic-resistant infections in the dairy industry and dairy workers in India.
40056744	Hydrogen sulfide enhances cadmium tolerance in oilseed rape roots by augmenting glutathione-mediated antioxidant defense and ROS homeostasis.	Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) plays a crucial role in regulating plant development and stress responses. Here, the potential role of H<sub>2</sub>S in enhancing cadmium (Cd) tolerance by modulating the antioxidant defense system and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis was investigated. The results shown that Cd (II) exposure significantly inhibited the growth and chlorophyll content of rapeseed seedlings. Optimal exogenous sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS; 50 μM) pretreatment markedly alleviated Cd-induced growth inhibition, chlorosis, and root morphology in contrast to increased Cd accumulation in the roots. The DW of the leaves and roots, and the total chlorophyll content increased by 23.8 %, 21.4 % and 114.8 %, respectively. Cd (II)-induced oxidative damage was significantly ameliorated by NaHS application through the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>) accumulation, which were up to 47.3 % and 67.6 %, respectively. Moreover, exogenous NaHS elevated the glutathione (GSH) content and GSH/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio in Cd-stressed roots from 21.9 - 33.3 % and 39.3-87.4 %, respectively. The activity of antioxidant enzymes, with the exception of ascorbate peroxidase, was further elevated by NaHS application. These results suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S enhances Cd tolerance by augmenting GSH pools and activating antioxidant enzymes to control reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, thereby ameliorating Cd-induced oxidative stress in rapeseed seedling roots.
40056745	Resilience mechanisms of rhizosphere microorganisms in lead-zinc tailings: Metagenomic insights into heavy metal resistance.	This study investigates the impact of heavy metal contamination in lead-zinc tailings on plant and soil microbial communities, focusing on the resilience mechanisms of rhizosphere microorganisms in these extreme environments. Utilizing metagenomic techniques, we identified a significant association between Coriaria nepalensis Wall. rhizosphere microbial communities and metal(loid) resistance genes. Our results reveal a notable diversity and abundance of bacteria within the rhizosphere of tailings, primarily consisting of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. The presence of metal-resistant bacterial taxa, including Afipia, Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonas, and Miltoncostaea, indicates specific evolutionary adaptations to metal-rich, nutrient-deficient environments. Elevated expression of resistance genes such as znuD, zntA, pbrB, and pbrT underscores the microorganisms' ability to endure these harsh conditions. These resistance genes are crucial for maintaining biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and adaptability. Our findings enhance the understanding of interactions between heavy metal contamination, microbial community structure, and resistance gene dynamics in lead-zinc tailings. Additionally, this research provides a theoretical and practical foundation for employing plant-microbial synergies in the in-situ remediation of contaminated sites.
40056774	Detection of microplastic hotspots in beach sand for national surveys using fluorescence microscopy and infrared spectroscopy: Case study on the Catalan coast.	The aim of this study is the characterization of microplastics (60 μm -5 mm) on Catalan beaches. It takes into consideration factors as sand size distribution, geomorphology, meteorological parameters and anthropogenic pressures. MPs were measured in seventy (n = 70) intertidal sand samples covering 580 km coastline. After dry sieving the fraction over 0.5 mm was analysed by visual sorting and FTIR techniques. The fraction below 0.5 mm was separated by wet density separation processes, oxidation of organic matter and then analysed by Nile Red staining and fluorescence microscopy. A subset of samples (n = 23) was also subjected to μ-FTIR techniques for compositional analysis in order to compare and confirm the results given by the staining method. The concentration of MP > 0.5 mm ranged from <0.55 to 56.8 MPs/kg (60 % fragments). For sizes 60 μm-0.5 mm it varied from 0 to 2013 MPs/kg (70 % fibres). Polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene composed most fragments. Polyester, polyamide, polypropylene and acrylic constituted fibres. Although spectroscopy (μFTIR) is needed to confirm the results, the staining method can be a screening strategy to detect hotspots and provided good approximations for MPs quantification. Only sand particle size is correlated with MPs concentration. Sewage treatment plant discharges, runoff, and local ocean currents might all be significant in the accumulation of MPs along the coast.
40056820	Matrix preparation and workflow for microplastics analysis in soil.	One of the main difficulties in microplastic (MP) research is the lack of standardized, real-world methods such as matrix blank and simultaneous tracking of polymer particles for enumeration. Building on a previous study, a matrix preparation and experimental workflow for soil matrices is presented that addresses the challenges of purification to allow subsequent analysis using Nile Red-stained MPs as a surrogate. Key steps include peroxide digestion and density separation (NaI) followed by centrifugation for low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surrogates to assess recoveries in terms of number and size, based on fluorescence microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The results yielded false positive recoveries greater than 100% for stained MPs and overall mean recovery around 80% for virgin MPs. Staining reflected the effect of pretreatment on the morphological and fluorescence characteristics of PE and PVC particles. An instrumental approach for fast Raman measurements is also presented, which facilitates counting up to 83%. Although particles down to 21 μm have been tested, this approach appears promising down to single microns due to its traceable and reliable nature for MP particles <300 μm in soil or terrestrial environments. In conclusion, the MP research community should strive to address small polymeric particles that pose an obstacle by agglomerating and interfering with particle-based quantification by spectroscopic techniques.
40056837	Comprehensive experimental and computational analysis of endemic Allium tuncelianum: Phytochemical profiling, antimicrobial activity, and In silico studies for potential therapeutic applications.	Allium tuncelianum (TG), an endemic garlic species from Tunceli, Turkey, was investigated using a multidisciplinary approach combining experimental and computational methods. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with B3LYP/def2-SVP/def2-TZVP basis sets were employed to analyze electronic properties, reactivity, and stability under gas and ethanol conditions. Headspace/GC-MS identified 10 major components, with diallyl disulfide (48.03 %) and 1-propene (20.72 %) as predominant. Antimicrobial assays revealed potent activity against MRSA, Salmonella paratyphi A, and E. coli, with MIC values as low as 0.063 mg/mL. Antioxidant capacity, evaluated via DPPH, metal chelating, and FRAP assays, showed promising results, with the water extract exhibiting the highest activity (1.74 mg BHT equivalent/mL). DFT and molecular docking studies highlighted key compounds as potential inhibitors of E. coli Gyrase B, with binding energies of -5.68 and -6.07 kcal/mol. ADME predictions indicated favorable drug-like properties, though some compounds showed potential CYP450 interactions and toxicity. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of TG's biochemical profile and therapeutic potential, offering insights for future research and optimization.
40056853	Synthetic biology approaches to improve Rubisco carboxylation efficiency in C<sub>3</sub> Plants: Direct and Indirect Strategies.	Food security remains a pressing issue due to the growing global population and climate change, including the global warming along with increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, which can negatively impact C<sub>3</sub> crop yields. A major limitation in C<sub>3</sub> plants is the inefficiency of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) due to its low carboxylation activity and competing oxygenase activity. Improving Rubisco efficiency in C<sub>3</sub> plants is thus essential for improving photosynthetic performance. Recent advances in synthetic biology have introduced promising strategies to overcome these limitations. This review highlights the latest synthetic biology and gene transformation techniques aimed at optimizing Rubsico carboxylation efficiency. Next, direct approaches such as engineering Rubisco subunits by replacing plant Rubisco with proteins from other organisms are discussed. Additionally, indirect strategies involve modifications of Rubisco-interacting proteins and adjustment of Rubisco environment. We explore CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) based on pyrenoids and carboxysomes, which increase local CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations around Rubisco thus favouring the carboxylation reaction. Lastly, photorespiratory bypasses are also covered in this review.
40056864	Unlocking the potential of Eudrilus eugeniae in mitigating the pollution risk of pesticides and heavy metals: Fostering machine learning tactics to optimize environmental health.	Agro-industrial waste management remains a critical challenge in sustainable development, particularly due to contamination with heterogeneous micropollutants such as heavy metals (HMs), pesticides, and polyphenols. This study explores an innovative vermistabilization approach using pineapple pomace (PP) to enhance the bioremediation of paper mill sludge (PMS) facilitated by Eudrilus eugeniae. The research demonstrates that the contrasting pH profiles of PMS (a highly alkaline substrate) and PP (a highly acidic substrate) have significantly contributed to nutrient enhancement and stabilization of end products for the mixed feedstock treatments (PP and PMS-based feedstocks) compared to the feedstock treatments in isolations. Results demonstrated a 2.1 fold increase in earthworm population density, and 4-5 fold reduction in organic carbon content confirming its effectiveness of biostabilization in a heterogeneous feed mixture. Vermicomposting enhanced nutrient availability (N, P, K) and microbial metabolic activity by 3-5 folds. Amongst tested ratios, PP + PMS + cowdung (CD) (1:2:1) achieved optimal remediation, reducing HMs (Cd, Pb, Zn, Hg, Ni, Cu, Cr), pesticides (chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, carbofuran), and polyphenols by 8-9 folds. Integration of Artificial Neural Networks coupled with Sobol sensitivity analysis also identified PP + PMS + CD(1:2:1) as the most effective combination in minimizing potential health risks. Furthermore, Taylor plot analysis determined the best-fit model for predicting health risks associated with various PP and PMS-based complex systems. The findings underscored the potential of utilizing PP along with PMS based feedstock for mitigating pollutants whilst simultaneously enhancing nutrient recovery during vermicomposting. Thus, the machine learning techniques could facilitate the optimization of feedstock compositions, advancing large-scale vermistabilization as a sustainable strategy for agro-industrial waste management.
40056894	From soil sorption to bioaccumulation: Tracing the endectocide ivermectin in soil and earthworms.	Ivermectin (IVM), a widely used antiparasitic drug in veterinary medicine, has emerged as an environmental contaminant due to its semi-persistence and potentially harmful ecotoxicological impacts on non-target terrestrial fauna. This study investigates the innovative combination of sorption, desorption, and bioaccumulation dynamics of IVM in soil-earthworm systems, focusing on the species Eisenia fetida, Aporrectodea caliginosa, and Lumbricus terrestris. Sorption experiments in artificial soil (AS) and its components (sand, clay, peat) revealed a strong affinity of IVM for organic-rich substrates, reducing bioavailability and bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation studies showed that the kinetic bioaccumulation factor BAF<sub>k</sub> for IVM in E. fetida ranged from 0.505 to 0.727 g soil dw/g earthworm dw, with elimination kinetics best described by a biphasic model, and suggesting minimal net accumulation. A. caliginosa and L. terrestris showed slightly higher accumulation potential, with accumulation factors exceeding 1 during the uptake phase, although equilibrium was not reached within 21 days. The prolonged accumulation process, combined with a calculated DT<sub>50</sub> of 142 days in AS, underscores IVM's potential environmental persistence and risk, particularly its ecotoxicological relevance. The results also suggest that strong sorption to organic matter in soils can mitigate bioaccumulation.
40057046	Cryptochromes (CRYs) in pepper: Genome-wide identification, evolution and functional analysis of the negative role of CaCRY1 under Phytophthora capsici infection.	Cryptochromes (CRYs) are ultraviolet-A (UV-A) and blue light photoreceptors that perceive UV-A and blue light to mediate a range of physiological processes including disease response in plants. However, there has been no report about the roles of CRY genes in pepper, which often suffers from Phytophthora blight caused by Phytophthora capsici. In this work, three pepper CRY genes were identified and their characteristics were examined by bioinformatics analysis. CaCRY1 is an ortholog of AtCRY1 located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and expression analysis by RT-qPCR showed that its transcription was differentially regulated by jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), as well as by P. capsici infection (PCI). Overexpression of CaCRY1 in pepper and Nicotiana benthamiana promoted the susceptibility of plants to PCI. Further virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) analysis showed that silencing of CaCRY1 promoted the resistance of pepper plants to PCI with decreased disease index and transcripts of genes associated with SA biosynthesis. RNA-seq analysis showed that CaCRY1 silencing affected many genes in stress-related metabolic pathways. In summary, our findings show that CaCRY1 plays a negative role in the defense response of pepper to PCI, laying a foundation for studying the roles of CRYs in the future.
40057106	Exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons among adults and children: Contributions from multiple pathways and sources.	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exist ubiquitously in the natural environment; however, studies seldom evaluate health risks from aggregate exposures to PAHs from multiple environmental media. This study aimed to estimate the doses and risks of 16 priority PAHs in soil and air for both children and adults and quantify their contributors. Soil and ambient air samples were collected at 50 and 8 sites, respectively, in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. Grab soil samples were taken from the upper 2 inches of the soil and air samples were collected every 12 days for over one year. The sum concentration of 16 PAHs (ΣPAH) averaged 7.6±15.0 mg/kg (range 1.5-98.8 mg/kg) in soil and 73.6±25.3 ng/m<sup>3</sup> (range 47.0-121.2 ng/m<sup>3</sup>) in air. Source apportionment identified five broad sources of health risks: vehicle emissions, petrogenic sources, coal combustion, emissions from coal tar, and natural gas combustion. For children aged 3-6 years, the average daily dose (ADD) of ΣPAH was 58.3 ng/kg-day, with 66%, 27%, and 7% from inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact, respectively. The lifetime cancer risk from all PAHs was 0.42×10<sup>-6</sup>, with ingestion being the primary contributor (75%). For adults aged 21-30 years, the ADD of ΣPAH was 46.2 ng/kg-day, with contributions of 67%, 31%, and 2% from dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion, respectively. The lifetime cancer risk from all PAHs was 0.55×10<sup>-6</sup>, mainly due to dermal contact (96%). Vehicle emissions, petrogenic sources, and coal combustion together contributed over 85% of the cancer risk. The findings provided bases for designing effective exposure controls, including source control and personal behavioral changes.
40057107	Synthesis and Characterization of Cationic Modified Starch Grafted Acrylic Acid-Based Absorbent Resin Dust Suppressant.	In this paper, corn starch was used as the base material, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride was used as a cationic surfactant to modify it. Subsequently, acrylic acid was then used as the primary raw material, and through the combined action of potassium persulfate and N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide, a cationic modified starch grafted acrylic-based water-absorbent resin dust suppressant (CACS) is synthesized via graft polymerization. During the preparation process, the water absorption performance is employed as the key indicator to optimize the process parameters: the degree of neutralization of acrylic acid is set at 50%, the mass ratio of corn starch to acrylic acid is 10 wt%, the volume ratio of CHPTA to acrylic acid is 1:20, the initiator concentration is 0.5 wt%, the coupling agent concentration is 0.1 wt%, and the reaction temperature is maintained at 65 °C. Under these conditions, the water absorption performance of CACS reaches 394.43 g/g. The water absorption and retention properties of the resin are evaluated, and its structure and morphology are characterized using FT-IR, SEM, TG, XRD, and other analytical techniques to validate the effectiveness of the preparation method. Furthermore, samples are prepared into solutions of varying concentrations and sprayed onto the loess surface to assess their dust suppression performance. The results indicate that the soil sample treated with a dust suppressant concentration of 0.25 wt% exhibits a wind erosion resistance rate of 99.58% at a wind speed of 12 m/s and an evaporation resistance rate of 48.28% at a high temperature of 50 °C.
40057111	Impact of Repeated Organic Amendments on Trace Element Exposure and Health Risks via the Soil-Vegetable-Human Pathway.	Applying organic fertilizers enriches soil with essential nutrients and organic matter. However, the trace elements (TE) often present in organic fertilizers-such as chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As)-can pose food safety risks. Continuous use of organic amendments can lead to the accumulation of TE in the soil, increasing their uptake by plants and potential risks to human health. To investigate this, we conducted a study across two production cycles to examine the presence of TE along the soil-plant-human contamination pathway. Our focus was on assessing the effects of repeated fertilizer applications on vegetable production and TE contamination, particularly in leafy (lettuce) and root (radish) vegetables. The results showed that using sewage sludge (SS), swine manure (SM), and chemical fertilizer (CF) led to higher vegetable yields compared to compost derived from municipal solid waste (CP). Soil amendments had limit impact on the overall TE concentrations in the soil. However, TE were more concentrated in vegetables grown with organic fertilizers than in those grown with chemical fertilizers. TE levels in the edible parts of vegetables increased significantly following repeated applications. In the first productive cycle of both vegetables, Zn and Cd exhibited moderate bioaccumulation, with BCF values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. In the second cycle, bioaccumulation generally increased, with Zn reaching high bioaccumulation levels in lettuce under SS and SM treatments (BCF > 1.0). Cr in both vegetables and Cu in lettuce maintained moderate bioaccumulation levels. Conversely, both vegetables demonstrated strong defense mechanisms against Pb and As accumulation, as indicated by consistently low BCF values. According to the hazard quotient (HQ), repeated fertilization of lettuce with CF, CP, SS, and SM resulted in a 1.4-1.8-fold increase in the total hazard quotient (THQ) for adults and a 1.3-1.9-fold increase in radish bulbs, with a maximum THQ of 0.23 in the twice-CP fertilization treatment. Overall, the consumption of lettuce and radish grown in amended soils poses no significant health risk, as the THQ values remained consistently below 1.
40057263	Bioconversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into valuable bioproducts via synthetic modular co-culture of engineered Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Escherichia coli.	With increasing concern over environmental problems and energy crises, interest in the biological conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into bioproducts is growing. Although microalgae efficiently utilize CO<sub>2</sub>, their metabolic engineering remains challenging. In contrast, while synthetic biology tools are advanced for many heterotrophic bacteria, these organisms cannot directly utilize CO<sub>2</sub>. As such, a modular co-culture system with a glycolate dehydrogenase 1 (GYD1) deficient Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant and Escherichia coli was developed. The GYD1 mutant secretes glycolic acid via photorespiration, which E. coli metabolizes via the glyoxylate cycle. E. coli growth was improved by implementing two-stage continuous systems to 2.0 mg L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> on CO<sub>2</sub>. The production of green fluorescent protein (0.52 ng L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) and lycopene (6.3 μg L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) was also demonstrated. This study represents a successful case of a synthetic modular co-culture with a microalga and a heterotrophic bacterium, potentially contributing to sustainable industrial processes and reducing environmental impact.
40057356	Influence of surface type on outdoor gait parameters measured using an In-Shoe Motion Sensor System.	The objectives of this study were to measure outdoor gait parameters using an In-Shoe Motion Sensor System (IMS) and evaluate how different types of surfaces affect various gait dynamics. Accurate outdoor gait data are crucial for effective fall risk assessment because surface irregularities and tripping hazards often result in falls during walking. An IMS was used in this study to collect spatiotemporal, spatial, and foot parameters from 27 healthy adults walking on indoor asphalt, soil, and grass surfaces. Data were recorded during a 6-minute walk test, with measurements taken every 2 min and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The results showed significant differences in foot clearance, heel height, and gait cycle across surfaces. Walking on grass significantly increased foot height, swing time, and roll angle of heel contact. These findings may help develop interventions to prevent falls.
40057505	Differential roles of deterministic and stochastic processes in structuring soil bacterial ecotypes across terrestrial ecosystems.	Soil bacteria are vital to ecosystem resilience and resistance, yet ecological attributes and the drivers governing their composition and distribution, especially for taxa varying in ecological traits and inhabiting different ecosystems, are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed a large-scale bacterial community and environmental dataset of 622 soil samples systematically collected by us from six major terrestrial ecosystems across the United States. We show that soil bacterial diversity and composition significantly differ among ecotypes and ecosystems, partially determined by a few universal abiotic factors (e.g., soil pH, calcium, and aluminum) and several ecotype- or ecosystem-specific ecological drivers. Co-occurrence network analysis suggests that rare taxa have stronger ecological relevance to the community than abundant taxa. Ecological models revealed that deterministic processes shape assembly of abundant taxa and generalists, while stochastic processes played a greater role in rare taxa and specialists. Also, bacterial communities in the shrubland ecosystem appear to be more sensitive to environmental changes than other ecosystems, evidenced by the lowest diversity, least connected community network, and strongest local environmental selection driven by surrounding land use. Overall, this study reveals ecological mechanisms underlying the bacterial biogeography in terrestrial ecosystems nationwide and highlights the need to preserve rare biosphere and shrubland ecosystems amid environmental disturbance.
40057515	Larval spongy moth transcriptomic response to ingestion of broad-versus narrow-spectrum insecticidal Chromobacterium species.	The PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> strain of Chromobacterium subtsugae was the first insecticidal bacterium to be registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use in crop protection applications since approval for Bacillus thuringiensis was granted in 1961. C. subtsugae, a Gram-negative betaproteobacterium, exhibits oral toxicity against a broad range of important insects, including dipteran, coleopteran, lepidopteran, and at least some hemipteran and tetranychidan pests. Chromobacterium sphagni is a closely related bacterium exhibiting a distinctly narrower activity spectrum than that of C. subtsugae: it is toxic to lepidopteran, but not dipteran or coleopteran pest insects. The molecular mode of activity for either species is not well characterized at present, and it remains unclear whether these bacterial species affect insects similarly, notwithstanding their close evolutionary relatedness. In this study, synchronized third-instar larvae of the destructive lepidopteran forest pest, Lymantria dispar dispar (European spongy moth), were separately fed with cultures of C. subtsugae strain PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> or C. sphagni strain 14B-1<sup>T</sup> and sampled after 24 h post infection. Gene expression levels in healthy reference versus treated insects were independently compared at the whole-insect and midgut-only tissue levels to characterize host-specific transcriptional responses to intoxication. Treatment induced up-regulation of such antimicrobial peptides as attacin and cecropin, of two cytochrome P450-encoding genes, and of gelsolin, a molecule involved in actin organization. Some differentially expressed genes were novel or uncharacterized, hence future work with lepidopteran species will be necessary to understand insect physiological responses to Chromobacterium infection.
40057539	Competition and interdependence define interactions of Nostoc sp. and Agrobacterium sp. under inorganic carbon limitation.	Cyanobacteria of the Nostoc genus are capable of forming symbiotic relationships with plants but also serve as a hub for heterotrophic bacteria. By comparing the axenic strain Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 and the xenic strains Nostoc sp. KVJ2 and KVJ3, we were able to demonstrate an almost obligate dependence of the cyanobacteria on the heterotrophic partners under carbon-limiting conditions. A detailed analysis of the intimate relationship between N. punctiforme and the isolate Agrobacterium tumefaciens Het4 using shotgun proteomics and microscopy uncovered a complex partnership characterized by competition for iron and facilitation for carbon. The prevalent extracarboxysomal localization of the carbon-fixing enzyme RubisCO suggests that a weak carbon-concentrating mechanism in N. punctiforme enforces a dependence on heterotrophic bacteria. Our study indicates a limited autonomy of symbiotic Nostoc strains, which may also explain its preference for symbiotic interactions.
40057543	Mapping 1-km soybean yield across China from 2001 to 2020 based on ensemble learning.	Soybean is a critical agricultural product in China, with domestic production unable to satisfy the substantial demand, leading to a huge reliance on imports. To support the scientific formulation of agricultural policies and the optimization of domestic planting structures, we developed a high-resolution annual soybean yield dataset for China (2001-2020), ChinaSoyYield1km. This dataset was generated by applying ensemble learning algorithms and spatial decomposition to a comprehensive set of multi-source data, including climate variables, remote sensing imagery, soil properties, agricultural management practices, and official yield records. The integration of these diverse datasets allows for a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing soybean yield at a 1-km resolution. The resulting dataset captures over 50% of the yield variability at the county scale, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to publicly available datasets with reductions in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ranging from 0.18 to 0.60 t/ha. It is anticipated that our dataset will enhance agricultural studies, planning, and policy-making related to soybean cultivation, providing a valuable resource for both the scientific community and government.
40057547	Effects of heavy metals on variation in bacterial communities in farmland soil of tailing dam collapse area.	Heavy metals are commonly present in polluted soil in mining areas. In this study, we investigated 10 sites of farmland soil in the heavy metal tailing dam collapse area (TDCA) with the dominant phyla Acidobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. The heavy metal dam collapse area is a composite contamination area of multiple heavy metals, with Cd, Pb and Zn being the most severely contaminated, and the levels of Hg and Cu exceeding the screening values at some of the sites. The Shannon, Chao1 and ACE indices revealed high microbial diversity but low relative abundance of microorganisms at the severely polluted TDCA1 and TDCA3 sites. The results of redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that Hg (Max = 4.31 mg/kg) and Cu (Max = 100 mg/kg) were important factors affecting soil microbial community in the TDCA compared to other heavy metals. Correlation analysis of heavy metals with microbial communities showed that RB41 (Acidobacteria) was more resistant to high concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn pollution. The genera of UTCFX1 (Chloroflxi) and norank_TRA3-20 had strong tolerance to the heavy metal Hg. Cu was significantly negatively correlated with norank_WD2101_soil_group (P < 0.05). Therefore these can be used as indicators for monitoring potential heavy metal contamination. The results can be used to predict the changes in the ecosystem of the mining area to maintain its ecological balance and health.
40057549	A case study on thermal conductivity characteristics and prediction of rock and soil mass at a proposed ground source heat pump (GSHP) site.	Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) has a wide range of applications in the field of building cooling and heating. Ground source heat pump (GSHP) system is a technology to extract SGE. The design of borehole heat exchanger (BHE) has a great impact on heat transfer performance and investment cost, so it is important to accurately measure the thermal conductivity of rock and soil. Therefore, this study conducted field in-situ thermal response test (TRT) and laboratory sample test based on distributed optical fiber temperature sensor (DOFTS) in LY research area of Changchun, Northeast China. After comparing the differences and analyzing the reasons, an in-situ thermal conductivity prediction model was established based on artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm to predict in-situ thermal conductivity based on basic physical property parameters of laboratory tests. This model is used to supplement the layered thermal conductivity lacking in the CY study area. The results show that the distributed thermal conductivity can be obtained and the layered thermal conductivity can be calculated by improved combined thermal response test (ICTRT). The average layer thermal conductivity of laboratory test is about 12.2% lower than that of field test, but the thermal conductivity of the two test methods has the same variation trend along the depth. The thermal conductivity of rock mass is positively correlated with water content, negatively correlated with porosity and positively correlated with density. The result error of the in-situ thermal conductivity prediction model established by calculation is mainly within ± 5%, which is reliable and accurate. This model is used to supplement the layered thermal conductivity of the CY01 test hole. The research results can provide a new way to determine the thermal conductivity in SGE exploration.
40057572	Influence of Tithonia diversifolia biochar on selected soil physicochemical properties, leaf nutrient concentrations and broccoli growth.	A screen house experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of Tithonia diversifolia biochar on selected soil physicochemical properties. The study included five treatments with Tithonia diversifolia biochar applied at rates of 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 t ha<sup>- 1</sup>, arranged in a completely randomised design with three replicates. Surface soil (0-15 cm depth) from the Iwo soil series (sandy loam) was collected from the Teaching and Research Farm of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria. Each 10 kg soil sample was thoroughly mixed with the respective biochar rate and maintained at field moisture capacity for four weeks in the screen house before sowing broccoli seeds. Soil samples were analyzed for particle size distribution, bulk density, porosity, moisture content, pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Agronomic parameters measured included broccoli height, number of leaves, leaf area, stem girth, and fresh weight of broccoli biomass. Leaf nutrient concentrations of broccoli were also determined. Data were subjected to analysis of variance, and significant means were separated using Duncan's multiple range test at p = 0.05. Results indicated that biochar-amended plots significantly improved soil physicochemical properties compared to the control. Biochar application also significantly increased broccoli height, number of leaves, leaf area, stem girth, leaf nutrient concentrations, and fresh weight of broccoli biomass. The application of tithonia biochar at rates of 10, 20, 30, and 40 t ha<sup>- 1</sup> increased the fresh weight of broccoli biomass by 13%, 38%, 26%, and 23%, respectively, compared to the control. The application rate of 20 t ha<sup>- 1</sup> was found to be the most beneficial, enhancing leaf nutrient concentrations and growth parameters. This study recommends the use of Tithonia diversifolia biochar as a soil amendment to improve soil quality of sandy loam and enhance broccoli productivity and quality.
40057612	Development of accessible and scalable maize pollen storage technology.	The inherent short lifespan of Zea mays (maize, corn) pollen hinders crop improvement and challenges the hybrid seed production required to produce food, fuel, and feed. Decades of scientific effort on maize pollen storage technology have been unable to deliver a widely accessible protocol that works for liters of pollen at a hybrid seed production scale. Here we show how suppressing the pollen cellular respiration rate through refrigeration and optimizing gas exchange within the storage environment are the critical combination of factors for maintaining pollen viability in storage. The common practice of preserving maize pollen by mixing the pollen with talcum powder is critically examined using pollen tube germination testing, electron microscopy of pollen-silk (stigma) interaction, and test pollinations in production environments. These techniques lead to mixing maize pollen collected for storage with anti-clumping carrier compounds, including microcrystalline cellulose. These carriers improve stored pollen flowability during pollination and enable increased seed sets to be obtained from stored pollen. Field testing in maize seed production demonstrates that a wide range of pollen volumes can be stored for up to seven days using low-cost, globally available materials and that stored pollen can achieve seed-set equivalency to fresh pollen.
40057750	In vitro efficacy of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CETAB)-modified nano-montmorillonite against aflatoxin B1 associated toxicity and methanogenesis.	Modified nano-montmorillonite is gaining attention as a feed additive for its benefits on ruminal fermentation. Chemical and mechanical methods were used to modify montmorillonite. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CETAB) was utilized for chemical modification, while grounding was carried out to achieve the desired nanoscale particle size, resulting in the formation of the nanoscale powder known as MNM<sub>CETAB</sub>. Impacts of MNM<sub>CETAB</sub> supplementation on a basal diet, either contaminated with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) or not at a level of 20 ppb were tested. Treatments included control (no supplements), a diet with 5 g per kilogram of dry matter (DM) of natural montmorillonite (NM), and diets with MNM<sub>CETAB</sub> at two doses, 0.5 (low) and 1 (high) grams per kilogram DM.

40057914	Bacillus Genotypes Exhibit Antagonistic Effects on Lettuce-Based Enterobacter Pathotypes.	Globally, among ready-to-eat (RTE) vegetables, lettuce is well-known as a potential host for Enterobacteriaceae, which theatens public health. However, in addition to E. coli, pathogenic Enterobacter species associated with RTE lettuce is poorly investigated, as well as their genetic relationship with sources of contamination has not been determined. This study investigated the evolutionary relationship between Enterobacter species and their antibiotic resistance attributes in RTE lettuce, irrigation water, and the soil of lettuce farms. Enterobacter species had the highest occurrence in the irrigation water (38%), followed by both the RTE lettuce (31%) and the soil of the lettuce farm (31%). The 16S rRNA-identified the bacteria isolates as Enterobacter species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Enterobacter species from RTE lettuce and irrigation water maintained a strong evolutionary relationship in comparison with those from the soil of the lettuce farm. In addition, irrespective of the source of contamination, the isolates demonstrated resistance to 67% of the 12 antibiotics tested. To overcome these challenges, efforts have been made to identify novel antimicrobial agents, especially from eco-friendly soil bacteria. Among the 76 soil bacterial isolates that were assessed via the antagonist‒pathogen agar plug method, only two (IBT42 and VFK47) exhibited outstanding (P = 0.05) antagonism against > 50% of the Enterobacter pathotypes in comparison with the control. The potency of IBT42 and VFK47 were validated via agar well diffusion, the minimum inhibitory concentration, and the minimum bactericidal concentration. The 16S rRNA and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the identities of IBT42 and VFK47 were Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus cereus, respectively.
40057930	Enhancing wheat resilience: biotechnological advances in combating heat stress and environmental challenges.	Climate change, with its increasing temperatures, is significantly disrupting global agricultural systems, and wheat, a key cereal crop faces severe challenges. Heat stress has emerged as a critical threat, accelerating wheat growth, leading to premature maturation, reduced grain filling, and ultimately lower yields. The situation is exacerbated by more frequent and intense heat waves, particularly in regions already struggling with water scarcity. Maintaining the delicate balance of temperature and water necessary for optimal wheat production is becoming challenging, posing a serious risk to global food security. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop adaptive strategies with innovations in breeding and transgenic technologies crucial to improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses, especially to combat the growing impacts of heat stress. Modern tools like CRISPR/Cas9, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases, and Zinc Finger Nucleases have been instrumental in developing wheat varieties with improved traits. However, the future of wheat cultivation requires more than just resistance to a single stressor. As climate change intensifies, there is an urgent need for wheat varieties that can withstand multiple stresses, including heat, drought, and pests. Developing these multi-stress-tolerant cultivars is crucial for ensuring food security in a rapidly changing climate.
40057975	Ecological and evolutionary responses of earthworm holobionts to environmental changes.	Global environmental change substantially affects soil detritivores, including earthworms, impacting host-microbiota interactions and altering key soil biogeochemical processes such as litter decomposition. As microbial communities are inherently capable of rapid evolution, responses of earthworms and associated microbiota (i.e., earthworm holobionts) to global environmental change may likely involve the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes and feedbacks. Although species-level responses of earthworms to global environmental change are well-studied, the potential ecological and evolutionary responses of earthworm holobionts to environmental change remain unexplored. Here, we provide a conceptual framework to elaborate on the complex network of earthworm host-microbiota interactions that modify their traits in response to global environmental change, jointly shaping their ecology and evolution. Based on literature, we synthesize evidence of global environmental change impacts on earthworm host-microbiota and discuss evidence of their ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change. Lastly, we highlight the agro- and eco-system level consequences of environmental change-mediated shift in earthworm host-microbiota functions. Soil legacies of environmental change have cascading detrimental impacts on the abundance, diversity, and functional dynamics of earthworm host-microbiota interactions in agriculture and ecosystems. The primary mechanisms driving such responses of earthworm hosts and associated microbial communities to environmental change include altered litter quality and host dietary preferences, competitive interactions and exclusion, habitat homogenization, and a shift in soil physicochemical and biological processes. Therefore, advancing knowledge of the intricate animal-microorganism interactions is crucial for belowground biodiversity management in a changing global environment.
40057982	The myb transcription factor PtoPHL3 positively regulates poplar resistance to canker disease caused by Dothiorella gregaria.	Diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms impair plant growth, leading to reduced crop yields. While the molecular mechanisms of plant disease response are well understood in annual herbaceous species, they remain largely unknown in perennial woody plants. Here, we found that PtoPHL3, a key transcription factor in poplar's phosphorus starvation response, showed significant expression changes after treatments with salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and inoculation of Dothiorella gregaria that causes poplar canker disease. Overexpressing PtoPHL3 conferred increased resistance to D. gregaria in transgenic poplar, while RNA interference-mediated knockdown made the plants more sensitive to the pathogen. DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) identified PtoPHL3-bound chromatin regions associated with disease response. Additionally, PtoPHL3 was found to bind the promoter of TGA6 and the gene body region of ERF5, upregulating their expression, which activates responses to D. gregaria, JA and SA. These findings deepen our understanding of the pathogen response process in poplar and lay a theoretical foundation for research on disease resistance mechanisms and the breeding of disease-resistant germplasm.
40058014	Compound effects of drought and COVID-19 on soybean production in Brazil: Challenges and policy responses.	This study investigates the cumulative and interactive impacts of drought and COVID-19 on soybean production in Brazil, focusing on cascading economic and operational disruptions. The country has faced numerous drought events in recent years (1989 to 2022), culminating with one in 2022 that, together with the occurrence of COVID-19, led to the highest decline in soybean production since 1990 (10.5 % of the total national production). Our analyses based on spatial lagged regression models revealed that the cumulative impacts of consecutive drought events significantly affect soybean production. Furthermore, the study uncovered a significant interactive association between COVID-19 and drought by using spatial lag models, emphasizing the compounded challenges posed by simultaneous shocks of climate change and rising agricultural production costs due to pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions. In addition, descriptive statistics on agricultural economics showed that COVID-19 triggered historical peaks in agricultural input prices, forcing producers to enter the 2021-2022 crop season under critical conditions. Specifically, previous losses in soybean production due to droughts during the 2020-2021 season left producers facing financial constraints while contending with historically high production costs for the next season. These results show how the impacts of a global pandemic cascade into soybean production costs (input prices), while highlight the vulnerability of Brazil's soybean production system to multiple shocks. Hence, we envision responses encompassing short-term changes in management practices and land-use decisions at the farm level; mid-term public policies providing risk assessments and emergency credit to address abnormal spikes in production costs caused by socio-health stressors, which would enable producers to secure more suitable input packages, helping to mitigate potential losses associated with co-occurring climate extreme events; and long-term further investments in developing more self-sufficient food production systems, reducing the heavy reliance on imported agricultural inputs-as seen in the Brazilian case-, and development of highly soybean tolerant-drought varieties.
40058038	The interactive application and impacts of iron/nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in distributed ponds for non-point source pollution control in a watershed.	The linkages of distributed ponds are utilized in conjunction with one another to remediate non-point source (NPS) pollution in a water-scarce basin. This study provides an overview of a state-of-the-art thorough evaluation of ponds, which offers insight into the majority of topics covered by the ongoing scientific studies, including their various functions and factors affecting their functioning on the hydrological, physicochemical, and biological processes, such as environmental climate factors and basin-specific landscape configuration parameters, as well as process parameters for design, operation and management aspects. The linkages of ponds provide a variety of sustainable services (6R functions), such as resources, restoration, reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery. The significance of regional environmental geochemical substrates in the ponds, such as red soil, as a hotspot for microbial reaction is emphasized to demonstrate the significant contribution of the migration and transformation of Fe/N cycles to the pollution removal process. In this review, 178 original research publications were thoroughly analyzed to improve our knowledge of the iron-nitrogen cycle in wetlands. From a molecular biology standpoint, the identification of functional microbe species and genes linked to microbially driven iron-nitrogen cycle activities is delved. Reliable data and homogeneous datasets from 42 studies were collected. The correlation analysis results demonstrated Feammox rates contributed to the N loss amount (r = 0.871; p < 0.01), and they had a positive correlation with Fe(III) concentration (r = 0.965; p < 0.01). The proposal for the treatment of NPS pollution by large-scale linkages of ponds in a basin involves optimizing Fe/N microbial processes to promote iron crystallization and efficient circulation of Fe(II) and Fe(III). The co-benefits of geochemistry, biotechnology, and environmental science should be considered when managing contamination in engineering applications. The linkages framework for integrated ponds, which incorporates macro (watershed management) and micro (biogeochemical cycle mechanism) investigations, provides a systematic approach to the application of integrated ponds and sustainable water management for NPS pollution control.
40058043	Does the land-use impact the risk of inducing antibiotic tolerance by heavy metal pollution?	The rise of antibiotic-resistant soil microbial communities is a critical global issue. Evidence suggests that heavy metals can select or co-select for tolerance to metals and antibiotics in soil bacteria, but it is unclear if this tolerance varies with land use. We tested the potential of bacterial communities to develop resistance to copper (Cu) or tetracycline (Tet) after amending soils from pristine forests, contaminated forests, and agricultural lands with 3000 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Cu and 6000 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> tetracycline, separately. Results showed that bacterial communities of unamended contaminated forest soils had the highest initial tolerance to Cu, while unamended agricultural soils exhibited the highest initial tolerance to tetracycline. The inducibility of bacterial resistance to antibiotics after Cu amendment varied by land use. In pristine forests, Cu amendment significantly increased microbial tetracycline resistance, as indicated by bacterial community tolerance, likely due to higher biodiversity. In contaminated forests, Cu amendment did not induce tetracycline-resistance, as indicated by unchanged bacterial community tolerance, possibly because of existing metal pollution and compromised bacterial communities by metal pollution. In agricultural soils, microbial tetracycline resistance as indicated by bacterial community tolerance developed slowly, becoming evident only after 42 days. These findings reveal significant differences in environmental risks related to soil metal pollution across different land uses, highlighting the need for systematic studies on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in metal-contaminated soils due to their human health implications.
40058046	Enhanced sulfamethoxazole degradation by electrode material modification in microbial electrochemical system.	Electrode modification was recognized as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of microbial electrochemical systems. In this study, the cathode material was modified by introducing conductive polymer (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene, PEDOT)-modified carbon fiber (CF) and MnO<sub>2</sub>-modified granular activated carbon (GAC) electrodes to improve the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from water and to explore the mechanisms underlying microbial electrochemical action that facilitated SMX degradation. The results showed that, compared to the control group, the specific capacitance of the PEDOT/CF group and the MnO<sub>2</sub>/GAC group was increased by 100.2 F·g-1 and 197.4 F·g-1, respectively. Additionally, internal resistance was reduced by 335 Ω and 684 Ω, while the average current was increased by 56.8% and 57.4%, respectively. As a result, SMX removal efficiencies were enhanced by 11.8% and 12.9%, respectively. Microbial community analysis revealed that the cathode surfaces were enriched with electroactive and degradation-dominant microorganisms. Combined with an analysis of SMX degradation products, these findings demonstrated that the modified electrodes exhibited enhanced electron transfer capabilities, promoting redox reactions and ultimately facilitating the degradation of SMX.
40058049	Study on the effect of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 coupled with the low molecular weight organic acid on the dissimilation reduction of Cd-containing goethite.	Microbial dissimilated iron reduction is one of the important driving forces of the biological and geochemical cycles of iron in nature. Plant root exudates dominated by organic acids are important electron donors of the rhizosphere dissimilar iron reduction microorganisms under flooded conditions. In this paper, we investigated the effects of different kinds and concentrations of organic acids on the dissimilation reduction process of goethite by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and explored the effect of phase transformation of iron minerals on its adsorption of Cd. The results showed that the low molecular weight organic acid promoted the dissolution of Fe(Ⅲ) in goethite, and ternary carboxylic acids had more obvious effect than binary carboxylic acids. The concentration of the solution of Fe(Ⅱ) increased by 63.95%-342.3%, the Fe(Ⅲ) concentration increased by 2.95%-260.6%. In addition, in the process of dissimilated iron reduction, the concentration of Cd released during the dissolution of iron ore is low due to the complexation of the low molecular organic acid, which will reduce the negative impact of high concentration Cd on Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and further reduce the inhibitory effect of Cd on dissimilated iron reduction. It is noteworthy that we found that Cd released by soil iron minerals will be adsorbed and fixed again, that is, heavy metals loaded on trivalent iron minerals will be released and redistributed in the process of dissimilated iron reduction, which is one of the migration and transformation ways of heavy metals in the environments.
40058053	Anaerobic fermentation integrated with pyrolysis for carbon resource recovery from food waste and biogas sludge: Effects of inoculation ratio and pyrolysis temperature.	In view of the food waste (FW) as well as its digestate are both the organic sources of municipal solid waste, this study explored the anaerobic fermentation (AF) and following pyrolysis carbonization to co-disposal the two wastes for carbon resource recovery, including short chain organic acid (SCOAs), pyrolysis gas and biochar. Results indicated that both the rate and yield of SCOAs production both increase with the rising ratio of biogas sludge (BS) to FW, enhancing the soluble carbon recovery. The highest SCOAs production of 474.33 mg/g-VS was achieved at the ratio of 2:1 in 72 h. To further utilize the carbon source, the solids from the fermented residue (FR) was pyrolyzed at 400, 600 and 800 °C, respectively. Findings showed that the carbon content in biochar decreases with the increasing pyrolysis temperature, while the carbon in pyrolysis gas exhibits the opposite trend. Integrating the AF and pyrolysis contributed to a carbon recovery about 56.39% when the FW and BS were co-fermented at a 2:1 ratio, followed by its FR was pyrolyzed at 600 °C. Additionally, the biochar prepared under these conditions displayed a specific surface area (SSA) of 313.10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, along with abundant pore structures and functional groups, indicating its potential applications as pollutant adsorbents and soil amendments. This research offers a new perspective on efficiently recovering high-value carbon sources through the co-treatment of FW and its digestate via AF integrated with pyrolysis.
40058055	Effects of organic material addition on carbon cycling and soil fertility in paddy soil.	Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in plant nutrient supply and soil physical, chemical, and biological function regulation. Factors such as climate change, human activities, and farm management practices can adversely affect SOC. Here, paddy soil in the double-cropping rice area of Hunan Province of China was cultured with eight kinds of organic materials, and the effects of organic fertilization on SOC content, humus content, and soil carbon sequestration efficiency were analyzed. The addition of straw, green fertilizer, and organic fertilizer had a positive influence on active SOC content. Straw addition had the most prolonged impact on soil microbial biomass carbon content, and green manure had the most rapid influence on soil dissolved organic carbon content. All organic materials enhanced the soil humus content; furthermore, the addition of organic fertilizers significantly improved the carbon sequestration efficiency among all treatments. The results of controlled culture experiments in paddy soils established that applying organic materials can increase SOC content, active carbon components, soil humus content, and the carbon fixation rate, thereby improving soil fertility. This study provides a theoretical basis for the optimal fertilization of paddy soil with organic material addition in China.
40058058	Preparation and bioactivities of chitosan nicotinamide derivatives and their application in the preservation of cherry tomatoes.	Three pyridine-3-formyl chitosan derivatives were successfully prepared, and the preservation performance of the derivatives was examined. According to the results, the derivatives exhibited better antifungal and antioxidant properties than that of chitosan. At a supply concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, 2-ANACS could scavenge DPPH radicals at a rate of (92.82 ± 0.38)%. Additionally, all three derivatives exhibited less cytotoxicity and higher biocompatibility. In the freshness preservation studies of cherry tomatoes, the three derivatives considerably decreased the weight loss rate and postponed the drop in V<sub>C</sub> and titratable acid content. After 32 days of 2.0 g/L VPPCS treatment, the weight loss of cherry tomatoes was (4.0 ± 0.52) % among them. Still, the weight loss of cherry tomato in the chitosan treatment and blank control was (5.5 ± 1.33) % and (5.94 ± 1.02) %, respectively, which was considerably decreased by VPPCS therapy. These findings demonstrated that adding niacin improved chitosan's antifungal and antioxidant properties, extended the shelf life of cherry tomatoes, and increased the potential uses of chitosan and its derivatives in fruit preservation.
40058201	Quantification of microplastics in agricultural soils by total organic carbon -solid sample combustion analysis.	Accurate quantification of microplastics (MPs) in soils is a significant challenge due to the complex nature of the organo-mineral matrix. Fine mineral particles and organic matter often interfere with the efficiency of extraction, identification and quantification of MPs from soils. Here, an optimized MP extraction and quantification method is proposed, using total organic carbon analyser-solid sample combustion unit (TOC-SSM) analysis. The approach entails a field survey, digestion of organic matter by Piranha solution, density separation, and quantification. This method achieves a high total recovery rate of 97.39 ± 14.25 (SE) % for particles sized between 300 and 600 µm, and 94.80 ± 13.48 (SE) % for particles less than 300 µm with spiked soil as samples. The optimised method is then applied to strawberry farm soils that use plastic mulch films to quantify MP contamination levels. Our results indicate MP concentrations of 12.24 ± 3.65 (SE) mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (for particles of 300-2000 µm in size) and 2.62 ± 0.66 (SE) mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (for particles smaller than 300 µm). With improved simplicity and the ability to provide the actual weight of plastics for the extraction and quantification of MPs, this work offers a potential approach for assessing low-density plastics in the northeastern Australian agricultural soils with a dominant MP contamination, specifically polyethylene (PE).
40058202	Anthropogenic impacts on regional leaching risks posed by trace metal(loid)s in the soil of an industrial city.	The leaching risks associated with trace metal(loid)s (s) in regional soil are complex due to the intricate interplay between pollution levels and soil properties. A K<sub>d</sub>-based regional leaching risk assessment method was developed to assess the leaching risks posed by soil TMs. The random forest model was used to identify the effects of the soil environment on the soil K<sub>d</sub> and the leaching risks. The reliability of the established method was successfully validated by field monitoring data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84). The mean total soil groundwater risk was 1.59, the high mobility of Cd contributed the most to total risks. High-risk areas were mainly located in the farmland and forestland around a smelter and areas with severe soil acidification. The high mobility and moderate contamination of TMs resulted in the highest leaching risks. Furthermore, soil acidification and the conversion of farmland to forestland would increase the leaching risk by 33.5 % and 46.4 %, respectively, while urban expansion would reduce the leaching risk by 60.3 %. The K<sub>d</sub>-based leaching risk assessment method provided a critical framework for decision-makers to efficiently identify high-risk areas on a regional scale, facilitating a deeper understanding of how anthropogenic activities influenced the leaching risks of TMs in soil.
40058208	Effects of microplastics on black soil health: A global meta-analysis.	Microplastics (MPs) have garnered widespread attention as an emerging global contaminant. However, the impacts of MPs on black soil health remain unclear. A meta-analysis of 337 cases from 33 studies was conducted to elucidate the effects of MPs on black soil health. The analysis incorporated 35 indicators, including soil properties, soil enzymes, plant growth, soil animal health, and soil microbial diversity. We investigated the effects of MPs properties, such as particle type, size, concentration, and exposure duration, on soil health. Results showed that MPs led to notable increases in SOM, DOC, available nitrogen by 31.84 %, 14.35 %, and 12.45 %, respectively, while decreasing nitrate nitrogen by 12.89 %. In addition, MPs exposure enhanced soil urease activity by 11.24 % but reduced phosphatase activity by 6.62 %. MPs also diminished microbial alpha-diversity, caused oxidative damage in earthworms, and suppressed plant germination rates. Notably, smaller MPs, higher concentrations, longer exposure periods, and conventional MPs have more detrimental effects on soil health. By applying the entropy weight method combined with the analytical hierarchy process, we quantified the overall impact of MPs on black soil health as a 12.09 % decrease. Our findings underscore the risks of persistent MPs pollution to black soil health.
40058237	Decoding the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors for fine-tuning target genes in rice.	In the intricate landscape of gene regulation, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) play a pivotal role in controlling gene expression across various biological processes in plants. The bHLH domain, about 60 amino acids long, consists of a DNA-binding basic region and a dimerization helix-loop-helix region. In rice, 188 bHLH proteins are encoded and more than 90 functionally characterized. To finely regulate the expression of various target genes, bHLH TFs engage multiple transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.
40058239	Phenotypic plasticity of Eurohypnum leptothallum in degraded karst ecosystems: Adaptative mechanisms and ecological functions driven by warming temperatures.	Phenotypic plasticity is a critical mechanism for plants to adapt to rapid climate change and other global change drivers. Eurohypnum leptothallum is widely distributed in fragile subtropical karst ecosystems, exhibiting strong drought tolerance, water retention, and soil stabilization capabilities, playing a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling and ecological restoration. Our study investigated the specific manifestations of phenotypic plasticity in epilithic E. leptothallum within degraded karst ecosystems. Results showed that E. leptothallum exhibited high phenotypic plasticity in the heterogeneous environments of degraded karst ecosystems. In the temperature range of 21.5 °C-59.5 °C, E. leptothallum developed a set of adaptive mechanisms in response to warming temperatures through the trade-offs and combinations in most morphological traits (increasing in shoot height, stem cortical ratio and leaf middle cell lumen area, decreasing in stem diameter and stem central strand ratio, making leaf shape, cell shape and lumen shape tend to ellipse) and physiological traits (increasing in C, Ca, C:N, C:P, N:P, Fv/Fm and Y(NO), decreasing in qP). Furthermore, these phenotypic variations may confer certain ecological benefits to the degraded karst ecosystems and are expected to contribute to the maintenance and sustainable development of structural stability and species diversity in degraded karst ecosystems and even global ecosystems in the early stages of global warming. The findings provide a new perspective for exploring the response of bryophytes to environmental changes, a theoretical basis for predicting the adaptive strategies of E. leptothallum and its potential ecological functions to degraded karst ecosystems under global warming.
40058252	Biodegradable and antibacterial edible films based on egg yolk granules/gelatin/CMC with e-poly-l-lysine: Application in fresh chicken meat preservation.	Novel biodegradable and antibacterial edible films were fabricated by incorporating E-poly-l-lysine (EPL) into egg yolk granules, gelatin, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose matrices. With increasing EPL concentration (0.3-0.9 %), water vapor permeability decreased to 0.215 ± 0.005 g.mm/m<sup>2</sup>.h.Kpa, while the water contact angle increased to 79.8°, enhancing transparency. X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy revealed the uniform dispersion of the EPL in the matrix, likely due to enhanced intermolecular interaction. The 0.9 %-EPL film exhibited strong antimicrobial activity and biodegraded in soil within seven days. Additionally, chicken meat packaged with films was stored at 4 °C for 8 days. Results showed that the 0.9 %-EPL film significantly reduced the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, pH, and total viable count, thereby extending its shelf life. In summary, the EPL-enhanced egg yolk granules/gelatin/CMC edible film exhibits significant potential as an eco-friendly antimicrobial packaging material.
40058304	Nationwide prediction of pesticide residual levels in soil: Implications on the resulting risk and prioritization framework.	Pesticides are widely accumulated in agricultural soils in China under successive applications, causing negative impacts on non-target species and environmental qualities. However, a nationwide overview of the residual levels of pesticides in soil, and the ecological risks to non-target soil species are lacking. In this study, we calculated geographically gridded concentrations of 107 pesticide active ingredients (AIs) in soils in China based on the Computational Pesticide Input (CPI) model and further assessed the ecological risks to soil biota. In the end, we proposed an integrated usage-impact model to identify prioritize control pesticides based on the usage, risk and persistence of pesticides. Pesticide concentrations were calculated in a range from 0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to over 185 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Glyphosate is the most prevalent pesticide that exists in most locations. The ecological risks were mostly assessed as medium risk, with extreme high- and high risk found in 1 % and 21 % of soils. Supervision and management of azoxystrbin, boscalid, butachlor and chlorpyrifos need to be prioritized. The results of this study provide guidance to local governments for the designation more accurate risk mitigation strategies across regions.
40058331	Radiocesium dynamics from canopy to forest floor by main depositional processes in Fukushima forests at quasi-equilibrium state.	Accurate measurement of the amounts of radiocesium (<sup>137</sup>Cs) that transfer from the canopy to the forest floor at the recent quasi-equilibrium state is crucial for improving the accuracy of long-term predictions of <sup>137</sup>Cs distribution in forests. This study is the first to detail the <sup>137</sup>Cs flux via throughfall, stemflow, and litterfall processes in two Japanese cedar forests (KU1-S and KU2-S) and one deciduous broad-leaved forest (KU1-Q) in the Fukushima Prefecture during the quasi-equilibrium state. From 2020 to 2023, the annual transfer of <sup>137</sup>Cs from the canopy to the forest floor, relative to the initial deposition, varied among the study plots but never exceeded 2% (0.433-0.564% in KU1-S, 1.06-1.62% in KU2-S, and 0.421-0.461% in KU1-Q). Since the transfer of <sup>137</sup>Cs from trees to soil is balanced with the transfer from soil to trees at the quasi-equilibrium state, these percentages can be interpreted as the root uptake of <sup>137</sup>Cs from the soil, which is difficult to observe directly. Analysis of the contributions of litterfall, throughfall, and stemflow to the total transfer of <sup>137</sup>Cs revealed that litterfall accounted for more than 50% in both Japanese cedar and deciduous broad-leaved forests. We also found that the proportion of <sup>137</sup>Cs flux via litterfall was higher in Japanese cedar forests compared to the deciduous broad-leaved forest (KU1-S:91-92%; KU2-S:74-77%; KU1-Q:57-60%). These findings regarding the <sup>137</sup>Cs fluxes at the quasi-equilibrium state will enhance our understanding of the future dynamics of <sup>137</sup>Cs within forest ecosystems and improve the accuracy of long-term predictions of <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentration in forests.
40058417	Isolation, identification and bioprospecting potential of Bacillus subtilis, endophytic bacterium from Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. ex Savigny.	Mangroves are crucial for supporting coastal communities, benefiting both humans and animals. Their intricate root systems grasp the soil, mitigating erosion and dampening wave impact. As a result, they shield and fortify shorelines that would otherwise erode. This study focuses on the isolation of endophytic bacteria from the stem of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. Molecular analysis using 16S rDNA gene sequencing identified the isolate as Bacillus subtilis (BG1). Its hydrolytic enzyme production capabilities were assessed, revealing its ability to produce cellulase, amylase, protease and L-asparaginase. The isolate also demonstrated various plant growth promoting traits including ammonia production, indole 3- acetic (IAA) production, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production, phosphate solubilization, and ACC deaminase activity. IAA and organic acid production were quantified using Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with B. subtilis producing 86.32 ± 0.64 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> of IAA, peaking at a retention time of 6.8 minutes. The endophyte also produced two different organic acids during phosphate solubilization with malic acid been the most abundant (398.79 ± 2.58 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, B. subtilis was able to form biofilm and exhibited drug resistance towards Cefixime (5 μg). Biofilm was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Invitro antagonist studies demonstrated the significant effectiveness of B. subtilis against two pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. This is the first study to successfully isolate and identify endophytic bacteria from B. gymnorrhiza, highlighting its plant growth promoting traits, biofilm forming potential, and antibacterial capabilities.
40058434	Characterization of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) raw bast fibers of monoecious versus dioecious cultivars from flowering to senescence: FTIR of lignocelluloses and extract bioactivities.	Hemp is a multipurpose crop. Due to the revived interest in sustainable crops, hemp cultivation has increased in recent years. Both dioecious and monoecious hemp varieties are cultivated, yet few studies provide a comparative characterization. Monoecious cannabis plants are more uniform and economically efficient, being a whole-plant harvesting type. The aim of this research was to provide a comparative characterization of monoecious versus dioecious hemp bast fibers. There was conducted a microscopic analysis that showed their localization, the FTIR characterization of raw lignocellulosic fibers and extract bioactivity assays (antioxidant and microbiologic). Results indicated that FTIR absorbance ratios of peaks 1427/897 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1373-1375/667 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and1373/2905-2910 cm<sup>-1</sup> are relevant for hemp fibers parameters. A significant positive correlation was found between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity (r = 0.69*, r = 0.56*). Analysis of raw bast fibers extract indicated that the monoecious cultivar in the senescence phenophases had highest total phenolic content, and was more effective against all tested pathogenic bacterial strains. Both monoecious cultivar and male plants of the dioecious cultivar had higher total phenolic content than female plants of the dioecious cultivar, although at different phenophases. The male plants in the technological maturity phenophases presented the highest total phenolic content. Lower antioxidant activity was registered by female plants of the dioecious cultivar, which also showed lower total phenolic content, and the extract had no effect against Listeria monocytogenes, regardless of harvest time. The findings thus point to monoecious cultivars as having potential relevance in applications requiring enhanced bioactive properties, besides being advantageous for large-scale cultivation for fibers and seeds due to the economic efficiency.
40058441	TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber incorporating hydrophobic TA-HBPSi nanoparticles aerogels for efficient adsorption of fungicides in water.	Fungicide contamination is a critical environmental issue, and the effective removal of fungicide residues from aquatic environments has attracted significant attention from researchers. In this study, the synthesized hyperbranched polysiloxane (TA-HBPSi) was grafted onto TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNF) to fabricate a novel aerogel material (TA-HBPSi@TOCNF) with the aim of enhancing the sorption efficiency of fungicide. The equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity of TA-HBPSi@TOCNF for imazalil (8.04 mg/g) was significantly higher compared to other fungicides, including prochloraz (6.43 mg/g), thiophanate-methyl (4.12 mg/g), carbendazim (0.16 mg/g), and thiabendazole (0.04 mg/g). In the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, the equilibrium adsorption capacity for imazalil increased from 8.04 mg/g to 9.61 mg/g, while the adsorption capacity for Cd<sup>2+</sup> increased from 0.26 mg/g to 0.88 mg/g. Quantum chemical calculations were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level. The energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ΔE(<sub>HOMO-LUMO</sub>)) for various adsorption mechanisms indicated that electrostatic interactions were the dominant driving force for adsorption, followed by π-π electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions and hydrophobic interactions. The developed aerogel demonstrated effective multi-component separation capabilities without inducing secondary environmental pollution, highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for practical water purification applications.
40058542	Iron at the helm: steering arsenic speciation through redox processes in soils.	The toxicity and bioavailability of arsenic (As) in soils are largely determined by its speciation. Iron (Fe) is widely present in soils with a strong affinity for As, and therefore the environmental behaviors of As and Fe oxides (including oxides, hydrates and hydrated oxides) are closely correlated with each other. The redox fluctuations of Fe driven by changes in the environment can significantly affect As speciation and its fate in soils. The interaction between Fe and As has garnered widespread attention, and the adsorption mechanisms of As by Fe oxides have also been well-documented. However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of how Fe redox dynamics affects As speciation depending on the soil environmental conditions. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms for As speciation transformation and redistribution, as well as the role of environmental factors in the main Fe redox processes in soils. These processes include the biotic Fe oxidation mediated by Fe-oxidizing bacteria, abiotic Fe oxidation by oxygen or manganese oxides, dissimilatory Fe reduction mediated by Fe-reducing bacteria, and Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of Fe oxides. This review contributes to a deeper understanding of the environmental behaviors of Fe and As in soils, and provides theoretical guidance for the development of remediation strategies for As-contaminated soils.
40058549	Effects of nitrogen fertilization on antibiotic resistance gene spread from soil to floodwater in paddy fields.	The environmental risks associated with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have drawn increasing attention. Here, we investigated the spread of ARGs from soil to floodwater in paddy fields by conducting 5-year field experiments having four treatments: control, reduced N fertilization, conventional N fertilization (CN) and plant-based organic N fertilization (ON). In comparison to the control treatment, CN and ON treatments significantly increased the total N content by 26.8%-36.6% in soil and 42.7%-67.4% in floodwater, respectively. Additionally, ON treatments increased the concentrations of free-floating and particle-attached mobile gene elements in floodwater by 78.6% and 32.7%, respectively. Redundancy and linear regression analyses indicated that total N and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in soil and mobile gene elements in floodwater were closely connected with the levels of ARGs in floodwater. Correspondingly, CN and ON treatments increased total abundances of ARGs in floodwater to 1.26 and 1.46 times, respectively. The network analysis further revealed that ARGs, such as MexW, tetAB and optrA, could be carried by the hosts of ARGs (such as Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae) and spread from soil to particle-attached floodwater fractions through suspended solids. Moreover, structure equation models indicated that the evolution of ARGs in free-floating fractions could dominate the propagation of ARGs in floodwater. These findings provide valuable insights into the propagation of ARGs in paddy fields and highlight nutrient management in paddy field floodwater as a potentially effective strategy to mitigate the spread of ARGs.
40058575	Characterization of a novel virulent mycobacteriophage Kashi-SSH1 (KSSH1) depicting genus-specific broad-spectrum anti-mycobacterial activity.	Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious disease causing mortality in the world and the rise of drug resistance; multi-drug resistance (MDR) and extensive-drug resistance (XDR) has added to extra complicacy of the disease. In this scenario, phage therapy has emerged as a potential treatment option against drug-sensitive/-resistant strains.
40058661	Integrated modelling of anaerobic digestion process chain for scenario assessment.	Anaerobic digestion (AD) expansion as a renewable energy source offers environmental benefits, such as reducing mineral fertilizer use and preserving soil organic matter. However, poor AD performance can cause greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient loss, impacting efficiency. To address this, an innovative AD process chain (ADPC) model was developed to dynamically simulate biogas production, organic matter bioaccessibility, digestate phase separation, storage, and soil application, focusing on carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Evaluated against 5 lab-scale experiments and C/N soil dynamics without specific calibration, the model accurately reproduced trends (bias: 11% for biogas, r<sup>2</sup>: 0.78 for soil N dynamics), despite discrepancies in digestate carbon speciation and soil C dynamics, emphasizing the importance of calibrating feedstock biodegradability and hydrolysis parameters to enhance accuracy. Additionally, feedstock seasonality scenarios demonstrated the importance of dynamic modeling in predicting agronomic digestate fate positioning ADPC as a valuable tool for scenario testing considering both energy and agronomic valorization.
40058874	Role of Arabidopsis monomeric E3 ubiquitin ligases in the ABA signaling pathway.	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key phytohormone that regulates multiple biological processes in plants, including seed germination, seedling growth, and abiotic stress response. ABA enhances drought tolerance by promoting stomatal closure, thereby improving crop productivity under unfavorable stress conditions. Extensive research efforts have focused on understanding ABA signaling more clearly for its potential application in agriculture. The accumulation and stability of signaling components involved in the efficient transduction of downstream ABA signaling are affected by both transcriptional regulation and post-translational modifications. Ubiquitination is a representative post-translational modification that regulates protein stability, and E3 ubiquitin ligase is a key enzyme that determines target substrates for ubiquitination. To date, many E3 ligases functioning as a monomeric form such as RING-, HECT- and Ubox-types have been known to participate in the ABA signaling process. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of ABA-related monomeric E3 ligases, their regulation, and mode of action in Arabidopsis, which will help develop a detailed and integrated understanding of the ABA signaling process in Arabidopsis.
40058890	Visualizing the spatial distribution of metabolites in tomato fruit at different maturity stages by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging.	Tomato is one of the highest-value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide, serving as an important source of micro-nutrients in the human diet. Understanding the spatial distribution changes of critical metabolites during fruit maturation is essential for investigating the physiological roles, nutritional value, and potential functional values of phytochemicals in tomato fruit. However, information on their spatial distribution remains limited. This study aimed to visualize the distribution differences of endogenous metabolites in tomatoes across four maturity stages (from green to red) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Relative quantification results showed that as the fruit ripened, levels of soluble sugars, amino acids and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increased significantly at the red ripening stage, while L-hydroxysuccinic acid exhibited an opposite trend, and citric acid initially decreased, then increased. Mass spectrometry imaging revealed that soluble sugars, organic acids, and amino acids were evenly distributed throughout the fruit across all maturity stages. During maturation, nine VOCs transitioned from a widespread distribution in the flesh tissue to concentrating near the peel, suggesting that aromatic compounds predominantly localize in the fruit's outer regions at full maturity. Additionally, a colocalization phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the spatial distribution imaging of each metabolite. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the changes and distribution of phytochemicals during tomato fruit development, offering a scientific basis for breeding, utilization, and production strategies.
40058912	Establishing a database of volatile metabolites in whole wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour provides novel insights into quality breeding.	Improving yield traits is the primary goal for wheat breeding, while much less attention has been paid to flavor and odor quality of wheat grain. In this study, a high-throughput protocol was developed for the identification and quantification of volatile compounds (VOCs) in wheat grains via a static head-space coupled with GC-MS. Using a diverse population consisting of 312 wheat germplasms, a database including 94 VOCs was constructed for grains. The main pathways for the biosynthesis of VOCs in wheat grains was constructed by manually assigning the volatiles to the lipoxygenase, the mevalonic acid and the shikimate/phenylalanine pathway, respectively. VOC profiling showed that grain VOCs were mainly synthesized from the LOX pathway and the content of VOCs varied largely between different wheat lines. Clear discrimination was identified between old and modern cultivars by OPLS-DA, indicating a reduction of VOCs both in species and content in modern cultivars. Correlation analysis and machine learning models established a link between VOC profiles and grain protein content. VOCs such as 1-octen-3-ol were significantly correlated with grain protein content, which can be used as diagnostic markers for wheat grain quality. In summary, our study established a comprehensive VOC database for wheat grains and explored the relationships between VOCs and grain quality traits in a diverse wheat population, providing novel insights into grain quality improvement and flavor enhancement in modern breeding programs.

40059061	Rate of herbicide resistant weed development: A Canadian Prairie case study.	Genetically modified crop adoption in Canada has been the key driver in removing tillage as the lead form of weed control, due to increased weed control efficiency. Land use has transitioned from the use of summerfallow to continuous cropping, predominantly involving zero or minimum tillage practices. Prairie crop rotations have diversified away from mainly cereals to include three-year rotations of cereals, pulses, and oilseeds. Total herbicide volume applied has increased as crop production acres increased, but the rate of herbicide active ingredient applied per hectare has declined. Diverse crop rotations allow for weed control using herbicides with different modes of action, reducing selection pressure for resistant weed development. Herbicide-resistant weeds are an important concern for farmers, as the loss of key herbicides would make weed control exceedingly more difficult. The objective of this case study is to examine herbicide resistance weed development in the Canadian Prairies and to identify changes in resistance development following GM crop adoption.
40059115	Evaluation of soybean germplasms for resistance to stay-green syndrome.	Stay-green syndrome (SGS) resistant germplasms serve as the cornerstone for soybean improvement. A comprehensive assessment was conducted on a panel of 1553 germplasms to evaluate their resistance to SGS through natural inoculation. Over a three-year period, one landrace, ZaoShuHeiDou, emerged as resilient to SGS, displaying a significantly reduced risk of SGS (p < 0.05) compared to its counterparts. The broad-sense heritability of SGS resistance was 0.86. Notably, landraces demonstrated a substantially lower incidence of SGS compared to improved cultivars. Furthermore, the severity of SGS correlated with several key traits pertinent to soybean improvement efforts. In field trials, the application of insecticides effectively mitigated SGS severity, whereas the use of organic fertilizers and soil sterilization had no discernible impact. A total of 83 DNA samples were successfully amplified from SGS-afflicted plants using specific primers for soybean stay-green associated virus (SoSGV), and a SoSGV LCU-1 strain was isolated. The qPCR analysis confirmed a positive correlation between SGS severity and the relative SoSGV copy number in afflicted plants. The findings of this study lay a solid foundation for the development of SGS-resistant cultivars and the exploration of underlying resistance mechanisms.
40059154	Allele and transcriptome mining in Gossypium hirsutum reveals variation in candidate genes at genetic loci affecting cotton fiber quality and textile flammability.	Breeding valuable traits in crop plants requires identifying diverse alleles in the germplasm that are likely to affect desirable characteristics. The genetic diversity of historic cultivars of cotton is a reservoir of potentially important genes for crop improvement and genetic research. Diversity in the characteristics of harvested cotton fibers affects their suitability for end-use applications. Candidate loci and genes have been identified that affect the length, strength, and maturity of cotton fibers which affect the quality and value of the yarn, thread and textile. Natural genetic mechanisms in the plant may also affect the flammability of the produced textiles.
40059155	Altitudinal impacts on phytochemical composition and mycorrhizal diversity of Reinwardtia indica Dumort, a medicinally valuable herb.	Reinwardtia indica, a highly valued ethnomedicinal plant, has been traditionally used to treat various ailments due to its rich phytochemical composition. However, the impact of environmental factors, particularly altitude, on its medicinal properties remains unexplored. This study investigates the effects of altitudinal variation on phytochemicals, mycorrhizal diversity, and soil physico-chemical parameters of R. indica.
40059163	Effects of DA-6 and MC on the growth, physiology, and yield characteristics of soybean.	As a grain and oil crop, soybean presents a much lower yield than other staple crops. However, crop yields can be improved by applying modern agricultural technology, such as diethylaminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6) and mepiquat chloride (MC), which are important plant-growth regulators that substantially affect crop growth and yield.
40059178	Advancements and challenges in microalgal protein production: A sustainable alternative to conventional protein sources.	The increasing global demand for sustainable protein sources necessitates the exploration of alternative solutions beyond traditional livestock and crop-based proteins. Microalgae present a promising alternative due to their high protein content, rapid biomass accumulation, and minimal land and water requirements. Furthermore, their ability to thrive on non-arable land and in wastewater systems enhances their sustainability and resource efficiency. Despite these advantages, scalability and economical feasibility remain major challenges in microalgal protein production. This review explores recent advancements in microalgal protein cultivation and extraction technologies, including pulsed electric field, ultrasound-assisted extraction, enzyme-assisted extraction, and microwave-assisted extraction. These innovative techniques have significantly improved protein extraction efficiency, purity, and sustainability, while addressing cell wall disruption and protein recovery challenges. Additionally, the review examines protein digestibility and bioavailability, particularly in the context of human nutrition and aquafeed applications. A critical analysis of life cycle assessment studies highlights the environmental footprint and economical feasibility of microalgal protein production compared to conventional protein sources. Although microalgal protein production requires significant energy inputs, advancements in biorefinery approaches, carbon dioxide sequestration, and industrial integration can help mitigate these limitations. Finally, this review outlines key challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need for cost reduction strategies, genetic engineering for enhanced yields, and industrial-scale process optimization. By integrating innovative extraction techniques with biorefinery models, microalgal proteins hold immense potential as a sustainable, high-quality protein source for food, feed, and nutraceutical applications.
40059228	Transcriptional reprogramming and microbiome dynamics in garden pea exposed to high pH stress during vegetative stage.	High soil pH induces the upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress and nutrient transport, while the enrichment of beneficial microbes (Variovorax, Chaetomium, and Pseudomonas) highlights their potential role in promoting stress adaptation. High soil pH severely impacts plant growth and productivity, yet the transcriptomic changes and microbial dynamics underlying stress adaptation in garden pea (Pisum sativum ssp. hortense) remain unclear. This study demonstrates that high soil pH leads to stunted growth, reduced biomass, impaired photosynthesis, and nutrient status in garden pea. Further, disruption in key nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium indicum, R. leguminosarum, and R. redzepovicii), along with the downregulation of NifA and NifD genes and upregulation of NifH in nodules highlights the critical role of micronutrient balance in legume-microbe symbiosis and a compensatory response to maintain nitrogen status. RNA seq analysis revealed extensive transcriptional reprogramming in roots, characterized by the upregulation of oxidative stress response genes (e.g., oxidoreductase and glutathione transferase activities, metal ion transporters) and the downregulation of genes related to ammonia-lyase activity and ion binding, reflecting broader disruptions in nutrient homeostasis. KEGG pathway analysis identified enrichment of MAPK signaling pathway, likely interacting with other pathways associated with stress tolerance, metabolic adjustment, and structural reorganization as part of adaptive responses to high pH. Root microbiome analysis showed significant enrichment of Variovorax, Shinella, and Chaetomium, suggesting host-driven recruitment under high pH stress. Stable genera, such as Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, Mycobacterium, Herbaspirillum, and Paecilomyces, displayed resilience to stress conditions, potentially forming core microbiome components for adaptation to high pH. In a targeted study, inoculation of plants with an enriched microbiome, particularly C. globosum, under high pH conditions improved growth parameters and increased the abundance of Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas in the roots. It suggests that these bacterial genera may act as helper microbes to C. globosum, collectively promoting stress resilience in pea plants suffering from high pH. These findings provide a foundation for microbiome-aided breeding programs and the development of microbial consortia to enhance the adaptation of pea plants to high pH conditions.
40059268	The oligosaccharyltransferase subunit PsSTT3A regulates N-glycosylation and is critical for development and virulence of Phytophthora sojae.	In eukaryotes, N-glycosylation is a complex, multistep process in which the core subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase, Staurosporine and Temperature Sensitive 3A (STT3A), plays a critical role in the catalytic activity of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. We found that the PsSTT3A gene plays a critical role in the viability of Phytophthora sojae (P. sojae). Furthermore, full PsSTT3A function was crucial to mycelial growth, sporangium production, zoospore production, and pathogenicity, as determined by gene silencing experiments. PsSTT3A is, itself, a highly N-glycosylated protein with six consensus NXS/T (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) motifs and one novel NS motif. However, the N-glycosylation sites on PsSTT3A that are required to support the development and virulence of P. sojae have been uncertain. Here, we demonstrated that glycosylation of site N593 is essential for normal mycelial growth and virulence in P. sojae. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis was disrupted by the mutation of N593. N593A mutations reduced the stability of the elicitin PsSOJ2A, an N-glycoprotein, in gene replacement transformations. Our study reveals the functional significance of N-glycosylation of PsSTT3A in the development and infection cycles of P. sojae, demonstrating that targeting of PsSTT3A may be a promising strategy for developing new mode of action fungicides.
40059346	Copper and Nitrogen Codoped CDs for Alleviating the Damage of Reactive Oxygen Species for Cucumber Seedlings under Salt Stress.	Dramatic changes in climate and soil environments have made growing conditions for crops more challenging. These crops are subject to a range of abiotic stresses in different environments, which can lead to significant yield losses, resulting in economic and environmental damages. Herein, we report a straightforward one-pot hydrothermal method for creating carbon dots codoped with copper and nitrogen (Cu,N-CDs). Under salt stress conditions, Cu,N-CDs demonstrate the ability to alleviate oxidative damage in cucumber seedlings by modulating antioxidant defense mechanisms and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cucumber seedling biomass accumulation is greatly enhanced by Cu,N-CDs treatment in the presence of a ROS burst, leading to a notable rise in the dry weight, plant height, and fresh weight. Cu,N-CDs mitigate oxidative damage in cucumber seedlings by activating antioxidant defense systems, specifically enhancing the activities of superoxide dismutase (+34.08%), catalase (+28.11%), peroxidase (+17.54%), and ascorbate peroxidase (+31.54%) to scavenge ROS. Furthermore, Cu,N-CDs can enhance the levels of nonenzymatic elements within the antioxidant system, such as polyphenols (+23.60%), flavonoids (+15.43%), and carotenoid content (+51.73%), which strengthen the scavenging ability of cucumber seedlings against ROS. Meanwhile, Cu,N-CDs can induce a significant increase of soluble sugar and soluble protein content by 27.27 and 32.58%, respectively, which improves the osmotic pressure as well as stress tolerance of plants. Additionally, the accumulation of biomass was aided by the increase in the photosynthetic pigment content that Cu,N-CDs treatment can produce.

40059455	TRTBee: A standalone calculator for Time-Reinforced Toxicity according to EFSA honeybee guidelines.	The revised European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidance document for the risk assessment of plant protection products on honeybees requires an assessment of time-reinforced toxicity (TRT) using toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modelling. While there are user-friendly software options available for this modelling, it is not specialised for this new application, therefore conducting the TRT assessment still requires additional manual calculations. Here we present TRTBee: a new, freely available tool which is capable of automatically performing all stages of the TRT assessment. The tool is based on robust and well-known algorithms. We conclude with a brief discussion of the open problems that still exist within the EFSA scheme.
40059570	Investigation of the Effects of Applying Bio-Magnesium Oxide Nanoparticle Fertilizer to Moringa Oleifera Plants on the Chemical and Vegetative Properties of the Plants' leaves.	Magnesium (Mg) is necessary for plants as a structural element or an enzyme cofactor. It also plays a significant role in the light and dark responses of photosynthesis. Moringa plants are considered one of the most important medicinal plants that humans need for nutrition. The aim of the study is to provide Mg to plants in an easy and simple way. Therefore, it is widely available in human food due to its nutritional importance. In this experiment, the treatment was done on the Moringa plant as, one of the medicinal plants that is increasingly used in fresh form. The experiment was conducted at the research farm of the National Research Center. Magnesium oxide has been extracted and prepared in a natural way that is safe for humans, plants, and soil. Trichoderma viride filtrate was used as a chelating agent in an environmentally friendly process to create magnesium oxide nanoparticle (MgO-NPs). FTIR, TEM, and SEM-EDX were utilized to analyze and characterize the synthesized. Plants were treated with different doses to determine the optimal concentration for the plant. The effect of treatment on plants was to improve vegetation such, as a number of leaves (232.15), leaf area (273.97 cm<sup>2</sup>), and fresh weight (3693.17 g). It also increased dry matter in the plant (171.8 g), chemical properties, and elements.
40059591	IIS/TOR network plays an essential role in ovarian development in the pupal stage of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda.	The ovary plays a crucial role in the female reproductive system of insects and is vital for the perpetuation of insect populations. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling network play a key role in controlling ovarian development and maturation during the adult stage. However, the pupal stage is a critical developmental phase in the reproductive system of holometabolous insects, and the regulatory role of the IIS/TOR network during this stage remains to be elucidated. In this study, we observed that during the pupal stage, the enlargement of ovarian development was accompanied by a corresponding increase in messenger RNA expression levels of genes within the IIS/TOR signaling pathway and insulin levels in the hemolymph. Decapitation experiments, serving as a pivotal approach to assess the regulatory role of the IIS signaling pathway in ovarian development, demonstrated that decapitation markedly inhibited ovarian development at this critical stage. Exogenous insulin administration significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of FOXO, S6K, and 4E-BP, thereby enhancing ovarian development and resulting in significant elongation of the ovarioles. In contrast, the injection of IIS/TOR pathway inhibitors, LY294002 and Rapamycin, reduced the phosphorylation of these proteins, inhibiting ovarian development during the pupal stage and leading to a significant shortening of the ovarioles, negatively impacting the reproductive performance of adult females. The current findings indicate that the IIS/TOR signaling network significantly regulates ovarian development during the pupal stage of Spodoptera frugiperda, providing new molecular insights for the development of pest management strategies.
40059664	18-year plant reproductive phenology dataset from Lambir, Borneo, including four large general flowering events.	Flowering and fruiting phenology can have large impacts on a plant's reproductive success. In many plant species, these phenological events are controlled by seasonal climatic cues, resulting in one-year reproductive cycles. However, parts of SE Asian tropical forests have an aseasonal climate with irregular fluctuations. This database comprises phenology records collected from 1993 to 2011 at the community level in an aseasonal lowland dipterocarp forest of the Lambir Hills National Park in Borneo. Observations were made every two weeks at three sites: The Canopy Biology Plot (CBP) with tree towers and walkways, the Operation Raleigh Tower (ORT) area with a tree tower for tourist attraction, and the Crane Plot located between the CBP and ORT, where plants were monitored from terraces on a canopy crane installed in 2000. The dataset includes in total 172,521 records of 450, 118, and 51 plants in CBP, Crane Plot, and ORT, respectively, representing 303 species. The number of individuals per species ranges from 1 to 21, and 64.9% are represented by only one. The plants in the censuses were mostly trees but also included lianas and epiphytes. The data have been used to study the causes and consequences of synchronized flowering and fruiting at the community level, a phenomenon unique to the region. Previous studies have shown that this synchronization is synergistically driven by cool air temperature and drought. Irregular flowering and fruiting have significant impacts on flower visitors, frugivores, forest material cycling, and plant regeneration. The dataset can also be used for comparing the phenology of the same species or group among forests and regions and exploring its association with climates. One major concern regarding tropical forests in the area is the effects of climate change on this community-wide masting regime, which could disrupt forest regeneration and ecosystem processes. The dataset could be an important source of information for conservation efforts aimed at protecting these amazingly diverse forest ecosystems. This dataset can be freely used for non-commercial purposes. Users of these data should cite this data paper in any publications resulting from its use and acknowledge the Forest Department Sarawak and Sarawak Forestry Corporation.
40059719	Improved Modeling of Vegetation Phenology Using Soil Enthalpy.	Many vegetation phenological models predominantly rely on temperature, overlooking the critical roles of water availability and soil characteristics. This limitation significantly impacts the accuracy of phenological projections, particularly in water-limited ecosystems. We proposed a new approach incorporating soil enthalpy-a comprehensive metric integrating soil moisture, temperature, and texture-to improve phenological modeling. Using an extensive dataset combining FLUXNET observations, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), and meteorological data across the Northern Hemisphere (NH), we analyzed the relationship between soil enthalpy and vegetation phenology from 2001 to 2020. Our analysis revealed significant temporal trends in soil enthalpy that corresponded with changes in leaf onset date (LOD) and leaf senescence date (LSD). We developed and validated a new soil enthalpy-based model with optimized parameters. The soil enthalpy-based model showed particularly strong performance in autumn phenology, improving LSD simulation accuracy by at least 15% across all vegetation types. For shrub and grassland ecosystems, LOD projections improved by more than 12% compared to the temperature-based model. Future scenario analysis using CMIP6 data (2020-2054) revealed that the temperature-based model consistently projects earlier LOD and later LSD compared to the soil enthalpy-based model, suggesting potential overestimation of growing season length in previous studies. This study establishes soil enthalpy as a valuable metric for phenological modeling and highlights the importance of incorporating both water availability and soil characteristics for more accurate predictions of vegetation phenology under changing climatic conditions.
40059763	The potential of silicon in crop protection against phloem feeding and chewing insect pests - a review.	As future crop production is threatened by the increasing incidence of insect pests caused by changing climate, it is crucial to focus on searching for alternative methods of insect pest management. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the effect of silicon (Si) on the incidence, growth, development, longevity, survival, feeding efficiency, and reproduction parameters of phloem sap feeding and chewing insects of plants. While Si may negatively impact the biological parameters of both insect guilds, the effect is generally more pronounced in chewing insects, and often varies under different cultivation conditions. In addition to the direct effect of Si on insect pest performance, the potential mechanisms of Si-mediated resistance of infested plants are discussed. These involve increasing plant mechanical properties (Si-based or other organic barriers), and boosting biochemical defence responses, such as increased antioxidant activity, stimulated activity of defence enzymes, attraction of parasitoids and predators of insect pests, and synthesis of toxic and taste repelling compounds. These changes create a complex Si-induced defence system that enables infested plants to better withstand insect pest attack, ultimately reducing pest damage and improving agricultural crop yields.
40059779	Myricetin alleviates high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice by regulating bile acid metabolism involved in gut microbiota remodeling.	Atherosclerosis poses a significant threat to global health. This study aimed to investigate the effects of myricetin (MYR) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our findings demonstrated that MYR treatment significantly reduced the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, particularly at a high dose of 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, MYR markedly attenuated lipid metabolism disorders in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice by decreasing body weight, improving serum lipid profiles, and reducing lipid deposition. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that MYR treatment enhanced the abundance of probiotic <i>g</i>_<i>Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136</i>, while it reduced that of obesity-associated genera, including <i>Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>. Metabolomic analysis and RT-qPCR tests indicated that MYR upregulated hepatic bile acid biosynthesis, evidenced by increased total bile acid levels and enhanced expression of key enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, particularly through the classical biosynthetic pathway. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed strong associations between the regulated bile acids and these aforementioned bacteria. Therefore, our results demonstrated that MYR exerts an anti-atherosclerotic effect by modulating the gut-liver axis.
40059837	Understanding zoonotic pathogens and risk factors from wildlife in Southeast Asia: a systematic literature review.	The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the significance of the human-animal interface in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, with wildlife serving as an important source of infection. A better understanding of the specific pathogens and mechanisms involved is vital to prepare against future outbreaks, especially in Southeast Asia, a hotspot for zoonotic diseases. This paper reviews the published literature on wildlife zoonoses in this region from 2012 to 2022. The results show a diverse range of potential zoonotic pathogens and the widespread occurrence of zoonotic diseases from wildlife. Drivers of zoonotic pathogen spillover include (i) environmental factors (e.g. animal habitat disruption, environmental conditions, exposure to contaminated water/food/soil), (ii) animal factors (e.g. movement patterns, age-related susceptibility), (iii) human factors (e.g. lack of awareness, poor hygiene practices, age, gender and income) and (iv) human-animal-environmental interface factors (e.g. close contact between humans and animals, exposure through visiting animals and presence of vectors). The diverse drivers of zoonoses in Southeast Asia put its communities at risk for infection. To mitigate these risks, global health efforts should consider adopting a One Health approach to foster collaboration across human, animal, and wildlife health sectors. This could involve educating communities on safe animal interactions and improving disease surveillance.

By integrating recent findings, this review lays a foundation for advancing the understanding and utilization of SPs to improve plant resilience and productivity.
40060111	Integrating AI detection and language models for real-time pest management in Tomato cultivation.	Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> L.) cultivation is crucial globally due to its nutritional and economic value. However, the crop faces significant threats from various pests, including <i>Tuta absoluta</i>, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>, and <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i>, among others. These pests not only reduce yield but also increase production costs due to the heavy reliance on pesticides. Traditional pest detection methods are labor-intensive and prone to errors, necessitating the exploration of advanced techniques. This study aims to enhance pest detection in tomato cultivation using AI-based detection and language models. Specifically, it integrates YOLOv8 for detection and segmentation tasks and ChatGPT-4 for generating detailed, actionable insights on the detected pests. YOLOv8 was chosen for its superior performance in agricultural pest detection, capable of processing large volumes of data in real-time with high accuracy.

40060112	Metagenomics-based study of rhizospheric microorganisms of <i>Poa alpigena L.</i> in Qinghai Lake, Ganzi River Plateau.	<i>Poa alpigena</i> Lindm., a dominant forage grass on the Tibetan Plateau, plays a critical role in livestock production and grassland restoration. This study investigates the rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric soil microorganisms of <i>Poa alpigena L.</i> in the Ganzi River area of the Qinghai Lake basin using metagenomic sequencing to understand their diversity and potential ecological functions.
40060175	A 6.49-Mb inversion associated with the purple embryo spot trait in potato.	The embryo spot trait leads to a deep purple or reddish coloration at the base of the cotyledons of the embryo, visible on both sides of flat potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) seeds. This trait has long been used by potato researchers and breeders as a morphological marker during dihaploid induction. The formation of embryo spots reflects the accumulation of anthocyanins, but the genetic basis of this trait remains unclear. In this study, we mapped the embryo spot trait to a 6.78-Mb region at the end of chromosome 10 using an F<sub>2</sub> population derived from a cross between spotted and spotless plants. The recombination rate in the candidate region is severely suppressed, posing challenges for the map-based cloning of the underlying gene and suggesting large-scale rearrangements in this region. A de novo genome assembly of the spotted individual and a comparative genomic analysis to the reference genome of spotless potato revealed a 6.49-Mb inversion present in the spotted plant genome. The left breakpoint of this inversion occurred in the promoter region of an R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene that is highly expressed in the cotyledon base of spotted embryos but is not expressed in that of spotless embryos. This study elucidated the genetic basis for embryo spot formation in potato and provides a foundation for future cloning of the causative gene.
40060178	Developing a pipeline for identification, characterization and molecular editing of <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements: a case study in potato.	Crop breeding requires a balance of tradeoffs among key agronomic traits caused by gene pleiotropy. The molecular manipulation of genes can effectively improve target traits, but this may not reduce gene pleiotropy, potentially leading to undesirable traits or even lethal conditions. However, molecular editing of <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (CREs) of target genes may facilitate the dissection of gene pleiotropy to fine-tune gene expression. In this study, we developed a pipeline, in potato, which employs open chromatin to predict candidate CREs, along with both transient and genetic assays to validate the function of CREs and CRISPR/Cas9 to edit candidate CREs. We used <i>StCDF1</i> as an example, a key gene for potato tuberization and identified a 288 bp-core promoter region, which showed photoperiodic inducibility. A homozygous CRISPR/Cas9-editing line was established, with two deletions in the core promoter, which displayed a reduced expression level, resulting in late tuberization under both long-day and short-day conditions. This pipeline provides an alternative pathway to improve a specific trait with limited downside on other phenotypes.
40060179	Emerging strategies to improve heat stress tolerance in crops.	The heat stress (HS) response in plants involves complex processes at the molecular, cellular, and whole-organism levels. Sensitivity to HS differs based on the species and developmental stage of the plant, making it challenging to define HS and its impacts. Efforts to enhance HS tolerance by traditional breeding are constrained by limited genetic resources, but understanding the mechanisms that regulate HS responses can enable efforts to improve heat tolerance by precision breeding and gene editing. Here, we review recent research on the effects of HS on major cereal crops at different developmental stages and identify key genes potentially involved in the HS response, offering insight for precision molecular breeding. Additionally, we discuss the use of favorable natural variants and gene editing to improve crop tolerance to HS, emphasizing the value of alleles involved in thermomemory, combined stress tolerance, and the stress response-growth balance. This review aims to summarize recent advancements in understanding HS responses in crops, highlighting potential avenues for generating heat-tolerant crops.
40060180	LEAFY1 and 2 are required for floral organ development in soybean.	The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is a vital step for the reproductive success of plants. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, LEAFY (LFY) plays crucial roles in inflorescence primordium and floral organ development, but little is known about the roles of its homologs in crop plants such as soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Here, we investigated the expression patterns and functions of the two <i>LFY</i> genes (<i>LFY1</i> and <i>LFY2</i>) in soybean. Both genes were predominantly expressed in unopened flowers and the shoot apical meristem, with <i>LFY2</i> having the higher transcript abundance. In an in situ hybridization assay, <i>LFY</i> genes produced strong signals in the floral meristem. We next generated <i>lfy1</i> and <i>lfy2</i> knockout lines. The <i>lfy2</i> mutants showed obvious changes in floral organ morphology, but the <i>lfy1</i> mutants showed no obvious changes in floral organ morphology or pod development. The <i>lfy1 lfy2</i> double mutants displayed more serious defects in floral organ development than <i>lfy2</i>, resulting in complete sterility. Gene expression analysis revealed differences in expression of the A-class <i>APETALA</i> (<i>AP</i>) genes <i>AP1a</i> and <i>AP1b</i> in the double mutant lines. These results suggest that LFY2 plays an important role in floral organ formation in soybean by regulating the expression of homeotic genes. Our findings increase the understanding of floral development, which could be useful for flower designs during hybrid soybean breeding.
40060182	Convenient, high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in autotetraploid alfalfa using endogenous <i>U6</i> promoters and visual reporters.	CRISPR/Cas is a simple, robust, versatile tool for plant biology studies and precision plant breeding. However, establishing a high-efficiency gene editing system for multiplex editing of the autotetraploid crop alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.), the most important forage legume worldwide, remains a formidable challenge. Here, we systematically identified endogenous <i>U6</i> promoters in alfalfa through transient expression via <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated infiltration of alfalfa leaves. We further demonstrated the efficacy of the three most active promoters for genome editing using an optimized alfalfa hairy root system. Subsequently, we established an improved CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex system containing three or four tandemly arrayed <i>MsU6</i>-promoter-driven polycistronic tRNA-sgRNA (PTG) expression cassettes, each consisting of three tRNA-sgRNA units, to simultaneously edit three or four alfalfa genes, coupled with the visual reporter <i>RH1</i> or <i>RUBY</i>. This toolkit showed efficient multiplex editing in the hairy root system with visual selection. We successfully obtained regenerated, red-colored shoots resulting from the stable transformation of alfalfa. These results highlight the potential application of the visual reporter system for the stable transformation of alfalfa. Our improved CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex system enables convenient, high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in alfalfa, providing a versatile toolset to facilitate functional studies of multiple genes and gene families for basic research and the genetic improvement of alfalfa.
40060183	A high-throughput protocol for testing heat-stress tolerance in pollen.	Viable pollen is crucial for fertilization, but pollen is generally highly susceptible to heat stress. A quick, reliable method for testing the heat-stress tolerance of pollen is needed to improve the heat-stress tolerance in plants, but current methods require considerable space and labor. In addition, many such methods only test tolerance to a single constant temperature, making it time-consuming to screen heat tolerance over a wide temperature range and to examine the dynamics of pollen viability at different temperatures. To address this issue, we aimed to: (1) develop an easy, reliable method for measuring pollen viability at different temperatures; and (2) identify the best temperature range for screening pollen with high heat-stress tolerance. We harvested mature pollen from wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plants and transferred it to a 96-well plate filled with liquid medium containing sucrose. We placed the plate in a PCR machine operating under a gradient PCR program to simultaneously test a range of temperatures. After incubating the pollen for 4 h, at temperatures ranging from 21.9 to 47 °C, we examined the pollen grains under a light microscope and employed a specific image analysis pipeline to assess the effects of temperature on pollen morphology, germination, and tube growth. This method facilitated the high-throughput screening of many pollen samples, enabling rapid, reliable, and precise analysis of pollen viability in response to temperature. Our approach should be applicable to other plant species and could be used to identify quantitative trait loci or genes influencing heat stress tolerance in pollen for breeding programs.
40060186	Plant metabolomics: applications and challenges in the era of multi-omics big data.

Plant metabolomics, a key branch of systems biology, involves the comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the composition, variation, and functions of these metabolites. Advances in technology have transformed plant metabolomics into a sophisticated process involving sample collection, metabolite extraction, high-throughput analysis, data processing, and multidimensional statistical analysis. In today's era of big data, the field is witnessing an explosion in data acquisition, offering insight into the complexity and dynamics of plant metabolism. Moreover, multiple omics strategies can be integrated to reveal interactions and regulatory networks across different molecular levels, deepening our understanding of plant biological processes. In this review, we highlight recent advances and challenges in plant metabolomics, emphasizing the roles for this technique in improving crop varieties, enhancing nutritional value, and increasing stress resistance. We also explore the scientific foundations of plant metabolomics and its applications in medicine, and ecological conservation.
40060187	<i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 biocontrol against potato common scab involves significant changes in the soil microbiome and metabolome.	Potato common scab (CS) is a worldwide disease, caused by <i>Streptomyces</i> spp., and its presence reduces the market value of potatoes. A nontoxic and potentially effective approach in many control strategies is the use of antagonistic microbes as biocontrol agents. In this study, <i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 was isolated and assessed for its ability to protect against CS. Through integrated metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, changes in the soil microbial community structure and soil properties were analyzed to understand the effects of <i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 on CS. These studies revealed that DX-9 inoculation could significantly decrease CS disease rate, disease index, and the number of CS pathogens, along with an increase in soil N and P content. Our metagenomic assays identified 102 phyla and 1154 genera, and DX-9 inoculation increased the relative abundances of the phyla Pseudomonadota, Chloroflexota and Gemmatimonadota. Additionally, an increase in the relative abundance of genera, such as <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, <i>Agrobacterium</i>, and <i>Nitrobacter</i>, were significantly and positively correlated with soil N and P. Metabolomic analysis revealed that DX-9 inoculation significantly increased the soil levels of phytolaccoside A, 7,8-dihydropteroic acid, novobiocin, and azafrin. These compounds were enriched in microbe pathway metabolites, including xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. In summary, the use of <i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 against potato CS offers an alternative biocontrol method that can improve both soil microbial community and properties. This study provides insight into the potential mechanisms by which microbial inoculants can control CS disease.
40060268	Individual and Interactive Effects of Temperature and Watering Regime on Canola Growth and Physiological Characteristics.	Although many studies have considered the effects of temperature and water on plants, the combined effects of these factors on canola (<i>Brassica napus</i>) growth, physiological traits, and fatty acids require more attention. Canola is an important oilseed crop in Canada and around the world and fatty acids act as regulators of stress signaling. We grew plants under two temperature regimes (22°C/18°C and 28°C/24°C; 16 h light and 8 h dark) and two watering regimes (well-watered and water stressed) in controlled-environment growth chamber for 3 weeks after 1 week of initial growth under 22°C/18°C. We measured growth, biomass, photosynthesis, fatty acids, and other physiological traits of plants. With respect to plant growth and physiological traits, as individual factor, higher temperatures decreased stem diameter, specific leaf mass, leaf water potential, and flavonoids, whereas water stress decreased stem height and diameter, leaf area and number, leaf mass, net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, transpiration, and stomatal conductance, but increased leaf mass ratio (leaf dry mass/plant dry mass). In terms of interaction, higher temperatures increased plant biomass, chlorophyll (Chl) <i>a</i>, carotenoids, and total Chl in the well-watered plants, but decreased all these traits in the water-stressed plants. With respect to fatty acids as individual factor, higher temperatures decreased tricosanoic acid (C23:0), but increased heptadecanoic acid (C17:0). In terms of interaction, higher temperatures decreased <i>cis</i>-10-heptadecenoic acid (C17:1), elaidic acid (C18:1), arachidic acid (C20:0), and <i>cis</i>-11,14-eicosadienoic acid (C20:2) in the water-stressed plants. Lower temperatures also decreased C17:1, C18:1, and C20:2 in the water-stressed plants. Overall, palmitoleic acid (C16:1) was higher in the stem than in the leaf. This study revealed that higher temperatures combined with water stress decreased some physiological traits and fatty acids and, in turn, plant biomass. Further studies are required to determine the effects of multiple climate change components on fatty acids in canola and other oilseed crops.
40060292	Integration of physio-biochemical, biological and molecular approaches to improve heavy metal tolerance in plants.	Heavy metal toxicity hinders plant growth and development by inducing oxidative stress, decreasing biomass, impairing photosynthesis, and potentially leading to plant death. The inherent defense mechanisms employed by plants, including metal sequestration into vacuoles, phytochelation, cell wall metal adsorption and an enhanced antioxidant system can be improved via various approaches to mitigate heavy metal toxicity. This review primarily outlines plants direct and indirect responses to HM stress and the tolerance mechanisms by which plants combat the toxic effects of metals and metalloids to understand the effective management of HMs and metalloids in the soil system. Furthermore, this review highlights measures to mitigate metal and metalloid toxicity and improve metal tolerance through various physio-biochemical, biological, and molecular approaches. This review also provides a comprehensive account of all the mitigative approaches by comparing physio-biochemical, biological and molecular approaches. Finally, we compared all the mitigative approaches used in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous to increase their metal tolerance. Although many studies have compared monocot and dicot plants based on metal toxicity and tolerance effects, comparisons of these mitigative approaches have not been explored.
40060394	Detection of inertial effects in capillary flows in open and closed channels.	The Lucas-Washburn-Rideal law is commonly applied to describe capillary flow dynamics in closed or open channels, microporous media, such as paper pads and fiber threads or even granulous soil. It assumes a viscous flow regime where capillary forces are counteracted by friction with the solid structure, a valid assumption given the small flow velocities and device dimensions. However, scenarios exist outside the viscous regime, where inertial effects become significant, meaning capillary and friction forces do not fully balance. One well-documented case is the transient inertial regime at the onset of capillary motion. With the advancement of capillary devices, other configurations also raise the possibility of inertia influencing flow behavior. This study introduces a criterion to identify inertial contributions in capillary-driven flows in spatially varying geometries within open or closed channels and demonstrates how the Bosanquet equation can account for inertial effects in rectangular open-channel configurations.
40060627	Metagenomic selections reveal diverse antiphage defenses in human and environmental microbiomes.	To prevent phage infection, bacteria have developed an arsenal of antiphage defense systems. Using functional metagenomic selections, we identified new examples of these systems from human fecal, human oral, and grassland soil microbiomes. Our antiphage selections in <i>Escherichia coli</i> revealed over 200 putative defenses from 14 diverse bacterial phyla, highlighting the broad phylogenetic interoperability of these systems. Many defense systems were unrecognizable based on sequence or predicted structure, so could only be identified via functional assays. In mechanistic studies, we show that some defense systems encode nucleases that only degrade covalently modified phage DNA, but which accommodate diverse chemical modifications. We also identify outer membrane proteins that prevent phage adsorption and a set of previously unknown defense systems with diverse antiphage profiles and modalities. Most defenses acted against at least two phages, indicating that broadly acting systems are widely distributed among non-model bacteria.
40060716	The Ecological Restoration Strategies in Terrestrial Ecosystems Were Reviewed: A New Trend Based on Soil Microbiomics.	Soil microorganisms play a pivotal role in the biogeochemical cycle and serve as crucial indicators of ecological restoration in terrestrial ecosystems. The soil microbial community is regarded as a pivotal participant in environmental processes, offering both positive and negative feedback to diverse media within the ecosystem. This community can serve as a potential indicator in ecological monitoring and restoration processes. Consequently, an increasing number of scholars are directing their research towards the field of soil microbial ecology in diverse ecosystems and fragile areas, with the aim of elucidating the intricate interactions between microbes and vegetation. However, the implementation of soil microbiome in ecological restoration remains in the experimental stage due to the interference of extreme events and the complexity of governance measures. Consequently, a comprehensive evaluation of existing research is imperative. This review aims to address the ecological crises currently experienced by diverse terrestrial ecosystems and to provide a comprehensive overview of the specific practices of soil microorganisms in the context of ecological restoration. We also incorporate them into fragile habitats and identify urgent issues that need to be addressed in the ecological restoration process of fragile areas.
40060720	The Effects of Climate Change and Greening of Vegetation on Spatiotemporal Variation of Evapotranspiration in the Haihe River Basin, China.	Highly accurate evapotranspiration (ET) estimation and understanding the impacts of climatic and land use change on ET are essential for water resources management in the Haihe River Basin (HRB). This study estimated spatial and temporal changes of ET and its drivers over the period 2000-2020, using the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model. Validation performed with the observations of 11 eddy covariance sites showed that the PT-JPL model can simulate ET with high accuracy (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.64, RMSE = 1.32 mm/day, NSE = 0.57). During the 21-year study period, the mean annual ET in HRB was 583 mm/year and showed an insignificant increasing trend (0.45 mm/year). Canopy transpiration (ET<sub>c</sub>, 2.96 mm/year) and interception evaporation (ET<sub>i</sub>, 0.74 mm/year) significantly increased whereas soil evaporation (ET<sub>s</sub>, -3.25 mm/year) significantly decreased. The mean annual net radiation (Rn), relative humidity (Rh), and wind speed (Ws) showed insignificant decreasing trends. In contrast, mean annual air temperature (Tm), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and precipitation showed insignificant increasing trends. The significantly increased leaf area index (LAI) demonstrated that vegetation in the HRB is greening. We explored the relationship between ET and its components to climate and vegetation parameters. The results showed that net radiation was the most important parameter for ET variations. Vegetation and temperature had large impacts on ET<sub>c</sub>. Vegetation greening in HRB dominates the increasing trend in ET<sub>c</sub>. Net radiation and relative humidity showed an important role in changes in ET<sub>s</sub>. Temperature and vegetation were key impact parameters for ET<sub>i</sub>. The increase in ET<sub>i</sub> is mainly located in the region of forests, which is due to the forest protection and afforestation projects in HRB. This study highlights the importance of isolating the contributions of vegetation and climate changes to the changes in ET and its components, which is useful for water resources management in HRB and other regions of the world.
40060723	Temporal Variation in Bacterial Community Characteristics Shaped by Habitat in a Reservoir Buffer Strip in China.	Habitat and temporal variation can both influence microbial community dynamics, although their relative importance in reservoir buffer zones with complex hydrology regimes and dramatically altered environments remains controversial. To elucidate this, we investigated spatiotemporal variation in soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes from the flooding period to the dry period (April and June, respectively) using high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing in three habitats (abandoned cropland, grassland, and woodland) within the Chushandian Reservoir's buffer strip, China. The results showed that habitat was more important than temporal variation in shaping soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes in the reservoir buffer zone. Bacterial communities responded to temporal variation both in terms of species composition and function; temporal variation affected bacterial communities mostly by altering the abundance of shared species and by causing the resurgence or extinction of specific taxa within the same habitat. The main driver of these changes was the resilience capacity of habitats to the changing moisture environment. The magnitude and underlying mechanisms of the changes in bacterial community diversity and ecological processes differed markedly between the three habitats, owing mostly to the characteristics of their vegetation, thus the allocation ratios of different habitat vegetation types and landscape diversity should pay attention for the reservoir buffer zone management, improving the integrated ecological benefits of the reservoir ecosystem from a multiscale.
40060822	Pyrolysis Behavior, Kinetic Analysis, and Biochar Production from Waste Flowers.	Waste flowers constitute a significant portion of organic waste, offering the potential for sustainable waste management through pyrolysis. This study explores the pyrolysis behavior, kinetic parameters, and biochar production from waste flowers. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to examine thermal degradation characteristics under varying heating rates (10, 20, and 50 °C min<sup>-1</sup>). Kinetic analysis was performed using model-free methods such as the Friedman method (FM), Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Starink method (STM), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and Criado model to determine the pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Further, the biochar was produced in a semibatch reactor at 450 °C with a 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup> heating rate and 100 mL min<sup>-1</sup> nitrogen flow rate. The characterization of the biochar included proximate and elemental analysis, calorific value, bulk density, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pH, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and water-holding capacity. The decomposition results were confirmed in three stages: moisture removal, active pyrolysis, and residue formation. Kinetic results revealed a multistep reaction mechanism, with average activation energies of 236.35, 232.29, 234.74, and 221.50 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> derived from KAS, OFW, STM, and FM, respectively. Pyrolysis of marigold flowers (MG) yielded 36.64 wt % biochar at 450 and 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup> heating rate. Further, the biochar exhibited a 57.10% carbon content, 33.57 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup> higher heating value (HHV), 9.96 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> BET surface area, and 29.14 mV zeta potential, demonstrating its potential for soil amendment, carbon sequestration, and pollutant adsorption. This study emphasizes the value of MG as a feedstock for biochar production, contributing to circular economy initiatives.
40060856	Highly Selective Pyrene-Anchored Halloysite Nanotube for Fluorometric Determination of 2,4,6-Trinitrophenol in Environmental and Food Samples.	2,4,6-Trinitrophenol (TNP) is explosive, toxic, ecological, and a human health hazard and is resistant to degradation. It can cause symptoms such as headache, loss of appetite, dizziness, fever, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting when inhaled. In this study, we aimed to develop a new halloysite nanotube anchored with pyrene moieties (<b>HNT@Py</b>) for the sensitive determination of TNP in soil, wastewater, and food samples using fully aqueous media. The <b>HNT@Py</b> was characterized structurally, morphologically, and thermally by using FTIR, UV-vis, XRD, TGA, fluorescence, SEM, and TEM analyses. The detection conditions for the assay were investigated and optimized, including competitive species, incubation time, sensor concentration, photostability, and selectivity. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for TNP were found to be 14.00 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> and 42.00 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> in the linear response of 0.04 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.60 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.9962), respectively. Validation of the current method was performed using the spike/recovery test and HPLC analyses, and it was subsequently utilized to successfully detect TNP with fluorescence in soil, food, and water samples. According to the obtained results, the suggested assay is dependent on the "turn-off" emission of <b>HNT@Py</b> with the PET mechanism between electron-deficient NACs and the electron-rich pyrene moieties. The sensor was found to be easy to use, extremely sensitive, and reliable in rapidly identifying TNP in real samples, displaying excellent flexibility and resilience. Additionally, detection membranes with regular morphology were obtained by the electrospinning method using <b>HNT@Py</b> nanostructures dispersed in the PCL matrix, and RGB changes were determined via a smartphone application.

This work reports the determination of mercury and the assessment of health risks in water, river sediments, and soil samples collected in the city of <i>Jacobina</i>, Brazil, located in a region impacted by gold mining. The mercury determinations were performed using the direct method analyzer (DMA) method, which was carefully validated according to the IUPAC recommendations. Total mercury contents ranged from 0.10 to 1.77 μg L<sup>-1</sup> in water samples, from 0.005 to 0.278 μg g<sup>-1</sup> in soil samples, and from 0.014 to 0.317 μg g<sup>-1</sup> in river sediment samples. The contamination factor (CF) and the ecological risk index were applied to the data obtained from soil and sediment analyses. Only one of the twenty-one soil samples had CF > 1 (1.11), denoting moderate contamination for this sampled site. All 20 other samples had CF < 1 (0.02 to 0.69), showing low mercury contamination in the soils collected throughout <i>Jacobina</i>. The results of the ecological risk index perfectly corroborated the results found by the CF, denoting that only one sample had a moderate potential ecological risk. Among the 13 sediment samples, two had CF > 1 and Er in the range of 40 to 80, denoting moderate contamination and moderate ecological risk in these two sampled locations. All 11 other samples had CF < 1 and Er less than 40, demonstrating that the sediments analyzed have low contamination and low potential for ecological risk due to mercury. All mercury levels found in water samples are below the maximum limit (2 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) established by the CONAMA, the Brazilian Government, for class 3 freshwater. The assessment of daily mercury exposure was also performed using the routes of exposure through dermal contact (ADIder), inhalation (ADIinh), ingestion (ADIing) in the soil samples, and dermal contact and ingestion in the water samples employing the health risk indices established by the USEPA. The results obtained did not indicate noncarcinogenic risks for adults and children.
40060881	Removal of Antibiotics from Swine Wastewater Using an Environmentally Friendly Biochar: Performance and Mechanisms.	Antibiotics used in the swine industry to treat diseases and improve animal growth are poorly absorbed by swine and have been classified as micropollutants due to their occurrence in surface water, wastewater, and soil. This study investigated the capacity of biochar produced from eastern red cedar to remove target antibiotics that have been extensively used in the swine industry. Biochar was produced by pyrolysis from eastern red cedar at 450 °C. The sorption tests were performed by mixing biochar and a solution (1:10 ratio) containing each antibiotic in 100, 300, 600, and 900 μg L<sup>-1</sup> concentrations. The results indicate that red cedar biochar was able to effectively remove up to 99.93% tetracycline, 96.23% oxytetracycline, 98.28% chlortetracycline, 76.4% sulfadiazine, and 78.6% sulfamethazine at the lowest concentrations. The removal efficiencies at higher concentrations declined up to 83.52, 47.23, 64.16, 69.8, and 58.4% for tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethazine, respectively. The biochar exhibited stronger adsorption capacity for chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine compared to the other antibiotics. The likely adsorption mechanisms driving the removal of tetracyclines and sulfonamides are hydrogen-bonding and π-π electron-donor-acceptor, supported by FTIR analyses of the biochar itself. Overall, the results highlighted the potential utilization of eastern red cedar biochar for practical applications, mitigating antibiotic residues from swine wastewater in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner due to its relatively low pyrolysis temperature (450 °C) and sustainable repurposing of an invasive tree species.
40061030	Effects of nitrogen fertilizer on protein accumulation in basal-middle and apical kernels of different low nitrogen tolerant maize hybrids.	Selecting low-nitrogen(N)-tolerant maize hybrids represent an effective approach to enhancing nitrogen use efficiency grain yield. However, the impact of nitrogen fertilization on protein accumulation in low-N-tolerant hybrids remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, a two-year field orientation trial was conducted at four nitrogen fertilizer rate with the different low-N-tolerant maize hybrids. The effect of nitrogen fertilization on the accumulation of protein and its fractions different kernels positions of different low-N-tolerant maize hybrids was studied. The results showed that the protein yield of ZH311 maize kernels was significantly higher than that of XY508, especially under low-N conditions (0N and 150N), and was 25.7%-36.2% higher than that of XY508. There was a significant correlation between protein yield and the accumulation of crude protein and protein fractions. Compared with XY508, the crude protein of ZH311 entered the rapid growth stage later and lasted for a relatively shorter period, but it was 50.8%-53.0% higher due to its higher accumulation rates (v<sub>2</sub> and v<sub>3</sub>) in its middle and late stages, especially in the apical grains. Under low-N conditions, the difference in crude protein accumulation between the apical and basal-middle kernels of ZH311 was only 4.3-8.2%, whereas the difference in XY508 was 29.9-37.3%, suggesting that low-N-tolerant maize hybrids improve protein yield by increasing the accumulation of proteins and their fractions in the apical kernels. Nitrogen fertilization had a greater effect on protein accumulation and yield in XY508, especially on the top kernel and protein yield. In the future, more attention should be paid to the effect of apical kernels when breeding high-quality maize hybrids tolerant to low nitrogen.

40061033	Soil properties and rhizosphere interactions affecting nitrous oxide emissions with mitigation by nitrification inhibitors in rice growth stages.	Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions from paddy soils, particularly from the rice rhizosphere, significantly contribute to agricultural greenhouse gas outputs. This study explores N<sub>2</sub>O emission dynamics in rhizosphere (R) and non-rhizosphere (NR) soils from two distinct paddy types (JR and YC) during the primary rice growth stages (tillering, jointing, heading, and grain-filling). Cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were measured at 688.56, 762.90, 831.20, and 1072.32 µg N kg<sup>-1</sup> for JR-NR, JR-R, YC-NR, and YC-R, respectively. Notably, JR-R and YC-R exhibited increases in cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by up to 20.04% and 28.23%, respectively, compared to their NR counterparts at different growth stages. These enhanced emissions were primarily associated with microbial genera <i>Nitrosospira</i> and <i>Nitrosospirae</i>, and influenced by factors such as electrical conductivity (EC) and available potassium (AK). The soil organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C/N) was a key determinant influencing <i>Nitrosospira</i> abundance. Additionally, nitrification inhibitors (NIs) demonstrated a substantial reduction in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, with a decrease of 92.37% in JR-R and 91.93% in YC-R at selected growth stages, showing more pronounced effects compared to NR soils. These findings highlight the efficacy of NIs in significantly mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, particularly in rhizosphere soils. Variations in the efficiency of NIs across different soil types and growth stages suggest that optimizing application timing and developing tailored soil-specific strategies could further enhance the effectiveness of NIs in mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from paddy fields. This research provides essential insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies to reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in rice cultivation and contributes to sustainable agricultural practices.
40061036	Corrigendum: Saturation mapping of a major effect QTL for stripe rust resistance on wheat chromosome 2B in cultivar Napo 63 using SNP genotyping arrays.	[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fpls.2017.00653.].
40061124	Rapid development of naked malting barley germplasm through targeted mutagenesis.	Covered barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) has historically been preferred for malting, as the husk in this plant protects the embryo during harvest and acts as a filter during brewing. Naked barley, which is typically used as food, has the potential to be used in brewing due to recent technical advances, but the grains contain higher levels of β-glucan and polyphenols, which are undesirable in brewing. Introducing the naked trait into brewing cultivars through crossing is time-consuming due to the need to eliminate these undesirable traits. In this study, we rapidly developed naked barley that is potentially suitable for malting by introducing targeted mutations into <i>Nudum</i> (<i>NUD</i>) using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis. The doubled haploid line 'DH120366', which was used as the parental line, was derived from a cross between two covered malting barley cultivars. We generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenized barley harboring mutations in <i>NUD</i> via <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated transformation and confirmed the presence of mosaic mutations in one individual from among 16 T<sub>0</sub> transformants. We sowed T<sub>1</sub> grains exhibiting the naked trait and sequenced the <i>NUD</i> gene in these T<sub>1</sub> seedlings, identifying two types of mutations. Shotgun high-throughput whole-genome sequencing confirmed the absence of the transgene in at least one <i>nud</i> mutant line following <i>k</i>-mer-based analysis. Cultivation in a closed growth chamber revealed no significant differences in agronomic traits between the <i>nud</i> mutants and the wild type. This study demonstrates the feasibility of rapidly developing naked barley with potential use for malting and brewing by targeting only <i>NUD</i> via targeted mutagenesis.

A new genus, <i>Trematirunella</i> <b>gen. nov.</b> (Mesostigmata: Uropodina: Trematuridae), with <i>Trematirunellaseychellia</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> as its type species, is described, based on a female, males, and deutonymphs collected in soil samples from the Seychelle Islands. The new genus belongs to the family Trematuridae based on the shape of the corniculi, gnathosomal setae, tritosternum and chelicerae. Members of the new genus bear a preanal suture on the ventral shield, two pairs or more pairs of wide, robust and sword-like setae on the caudal part of the dorsal shield, very dense setation on the caudal area of the marginal shield and an incision on the anterior part of the dorsal shield. These characters are missing in the other genera of Trematuridae. Two previously described species (<i>Trichouropodalagunae</i> Hirmatsu & Hirschmann, 1988 and <i>Trichouropodapalawanensis</i> Hirschmann & Hirmatsu, 1990) from the Philippines are transferred to the new genus, as <i>Trematirunellalagunae</i> (Hirmatsu & Hirschmann, 1988), <b>comb. nov.</b> and <i>Trematirunellapalawanensis</i> (Hirschmann & Hirmatsu, 1990), <b>comb. nov.</b> The new species differs from its congeners in the sculptural pattern of the female genital shield and in the shape of the robust and sword-like setae on the caudal area of the dorsal shield.
40061654	Principles and Therapeutics of <i>Yajna</i>.	Health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing, not merely the absence of diseases or infirmity. <i>Yajna</i> means selfless sacrifices performed along with sacred sounds, the mantras. The procedure includes offering selected herbal and sacred materials to the fire to obtain an array of benefits such as air purification and release of therapeutic compounds (antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antidepression, and anticonvulsant) in the form of aerosol that enriches the atmosphere and soil. Microbial intrusions into the human system such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have proved their ability to hack the elements such as air, water, and earth to coerce humans' physical and mental status. Panic during COVID (coronavirus disease) pandemic did not decline despite advanced therapeutic approaches. Vaccinating the human and animals of the entire globe within a specific time may not be a practically viable approach; adopting an alternative strategy that holistically represses the viral outbreak at various levels will support the medical and government authorities. Pandemic-combatted ancestors developed traditional remedies with secret medicinal portions prescribed to perform as rituals. One of those rituals is <i>Yajna</i>. <i>Yajna</i> procedure controls microbial load at both the environmental and zoonotic levels. The purpose of this literature review is to examine the advantages of scientifically establishing a correlation between <i>Yajna</i> and its potential contribution to prevent pandemics like COVID. An online search explored the phytotherapeutics of <i>Yajna</i> and correlated with the noninvasive drug delivery.
40061801	Advancements and strategies of genetic improvement in cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz): from conventional to genomic approaches.	Cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz) is a staple food of 800 million people in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Its industrial utilization for bioethanol, animal feed, and starch are still continuously expanding. It was not until the 1970s that significant scientific efforts were undertaken to improve cassava, despite its considerable economic and social significance. Shortening the breeding cycle and improving the breeding efficiency are always the focus of the cassava breeding study. In this review, we provide a global perspective on the current status of cassava germplasm resources and explore the diverse applications of cassava breeding methods from hybridization, polyploidy, and inbreeding to genomic selection and gene editing. Additionally, we overview at least six nearly complete cassava genome sequences established based on modern genomic techniques. These achievements have substantially supported the advancing of gene discovery and breeding of new cassava varieties. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the advancements in cassava's functional genomics, concentrating on important traits such as starch quality and content, dry matter content, tolerance to postharvest physiological deterioration, nutritional quality, and stress resistance. We also provide a comprehensive summary of the milestone events and key advancements in cassava genetic improvement over the past 50 years. Finally, we put forward the perspective of developing genomic selection breeding model and super-hybrids of cassava through building inbreeding population and emphasize the generation of triploid cassavas, as well as using gene editing technology allowing cassava to be a tropical model plant to serve for basic biological research and molecular breeding.
40061802	Integrative analysis of genome-wide association studies of polyphenols in apple fruits identifies the MdDof2.4<i>-MdPAT10</i> module that promotes procyanidin accumulation.	Polyphenols represent a significant class of nutrients in apples, contributing to human health and well-being. Among these, procyanidins stand out as the most prevalent polyphenolic compounds in apple fruits. These compounds are abundant in wild apples and generally low in modern apple cultivars. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and recover genetically lost genes that regulate polyphenol accumulation in order to improve the apple quality. To achieve this, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 15 traits related to polyphenol content, utilizing 134 <i>Malus</i> accessions. We identified 1204 marker-trait associations (MTAs) and 840 candidate genes, including known polyphenol biosynthetic and regulatory genes, such as <i>MYB7</i>, <i>TT4</i>, and <i>HCT/HQT</i>. Notably, we pinpointed a protein <i>S</i>-acyl transferase 10 (PAT10), which is significantly associated with procyanidin content. Through experiments with transgenic calli, we determined that apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) MdPAT10 positively regulated procyanidin accumulation. Furthermore, we identified a 51-bp insertion variant (In-868) on the promoter of the <i>PAT10</i>, which influences its expression. Both a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that MdDof2.4 was able to bind to the promoter of <i>MdPAT10</i> containing In-868 (<i>MdPAT10<sub>pro</sub> <sup>In-868</sup></i> ), but not to the promoter of <i>MdPAT10</i> without In-868 (<i>MdPAT10<sub>pro</sub></i> ). Moreover, MdDof2.4 promoted <i>MdPAT10</i> (with <i>MdPAT10<sub>pro</sub> <sup>In-868</sup></i> ) expression and increased procyanidin accumulation in fruits. Overall, our results enhance the understanding of the biosynthetic regulation of apple polyphenols and provide a theoretical foundation and genetic resources for breeding apple varieties with optimal polyphenol content.
40061810	Comprehensive strategies for paclitaxel production: insights from plant cell culture, endophytic microorganisms, and synthetic biology.	<i>Taxus</i> L<i>.</i>, an important ornamental, economic, and medicinal plant, is renowned for producing paclitaxel (Taxol®), a potent chemotherapeutic agent. The biosynthesis of paclitaxel involves intricate biosynthetic pathways, spanning multiple enzymatic steps. Despite advances, challenges remain in optimizing production methods. Microorganisms, particularly endophytic fungi, show potential in producing paclitaxel, though with limitations in yield and stability. The suspension culture of Taxus cells is a promising alternative, offering sustainable production, yet it requires further genetic and environmental optimization. Recent advancements in synthetic biology have enabled partial reconstitution of paclitaxel pathways in microbial and plant chassis. However, achieving complete biosynthesis remains an ongoing challenge. This review consolidates recent progress in paclitaxel biosynthesis, highlighting current limitations and future prospects for industrial-scale production.
40061812	Telomere-to-telomere, gap-free genome of mung bean (<i>Vigna radiata</i>) provides insights into domestication under structural variation.	Mung bean (<i>Vigna radiata</i>), an essential annual legume, holds substantial value in global agriculture due to its short growth cycle, low input requirements, and nutritional benefits. Despite extensive domestication, the genetic mechanisms underlying its morphological and physiological evolution remain incompletely understood. In this study, we present a gap-free, telomere-to-telomere genome assembly of the mung bean cultivar 'Weilv-9', achieved through the integration of PacBio HiFi, Oxford Nanopore, and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) sequencing technologies. The 500-Mb assembly, encompassing 11 chromosomes and containing 28 740 protein-coding genes, reveals that 49.17% of the genome comprises repetitive sequences. Within the genome, we found the recent amplification of transposable elements significantly impacts the expression of nearby genes. Furthermore, integrating structural variation and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from resequencing, we identified that the fatty acid synthesis, suberin biosynthetic, and phenylpropanoid metabolic processes have undergone strong selection during domestication. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms driving domestication and offer a foundation for future genetic enhancement and breeding programs in mung beans and related species.
40061816	Crop Wild Relatives (CWRs) in the United Arab Emirates: Resources for Climate Resilience and Their Potential Medicinal Applications.	Global climate change threatens the production, growth, and sustainability of plants. Crop wild relatives (CWRs) offer a practical and sustainable solution to these climatic issues by boosting genetic diversity and crop resilience. Even though CWRs are wild relatives of domesticated plants, they are nevertheless mostly neglected. This review focuses on the possible application of CWRs, which are found in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and are known for their abiotic stress tolerance and potential medicinal properties. In olden days, traditionally, CWRs has been used as medicine for various ailments as they are rich in phytochemical compounds. However, the medicinal potential of these wild plant species is decreasing at an alarming rate due to climate change stress factors. The medicinal potential of these native crop wild plant species must be investigated because they could be a useful asset in the healthcare sector. Research on pangenomics studies of certain CWRs is also highlighted in the review, which reveals genetic variability caused due to climate change stress factors and how these genetic variability changes affect the production of secondary metabolites that have potent medicinal value. This provides insights into developing personalized medicine, in which particular CWRs plant species can be chosen or modified to generate medicinal compounds. Despite their superior medicinal properties, many CWRs in the UAE are still not well understood. Finding the desired genes coding for the biosynthesis of specific phytochemicals or secondary metabolites may help us better understand how these substances are synthesized and how to increase their production for a range of treatments.

40061920	Nanoparticles for treatment of cadmium-contaminated cocoa-growing soils and beans: Performance on metal immobilization and removal.	Some areas of tropical soils where cocoa grows contain high cadmium (Cd) concentrations. The cocoa plant's need for nutrition causes the reticular system to uptake the toxic metal, translocate it, and accumulate it in roots, stems, and other edible parts such as cocoa beans and shells, threatening the health of cocoa consumers. To cope with this difficulty, different treatments have been applied to cadmium-contaminated soils, but they showed limited success. In this study, we prepared multicomponent nanoparticles (MCNPs) to treat cocoa soils in fixed-bed columns and field tests. Also, MCNPs were mixed with two varieties of cocoa beans, CNN51 and Fino de Aromain, during the fermentation, aiming to capture the cadmium. Our field investigations began by collecting soil samples from three Ecuadorian cocoa-producing farms to determine their physicochemical properties, cadmium, and iron contents. A few weeks later, a home-built prototype was installed in a cocoa plantation to fabricate the nanomaterials using commercial-grade chemicals and rainwater. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images showed MCNPs with an average size of 65.21 nm and the formation of chain-like aggregates. In contrast, MCNPs size was 76.6 nm, measured with Dispersed Light Scattering (DLS). The chemical composition of MCNPs was 90.7 % Fe0 and 1.81 % sulfur (S), analyzed by energy dispersal X-ray (EDX) and confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer measurements. Regarding the treatments, for the fixed-bed column tests, 0.28-1.08 L/kg was dosed into the soil, while for field treatments, 250, 500, and 835 mL/min MCNPs were injected in soil areas of 5 m<sup>2</sup> surrounding each cocoa tree (0.5-4.5 mg MCNPs/kg soil) at depths between 0 and 5 cm. Test results revealed that the procedure applied in the field did not reproduce the metal's immobilization (∼22 %) as in the fixed-bed columns (∼80 %). Moreover, cadmium removal was ∼20 % and ∼75 % after treating CCN51 and Fino de Aroma cocoa beans with 0.112 kg MCNPs/kg in the fermentation on-site and 0.034 kg MCNPs/kg in the laboratory. In this study, the size and chain-like aggregates of MCNPs notably influenced the field treatments as they precluded the filtration of MCNPs downwards. However, immobilizing cadmium could be more effective in soils with higher concentrations of the metal and multicomponent nanoparticles of smaller size, expanding our research scope and offering a practical solution to pollution issues in cocoa-growing regions.
40062238	The technique of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) based on the triangular q-rung fuzzy numbers (TR-q-ROFNS) with applications in best African coffee brand selection.	The African coffee market offers a rich and diverse range of coffee profiles. The coffee producers of Africa face numerous challenges like climate change, market fluctuations, diseases, soil degradation and limited access to finance. These challenges badly affect their productivity, quality and livelihood. There are different factors like social and cultural, which can affect the coffee production. This study aims to develop multi criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and their applications in coffee market specifically in identifying factors influencing consumers' coffee brand preferences in South Africa, which is known for its vibrant coffee culture. For this purpose, first we developed the technique of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in the environment of triangular q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers. The triangular q-rung fuzzy numbers can effectively handle the uncertainity. The AHP technique has widely been used in decision making due to its flexibility in assigning weights and dealing with vagueness. The weights of critera plays a very important role in an MCDM problem. The development of AHP technique in triangular q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment can improve the decision making (DM) by handling vagueness in data and by using the most appropriate weights. Furthermore this new proposed method improves accuracy and minimize the information loss. The newly peoposed method is applied to different MCDM problems and comparative analysis is conducted to check the validity of results.
40062284	Improving the accuracy of soil texture determination using pH and electro conductivity values with ultrasound penetration-based digital soil texture analyzer.	Soil texture analysis is critical for advancing agricultural productivity, ensuring environmental sustainability, and maintaining ecosystem balance. Traditional sedimentation-based methods, such as the hydrometer technique, are fast and practical but prone to inaccuracies due to the effects of water-soluble substances. This study focuses on the practical framework of integrating pH (potential of hydrogen) and EC (electrical conductivity), as indicators of dissolved substances that influence soil texture estimation. Using the Ultrasound Penetration-based Digital Soil Texture Analyzer (USTA), this research combined ultrasound time series data with pH and EC measurements to predict sand, silt, and clay ratios through machine learning methods-support vector regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). Simulations showed that RF yielded the best results, improving R<sup>2</sup> values to 0.52, 0.33, and 0.31 for sand, silt, and clay, respectively. The enhanced model performance demonstrates the viability of integrating pH and EC with advanced machine learning techniques to improve soil texture analysis accuracy. These findings suggest that automated systems like USTA, with modular pH and EC sensors, can provide cost-effective, efficient alternatives to traditional methods, offering practical implications for soil management and agricultural optimization.
40062339	Faecal sludge pyrolysis as a circular economic approach to waste management and nutrient recovery.	The disposal of faecal sludge from non-networked sanitation amenities leads to contamination of the surrounding environment and increasing public health problems across developing countries. Permanent solutions to deal with faecal sludge are required to solve the sanitation crisis and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030. Full-scale pyrolysis of faecal sludge in developing countries is fast becoming a safe and long-term option. Pyrolysis not only eliminates pathogens within the sludge but produces biochar as an end product which has the potential as a soil amendment to increase crop yield. In general, faecal sludge biochars have high pH values, high ash contents, and high macro-and micronutrient concentrations. Compared to biochar from lignocellulosic materials, faecal sludge biochar contains less carbon and exhibits lower porosities, and lower surface areas. However, evaluating the properties of faecal sludge biochar is difficult due to the different technologies used in collection, storage, and transportation of the feedstock. Differences in faecal sludge characteristics based on location, climate, age of the sludge, type of sanitation technology and seasonality are also factors in determining the properties of faecal sludge biochars. These factors contribute to the difficulty in describing faecal sludge biochar properties in general terms, and there is an argument to be made that characteristics of large-scale faecal sludge biochar should be determined on a case-by-case basis. The conclusion of this review is that future research should concentrate on short-term and long-term field studies of faecal sludge biochar application to different soil types.
40062368	Building Climate-Resilient Crops: Genetic, Environmental, and Technological Strategies for Heat and Drought Stress Tolerance.	Global crop production faces increasing threats from the rise in frequency, duration, and intensity of drought and heat stress events due to climate change. Most staple food crops, including wheat, rice, soybean, and corn that provide over half of the world's caloric intake, are not well-adapted to withstand heat or drought. Efforts to breed or engineer stress-tolerant crops have had limited success due to the complexity of tolerance mechanisms and the variability of agricultural environments. Effective solutions require a shift towards fundamental research that incorporates realistic agricultural settings and focuses on practical outcomes for farmers. This review explores the genetic and environmental factors affecting heat and drought tolerance in major crops, examines the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying these stress responses, and evaluates the limitations of current breeding programs and models. It also discusses emerging technologies and approaches that could enhance crop resilience, such as synthetic biology, advanced breeding techniques, and high-throughput phenotyping. Finally, this review emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary research and collaboration with stakeholders to translate fundamental research into practical agricultural solutions.
40062396	Interaction Between Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus-GAV Movement Protein and VOZ Proteins Delays Flowering of Plant.	Dwarfing and yellowing are characteristic symptoms caused by viral infections and are considered significant contributors for reduced crop yield. In this study, we identified that infection by barley yellow dwarf virus-GAV (BYDV-GAV) leads to a delay in the flowering process, potentially diminishing grain yield in wheat. The BYDV-GAV movement protein (MP) interacts with vascular plant one-zinc finger proteins (VOZs), which play a crucial role in promoting wheat flowering. Expression of MP inhibits floral transition in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Furthermore, BYDV-GAV MP facilitates the degradation of VOZ transcription factors via the 26S proteasome pathway, independently of phytochrome B (PhyB). Domain B in VOZ is essential for the interaction between VOZ and MP. Our results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-induced symptoms.
40062422	<i>Rhodotorula tropicalis</i> sp. nov., a novel red yeast of the order Sporidiobolales isolated from Thailand, Indonesia and Japan.	Six yeast strains, representing a novel anamorphic species of the genus <i>Rhodotorula</i>, were investigated in this study. Among them, three strains, SU21, SU16 and SU14, were obtained from three different fruiting bodies of wild mushrooms in Thailand. One strain (ISM36-1) was isolated from soil in Japan, and two strains were isolated from soil (14Y315) and leaf litter (Y15Kr055) collected in Indonesia. Analysis of the sequences of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions showed that the six strains were identical or differed by only one nt substitution in both the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene and the ITS regions. <i>Rhodotorula paludigena</i> CBS 6566<sup>T</sup> was the most closely related species but with 23-24 nt substitutions in the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene and 38-39 nt substitutions in the ITS regions. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated sequences of the ITS regions and D1/D2 domain showed that these strains represent a single species of the <i>Rhodotorula</i> clade that is distinct from other recognized species of the genus. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characteristics, these six strains were assigned to a novel species of the genus <i>Rhodotorula</i>, although sexual reproduction was not observed. The name, <i>Rhodotorula tropicalis</i> sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate the six strains. The holotype is TBRC 14874<sup>T</sup> and the ex-type culture is PYCC 8913 (=SU21). The MycoBank number of the novel species is MB 856795.
40062550	The Response of Carbon Uptake to Soil Moisture Stress: Adaptation to Climatic Aridity.	The coupling between carbon uptake and water loss through stomata implies that gross primary production (GPP) can be limited by soil water availability through reduced leaf area and/or stomatal conductance. Ecosystem and land-surface models commonly assume that GPP is highest under well-watered conditions and apply a stress function to reduce GPP as soil moisture declines. Optimality considerations, however, suggest that the stress function should depend on climatic aridity: ecosystems adapted to more arid climates should use water more conservatively when soil moisture is high, but maintain unchanged GPP down to a lower critical soil-moisture threshold. We use eddy-covariance flux data to test this hypothesis. We investigate how the light-use efficiency (LUE) of GPP depends on soil moisture across ecosystems representing a wide range of climatic aridity. 'Well-watered' GPP is estimated using the sub-daily P model, a first-principles LUE model driven by atmospheric data and remotely sensed vegetation cover. Breakpoint regression is used to relate daily β(θ) (the ratio of flux data-derived GPP to modelled well-watered GPP) to soil moisture estimated via a generic water balance model. The resulting piecewise function describing β(θ) varies with aridity, as hypothesised. Unstressed LUE, even when soil moisture is high, declines with increasing aridity index (AI). So does the critical soil-moisture threshold. Moreover, for any AI value, there exists a soil moisture level at which β(θ) is maximised. This level declines as AI increases. This behaviour is captured by universal non-linear functions relating both unstressed LUE and the critical soil-moisture threshold to AI. Applying these aridity-based functions to predict the site-level response of LUE to soil moisture substantially improves GPP simulation under both water-stressed and unstressed conditions, suggesting a route towards a robust, universal model representation of the effects of low soil moisture on leaf-level photosynthesis.
40062709	Enhancing Bacterial Phenotype Classification Through the Integration of Autogating and Automated Machine Learning in Flow Cytometric Analysis.	Although flow cytometry produces reliable results, the data processing from gating to fingerprinting is prone to subjective bias. Here, we integrated autogating with Automated Machine Learning in flow cytometry to enhance the classification of bacterial phenotypes. We analyzed six bacterial strains prevalent in the soil and groundwater-Bacillus subtilis, Burkholderia thailandensis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas stutzeri. Using the H2O-AutoML framework, we applied gradient-boosting machine (GBM) models to classify bacteria across different metabolic phases. Our results demonstrated an overall classification accuracy of 82.34% for GBM. Notably, accuracy varied across metabolic phases, with the highest observed during the late log (88.06%), lag (88.43%), and early log phases (89.37%), whereas the stationary phase showed a slightly lower accuracy of 80.73%. P. stutzeri exhibited consistently high sensitivity and specificity across all the phases, which indicated that it was the most distinctly identifiable strain. In contrast, E. coli showed low sensitivity, particularly in the stationary phase, which indicated challenges in its classification. Overall, this study with incorporating autogating and the AutoML framework, substantially reduces subjective biases and enhances the reproducibility and accuracy of microbial classification. Our methodology offers a robust framework for microbial classification in flow cytometric analysis, paving the way for more precise and comprehensive analyses of microbial ecology.
40062713	Wheat MAPK cascade mediates SGT1 nuclear entry targeted by a stripe rust effector.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a fundamental role in plant immunity by transducing external signals inside plant cells. Here, we defined a wheat MAPK cascade, composed of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) TaMKK2 and its downstream MAPK TaMAPK6, which phosphorylates the core immune regulator TaSGT1 (suppressor of G2 allele of Skp1), resulting in enhanced nuclear entry of TaSGT1, thereby conferring resistance against the devastating wheat pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Hence, we identified a TaMKK2-TaMAPK6-TaSGT1 signaling cascade that contributes to wheat stripe rust resistance. During infection, Pst secrets a haustorium-associated secreted protein 215 (HASP215), that targets TaMKK2 and interferes with the interaction of TaMKK2 with TaMAPK6 to suppress TaMAPK6 phosphorylation and activation, thereby leading to reduced capacity of TaMAPK6 to phosphorylate TaSGT1. Consequently, inhibition of TaMAPK6-mediated TaSGT1 phosphorylation resulted in decreased nuclear translocation of TaSGT1 and suppressed plant immunity. Our work elucidates the positive function of TaMKK2-TaMAPK6 cascade in wheat immunity by regulating the immune component TaSGT1, and its regulation by the rust effector HASP215, providing new insights into the MAPK cascade on crop immunity and the pathogenicity mechanism of obligate biotrophic fungus.
40062824	VqERF1B-VqERF062-VqNSTS2 transcriptional cascade enhances stilbene biosynthesis and resistance to powdery mildew in grapevine.	Grapes, as one of the world's oldest economic crops, are severely affected by grape powdery mildew, causing significant economic losses. As a phytoalexin against powdery mildew, stilbenes and their key synthetic gene, stilbene synthase (STS), are highly sought after by researchers. In our previous research, a new gene, VqNSTS2, was identified from Vitis quinquangularis accession 'Danfeng-2' through transcriptomic analysis. However, the function and molecular mechanism of VqNSTS2 gene remain unknown. Here, by characterization and transient overexpression of VqNSTS2, we demonstrated that its expression product, stilbenes, can be detected in the model plant tobacco, which does not inherently contain STSs. After artificially inoculating transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing VqNSTS2 with Erysiphe necator, it was found that VqNSTS2 actively moved to the pathogen's haustorium after responding to the pathogen, recognized and enveloped the haustorium, blocking the pathogen's infection and invasion and exhibited disease resistance. Furthermore, Agrobacterium-mediated stable overexpression of VqNSTS2 promoted stilbene accumulation and enhanced resistance of the V. vinifera susceptible cultivar 'Thompson Seedless' to E. necator. Additionally, through screening and identification, a transcription factor, VqERF062, was found to directly bind to the DRE and RAA motifs on ProVqNSTS2, positively regulating VqNSTS2 expression. Moreover, VqERF062 directly interacted with VqERF1B to promote the transcription of VqNSTS2 in addition to forming a homodimer with itself. Taken together, our findings reveal that the VqERF1B-VqERF062- module is required for grape resistance to E. necator and providing insights into the regulatory mechanism of stilbenes biosynthesis.
40062894	A <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> strain with a substantially smaller genome retains the core metabolic versatility of its genus.	<i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> are a group of phototrophic microbes with a marked metabolic versatility and flexibility that underpins their potential use in the production of value-added products, bioremediation, and plant growth promotion. Members of this group have an average genome size of about 5.5 Mb, but two closely related strains have genome sizes of about 4.0 Mb. To identify the types of genes missing in a reduced genome strain, we compared strain DSM127 with other <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> isolates at the genomic and phenotypic levels. We found that DSM127 can grow as well as other members of the <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> genus and retains most of their metabolic versatility, but it has many fewer genes associated with high-affinity transport of nutrients, iron uptake, nitrogen metabolism, and biodegradation of aromatic compounds. This analysis indicates genes that can be deleted in genome reduction campaigns and suggests that DSM127 could be a favorable choice for biotechnology applications using <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> or as a strain that can be engineered further to reside in a specialized natural environment.IMPORTANCE<i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> are a cohort of phototrophic bacteria with broad metabolic versatility. Members of this group are present in diverse soil and water environments, and some strains are found associated with plants and have plant growth-promoting activity. Motivated by the idea that it may be possible to design bacteria with reduced genomes that can survive well only in a specific environment or that may be more metabolically efficient, we compared <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> strains with typical genome sizes of about 5.5 Mb to a strain with a reduced genome size of 4.0 Mb. From this, we concluded that metabolic versatility is part of the identity of the <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> group, but high-affinity transport genes and genes of apparent redundant function can be dispensed with.
40062895	No-tillage systems promote bacterial photosynthetic gene expression in low carbon, semi-arid surface soils.	Managing soils in semi-arid agricultural croplands generally focuses on reducing wind erosion, increasing fertility, and storing carbon. Thus, converting conventionally tilled systems to no-tillage and cover-cropped systems are often the first steps towards a conservation management approach across the growing area of semi-arid croplands. From a soil biological perspective, introducing cover crops to semi-arid soils has been shown to alter microbial community structure, which may lead to changes in the biogeochemical pathways expressed in these soils. In this study, we examined the impact of single-species wheat cover cropping and no-tillage on microbial gene expression after 4 and 5 years of implementation. We sequenced the metatranscriptomes of three production systems with varying levels of conservation management: conventional tillage winter fallow, no-tillage winter fallow, and no-tillage with a winter wheat cover crop. Removing tillage was the biggest factor altering microbial gene expression in this study, specifically resulting in upregulation of several photosystem-associated functions. These functions were taxonomically linked to organisms that make up the early stages of biological soil crusts, which may introduce additional benefits to these semi-arid agricultural systems beyond a reduction in wind erosion. Implementing a cover crop did not clearly alter gene expression beyond the effect of tillage removal; however, it did indicate a potential to reduce fungal disease incidence in 1 year of the study. These alterations of microbial activities and selection for potentially beneficial functions should be considered and further studied to aid in maintaining sustainable croplands for our changing climate.IMPORTANCEEliminating tillage from semi-arid agricultural soils has the potential to significantly alter the activities of the soil bacterial community compared with conventionally tilled soils. A major driver of this change was the activities of biological soil crust forming organisms that can provide several environmental benefits to the soil ecosystem beyond the typically associated benefits of conservation management. Furthermore, this study revealed that the implementation of a cover crop regime on no-tillage soils does not confer a major change in the function of the organisms present. Overall, the study reported here reveals that soil management practices aimed at reducing wind erosion and improving sustainability will positively impact the function of the microbial community and suggests that future investigations into the consequences of these functional changes may provide valuable services to these agricultural ecosystems.
40062896	Evaluating the survival and removal of <i>Escherichia coli</i> from surfaces made with traditional and sustainable cement-based materials in field-relevant conditions.	Soil household floors are common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and can serve as reservoirs of enteric pathogens. Cement-based floors may interrupt pathogen transmission, but little is known about pathogen survival or removal from cement-based surfaces. This study investigated the survival of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, an indicator of fecal contamination, on cement-based surfaces and evaluated its reduction through common household activities (mopping, sweeping, and walking). We compared <i>E. coli</i> fate on three mixes: (i) ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete (used in the United States), (ii) OPC mortar (used in Bangladesh), and (iii) OPC mortar with fly ash (a sustainable alternative to the Bangladesh mix). Additionally, we compared outcomes on cement-based surfaces with and without soil and at two temperatures representing the dry and wet seasons in Bangladesh. After 4 hours on the cement-based surfaces, <i>E. coli</i> decayed more than 1.1 log<sub>10</sub>(<i>C</i>/<i>C<sub>o</sub></i>) under all conditions tested, which is significantly faster than in bulk soils. The higher temperature increased the decay rate constant (<i>P</i> = 5.56 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) while soil presence decreased it (<i>P</i> = 2.80 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Sweeping and mopping resulted in high levels of removal for all mixes, with a mean removal of 71% and 78%, respectively, versus 22% for walking. The concrete and mortar mix designs did not impact <i>E. coli</i> survival or removal (<i>P</i> > 0.20). Cement-based floors made with a fly ash mix performed similarly to traditional cement-based floors, supporting their potential use as a more sustainable intervention to reduce fecal contamination in rural LMIC household settings.
40062942	A Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Markers and Candidate Genes Affecting Tolerance to the Wheat Pathogen <i>Zymoseptoria tritici</i>.	Plants defend themselves against pathogens using either resistance, measured as the host's ability to limit pathogen multiplication, or tolerance, measured as the host's ability to reduce the negative effects of infection. Tolerance is a promising trait for crop breeding, but its genetic basis has rarely been studied and remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal the genetic basis of leaf tolerance to the fungal pathogen <i>Zymoseptoria tritici</i> that causes the globally important septoria tritici blotch disease on wheat. Leaf tolerance to <i>Z. tritici</i> is a quantitative trait that was recently discovered in wheat by using automated image analyses that quantified the symptomatic leaf area and counted the number of pycnidia found on the same leaf. A genome-wide association study identified four chromosome intervals associated with tolerance and a separate chromosome interval associated with resistance. Within these intervals, we identified candidate genes, including wall-associated kinases similar to <i>Stb6</i>, the first cloned STB resistance gene. Our analysis revealed a strong negative genetic correlation between tolerance and resistance to STB, indicative of a trade-off. A trade-off between tolerance and resistance would hinder breeding simultaneously for both traits, but our findings suggest a way forward using marker-assisted breeding. We expect that the methods described here can be used to characterize tolerance to other fungal diseases that produce visible fruiting bodies, such as speckled leaf blotch on barley, potentially unveiling conserved tolerance mechanisms shared among plant species.
40063098	Towards quality-assured measurements of microplastics in soil using fluorescence microscopy.	Fluorescence microscopy is increasingly seen as a fast, user-friendly, and high-throughput method for detecting microplastics (MPs) in soil; however, its effectiveness across diverse MP types and soil properties remains underexplored. This study tested a fluorescence microscopy-Nile red (NR) staining approach on eight MP types, covering both biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastics, in three size ranges (≤ 150 µm, 100-250 µm, 500-1000 µm) across loamy, clayey, and sandy soils. Each sample, processed in triplicate, underwent a relatively quick and straightforward extraction procedure involving density separation, organic digestion, and NR staining, followed by fluorescence and bright-field microscopy. A new digital image analysis pipeline using Image J was developed to expedite and (semi)automate MP quantification. Recoveries ranged from 80% to 90% for MPs with a Feret diameter of 500-1000 µm, regardless of soil type. In contrast, the recovery of smaller MPs (Feret dia. ≤ 250 µm) varied depending on the soils and plastic types: recoveries for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) reached 85% in sandy soil and 90% in loamy soil, whereas those for biodegradable polybutylene adipate terephthalate/polylactic acid (PBAT/PLA) were only 60% and 10%, respectively. The lowest recovery rate was observed in clayey soil and for biodegradable plastics. The method was tested on non-agricultural soil samples, yielding a MP mean number concentration of 20.7 ± 9.0 MPs/g for MPs sized from dia. ≥ 25 µm, comparable to Fourier transform infrared (FPA-µ-FTIR) results of 13.1 ± 7.3 MPs/g (p > 0.05). We conclude that fluorescence microscopy with NR staining and automated particle quantification offers a time-efficient, reproducible, and accurate method for MP detection in light-textured soils, whereas limitations remain for reliable MP analysis in clay-dominated soils.
40063119	Morphological spore-based characterisation and molecular approaches reveal comparable patterns in glomeromycotan communities.	Traditionally, characterisation and comparison of AMF communities has been carried out by morphological identification of asexual spores in soil. In recent decades, molecular methods such as soil metabarcoding have become more popular than morphological identification of spores, but direct comparisons of the efficiency of both approaches have been rare. In this study, we compared AMF communities in soil samples from vegetable farms using both morphological and molecular methods (internal transcribed spacer, ITS, markers). In addition, we performed a systematic literature search and retrieved nine studies that analysed AMF communities using both approaches in the same soil samples, mostly in agroecosystems. Our results show that AMF communities determined by morphological spore-based identification are different than those determined by molecular genetic markers, but not as often claimed. In some cases, the morphological spore-based characterisation of spores revealed more diverse glomeromycotan communities. Moreover, in several cases the spore-based methods recovered taxa that the molecular methods did not, while in other cases the opposite was observed. The field and literature-based results of this study indicate that for a comprehensive and exhaustive characterisation of AMF communities it is necessary to combine both approaches. However, if the aim is to compare communities under different environmental conditions, both approaches provide comparable patterns.
40063217	Methodological optimization for ecotoxicological community tests with Enchytraeids-extraction procedures and sampling effort.	Enchytraeids play important roles in ecosystems, contributing to the decomposition of organic matter, given the feeding activity in the litter and the interaction with soil microorganisms, affecting the regulation, flow, and cycling of carbon and nutrients in ecosystems. Despite their ecological relevance, enchytraeids are commonly neglected in soil biodiversity assessments. To develop a methodology to assess the effects of pollutants on natural communities of enchytraeids, some methodologies require optimization. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the two extraction methods of the enchytraeid community to access their structural diversity, determine the sampling effort for each extraction method, and evaluate the survival of the specimens subjected in a post-extraction survival test. The samplings were collected in two municipalities in the South region of Brazil. In each area, two transects were established (one for the wet-hot extraction method and one for the wet-cold extraction method); each transect contained nine sampling points, and nine cores were collected. The nine cores were collected in a grid of 3 × 3 subpoints, spaced 0.3 m. The enchytraeids were identified until genus and morphospecies level. The extraction method did not influence the diversity accessed in the field. The sampling effort was positively related to the genus and morphospecies richness, with the cold extraction method requiring more samples to achieve a given fraction of species richness. Additionally, both extraction methods had similar effects on the survival of enchytraeids after extraction. These results contribute to the development of a methodology to assess the effects of pollutants on enchytraeids communities and help to fulfill the gap of knowledge about this important biological indicator.
40063235	Identification of Camellia Oil Adulteration With Excitation-Emission Matrix Fluorescence Spectra and Deep Learning.	Camellia oil (CAO), known for its high nutritional and commercial value, has raised increasing concerns about adulteration. Developing an accurate and non-destructive method to identify CAO adulterants is crucial for safeguarding public health and well-being. This study simulates potential real-world adulteration cases by designing representative adulteration scenarios, followed by the acquisition and analysis of corresponding excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) spectra. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was employed to characterize and explore the variations of fluorophores in the EEMF spectra of different adulterated scenarioss, which showed a linear correlation between the relative concentration of PARAFAC components and adulteration levels. A deep learning model named ResTransformer, which combines residual modules with Transformer, was proposed for both the qualitative detection of adulteration types and the quantitative detection of adulteration concentrations from local and global perspectives. The global ResTransformer qualitative models achieved accuracies of over 96.92% based on EEMF spectra and PARAFAC, and quantitative models showed determination coefficient of validation ([Formula: see text]) > 0.978, root mean square error of validation ([Formula: see text]) < 3.0643%, and the ratio performance deviation (RPD) > 7.6741. Compared to traditional chemometric models, the ResTransformer model demonstrated superior performance. The integration of EEMF and ResTransformer presents a highly promising strategy for rapid and reliable detection of CAO adulteration.
40063245	Genome-wide association mapping for the identification of stripe rust resistance loci in US hard winter wheat.	The GWAS and testing with Yr gene linked markers identified 109 loci including 40 novel loci for all-stage and adult plant stage resistance to stripe rust in 459 US contemporary hard winter wheat genotypes. Stripe rust is a destructive wheat disease, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). To identify sources of stripe rust resistance in US contemporary hard winter wheat, a panel of 459 Great Plains wheat genotypes was evaluated at the seedling stage against five US Pst races and at the adult plant stage in field environments in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Washington. The results showed that 7-14% of the genotypes were resistant to Pst races at the seedling stage, whereas 32-78% of genotypes were resistant at the adult plant stage across field environments, indicating the presence of adult plant resistance. Sixteen genotypes displayed a broad spectrum of resistance to all five Pst races and across all field environments. The panel was further genotyped using 9858 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated from multiplex restriction amplicon sequencing (MRASeq) and the functional DNA markers linked to the known stripe rust resistance (Yr) genes Yr5, Yr15, Yr17, Yr18, Yr29, Yr36, Yr40, Yr46, and QYr.tamu-2B. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using genotypic and phenotypic data, which identified 110 SNPs and the functional markers linked to Yr15 and Yr17 to be significantly associated with stripe rust response. In addition, Yr5, Yr15, Yr17, Yr18, Yr29, and QYr.tamu-2B were detected by their functional DNA markers in the panel. This study identified 40 novel loci associated with stripe rust resistance in genomic regions not previously characterized by known Yr genes. These findings offer significant opportunities to diversify and enhance stripe rust resistance in hard winter wheat.
40063283	Drought's physiological footprint: implications for crop improvement in rice.	Rice, a staple food for significant percent of the world's population, is increasingly vulnerable to drought stress, threatening global food security. This review synthesizes current knowledge on drought's physiological impact on rice, highlighting key mechanisms, responses, and adaptations. Drought stress alters rice physiology at various stages, from seed germination to grain filling, affecting yield, quality, and nutrient content. Drought tolerance in rice is influenced by physiological traits such as root architecture and depth, stomatal regulation and water use efficiency, Osmo-protectants and antioxidant defences, hormone signalling and stress response pathways. Genetic diversity and molecular breeding have enhanced drought resilience in rice, with key genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling drought tolerance identified, enabling marker-assisted selection and genetic engineering. Despite progress, challenges persist, including limited understanding of drought's impact on rice physiology under field conditions, inefficient screening methods for drought tolerance, and insufficient attention to drought's effects on rice quality and nutritional content. To address these gaps, integrating physiology, genetics, and agronomy for holistic drought mitigation strategies is crucial. Developing high-throughput phenotyping tools for drought tolerance screening and investigating drought's impact on rice grain quality and nutritional content are essential. This review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding drought's physiological footprint in rice and guiding future research toward improving drought tolerance and resilience.
40063319	Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in Saudi Arabia: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) pose a significant public health challenge in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), where epidemiological data remain scarce. These diseases disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, leading to chronic morbidity and economic burdens. Understanding their distribution and burden is crucial for effective public health interventions. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the prevalence, distribution, and etiological patterns of NTDs in KSA, identifying key research gaps and informing future policy directions. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on peer-reviewed studies published between 1950 and 2024 that investigated NTDs in humans in KSA. Ninety-four articles met the inclusion criteria. The majority (69.15%, n = 65) were published after 2010, with most studies concentrated in the western (n = 35, 37.23%) and southwestern (n = 15, 15.96%) regions, areas known for environmental and socioeconomic factors that may contribute to disease transmission. Protozoal NTDs were the most frequently reported (n = 28, 29.78%), followed by viral (n = 26, 27.66%), helminthic (n = 18, 19.15%), and ectoparasitic (n = 9, 9.57%) infections. Bacterial (n = 5, 5.32%), fungal (n = 4, 4.26%), and venom-related (n = 4, 4.26%) NTDs were less commonly reported. Meta-analysis yielded pooled prevalence estimates of leishmaniasis at 0.59 (95% CI: 0.38-0.77, I² = 94.2%) and dengue at 0.20 (95% CI: 0.05-0.53, I² = 98.8%), highlighting a substantial disease burden and high heterogeneity among studies. The findings emphasize the urgent need for strengthened national surveillance, improved diagnostic capacity, and region-specific interventions to control NTDs in KSA. Future research should focus on underrepresented regions, expand community-based epidemiological studies, and integrate cross-border surveillance strategies to mitigate disease importation risks. By addressing these gaps, KSA can enhance its preparedness and contribute to global NTD elimination efforts.
40063342	Evaluation of in vivo fish and amphibian endocrine test guideline assays: current status and future needs.	Endocrine pathways are crucial in regulating physiological functions in organisms, including growth and development, metabolism, tissue function, and reproduction. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with normal hormonal function and lead to adverse effects in organisms and/or their offspring. As a result, regulatory testing and assessment requirements have been implemented to identify and regulate EDCs-defined by the World Health Organization as chemicals that alter the function of an endocrine system and cause "subsequent adverse effects in an intact organism, its progeny, or (sub)populations" - although the approaches taken for assessment vary worldwide. As such, the current typical ecotoxicological assessment paradigm for EDCs involves initial testing for endocrine activity using in vitro and lower-tier in vivo assays, followed by higher-tier in vivo testing which can provide additional endocrine mechanistic data and establishes any consequent adversity. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among other entities, have validated and adopted standardized in vivo test guidelines for mammals, fish, and amphibians. These tests can be challenging and take months to perform, and many require the use of large numbers of laboratory animals. This paper summarizes the current state of the science for evaluating the endocrine disrupting potential of chemicals in fish and amphibians using in vivo test guideline assays across the estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and steroidogenesis modalities. Current challenges associated with conducting and interpreting the in vivo assays are discussed. Opportunities and potential next steps to strengthen this growing area of testing are explored, including potential to inform development and application of new approach methodologies and thereby reduce reliance on using laboratory animals.
40063508	Wood Biomolecules as Agricultural Adjuvants for Effective Suppression of Droplet Rebound from Plant Foliage.	The agrochemical run-off associated with crop control is an unintended consequence of droplet rebound from plant foliage, which negatively affects crop performance and the environment. This is most critical in water-based formulations delivered on plant surfaces that are typically waxy and nonwetting. This study introduces an alternative to synthetic surfactants and high molecular weight polymers that are used as spreading agents for agrochemicals. Specifically, biopolymeric adjuvants (hemicelluloses and oligomeric lignin) extracted from wood by pressurized hot water are shown for their synergistic pinning capacity and surface activity that can effectively suppress droplet rebound from hydrophobic surfaces. Hemicellulose and lignin mixtures, alongside several model compounds, are investigated for understanding the dynamics of droplet impact and its correlation with biomacromolecule formations. The benefit of utilizing lean solutions (0.1 wt.% concentration) is highlighted for reducing droplet rebounding from leaves, outperforming synthetic systems in current use. For instance, a tenfold deposition improvement is demonstrated on citrus leaves, because of a significantly suppressed droplet roll-off. These results establish the excellent prospects of wood extracts to improve crop performance.
40063562	Water production efficiency and economic benefits under diversified planting modes of intercropping-multiple cropping in arid regions.	Diversified planting patterns are important measures to improve the comprehensive grain production capacity, alleviate the contradiction between grain crops and forage planting, and enhance water production efficiency. In order to explore the suitable diversified planting modes in the Yellow River irrigation area of Ningxia, a total of 4 treatments were designed, including wheat-maize silage intercropping and multiple planting of sorghum-sudangrass hybrid after wheat harvest (T1); wheat-cabbage intercropping, multiple planting of oil sunflower after wheat harvest, followed by maize silage planting after cabbage harvest (T2); sole wheat, after the harvest of wheat, half of the land is used for multiple plantings of maize silage, and the other half is used for multiple plantings of oil sunflower (T3); and sole maize silage (T4). The results showed that all diversified planting modes can increase biomass and land equivalent ratio compared to the control monoculture. The T2 had the highest total biomass and land equivalent ratio, the two-year average was 79.68 t/ha and 2.27, respectively. The highest biological yield per cubic meter of water was achieved by T3, with an average of 12.65 kg/m3 over two years. T1 achieved the highest output value per cubic meter of water, with 16.81 Chinese Yuan/m³ over 2 years. In both T1 and T2, due to the increased spacing between intercropping crops, as well as sufficient water and fertilizer supply and developed root system, maize silage is at a competitive advantage, with a interspecific relative competitive ability between 0.059-0.234. When maize silage and oil sunflower are planted simultaneously, due to the fast growth rate of oil sunflower, it is the dominant crop, the interspecific relative competitive ability in 2022 and 2023 were 0.164 and 0.137, respectively. The net benefit of T1 was the highest, with an average total net income of 84,950 Chinese Yuan/ha over 2 years. It can be seen that diversified planting patterns can improve the yield and economic benefits per unit land area, and are a highly promising planting pattern.
40063625	Numerical simulation analysis of pile-soil interaction under earthquake action.	Pile foundation is a commonly recognized form of foundation, and earthquakes are a common seismic damage phenomenon. Accidents resulting from reduction in pile bearing capacity due to earthquakes pose a great threat to people's lives and safety. This article investigates the interaction between soil and piles under earthquake action. Utilizing the MIDAS GTS NX finite element software, the vertical bearing characteristics of piles under earthquake action are studied. Obtained acceleration of piles, pile settlement, pile axial force, pile top horizontal displacement, soil pore water pressure, and pore pressure ratio under different earthquake magnitudes. The research results indicate that as the depth increases, the acceleration at the pile top is significantly greater than that at the pile bottom, with an average increase of 20% in acceleration at three different earthquake magnitudes; Both the beginning of the pore pressure ratio growth and the ultimate reaching of its stable pore pressure ratio coincide with a rise in earthquake magnitude. Additionally, the axial force of the pile body also increases with the magnitude of the earthquake, and the maximum axial force of the pile body can increase by 40% at the same time. Simultaneously, the magnitude of the earthquake influences both the displacement of the pile body and the settling of the pile top. This article can provide reference for pile foundation design and engineering construction in liquefaction sites.
40063634	Genomic insights into Mediterranean pepper diversity using ddRADSeq.	This work investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of 99 pepper lines (Capsicum annuum L.), acclimated to Mediterranean climate conditions, using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq). The aims were to understand the genetic relationships among these lines, correlate genetic clusters with botanical classifications, and provide insights into pepper domestication in the region. Obtained were 318.76 million raw sequence reads overall, averaging 3.21 million reads per sample. A total of 8475 high-quality SNPs were identified and used to assess genetic diversity and population structure. Chromosome NC_061113.1 displayed the highest amount and Chromosome NC_061118.1 the fewest of these SNPs, which were not equally spaced around the genome. Heterozygosity measures and a negative inbreeding coefficient point to the great genetic diversity seen, therefore highlighting the genetic health of the population. Different genetic clusters found by phylogenetic study and STRUCTURE analysis can be used in breeding programs to mix desired features from many genetic backgrounds. This work showed how well ddRADSeq generates high-quality SNPs for genomic research on peppers, therefore offering useful molecular tools for genomic selection and marker-assisted selection. The analysis identified significant genetic diversity and distinct genetic clusters which are valuable for breeding programs focused on crop improvement. These findings enhance our understanding of pepper domestication and provide valuable genetic resources for breeding programs aimed at improving pepper varieties.
40063666	<i>Microbacterium candidum</i> sp. nov. and <i>Microbacterium capsulatum</i> sp. nov., isolated from waste landfill.	Two Gram-stain-positive, oxidase-negative, non-motile and rod-shaped strains (ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup>) were isolated from a waste landfill in Shanghai, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains are associated with members of the genus <i>Microbacterium</i>. Strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> were most closely related to <i>Microbacterium rhizosphaerae</i> JCM 31396<sup>T</sup> and <i>Microbacterium bovistercoris</i> CCTCC AA 2018025<sup>T</sup> with 98.5 and 98.0% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, respectively. The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> were 69.5 and 70.5 mol %, respectively. Strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> exhibited the highest average nucleotide identity values of 81.7 and 85.3% against their closest relatives <i>Microbacterium xylanilyticum</i> JCM 13591<sup>T</sup> and <i>M. rhizosphaerae</i> JCM 31396<sup>T</sup>, respectively. Corresponding digital DNA-DNA hybridization values were 25.1 and 30.9%, respectively. Strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> grew optimally at pH 7.0 and 28 °C on Reasoner's 2A. Strain ASV81<sup>T</sup> produced capsules, but ASV49<sup>T</sup> did not. Both isolates shared the following chemotaxonomic characteristics in common: the major fatty acids of anteiso-C<sub>15 : 0</sub>, iso-C<sub>16 : 0</sub> and anteiso-C<sub>17 : 0</sub>; the respiratory quinones of MK-11, MK-12, MK-13 and MK-10; the polar lipids of diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol; and the cell wall amino acids of ornithine, alanine, glycine and glutamic acid. Based on the genomic, phenotypic and chemical characteristics, strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> represent two novel species of the genus <i>Microbacterium</i>, for which the names <i>Microbacterium candidum</i> sp. nov. and <i>Microbacterium capsulatum</i> sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains are ASV49<sup>T</sup> (=GDMCC 1.4109<sup>T</sup>=JCM 36480<sup>T</sup>) and ASV81<sup>T</sup> (=GDMCC 1.4110<sup>T</sup>=JCM 36481<sup>T</sup>), respectively.
40063668	<i>Rhodococcus parequi</i> sp. nov., a new species isolated from equine farm soil closely related to the pathogen <i>Rhodococcus equi</i>.	We present the description of the new species, <i>Rhodococcus parequi</i>, found during phylogenomic investigations of a global collection of strains identified as <i>Rhodococcus</i> (<i>Prescottella</i>) <i>equi</i>. Strain PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> was isolated from horse-breeding farm soil in Normandy, France, and was indistinguishable from <i>R. equi</i> based on the usual identification tests. Whole-genome phylogenetic analyses located PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> in the same <i>Rhodococcus</i> sublineage as <i>R. equi</i>, together with <i>Rhodococcus agglutinans</i>, <i>Rhodococcus defluvii</i>, <i>Rhodococcus soli</i>, <i>Rhodococcus subtropicus</i>, <i>Rhodococcus spongiicola</i> and <i>Rhodococcus xishaensis</i>. PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> is most closely related to, but sufficiently distinct from, <i>R. equi</i> DSM 20307 <sup>T</sup> to be considered a separate species. The average nt identity (ANI) and average aa identity (AAI) values are 88.60% and 92.35, respectively, well below the species cutoff. The PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> draft genome is ~5.3 Mb in size with 68.98% G+C mol content. PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> is strictly aerobic and non-motile and produces smooth, creamy to buff-coloured colonies very similar to those of <i>R. equi</i>. It phenotypically differs from the latter by the ability to grow at 5 °C, a strongly positive urease test at 24 h and specificities in the carbon and nitrogen source utilization profile as determined by phenotype microarray screens. Our data indicate that PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> belongs to a novel species, for which the name <i>Rhodococcus parequi</i> sp. nov. is proposed. <i>R. parequi</i> was avirulent in macrophage infection assays and is assumed to be non-pathogenic. The type strain is PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> (=CETC 30995<sup>T</sup>=NCTC 14987<sup>T</sup>).
40063669	<i>Novosphingobium rhizovicinum</i> sp. nov. and <i>Novosphingobium kalidii</i> sp. nov., two novel species isolated from rhizosphere soil and a root of halophyte <i>Kalidium cuspidatum</i>.	Two bacteria, designated strain M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup>, were isolated from rhizosphere soil and a root of <i>Kalidium cuspidatum</i> in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strains M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup> were tightly clustered and both shared the highest 16S rRNA gene similarities (98.6 and 98.5 %) to <i>Novosphingobium fluoreni</i> ACCC 19180<sup>T</sup> and less than 97.8% similarities with all other current type strains. Values of the digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), the average nucleotide identity based on the blast method (ANIb) and the average amino acid identity (AAI) of the two strains and their closely related species were 32.2, 79.0, and 84.5%, which were lower than the threshold values (70% for dDDH, 95% for ANIb and 95% for AAI). The major fatty acids of strains M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup> were C<sub>18 : 1</sub> <i> ω7</i>c and summed feature 3 (C<sub>16 : 1</sub> <i> ω6</i>c and/or C<sub>16 : 1</sub> <i> ω7</i>c). The only quinone was ubiquinone-10. Spermidine was the predominant polyamine. The genomic DNA G+C contents for strain M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup> were 62.4 and 62.7%. The phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic results supported that strains M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup> could be identified as two novel species within the genus <i>Novosphingobium</i>, for which the name <i>Novosphingobium rhizovicinum</i> sp. nov. and <i>Novosphingobium kalidii</i> sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains are <i>N. rhizovicinum</i> M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> (=CGMCC 1.62060<sup>T</sup>=KCTC 8106<sup>T</sup>) and <i>N. kalidii</i> RD2P27<sup>T</sup> (=CGMCC 1.62131<sup>T</sup>=KCTC 8107<sup>T</sup>).
40063678	Environmental and Biological Drivers of Root Exudation.	Root exudation is the process by which plants release organic and inorganic metabolites from their roots into the surrounding soil. Root exudation is a dynamic process and shapes plant-environment interactions at the root-soil interface. Little is known about the biological and environmental factors that shape the exuded metabolome, hereafter referred to as the exudome, despite its importance in structuring soil processes. Here, we emphasize plant physiological and morphological traits that modulate the exudome in a species- and developmental stage-specific manner. We further discuss how environmental factors drive exudation processes. We highlight evidence of a potential circadian exudation rhythm and further illustrate how the physical (temperature, structure), chemical (moisture, pH, nutrients, pollutants), and biological (micro- and macrofauna) properties of soil alter the root exudome composition and release patterns. Exploring the factors that directly or indirectly modulate exudation will enhance our understanding of how this dynamic process mediates plant-environment interactions.
40063772	First record of watermelon crinkle leaf-associated virus 2 infecting watermelon in open field in Italy.	Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) is an important horticultural crop in Italy, with a production of around 600,000 tons per year (third producer in the Europe). Viruses are considered a limiting factor in watermelon production, especially those transmitted by efficient vectors such as whiteflies and aphids. In July 2023, foliar symptoms on 100% of watermelon plants (cv. Samba), including curling and wrinkling, yellow mottling and chlorosis, were observed in a commercial field of about 4000 m2 at Eboli (Salerno province, South Italy; coordinates: 40°29'83''N 14°57'99''E) (Figure S1). Some fruits were also symptomatic showing circular lesions and deformations. Overall, symptoms resembled those described for watermelon crinkle leaf-associated viruses (WCLaV-1, Coguvirus citrulli and WCLaV-2, Coguvirus henanense; genus Coguvirus, family Phenuiviridae) (Hernandez et al., 2021; Hendricks et al., 2022; Mulholland et al., 2023). Total RNAs were isolated from pooled leaf tissues of 10 symptomatic plants using the Viral Gene-spinTM Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc., South Korea) and used for construction of RNA-seq libraries, which were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform with paired-end reads length of 101 bp. The HTS yielded 31,125,612 raw reads, while after trimming 28,868,089 reads were recovered. Viral genome assembly was performed with the two algorithms implemented in the SPAdes program (v. 3.15.3; Bankevich et al., 2012). Two sets of filtered contigs were obtained: 3,184 contigs with the algorithms implemented in Metaspades, and 3,369 contigs with algorithms implemented in RNAviral. BLASTn/BLASTx analysis of the contigs were carried out against online databases (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Two contigs, obtained from the assembly of 7520 reads for RNA1 and 4585 reads for RNA2 respectively, showed the greatest nucleotide identities with the WCLaV-2 genome. These contigs represented full-length genomic sequences of the corresponding virus. No other viral contigs belonging to other viruses were generated by HTS library. The HTS results were confirmed by RT-PCR on each of the 10 watermelon samples using the WCLaV-2-specific primers WCLaV-2vRP (5'-GTCTCACATTCCTGCACTAACT)/WCLaV-2cRP (5'-ATCGGTCCTGGGTTATTTGTATC) targeting 968 bp of the RdRP and WCLaV-2vMP (5'-GACTTCAGAACCTCAACATCCA)/WCLaV-2cMP (5'-CAAGGGAGAGTGCTGACAAA) targeting 562 bp of the MP (Hernandez et al., 2021). Amplicons of the expected size were sequenced and sequences were 100% identical to the corresponding regions obtained by HTS sequencing, confirming presence of WCLaV-2 in the watermelon plants. After verifying the sequences at the 5' and 3' ends, the sequences of the two genomic ssRNA segments consisted of 6679 nucleotides (nt) for RNA1 and 2729 nt for RNA2. These sequences were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers PQ869160 (RNA1) and PQ869161 (RNA2). According to the BLASTn analysis, the RNA1 was highly similar (99.94% sequence identity; 100% query coverage) to the Ju-01-WCLaV2 isolate (LC636073) from Brazil, while the RNA2 was highly similar (96.23% sequence identity; 99% query coverage) to the KF-15 isolate (NC_079049) from China. WCLaV-2 was first reported in watermelon in China (Xin et al., 2017) and then in USA (Hernandez et al. 2021), Brazil (Maeda et al., 2022) and Australia (Mulholland et al., 2023). Although it was recently detected in some watermelon commercial seeds in Italy (Minutolo et al., 2024), this report confirms for the first time the spread of the virus in open field watermelon crops in southern Italy. Studies to assess the incidence and impact of disease on watermelon production, the identification of potential vectors and the role of the seeds in virus transmission should be conducted to aid the development of the best management practices with the aim to contain the damages caused by the virus.
40063773	First Report of Brown Stripe Disease Caused by <i>Paracidovorax oryzae</i> on Rice in Guangxi (China).	Rice, being the most important food crop in China, is also the world's largest producer and consumer, accounting for 30% of global production and consumption. In 2023, brown stripes were observed on the leaf sheaths of diseased rice seedlings in a Jingxi rice field (22°51'N, 105°56'E) in Guangxi, China. The investigated area of rice fields, which was about 1.5 hectares, had an estimated disease incidence of 15 ± 5%. Leaf samples exhibiting symptoms of suspected brown stripe disease was collected and stored at 4 °C for bacterial isolation. The junction margins of lesions were surface-sterilized with 75% ethanol-saturated cotton swabs, and sterilized scissors were used to excise leaf sections (5 mm × 5 mm) from the diseased-healthy tissue interfaces. Within a sterile environment, these leaf fragments were soaked in 75% ethanol for three minutes, then ground and cultured on KB medium at a temperature of 28 °C for two days. A single colony (strain JX258) was then inoculated into sterile KB medium and incubated at 28 °C with a rotation speed of 220 rpm for 15 hours to obtain a bacterial suspension. Universal primers (27F/1492R) (Kinoshita et al., 2021) were used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene from strain JX258. A 1,394 bp fragment (GenBank PQ465223) amplified from strain JX258 was obtained and showed 97.80% sequence identity with Paracidovorax oryzae ATCC 19882 (Li, X et al. 2017). Specific primers (Aaaf3/ Aaar2, Aaaf3/ Aaar2) (Osdaghi E. 2023) successfully confirmed that this particular strain is indeed responsible for causing brown stripe disease in rice plants. Rice seeds were soaked in a bacterial suspension (1 × 10^6 CFU·mL⁻¹) for two days before undergoing germination followed by sowing in perlite under moist conditions (Supplemental Figures 1A-D). Brown lesions developed on leaves by 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), whereas mock-inoculated controls (10 mM MgCl₂) remained symptom-free. The seedlings soaked in a suspension of strain JX258 exhibited significantly reduced viability, germination, height, and growth rate, ultimately leading to seed mortality. Moreover, healthy rice leaves that were treated with a bacterial suspension (1 × 10^4 CFU·mL⁻¹) via spray inoculation, resulted in the manifestation of brown rice stripe disease symptoms within 7 days post-inoculation, P. oryzae was reisolated from the infected rice leaves, similar to those observed in the field, fulfilling Koch's postulates (Supplemental Figures 1E-F). The whole genome of JX258 was sequenced using the Sanger method, assembled, and analyzed to identify the strain at the species level. Whole-genome sequencing of JX258 (GenBank JBHJCP000000000.1) revealed 91.20% digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and 98.14% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with P. oryzae ATCC 19882 (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013; Yoon et al., 2017). In the Biolog Microbial Identification System, Version 4.2 (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA), JX258 showed a similarity with a match probability of 73% to Paracidovorax avenae. The utilization of the unique carbon source on BIOLOG GEN III reagent strip by JX258 is shown in Supplemental Table 1. The pathogen was identified as Paracidovorax oryzae based on technological means of pathogenicity assessment, biochemical analysis, phylogenetic analysis (Supplemental Figure 1G), and molecular characterization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Paracidovorax oryzae causing brown stripe disease on rice in Guangxi, China. Therefore, phytosanitary measures have to be implemented to prevent the introduction and spread of the pathogen in other areas.
40063805	Sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to multiple <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> traits in transgenic maize.	Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.
40063806	The SUbventral-Gland Regulator (SUGR-1) of nematode virulence.	Pathogens must precisely tailor their gene expression to cause infection. However, a signaling cascade from host signal to effector production has remained elusive for metazoan pathogens. Here, we show that plants contain molecular signals, termed effectostimulins, that activate the first identified regulator of plant-parasitic nematode effectors. SUGR-1 directly binds effector promoters, and is central to a transcriptional network that activates 58 effector genes. Importantly, we demonstrate that downregulation of <i>sugr-1</i> inhibits parasitism, underlining SUGR-1 signaling as a valuable target for crop protection and food security. This, in the wider context of nematodes as parasites of humans and other animals, has scope for potentially broader impact: Disrupting effector production could, in principle, be applied to any pathogen that secrets effectors.
40063820	A global estimate of multiecosystem photosynthesis losses under microplastic pollution.	Understanding how ecosystems respond to ubiquitous microplastic (MP) pollution is crucial for ensuring global food security. Here, we conduct a multiecosystem meta-analysis of 3,286 data points and reveal that MP exposure leads to a global reduction in photosynthesis of 7.05 to 12.12% in terrestrial plants, marine algae, and freshwater algae. These reductions align with those estimated by a constructed machine learning model using current MP pollution levels, showing that MP exposure reduces the chlorophyll content of photoautotrophs by 10.96 to 12.84%. Model estimates based on the identified MP-photosynthesis nexus indicate annual global losses of 4.11 to 13.52% (109.73 to 360.87 MT·y<sup>-1</sup>) for main crops and 0.31 to 7.24% (147.52 to 3415.11 MT C·y<sup>-1</sup>) for global aquatic net primary productivity induced by MPs. Under scenarios of efficient plastic mitigation, e.g., a ~13% global reduction in environmental MP levels, the MP-induced photosynthesis losses are estimated to decrease by ~30%, avoiding a global loss of 22.15 to 115.73 MT·y<sup>-1</sup> in main crop production and 0.32 to 7.39 MT·y<sup>-1</sup> in seafood production. These findings underscore the urgency of integrating plastic mitigation into global hunger and sustainability initiatives.
40063867	Impact of mass drug administration with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole for lymphatic filariasis on hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis infections in Papua New Guinea.	Persons with lymphatic filariasis (LF) are often co-infected with soil-transmitted helminths. A single co-administered dose of ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (IDA) is recommended by WHO for mass drug administration (MDA) for LF instead of diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (DA) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). We compared the effectiveness of a single round of MDA with IDA or DA on hookworm and strongyloidiasis in PNG.
40063884	Enhancing green bean crop maturity and yield prediction by harnessing the power of statistical analysis, crop records and weather data.	Climate change impacts require us to reexamine crop growth and yield under increasing temperatures and continuing yearly climate variability. Agronomic and agro-meteorological variables were concorded for a large number of plantings of green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in three growing seasons over several years from semi-tropical Queensland. Using the Queensland government's SILO meteorological database matched to sowing dates and crop phenology, we derived planting specific agro-meteorological variables. Linear and nonlinear statistical models were used to predict duration of vegetative and pod filling periods and fresh yield using agro-meteorological variables including thermal time, radiation and days of high temperature stress. High temperatures over 27.5∘C and 30∘C in the pod fill period were associated with a lower fresh bean yield. Differences between specific bean growing sites were examined using our bespoke open source software to derive agro-meteorological variables. Agronomically informed statistical models using production data were useful in predicting time of harvest. These methods can be applied to other commercial crops when crop phenology dates are collected.
40064053	Microplastics in agricultural soils following sewage sludge applications: Evidence from a 25-year study.	Sewage sludges applied to agricultural soils are sources of microplastic pollution, however, little is known about the accumulation, persistence, or degradation of these microplastics over time. This is the first study to provide long-term, high temporal resolution quantitative evidence of microplastics in agricultural soils following sewage sludge application. The abundance and degradation of microplastics was assessed in soils sampled biennially from an experimental field over a 25-year period managed under an improved grassland regime following the application of five different sewage sludges. The sludges contained different microplastic compositions reflecting the different sources of the sludges. Microplastic abundance increased by 723-1445% following sewage sludge applications (p < 0.05) and remained constant over time (22 years and possibly beyond) (p > 0.05). All sludges predominantly added white/transparent microfibres to soil. Microfilms, microfibres, and fragments were most susceptible to degradation, potentially creating micro(nano)plastics. Of note was the discoloration of coloured microfibres, which may be environmentally hazardous due to the toxicity of textile dyes in soil ecosystems. We also found that plastic composition could be used to trace its source. This evidence is useful in informing regulation on sewage sludge use and management, and in assessing the fate and impact of microplastics in soil.
40064076	Effective microbial formulations using sustainable carriers for the remediation of plastic-affected soils.	The increasing use of mulching films in intensive agriculture, together with their inefficient end-of-life disposal, has led to a significant plastic accumulation in soils, which contributes to disrupting ecosystems. The aim of this work was to determine the ability of different sustainable carriers to harbor and introduce plastic-degrading microorganisms into contaminated soils to provide a biotechnological tool that potentially enhances plastic decontamination, ameliorating the harmful effect of this type of pollutant in soil. To this end, pure cultures and co-cultures of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas alloputida (specialized plastic-degrading strains) were added to three sustainable carriers (vermicompost, biochar, and calcium alginate beads) for the preparation of microbial formulations. After a storage period, the maintenance of cell viability and enzymatic activities related to the bioremediation potential of plastic materials of the inocula tested in the different microbial formulations (carrier + inoculant) were evaluated. The effectiveness of the formulations for plastic mineralization was tested by measuring CO2 emissions after two months. The results showed that biochar, followed by vermicompost, favored greater microbial survival (107 CFU g-1), while alginate formulations showed variable cell viability results, from 107 to 104 CFU g-1. Biochar also excelled in maintaining enzymatic activities related to plastic degradation, achieving the expression of 100% of the tested enzymes. Additionally, biochar-based formulations applied to soils contaminated with LLDPE plastic showed the highest mineralization rates, with statistically significant differences compared to the plastic-free control. These results lay the foundation for the development of new plastic decontamination technologies paving the way for the sustainable treatment of polluting and recalcitrant materials such as plastic.
40064078	Environmental determinants of spatial-temporal variability in ammonia oxidizing microorganisms across diverse Chinese agricultural soils.	Numerous studies investigated the variation of soil ammonia oxidizing microorganisms along the geographic distance, but few highlighted the associated influence of agricultural practices on ammonia oxidizing communities and functions. To make up this gap, we determined the variation of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacteria (AOB), and soil nitrification within eight typical agricultural plots across China. The current study revealed significant variations in soil potential nitrification rates (PNRs) and the diversity and composition of AOA and AOB communities across various plots. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant link between soil PNRs and alpha diversity, specific AOA and AOB taxa, but no significant correlation was found with amoA gene abundance. Structural equation modeling and canonical correspondence analysis showed that factors like MAT, clay content, CEC, and soil carbon and nitrogen levels significantly influenced the diversity and composition of AOA. In contrast, AOB were more significantly impacted by soil pH and carbon- and nitrogen-related nutrients, but less associated with MAP and soil clay content. Notably, soil PNRs were found to be closely linked to AOB diversity, soil pH, and ammonium nitrogen (NH4N) levels. This research highlights the contributing role of AOB group in soil nitrification and the related driving factors from agricultural practices.
40064082	Transformational fixation of Cr(VI) during microwave-enhanced reduction of soil iron minerals by tea polyphenols.	Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] presents substantial environmental and health hazards due to its pronounced toxicity and mobility in soils. Traditional chemical reduction methods for Cr(VI) are often inadequate for treating chromium-contaminated soils, as they may fail to fully reduce Cr(VI), leading to incomplete remediation. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop more efficient and environmentally sustainable methods for the treatment of hexavalent chromium. This study explores an innovative approach using microwave-enhanced reduction of soil iron minerals facilitated by tea polyphenols to achieve transformational fixation of Cr(VI). The microwave-assisted treatment (0.5 wt% TP combined with MW at 700 W for 10 min) significantly reduced Cr(VI) concentrations in iron-rich soil from 363.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 0.3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, achieving a removal rate of 99.9%, compared to TP treatment alone (0.5 wt%). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the enhanced removal efficiency of Cr(VI) by microwave-assisted tea polyphenols is attributable to the accelerated reduction of soil iron minerals by the polyphenols. Furthermore, microwave enhancement facilitated the transformation of Cr into more stable forms, such as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Additionally, the Cr(VI) content in the treated soil remained below 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> after 360 days of atmospheric exposure, indicating sustained immobilization. This study demonstrates that the integration of tea polyphenols with microwave irradiation constitutes a promising strategy for the remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated soils.
40064085	Forest fire susceptibility mapping using multi-criteria decision making and machine learning models in the Western Ghats of India.	Forest fires have significantly increased over the last decade due to shifts in rainfall patterns, warmer summers, and long spells of dry weather events in the coastal regions. Assessment of susceptibility to forest fires has become an important management tool for damage control before the occurrence of fires, which often spread very rapidly. In this context, the current study was undertaken with the aim to map forest areas susceptible to fire in the state of Goa (India) using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system () derived variables through an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and machine learning techniques namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Nine variables viz. Elevation (m), slope (%), aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), forest cover types, average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to road (m), distance to settlement (m), and land surface temperature (LST, °C) were used to map susceptible areas in five different classes. The map classified forest areas into different susceptibility levels, with significant variations observed across different models. The study emphasized the importance of machine learning techniques for forest management and fire risk assessment. Validation of the susceptibility map showed excellent performance of the models, with the random forest model exhibiting the best performance. The forest fire susceptibility map generated using RF indicated that a large area (44.15%) of forest cover in Goa is very highly susceptible to fire followed by highly susceptible (21.35%) and a moderately susceptible area of 15.62%. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis using RF identified forest type, distance from settlement, slope and NDVI as important variables affecting forest fire susceptibility. In the study area, an extended dry period with no post-monsoon rainfall makes the forest highly susceptible to fire. In view of the large area potentially susceptible to forest fire, there is an urgent need to implement preventive measures for fire control in the identified zones.
40064086	Enriched anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation for mitigating methane emissions in rainfed systems and climate-neutral rice production.	This study demonstrated the effectiveness of enriched anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation in reducing methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from rice cultivation while improving soil fertility and rice productivity. The enriched consortium from cattle farm effluent, dominated by Acinetobacter (65.5%) and containing both types I (Methylosarcina, Methylomagnum, and Methyloversatilis) and II (Methylocystis) methanotrophs, exhibited high methane oxidation rates (V<sub>max</sub> 45.70 ± 13.71 μmol-CH<sub>4</sub>⋅g<sup>-1</sup>⋅h<sup>-1</sup> and K<sub>m</sub> 16.50 ± 4.95 μM). The optimal inoculum size for soil application was 0.2 L⋅m<sup>-2</sup> (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5), resulting in a CH<sub>4</sub> reduction efficiency of 74.30 ± 3.56%. In rice pot experiments, the anoxic methanotrophic consortium with an inoculum size of 0.2 L⋅m<sup>-2</sup> reduced methane emissions by 79.32 ± 3.96% without fertilizer and 29.22 ± 1.45% and 46.81 ± 1.87% when combined with organic and chemical fertilizers, respectively. The field-scale evaluation revealed that combined soil and irrigation water application with anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation was the most effective, reducing seasonal methane emissions from 32.8 ± 4.2 to 9.3 ± 1.5 g-CH<sub>4</sub>·m<sup>-2</sup> and methane flux from 15.2 ± 2.1 to 4.3 ± 0.8 mg-CH<sub>4</sub>·m<sup>-2</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>, representing a 71.7 ± 0.4% reduction. This method also increased plant height (6.5%) and tiller number (26.4%). The combined application method also resulted in the highest soil nutrient levels (96.1 mg-N·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil, 21.8 mg-P·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil, and 133.4 mg-K·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil) and increased rice yield by 14.7% (975 g⋅m<sup>-2</sup>). These findings demonstrate that anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation is a sustainable approach to mitigate methane emissions and improve rice productivity, emphasizing the importance of integrating this strategy into rice cultivation practices in rainfed lowland areas.
40064088	Grapevines and trees: A biodiversity study of microbiomes in an established temperate agroforestry system.	Biodiversity is threatened particularly in perennial crop cultivation such as fruit trees or grapevines. If established, agroforestry has the potential to increase biodiversity by providing a higher habitat heterogeneity at the example of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Riesling) cultivated together with oak or poplar trees for 12 years. Together with the rhizosphere microbiome, the root metabolome was quantified as an indicator of root exudation. Since the root metabolome does not fully align with the exudate metabolome, we are using the root metabolome as a proxy for the exudate metabolome. The results reveal that co-cultivation of grapevine with trees reduces the nutrient availability in the soil and changes the root metabolome of both, grapevine and trees with a more distinct effect of trees on grapevine than vice versa, particularly for oak. Apparently, root-to-root signalling takes place between trees and grapevine. Co-cultivation of grapevine and oak trees also enhanced the alpha diversity of the microbiome. Correlation analysis revealed strong positive correlations between distinct microbial families and metabolites enriched in the roots of Riesling. Thus, microbiome analyses support the view that root-to-root interaction in mixed cultivation of grapevine with trees is mediated by root exudation.
40064090	Green synthesized MgO combined with dielectric barrier discharge plasma enhanced phosphorus (P) recovery from livestock wastewater: A dual approach for management of wastewater and P resources.	Phosphorus (P) recovery from wastewater using integrated techniques i.e., adsorption combined with advanced oxidation technologies is a novel approach for cleaning wastewater and preventing eutrophication. This approach, however, has not been extensively studied, particularly in the context of real wastewater applications. In this study, a green biomass-based sol-gel method was developed using potato starch (PS) and MgCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O to synthesize MgO (PS-MgO). The unique synthesis method resulted in PS-MgO composed predominantly of spherical particles with an average size of about 103 nm and exhibited superior P adsorption performance compared to commercial MgO materials (GH-MgO and AD-MgO). The Langmuir maximum P adsorption capacity (mg/g) of the PS-MgO was 429.4, while that of the commercial GH-MgO and AD-MgO was 341.3 and 421.7, respectively, at the solution pH 7.0. The kinetic model fitting demonstrated that the adsorption rate of PS-MgO was faster than the two commercial MgOs. Importantly, PS-MgO can maintain a high P adsorption capacity across a wide pH range (425 mg/g at pH 5.0 and 369 mg/g at pH 11.0), whereas the P adsorption capacities of GH-MgO (153 at pH 5.0 and 297 at pH 11.0) and AD-MgO (422 at pH 5.0 and 200 at pH 11.0) were more pH-dependent. In addition, PS-MgO exhibits high selectivity for P capture in solutions containing coexisting ions, and the P-loaded PS-MgO can efficiently release P through acid or base treatment, highlighting its potential for reuse as a fertilizer. To enhance P recovery from real livestock wastewater, the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma technology was combined with MgO adsorption. The P recovery capacity of MgOs from livestock wastewater increased 1.4-1.7 times after DBD plasma treatment, attributed to the degradation of aromatic proteins and microbial metabolites. These findings provide new insights into the design of efficient and environmentally friendly materials for P recovery, while also demonstrating the potential of integrating advanced oxidation technologies with adsorption processes.
40064215	Cloning of Toll3 and Toll4 and association analysis among their SNP haplotypes and disease resistance in red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).	With the expansion of the culture scale of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), the high incidence of diseases has seriously threatened the development of its industry. In this study, PcToll3 and PcToll4 were respectively cloned and explored SNPs among the germplasm populations, which had been identified relating to disease resistance in crayfish based on our previous study. A total of 3036 bp and 2820 bp of the open reading frame of PcToll3 and PcToll4 encoded 1011 and 939 amino acids, respectively. They were specially expressed in haemolymph, and significantly up-regulated expression after stimulation by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila and white spot syndrome virus. It was found that the expression of downstream genes PcALF, PcCru, PcIMD, PcMyD88, and PcNF-κB were repressed after interference of PcToll3 and/or PcToll4. Totally, 16 and 19 SNPs in the coding region of PcToll3 and PcToll4 were mined, and the favoured haplotypes and the combinations of them were classified according to the associated SNPs with the disease resistance in crayfish. The haplotypes of Toll3-Hap1, Toll4-Hap1 and the combination of Toll3+Toll4-Hap1 were further validated that they had the stronger disease resistance comparing to others haplotypes, and the related KASP markers were developed for further breeding application. This study will advance our understanding of the function of the two Toll genes in crayfish, and provide the markers for the molecular breeding.
40064231	Community structure and metabolic potentials of keystone taxa and their associated bacteriophages within rice root endophytic microbiome in response to metal(loid)s contamination.	Heavy metal (HM) contamination of agricultural products is of global environmental concern as it directly threatened the food safety. Plant-associated microbiome, particularly endophytic microbiome, hold the potential for mitigating HM stress as well as promoting plant growth. The metabolic potentials of the endophytes, especially those under the HM stresses, have not been well addressed. Rice, a major staple food worldwide, is more vulnerable to HM contamination compared to other crops and therefore requires special attentions. Therefore, this study selected rice as the target plants. Geochemical analysis and amplicon sequencing were combined to characterize the rice root endophytic bacterial communities and identify keystone taxa in two HM-contaminated rice fields. Metagenomic analysis was employed to investigate the metabolic potentials of these keystone taxa. Burkholderiales and Rhizobiales were identified as predominant keystone taxa. The metagenome-assembled genome (MAG)s associated with these keystone populations suggested that they possessed diverse genetic potentials related to metal resistance and transformation (e.g., As resistance and cycling, V reduction, Cr efflux and reduction), and plant growth promotion (nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, oxidative stress resistance, indole-3-acetic acid, and siderophore production). Moreover, bacteriophages encoding auxiliary metabolism genes (AMGs) associated with the HM resistance as well as nitrogen and phosphate acquisition were identified, suggesting that these phages may contribute to these crucial biogeochemical processes within rice roots. The current findings revealed the beneficial roles of rice endophytic keystone taxa and their associated bacteriophages within HM-contaminated rice root endophytic microbiome, which may provide valuable insights on future applications of employing root microbiome for safety management of agriculture productions.
40064342	The primary role of phosphate-metal- natural organic matter (humic) ternary complexes as drivers of long-term phosphorus plant nutrition in acidic soils.	Several studies have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) can form stable complexes in soil and soil solution, with some fractions of natural organic matter (NOM), mainly humic substances, through metal bridges. However, the role of these types of complexes in plant phosphorus (P) nutrition remains unclear. On the other hand, Pi in acidic soils is rapidly absorbed and fixed, becoming unavailable for plants. In this framework, this study aims to unveil the role of Pi-metal-NOM (humic) complexes in plant P nutrition in acidic soils. To this end, we have selected nine acidic soils from Spain with different soil properties and nutrient availability. On these soils, we cultivated wheat (Triticum aestirum L., cv Fiel) for successive harvests until no new sprouts appeared. Pi fractions were characterized using two complementary Pi sequencing analyses adapted to acidic soils. The results showed that Pi-metal-NOM (humic) complexes are mainly extracted by oxalate-pH3 after extracting the more labile forms of Pi. Likewise, correlation and principal component analysis studies showed that the Pi extracted with water plus resin is linked to short-term wheat P-nutrition. On the contrary, the Pi extracted with oxalate (pH 3) (after extracting the more labile fraction of Pi) that contains the main fraction of Pi-metal-NOM (humic) complexes is mainly linked to long-term wheat P-nutrition. This fact indicates that the addition of humified organic matter to acidic soils can significantly improve the fraction of potentially available P for crops.
40064344	Enhancement of the phytoremediation performance in heavy metal-contaminated soil using a multifunctional EPS-producing bacterium Kosakonia sp. W18.	The use of exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacteria for the phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil is emerging as a promising approach. This study explores the potential of Kosakonia sp. W18, an EPS-producing bacterium isolated from Suaeda japonica habitat, in the phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils. Strain W18 exhibited the highest tolerance to Pb (EC<sub>50</sub> of 231.1 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>), Cu, and Cr (EC<sub>50</sub> of 24.9 and 26.7 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>), and displayed plant growth-promoting traits. The EPS extracted from W18 (107.3 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>) showed 58% emulsification against chloroform, remarkable 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (38%) and hydroxyl radical (83%) scavenging activities. Extracted EPS also exhibited a Pb-removal efficiency exceeding 79%, with an adsorption capacity for Pb of 499.2 ± 7.7 mg·g-EPS<sup>-1</sup>. In the contaminated soils with Pb (500 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>) and Cr (100 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>), W18 inoculation significantly enhanced pakchoi shoot length and biomass by 1.1 to 1.3 times after 20 days. The presence of pakchoi decreased bioavailable Pb and Cr concentrations in soil by 46%, which elevated to 76% for Pb and 72% for Cr post-inoculation with W18. Furthermore, W18 enhanced Pb uptake in pakchoi roots, increasing the bioconcentration factor by over 1.5 times and large macroaggregates (>2 mm) formation exceeded 75%. Overall, this study highlights Kosakonia sp. W18's multifunctional abilities to promote pakchoi growth and improve its effectiveness in phytoremediation of heavy metals in contaminated soils.
40064347	Spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors of heavy metals of topsoil in Pearl River Basin, China.	This study investigates the spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors of topsoil heavy metals in the Pearl River Basin by utilizing data from the 2000s to the 2010s obtained from China Geochemical Baselines project (CGB1: 2008-2012; CGB2: 2015-2019), alongside geostatistics methods and a modified absolute principal component scores-multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) model. The results indicate that the median concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Hg exhibited a decreasing trend from the CGB1 to CGB2. Notably, As concentrations decreased the most, with a reduction percentage of 24.7%. Mining and smelting activities predominantly influenced the concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu, which decreased respectively from 16.34 mg/kg to 12.31 mg/kg, 365.11 μg/g to 287.38 μg/g, 41.31 mg/kg to 34.20 mg/kg, 96.41 mg/kg to 84.00 mg/kg, and 28.63 mg/kg to 25.72 mg/kg. The contribution rates of these activities ranged from 49.7% to 95.2%. In contrast, natural factors such as parent materials, weathering processes, and soil properties predominantly governed the concentrations of Cr and Ni, which decreased respectively from 62.03 to 55.92 mg/kg and 23.74 to 22.98 mg/kg, with contribution rates of 42.8% and 71.2%, respectively. Geochemical processes controlled the concentrations of Hg, which decreased from 115.75 to 112.85 μg/g, contributing 62.9%. Given the diverse geology and economic development of the Pearl River Basin, investigations into the spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors of heavy metals in topsoil not only provide a scientific basis for partitioned studies on pollution dynamics and health assessments within the basin, but also establish a foundation for analyzing environmental changes and developing policies in other regions.
40064348	Carbon Quantum Dots from Fallen Leaves of Lonicera caerulea L.: An Innovative Plant Growth Promoter and Fruit Quality Enhancer.	With increasing environmental pollution and resource wastage, utilizing waste for high-value applications has become crucial. This study explores the preparation of carbon dots (CDs) from blue honeysuckle leaves and their potential in enhancing plant photosynthesis. CDs derived from these leaves have a particle size of ∼2.6 nm and emit blue fluorescence under 365 nm UV light, making them suitable for foliar spraying. When applied, CDs enter leaf cells and impact chloroplasts, significantly improving photosystem II (PSII) performance and Rubisco enzyme activity. At an optimal concentration of 1000 mg/L, PSII electron transfer efficiency and Rubisco activity increased by 29.84% and 208.12%, respectively, boosting net photosynthetic rate by 60.4%. This treatment also enhanced blue honeysuckle yield and fruit quality, with higher levels of soluble solids, ascorbic acid, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and total phenolics. These improvements were linked to increased sucrose synthesis (up 25.99%) and leaf assimilative capacity (up 25%). Additionally, CDs enhanced post-harvest soil enzyme activity and microbial abundance, promoting nutrient cycling and soil utilization. This study demonstrates that preparing CDs from waste blue honeysuckle leaves not only mitigates environmental pollution but also offers a sustainable, high value use for plant resources. The findings highlight the potential of nanomaterials in improving agricultural productivity and provide a novel pathway for waste reuse.
40064349	Distribution and Accumulation Dynamics of Fungicide Azoxystrobin in the Soil-Plant System.	Azoxystrobin is a widely used fungicide belonging to the strobilurin group, primarily employed to control a range of fungal diseases in crops, including pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). As a systemic pesticide, it effectively inhibits mitochondrial respiration in fungi, thereby preventing their growth and spread. However, concerns have emerged regarding its environmental persistence and potential bioaccumulation in soil-plant systems. This study conducted a field study and utilized HPLC-MS/MS for sample analysis, investigating the distribution and accumulation dynamics of azoxystrobin in the soil-plant system, with a focus on its behavior in different soil depths and plant tissues. The results show that pesticide concentration in the shoots remained consistently low throughout the observation period. In contrast, the concentration in roots gradually increased over time, with a peak observed in the top soil around the 10th day (16.56 mg/kg), followed by a rapid decrease to 1.44 mg/kg by the 14th day after application. The pesticide concentration in the subsurface soil remained relatively stable, reaching 0.91 mg/kg by the 35th day. The percentage distribution of pesticides in different parts of the system was as follows: top soil > subsurface soil > roots > shoots. The biological concentration factor (BCF) was greater than 1 during the early and middle-late growth stages, and both the biological accumulation coefficient (BAC) and translocation factor (TF) remained consistently below 1. This study highlights the role of the top soil as a primary pesticide reservoir and suggests limited translocation efficiency from roots to shoots. This pattern of accumulation could have significant implications for environmental health by indicating potential risks of pesticide persistence in the soil, emphasizing the need for further research on optimizing agricultural practices to mitigate pesticide accumulation in the environment.
40064377	The stability and elimination of mammalian enveloped and non-enveloped respiratory viruses in indoor air: Testing using a room-sized aerobiology chamber.	We assessed the viability of aerosolized human betacoronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43; ATCC VR-1558), human rhinovirus-14 (RV-14; ATCC VR-284) and feline calicivirus (FCV; ATCC VR-782) as representative enveloped and non-enveloped respiratory viruses of mammals in indoor air under ambient conditions (relative humidity 50±10% and air temperature 22±2°C) using a room-sized (25 m<sup>3</sup>; 900 ft<sup>3</sup>) aerobiology chamber. All virus suspensions contained a soil load to simulate the presence of body fluids and they were separately aerosolized into the chamber using a six-jet Collison nebulizer. A muffin fan was used to uniformly mix the air inside the chamber and to keep the aerosols airborne. A slit sampler with Petri plates containing 3% (wt./vol) gelatin was used to collect the air samples. The gelatin was liquefied in an incubator and assayed for infectious virus as plaque-forming units (PFU). The rates of biological decay of HCoV-OC43, RV-14 and FCV were 0.0052±0.00026, 0.0034±0.0027 and 0.0081±0.0031 (as log<sub>10</sub> PFU/m<sup>3</sup>/min), respectively. We also assessed a HEPA filter-based stand-alone air purifier against the experimentally aerosolized viruses and the device could demonstrate >3-log<sub>10</sub> reductions in the viability of the three viruses in 46, 62 and 41minutes, respectively. Therefore, we can now investigate the stability of mammalian viruses in indoor air as well as air decontamination technologies against them under field-relevant conditions.
40064405	Molecular and Genomic Investigation Unveils Pseudomonas putida as an Emerging Multidrug-Resistant Pathogen Linked to Bovine Clinical Mastitis.	Pseudomonas putida is one of the emerging pathogens responsible causing mastitis in lactating animals. This study investigated the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), genetic diversity and virulence factor genes (VFGs) to highlight the pathogenic potentials of P. putida strains isolated from milk, feces and farm soil of bovine clinical mastitis (CM). A total of 110 samples were collected and analyzed, revealing an overall prevalence of P. putida in dairy farms at 40.90%, with specific prevalence rates of 42.22% in milk, 26.67% in feces, and 31.11% in farm soil. In vitro antimicrobial assays demonstrated that 76.0% P. putida isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR, resistance to ≥ 3 antibiotics), particularly showing high resistance to oxacillin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and aztreonam. Conversely, P. putida isolates showed the highest susceptibility against imipenem. The genome analysis of three MDR P. putida strains 11CM-M1 (milk), 11CM-F1 (feces) and 11CM-S1 (farm soil), showed a close evolutionary relationship with different strains of Pseudomonas spp. isolated from bovine mastitis milk and feces samples, human stool, and the hospital environment. The assembled genomes of three P. putida strains encoded nine antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), 36 VFGs, and 367 metabolic subsystems, highlighting a complex functional profile and potential for pathogenicity. The detailed analysis of these ARGs and VFGs demonstrated that P. putida strains employ distinct mechanisms of resistance (e.g., efflux pumps), biofilm formation, and virulence factors, including adhesins, secreted toxins, and lipopolysaccharides, which contribute to their pathogenic potential. Given the lack of reports linking P. putida strains to bovine mastitis in Bangladesh, the increasing trend of AMR, along with the presence of significant ARGs and VFGs in the studied strains, underscores the need for more intensive research, including animal model experiment, to better elucidate the pathogenesis and inform treatment decisions for mastitis in dairy animals.

40064517	Microdroplet-Mediated Enzyme Activity Enhancement for Potentiometric Sensing of Peroxidase in Soil.	On-site measurements of enzyme activity in complex solid matrices such as soil and sediment could offer invaluable insights for the soil health evaluation and sustainable management. As such, sensors for on-site measurements of soil enzyme activity are highly required but remain unachieved to date. Herein, a potentiometric sensor for rapid, direct, and in-field analysis of soil enzyme activity is proposed, in which soil particle separation and soil enzyme extraction can be achieved within a single device. More importantly, the enzyme activity mediated by microdroplets can be greatly enhanced for potentiometric measurements. By using a classic soil redox enzyme-peroxidase and an anti-interference substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as a model, the potentiometric sensor enables directly measuring peroxidase activity in the field with a detection limit that can reach as low as 10<sup>-7</sup> U mL<sup>-1</sup> within 5 min. Moreover, the potentiometric sensor was deployed for on-site analysis of the peroxidase activity of <i>Suaeda salsa</i> (L.) Pall. rhizosphere soil under salinity stress, showing excellent sensitivity and anti-interference capability, and retaining promising potential for evaluating the mechanisms and feedback in response to environment stresses.
40064518	Binding Properties of Chemosensory Protein 1 to Plant Volatiles Guiding <i>Nicotiana rustica</i> Recognition in <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>.	<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> is one of the most serious pests attacking tobacco around the world. <i>Nicotiana rustica</i> is widely used as a trap crop in the fields of <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> in China. However, the chemical and molecular bases guiding <i>N. rustica</i> recognition in <i>H. armigera</i> are still unknown. In this study, we found 15 volatiles emitted from <i>N. rustica</i> induced EAG responses of <i>H. armigera</i>, while β-ocimene, α-pinene, and linalool were attractive to the moths in Y-tubes. Oviposition tests showed that <i>H. armigera</i> prefers to lay eggs on tobacco plants treated with β-ocimene and α-pinene. Further assays showed that an antenna-enriched chemosensory protein, HarmCSP1, binds robustly with β-ocimene, benzaldehyde, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. Structural analyses revealed that several key amino acid residues are involved in ligand binding. This study increases the understanding of the chemosensory mechanism of <i>H. armigera</i>'s recognition of <i>N. rustica</i> and provides the foundation for the design of attractants for <i>H. armigera</i> management.
40064531	Role of Chlorella fusca in Promoting Plant Health Through Microbiota Regulation in Strawberry.	Chlorella is a microalgae species known to have plant growth-promoting (PGP) and disease-suppressing effects in crops. However, the mechanism of Chlorella's efficacy on crops remains unclear.
40064553	Study on Differential Metabolite Active Ingredients in Maize Roots Based on Network Pharmacology and Metabolomics Analysis.	Maize is a globally important crop. Roots are the main part of maize and are mainly used for soil improvement and for maintaining crop growth as agricultural waste. Their application scope is relatively small. It is very important to analyze the components in maize roots in order to increase their resource utilization and reduce the burden of waste disposal. Metabolomics shows that maize roots contain various bioactive components, such as alkaloids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, etc. Therefore, this study explores the potential pharmacological effects of maize root metabolites under drought stress from the perspective of metabolomics combined with network pharmacology. The crude extraction of betaine, a metabolite in maize roots under drought stress, was conducted, and the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of the crude extract were evaluated. The experimental results of DPPH, Fenton, etc. indicate that the crude extract of betaine from maize roots has certain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which provides a basis for its potential applications in the fields of medicine and food. The research on extracting medicinal active substances such as betaine from maize roots as agricultural waste not only has economic and environmental advantages but also has important significance in promoting technological progress and public health.
40064671	Effects of Low Concentrations of Hypochloric Acid on the Agricultural Soil Properties.	The oxidant (e.g., hypochlorous acid, HClO) has been widely used to remediate contaminated sites. However, the effects of HClO on soil health in agricultural fields have been rarely explored. Based on the laboratory and field experiments, we found that low concentrations of HClO changed soil bioavailable elements, enzyme activities, and the structure of microbial communities. Specifically, the application of 5‰ HClO increased DOC content by 13.9-19.9% compared with CK. The bioavailable Fe and Mn contents also increased by 15.0% and 48.7%-61.8%, respectively. Correspondingly, in field experiments, 5‰ HClO enhanced the DOC contents by 12.0%. Besides, the application of HClO also elevated enzyme activities and improved the structure of the microbial community of soil. These findings might provide new strategies for improving the fertility and quality of agricultural soil.
40064678	Inherited endurance: deciphering genetic associations of transgenerational and intergenerational heat stress memory in barley.	Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a cornerstone of global cereal crops, is increasingly vulnerable to concurrent heat stress, a critical abiotic factor that is intensified by climate change. This study employed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate "stress memory," a phenomenon where prior stress exposure enhances a plant's response to subsequent stress events. In this study, we analyzed essential agronomic traits, including plant height, spike length, grain number, and thousand-kernel weight, in conjunction with biochemical markers such as chlorophyll content, proline, and soluble proteins. These assessments spanned three successive generations under heat stress, capturing transgenerational and intergenerational effects and uncovering the cumulative impacts of prolonged stress in the third generation. Markedly, our findings highlight the critical influence of heat stress on plant physiology across generational scales, showcasing significant reductions in chlorophyll content, which reflect stress-induced limitations on photosynthetic capacity. In contrast, the observed consistent and substantial increases in proline and soluble protein content across transgenerational, intergenerational, and third-generation stress memory stages underscore their vital roles in stress mitigation and cellular homeostasis. These results provide compelling evidence of generational stress memory, suggesting potential adaptive strategies that plants employ to cope with harsh environmental conditions. Interestingly, identifying significant SNP markers within key genomic regions using GWAS analysis further highlights the potential for harnessing these loci in breeding programs. These results shed light on the intricate mechanisms of barley's stress tolerance and underscore the potential of integrating genomic, epigenomic, and advanced phenotyping tools into breeding programs to develop heat-resilient cultivars.
40064681	Assessment of L-cysteine Reductase Activity as an Indicator of Soil Health in Different Climatic Zones After Pollution by Oil.	The sulfur cycle in the soil regulates many vital processes in plants since it enters the composition of amino acids, vitamins, phytochelatins, and other substances. Soils of different climatic zones have different physicochemical properties and sulfur reserves, which, therefore, stipulates various activities of soil enzymes. The aim of the study was the assessment of L-cysteine reductase activity as an indicator of soil health in different climatic zones after oil pollution: semi-desert types, steppe types and forest types of soils. A model experiment was based on the pollution of 12 types of soil by oil (1%, 5%, and 10%) followed by the determination of the L-cysteine reductase activity in the soils after 30 days from the start of the experiment. The highest activity of L-cysteine ​​reductase in soils contaminated with oil was found in semi-desert (Haplic Solonchaks Aridic, Haplic Kastanozems Chromic) and forest (Luvic Phaeozems Albic and Luvic Stagnosols Dystric (Illuvial-Ferrugenous)) soils. The greatest sensitivity and informative content by oil pollution, assessed by the activity of L-cysteine reductase, were found in Haplic Kastanozems Chromic (semi-desert types of soils), Voronic Chernozems Pachic (ordinary) and Luvic Phaeozems Albic (steppe types of soils) and Luvic Stagnosols Dystric and Luvic Stagnosols Dystric (Illuvial-Ferrugenous) (forest types of soil). The results obtained can be used in diagnosing and assessing the ecological state and health of soils contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons.
40064729	Integrative metabolo-genomics suggests a biosynthetic pathway for tetrangulol in Streptomyces sp. KL110A.	Natural products (NPs) of microbial origin are highly valued for their diverse bioactive properties. Among bacteria, Streptomyces stands out as a prolific source of NPs with applications in medicine and agriculture. Recent advances in metabolomics, and bioinformatics as well as the abundance of genomic data have revolutionized the study of NPs, enabling the rapid connection of biosynthetic pathways and metabolites. However, discovering novel compounds from large pools of genomes and strains is cumbersome. Metabolo-genomics approaches are promising strategies that can save time and resources at initial stages of the natural product discovery pipeline by rapidly linking molecules and their biosynthetic genes. Here, we present genomic characterization and metabolomic profiling of Streptomyces sp. KL110A, a strain isolated from the rainforest soils of Calakmul, Campeche in Mexico. Using genome mining tools and LC-MS/MS metabolomics, we identified and characterized known biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and proposed a biosynthetic mechanism for the biosynthesis of the benz(a)anthraquinone tetrangulol. Our findings underscore the relevance of integrating genomic and metabolomic approaches in elucidating novel biosynthetic pathways, positively contributing to the field of natural product research.
40064739	Metagenomic insights of microbial functions under conventional and conservation agriculture.	Agricultural practices such as conventional (CN) and conservation agriculture (CA) influence the composition and structure of soil microorganisms. We used short reads and genome-resolved metagenomic-based dual sequencing approaches to create a profile of bacterial and archaeal communities in hyperthermic Typic Haplustepts soil after seven years of CA and CN. The most differences in the physico-chemical and biological properties of soil were higher pH, organics carbon, available nitrogen and microbial biomass contents, activities of dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, and arylsulfatase, found in CA soil. The dominant bacterial taxa under both management types were Pseudomonadota (46-48%), Acidobacteriota (12-13%), Planctomycetota (8-10%), Bacteroidota (7-8%), and Actinomycetota (6-7%). Nitrososphaerota (1.1-1.5%) was the predominant archaeal phyla in CA and CN soils. The alpha diversity was 1.5 times higher in CA compared to CN soils. Fourteen high-quality (HQ) metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from both groups. Four HQ metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Pseudomonadota phylum were exclusively recovered from the CA soil. The dominance of this phylum in the CA soil might be correlated with its nutrient richness, as certain classes of Pseudomonadota, such as Alpha, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltaproteobacteria, are known to be copiotrophic. Copiotrophic organisms thrive in nutrient-rich environments, which could explain their prevalence in the CA soil. CAZyme gene analysis showed that Glycoside Hydrolases (GH) and GlycosylTransferases (GT) classes are dominant in the CA group, possibly due to higher substrate availability from the application of crop residues, which provide a rich source of complex carbohydrates. Several biogeochemical gene families related to C1 compounds, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur metabolism were enriched in CA soils, suggesting these practices may contribute to a soil environment with increased organic matter content, microbial diversity, and nutrient availability. Overall, CA practices seemed to improve soil health by supporting soil microbial communities abundance.
40064743	Heavy metal and bacteria contamination of selected wetland ecosystems on the eastern slope of Mount Cameroon: implications for human and ecosystem health.	The wetland ecosystems on Mount Cameroon's eastern slope, known for their agroecological significance and biodiversity, are facing potential threats such as heavy metal and bacterial contamination due to poor waste management systems and anthropogenic activities. A study was conducted to quantify the heavy metals and bacterial loads in Solanum scabrum Mill., Amaranthus cruentus L., and Talinum fruticosum (L.) Juss., three major vegetables grown in the area. Soil and water samples were collected and analysed for the concentrations of 24 elements, including heavy metals, using the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) approach. The bacteria in the samples were isolated and cultured in lactose broth, and the total coliform count was estimated using the maximum probable number (MPN) technique. The heavy metals in both soil and plant samples occurred in the order Mn > Zn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Co > Pb > Fe > Al. The contamination indices of Mn > 5807.3 and Cr > 4698.3 indicated varied sources of these metal contaminants. The bioaccumulation coefficient (BAC) was > 1 for most of the metals, with T. fruticosum having the highest BAC value (3.60) for the leaves. The mean bacteria count indicated high contamination with Enterobacteria (600 coliform forming units (CFU)) and E. coli (500 CFU) in vegetables across all sampling sites. The high concentration of bacterial contaminants in the soil, water, and plants across the study sites indicates a high health risk, making the ecosystem not pristine and thus impossible for these wetlands to improve food security. Consequently, this study provides crucial information for policymakers and stakeholders to develop effective strategies for the conservation and sustainable management of these wetlands.
40064772	Begomovirus Transmission by the Insect Vector, the Whitefly Bemisia tabaci.	Begomoviruses are exclusively transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci in a persistent circulative manner and pose serious threat to the production of important cash crops worldwide. Here, we describe the protocols to study how the whiteflies transmit begomoviruses, including maintenance of whitefly and species identification, preparation of tomato plants infected with virus, acquisition and transmission of virus by whiteflies, dissection of whitefly organs, analysis of virus quantity in whiteflies, immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection of virus in whitefly tissues, membrane feeding of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or antibody and microinjection of dsRNA in whiteflies.
40064774	Transmission of Grabloviruses by Insect Vectors.	Among the three viruses of the genus Grablovirus in the plant virus family Geminiviridae, insect vector transmission is documented only for grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV), for which Spissistilus festinus (Hemiptera: Membracidae), the three-cornered alfalfa hopper, is identified as a vector. Transmission of GRBV by S. festinus is circulative, nonpropagative; it is also transstadial but neither transovarial, nor via seeds. Here, we thoroughly describe the S. festinus-mediated transmission process of GRBV with Vitis species, the natural hosts of the virus, and Phaseolus vulgaris plants, an experimental pseudo-systemic herbaceous host of the virus.
40064783	Full-Length Sequencing of Circular DNA Viruses Using CIDER-Seq.	Full-length viral genome sequencing is key for virus distribution profiling, new virus discovery, and understanding virus populations across different samples. Circular DNA Enrichment Sequencing (CIDER-Seq) allows unbiased enrichment and long-read sequencing of circular DNA viruses. CIDER-Seq produces single-read full-length virus genomes, combining PCR-free enrichment with Single Molecule Real-Time sequencing and de-concatenation algorithm. CIDER-Seq data analysis package, using the DeConcat algorithm, processes PacBio sequencing data into intact circular DNA sequences, generating fully annotated and highly accurate circular DNA virus genome sequences.
40064788	The Mickey Mouse's hand sign in brain MRI points out multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumors in mesial temporal lobe structures.	Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT) is a rarely diagnosed neoplastic lesion often associated with adult-onset focal seizures. In some situations, atypical MRI features of MVNT may mimic other long-term epilepsy associated tumors (LEATs) or diffuse low-grade gliomas. In such a context, the identification of distinct clinical markers is recommended.
40064789	Study on the Effect of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CCFM1066 on Exercise Performance, Gut Microbiota, and Its Metabolites in Mice.	Prolonged high-intensity exercise consumes significant energy, leading to fatigue and decreased performance. This study explores the effects of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CCFM1066 on exercise performance, gut microbiota, and its metabolites in mice. The results of the mouse experiments showed the mice which were intervened by Bifidobacterium adolescentis CCFM1066 have a significant increase in exercise performance, including forceful swimming time, fatigue baton turning time, and forelimb grip strength. Through metagenomic sequencing and differential metabolites, analysis indicated that the intervention of CCFM1066 increased Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Parabacteroides goldsteinii, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis and altered the key metabolic pathways including protein digestion and absorption and biosynthesis of amino acids. Supplementation with CCFM1066 modulates the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and fatty acid amides (FAAs) by gut microbiota, decreasing levels of lactic acid (LA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) while increasing muscle and hepatic glycogen content, thus reducing central nervous system fatigue and thereby improving exercise endurance and performance. These findings provide new insights into nutritional interventions for sports performance.
40064791	Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived exosomes promote skin wound healing through activating FGF2-mediated p38 pathway.	The acute and large area skin healing has been an intractable problem for both clinician and patient. Exosomes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-Exos) have been a novel promising cell-free treatment on skin damage repair. In this study, in vivo skin trauma model of full-layer skin damage on mouse back and in vitro skin-like trauma model of human keratinocytes (HaCaT) scratches were established to investigate the effects of hiPSC-Exos on the acute wound healing, and its potential regulation mechanism would be tried to explore. Our in vivo results showed that hiPSC-Exos labeled with PKH26 could be well taken up by cells in the wound area, and could effectively accelerate acute skin wound healing by inhibiting the mRNA expressions of inflammation factors and chemokines such as Il-1β, Ccl2, Cxcl5, Ccl7 as well as promoting PCNA positive cell ratio. The in vitro data showed that hiPCS-Exos could markedly increase the numbers of EdU positive keratinocytes and expedite keratinocyte migration, which could be reversed by fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) antagonist AZD4547 and p38 inhibitor SB203580. In addition, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) was existent in hiPSC-Exos, and hiPSC-Exos could upregulate the p-p38/p38 level, which could be significantly reversed by AZD4547, but not affect the p-ERK/ERK and p-JNK/JNK levels in wound model tissues and cells. In conclusion, hiPSC-Exos may have the potential to promote wound healing by inhibiting cell inflammation as well as promoting cell proliferation and migration based on inherent FGF-2 targeting to FGFR3 to activate p38 pathway, which may serve as a promising candidate for skin healing.
40064834	Olaparib increases chemosensitivity by upregulating miR-125a-3p in ovarian cancer cells.	Ovarian cancer is associated with the highest mortality rate among all malignant gynecological tumors. PolyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor maintenance therapy is the standard treatment strategy for this type of cancer, and olaparib is a widely used oral PARP inhibitor for tumors with BRCA mutations. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of olaparib in non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer and the potential mechanisms involved.
40064845	Discrete and conserved inflammatory signatures drive thrombosis in different organs after Salmonella infection.	Inflammation-induced thrombosis is a common consequence of bacterial infections, such as those caused by Salmonella Typhimurium (STm). The presentation of multi-organ thrombosis post-infection that develops and resolves with organ-specific kinetics raises significant challenges for its therapeutic control. Here, we identify specific inflammatory events driving thrombosis in the spleens and livers of STm-infected mice. IFN-γ or platelet expression of C-type lectin-like receptor CLEC-2, key drivers of thrombosis in liver, are dispensable for thrombosis in the spleen. Platelets, monocytes, and neutrophils are identified as core constituents of thrombi in both organs. Depleting either neutrophils or monocytic cells abrogates thrombus formation. Neutrophils and monocytes secrete TNF and blocking TNF diminishes both thrombosis and inflammation, which correlates with reduced endothelial expression of E-selectin and leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, inhibiting tissue factor and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 pathways impairs thrombosis in both spleen and liver. Therefore, we identify organ-specific, and shared mechanisms driving thrombosis within a single infection. This may inform on tailoring treatments towards infection-induced inflammation, and single- or multi-organ thrombosis, based on the clinical need.
40064846	Mitochondria are positioned at dendritic branch induction sites, a process requiring rhotekin2 and syndapin I.	Proper neuronal development, function and survival critically rely on mitochondrial functions. Yet, how developing neurons ensure spatiotemporal distribution of mitochondria during expansion of their dendritic arbor remained unclear. We demonstrate the existence of effective mitochondrial positioning and tethering mechanisms during dendritic arborization. We identify rhotekin2 as outer mitochondrial membrane-associated protein that tethers mitochondria to dendritic branch induction sites. Rhotekin2-deficient neurons failed to correctly position mitochondria at these sites and also lacked the reduction in mitochondrial dynamics observed at wild-type nascent dendritic branch sites. Rhotekin2 hereby serves as important anchor for the plasma membrane-binding and membrane curvature-inducing F-BAR protein syndapin I (PACSIN1). Consistently, syndapin I loss-of-function phenocopied the rhotekin2 loss-of-function phenotype in mitochondrial positioning at dendritic branch induction sites. The finding that rhotekin2 deficiency impaired dendritic branch induction and that a syndapin binding-deficient rhotekin2 mutant failed to rescue this phenotype highlighted the physiological importance of rhotekin2 functions for neuronal network formation.
40064848	Liver fibrosis negatively impacts in vivo gene transfer to murine hepatocytes.	Liver fibrosis occurs in several genetic and acquired disease conditions, leading to alterations of the tissue and metabolism, which may adversely affect viral vector-mediated gene therapy. Here, we assessed the impact of liver fibrosis on in vivo gene transfer to hepatocytes mediated by lentiviral vectors or adeno-associated viral vectors. We exploited two chemically induced fibrosis mouse models characterized by tissue damage in different areas of the liver lobule. Moreover, we used Abcb11<sup>-/-</sup> and Agl<sup>-/</sup><sup>-</sup> mice, recapitulating features of inherited cholestasis and glycogen storage disease, as representative models of genetic disorders characterized by liver fibrosis. We report a general negative influence of liver fibrosis on hepatocyte transduction and alteration of the vector distribution within the liver lobule, with different outcomes according to the viral vector used and the state of the liver at the time of vector administration. This study bears implications for future developments and applications of in vivo liver-directed gene therapy.
40064861	Impact of liver fibrosis on AAV-mediated gene transfer to mouse hepatocytes.	Liver fibrosis, characterized by scar tissue accumulation due to liver injury, poses significant barriers to liver-targeted gene therapy. Current clinical trials exclude patients with fibrosis, as intact liver architecture is considered essential for efficient and safe adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)-mediated gene delivery. Here, we show that liver fibrosis reduces the efficiency of hepatocyte transduction by AAV8 vectors across three mouse models with diverse fibrotic patterns. This inefficiency stems primarily from decreased vector uptake by the liver rather than loss of vector genomes due to hepatocyte turnover. Additionally, fibrosis alters blood vector clearance and redistributes AAV particles to extra-hepatic organs, such as spleen, lung, and kidney. At the cellular level, fibrosis decreases AAV genome content in hepatocytes while increasing it in non-parenchymal liver cells and splenic immune cells. Importantly, the capsid variant AAV-KP1 retains transduction efficiency in fibrotic livers, highlighting its potential for expanding gene therapy applications to fibrotic diseases.
40064869	In-depth and high-throughput spatial proteomics for whole-tissue slice profiling by deep learning-facilitated sparse sampling strategy.	Mammalian organs and tissues are composed of heterogeneously distributed cells, which interact with each other and the extracellular matrix surrounding them in a spatially defined way. Therefore, spatially resolved gene expression profiling is crucial for determining the function and phenotypes of these cells. While genome mutations and transcriptome alterations act as drivers of diseases, the proteins that they encode regulate essentially all biological functions and constitute the majority of biomarkers and drug targets for disease diagnostics and treatment. However, unlike transcriptomics, which has a recent explosion in high-throughput spatial technologies with deep coverage, spatial proteomics capable of reaching bulk tissue-level coverage is still rare in the field, due to the non-amplifiable nature of proteins and sensitivity limitation of mass spectrometry (MS). More importantly, due to the limited multiplexing capability of the current proteomics methods, whole-tissue slice mapping with high spatial resolution requires a formidable amount of MS matching time. To achieve spatially resolved, deeply covered proteome mapping for centimeter-sized samples, we developed a sparse sampling strategy for spatial proteomics (S4P) using computationally assisted image reconstruction methods, which is potentially capable of reducing the number of samples by tens to thousands of times depending on the spatial resolution. In this way, we generated the largest spatial proteome to date, mapping more than 9000 proteins in the mouse brain, and discovered potential new regional or cell type markers. Considering its advantage in sensitivity and throughput, we expect that the S4P strategy will be applicable to a wide range of tissues in future studies.
40064874	Berberine-inspired ionizable lipid for self-structure stabilization and brain targeting delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics.	Lipid nanoparticles have shown success in targeting major organs such as the liver, spleen, and lungs, but crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major challenge. Effective brain-targeted delivery systems are essential for advancing gene therapy for neurological diseases but remain limited by low transport efficiency and poor nucleic acid stability. Here, we report a library of ionizable lipids based on the tetrahydroisoquinoline structure of protoberberine alkaloids, designed to improve BBB penetration via dopamine D3 receptor-mediated endocytosis. These nanoparticles offer three key advantages: enhanced brain uptake, improved nucleic acid stability through poly(A) self-assembly, and minimal immunogenicity with inherent neuroprotective properties. In murine models, they demonstrate therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease, glioma, and cryptococcal meningitis. This berberine-inspired delivery system integrates precise receptor targeting with nucleic acid stabilization, offering a promising platform for brain-targeted therapeutics.
40064877	Activation of endogenous full-length utrophin by MyoAAV-UA as a therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.	Activation of endogenous full-length utrophin, a dystrophin homolog, presents an attractive therapeutic strategy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), regardless of mutation types and loci. However, current dCas9-based activators are too large for efficient adeno-associated virus delivery, and the feasibility and durability of such treatments remain unclear. Here, we develop a muscle-targeted utrophin activation system using the compact dCasMINI-VPR system, termed MyoAAV-UA. Systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA in male mdx mice leads to substantial upregulation of utrophin at the sarcolemma, resulting in significant improvements in skeletal muscle function and a slowing of heart function deterioration. These benefits remain observable at six months post-treatment. In male nonhuman primates, systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA increases utrophin expression by twofold in skeletal muscle, with no significant side effects observed. Furthermore, MyoAAV-UA upregulates utrophin and utrophin-glycoprotein complexes in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myotubes from DMD patients. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the potential of MyoAAV-UA as a therapeutic approach for DMD.
40064881	In vivo prime editing rescues photoreceptor degeneration in nonsense mutant retinitis pigmentosa.	The next-generation gene editing tool, prime editing (PE), is adept at correcting point mutations precisely with high editing efficiency and rare off-target events and shows promising therapeutic value in treating hereditary diseases. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common type of inherited retinal dystrophy and is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptors and, consequently, visual decline. To date, effective treatments for RP are lacking. Herein, a PE system is designed to target the PDE6B Y347X mutation in the rd1 mouse strain, a preclinical RP model. We screen and develop the PE system with epegRNA and RT<sup>ΔRnH</sup>, which is delivered via dual-AAV in vivo with an editing efficiency of 26.47 ± 13.35%, with negligible off-target effects confirmed by AID-Seq and PE-tag. Treatment with the PE system in vivo greatly restores PDE6B protein expression and protects rod cells from degeneration. Mouse behavioural experiments also show that compared with no treatment, prime editing inhibits vision deterioration in littermate rd1 mice. This study provides a therapeutic opportunity for the use of PE to correct mutated RPs at the genomic level.
40064887	TET2 deficiency increases the competitive advantage of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells through upregulation of thrombopoietin receptor signaling.	Ten-Eleven Translocation-2 (TET2) mutations drive the expansion of mutant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). However, the precise mechanisms by which TET2 mutations confer a competitive advantage to HSCs remain unclear. Here, through an epigenetic drug screen, we discover that inhibition of disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L), a H3K79 methyltransferase, selectively reduces the fitness of Tet2 knockout (Tet2<sup>KO</sup>) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Mechanistically, we find that TET2 deficiency increases H3K79 dimethylation and expression of Mpl, which encodes the thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R). Correspondingly, TET2 deficiency is associated with a higher proportion of primitive Mpl-expressing (Mpl<sup>+</sup>) cells in the HSC compartment. Importantly, inhibition of Mpl expression or the signaling downstream of TPO-R is sufficient to reduce the competitive advantage of murine and human TET2-deficient HSPCs. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for aberrant TPO-R signaling in TET2 mutation-driven CH and uncover potential therapeutic strategies against this condition.
40064889	Discovery of the widespread site-specific single-stranded nuclease family Ssn.	Site-specific endonucleases that exclusively cut single-stranded DNA have hitherto never been described and constitute a barrier to the development of ssDNA-based technologies. We identify and characterize one such family, from the GIY-YIG superfamily, of widely distributed site-specific single-stranded nucleases (Ssn) exhibiting unique ssDNA cleavage properties. By first comprehensively studying the Ssn homolog from Neisseria meningitidis, we demonstrate that it interacts specifically with a sequence (called NTS) present in hundreds of copies and surrounding important genes in pathogenic Neisseria. In this species, NTS/Ssn interactions modulate natural transformation and thus constitute an additional mechanism shaping genome dynamics. We further identify thousands of Ssn homologs and demonstrate, in vitro, a range of Ssn nuclease specificities for their corresponding sequence. We demonstrate proofs of concept for applications including ssDNA detection and digestion of ssDNA from RCA. This discovery and its applications set the stage for the development of innovative ssDNA-based molecular tools and technologies.
40064891	Suppression of stress granule formation is a vulnerability imposed by mutant p53.	Missense mutations in the TP53 (p53) gene have been linked to malignant progression. However, our in-silico analyses reveal that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with mutant p53 (mutp53) have better overall survival compared to those with p53-null (p53<sup>null</sup>) HCC, unlike other cancer types. Given the historical use of sorafenib (SOR) monotherapy for advanced HCC, we hypothesize that mutp53 increases sensitivity to SOR, a multikinase inhibitor that induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here we show that mutp53 inhibits stress granule (SG) formation by binding to an ER stress sensor, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and a key SG component, GAP SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), contributing to increased sensitivity of SG-competent cells and xenografts to ER stress inducers including SOR. Our study identifies a unique vulnerability imposed by mutp53, suggesting mutp53 as a biomarker for ER stress-inducing agents and highlighting the importance of SG inhibition for cancer treatment.
40064893	Chromosome-level genome assembly of Jaguar guapote (Parachromis manguensis) by massive parallel sequencing.	Parachromis managuensis is a native cichlid fish from Central America and is the most commonly traded species within its genus. This study presents the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of P. managuensis using PacBio HiFi long reads and Hi-C sequencing data. The size of the P. managuensis genome is approximately 896.66 Mb, with a scaffold N50 of 38.19 Mb. The assembled genome demonstrates high quality in terms of completeness and accuracy, with a BUSCO score of 98.85% and a quality value (QV) of 50.95. A total of 888.60 Mb (99.10%) sequences were anchored to 24 pseudochromosomes. Additionally, 21,145 protein-coding genes and 325.58 Mb (~36.31%) repetitive sequences were identified. This chromosome-level genome assembly provides a crucial reference for studying the evolution and ecological adaptability of P. managuensis.
40064895	Magnetically triggered thermoelectric heterojunctions with an efficient magnetic-thermo-electric energy cascade conversion for synergistic cancer therapy.	Thermoelectric therapy has been emerging as a promising and versatile strategy for targeting malignant tumors treatment. However, the lack of effective time-space controlled triggering of thermoelectric effect in vivo limits the application of thermoelectric therapy. Here a magnetically triggered thermoelectric heterojunction (CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, CFO/STO) for synergistic thermoelectric/chemodynamic/immuno-therapy is developed. The efficient magnetothermal nanoagent (CFO) is synthesized using the hydrothermal method, and thermoelectric nanomaterials (STO) are grown on its surface to create the heterojunction. To enhance oral delivery efficiency, a fusion membrane (M) of Staphylococcus aureus and macrophage cell membranes are coated the CFO/STO heterojunction, enabling effective targeting of orthotopic colorectal cancer. Once the CFO/STO@M reaches the tumor region, in vitro alternating magnetic field (AMF) stimulation activates the catalytic treatment through a magnetic-thermo-electric energy cascade conversion effect. Additionally, the immunogenic death of tumor cells, down-regulating vascular endothelial growth factor and heat shock protein HSP70, increasing expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1/VCAM-1), and M1 polarization of macrophages contribute to tumor immunotherapy. Overall, the magnetically triggered thermoelectric heterojunction based on CFO/STO@M shows remarkable antitumor capability in female mice, offering a promising approach to broaden both the scope of application and the effectiveness of catalytic therapy.
40064896	Soil Radon Time Series from the Italian Radon Monitoring Network (IRON).	We share long term, continuous measurements of soil radon emanations in Italy acquired from 2009 to 2021 by the Italian Radon mOnitoring Network (IRON). The radon concentrations were measured at 62 stations and consist of 621 720 single measurements. Employed detectors are both in-house prototypes (LUCAS) and commercial devices (AER by Algade©), suitably calibrated at INGV radionuclide laboratory. In addiction to radon concentration, most stations acquire internal temperature, while a subset of them also record relative humidity. When available, all these data series are provided along with radon time series and consist of 1 320 710 local temperature and humidity data. The presented dataset allows monitoring variations in radon emissions on multiple time scales, using different analysis techniques. Potential investigations include the effect of environmental parameters/conditions on radon emissions, the study of the impact on such emissions of transient signals like those associated with seismic and volcanic preparation processes and fluid migration dynamics as well as analyses of risk for human health, related to prolonged exposure to radon gas accumulated in confined spaces.

40064902	Methane emissions from thermokarst lakes must emphasize the ice-melting impact on the Tibetan Plateau.	Thermokarst lakes, serving as significant sources of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), play a crucial role in affecting the feedback of permafrost carbon cycle to global warming. However, accurately assessing CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from these lakes remains challenging due to limited observations during lake ice melting periods. In this study, by integrating field surveys with machine learning modeling, we offer a comprehensive assessment of present and future CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from thermokarst lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results reveal that the previously underestimated CH<sub>4</sub> release from lake ice bubble and water storage during ice melting periods is 11.2 ± 1.6 Gg C of CH<sub>4</sub>, accounting for 17 ± 4% of the annual total release from lakes. Despite thermokarst lakes cover only 0.2% of the permafrost area, they annually emit 65.5 ± 10.0 Gg C of CH<sub>4</sub>, which offsets 6.4% of the net carbon sink in alpine grasslands on the plateau. Considering the loss of lake ice, the expansion of thermokarst lakes is projected to lead to 1.1-1.2 folds increase in CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by 2100. Our study allows foreseeing future CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from the rapid expanding thermokarst lakes and sheds new lights on processes controlling the carbon-climate feedback in alpine permafrost ecosystems.
40064907	GLEAM4: global land evaporation and soil moisture dataset at 0.1 resolution from 1980 to near present.	Terrestrial evaporation plays a crucial role in modulating climate and water resources. Here, we present a continuous, daily dataset covering 1980-2023 with a 0.1°spatial resolution, produced using the fourth generation of the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). GLEAM4 embraces developments in hybrid modelling, learning evaporative stress from eddy-covariance and sapflow data. It features improved representation of key factors such as interception, atmospheric water demand, soil moisture, and plant access to groundwater. Estimates are inter-compared with existing global evaporation products and validated against in situ measurements, including data from 473 eddy-covariance sites, showing a median correlation of 0.73, root-mean-square error of 0.95 mm d<sup>-1</sup>, and Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.49. Global land evaporation is estimated at 68.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, with 62% attributed to transpiration. Beyond actual evaporation and its components (transpiration, interception loss, soil evaporation, etc.), the dataset also provides soil moisture, potential evaporation, sensible heat flux, and evaporative stress, facilitating a wide range of hydrological, climatic, and ecological studies.
40064910	A Chromosome-level genome assembly of the American bullfrog (Aquarana catesbeiana).	The American bullfrog (Aquarana catesbeiana) is both an economically important aquaculture species and a globally distributed invasive organism with high environmental adaptability. In this study, we present a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly for the species, comprising 13 chromosomes with a total length of 6.32 Gb and a scaffold N50 of 691.8 Mb. Genome completeness was evaluated at 95.5% using BUSCO and 99.9% using Merqury. Repetitive sequences accounted for 79.51% of the genome. Through a combination of RNA-seq, Ab initio and homology-based gene prediction, we identified 32,382 protein-coding genes, with 98.96% of these genes functionally annotated. This chromosome-level assembly provides an important resource for future studies on the evolution, functional genomics and molecular breeding of the American bullfrog.
40064914	DNA lesions can frequently precede DNA:RNA hybrid accumulation.	While DNA:RNA hybrids contribute to multiple genomic transactions, their unscheduled formation is a recognized source of DNA lesions. Here, through a suite of systematic screens, we rather observed that a wide range of yeast mutant situations primarily triggering DNA damage actually leads to hybrid accumulation. Focusing on Okazaki fragment processing, we establish that genic hybrids can actually form as a consequence of replication-born discontinuities such as unprocessed flaps or unligated Okazaki fragments. Strikingly, such "post-lesion" DNA:RNA hybrids neither detectably contribute to genetic instability, nor disturb gene expression, as opposed to "pre-lesion" hybrids formed upon defective mRNA biogenesis, e.g., in THO complex mutants. Post-lesion hybrids similarly arise in distinct genomic instability situations, triggered by pharmacological or genetic manipulation of DNA-dependent processes, both in yeast and human cells. Altogether, our data establish that the accumulation of transcription-born DNA:RNA hybrids can occur as a consequence of various types of natural or pathological DNA lesions, yet do not necessarily aggravate their genotoxicity.
40064915	Comprehensive immunophenotyping reveals distinct tumor microenvironment alterations in anti-PD-1 sensitive and resistant syngeneic mouse model.	The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has revolutionized cancer treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. However, resistance remains a critical challenge. This study aimed to comparatively elucidate immunophenotypic changes in syngeneic mouse models sensitive (MC-38) or resistant (LLC1) to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. In the sensitive MC-38 model, anti-PD-1 therapy increased dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, while decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I/II) and costimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86) was observed on tumor-associated DCs and macrophages. Tumor-infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup>T, CD8<sup>+</sup>T, regulatory T, NK, and NKT cells also significantly increased. Importantly, treatment boosted lymphocyte cytotoxic potential, with perforin identified as a key marker of efficacy. Notably, perforin expression in CD4<sup>+</sup>T and NKT cells strongly negatively correlated with tumor volume. In contrast, the resistant LLC1 model exhibited minimal immunophenotypic changes upon treatment. These findings highlight critical immune modifications induced by anti-PD-1 therapy, particularly the role of perforin, and the DC/MDSC ratio in predicting therapeutic outcomes. This research offers valuable insights into potential predictive biomarkers and informs strategies to overcome resistance, emphasizing the complex interplay between anti-PD-1 treatment and the tumor microenvironment, ultimately aiming to improve immunotherapy response rates.
40064917	The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice.	Fear can be induced either directly through self-experience of aversive events or vicariously by observing conspecifics experiencing such events. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NA) system is crucial in fear responses and cognitive processes. We investigated whether the LC-NA system differentially processes these two types of fear, direct and vicarious in male mice. The results highlighted that the right hemisphere LC→anterior cingulate cortex pathway is uniquely crucial for vicarious fear, while the two inputs to the LC-from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA)-differentially contribute to fear processing. The BNST plays a more targeted role in vicarious fear, and the CeA has a broader influence on fear in general. This underscores the complexity and specialization within the LC-NA system for fear-processing.
40064918	Interleukin-16 enhances anti-tumor immune responses by establishing a Th1 cell-macrophage crosstalk through reprogramming glutamine metabolism in mice.	Overcoming immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for developing novel cancer immunotherapies. Here, we report that IL-16 administration enhances the polarization of T helper 1 (Th1) cells by inhibiting glutamine catabolism through the downregulation of glutaminase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and increases the production of Th1 effector cytokine IFN-γ, thus improving anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, we find that establishing an IL-16-dependent, Th1-dominant TME relies on mast cell-produced histamine and results in the increased expression of the CXCR3 ligands in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), thereby improving the therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Cancer patients exhibit impaired production of IL-16, which correlates with poorer prognosis. Additionally, low IL-16 production is associated with unresponsiveness to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Collectively, our findings provided new insights into the biological function of IL-16, emphasizing its potential clinical significance as a therapeutic approach to augment anti-tumor immunity and sensitize ICB-based cancer immunotherapy.
40064919	Competitive antagonism of KAT7 crotonylation against acetylation affects procentriole formation and colorectal tumorigenesis.	Accurate procentriole formation is critical for centriole duplication. However, the holistic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we show that KAT7 crotonylation, facilitated by the crotonyltransferase hMOF, competes against its acetylation regulated by the deacetylase HDAC2 at the K432 residue upon DNA damage stimulation. This competition diminishes its histone acetyltransferase activity, leading to the inhibition of procentriole formation in colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, the reduction of KAT7 histone acetyltransferase activity by the antagonistic effect of KAT7 crotonylation against its acetylation decreases the gene expression associated with procentriole formation by modulating the enrichment of H3K14ac at their promoters and plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Furthermore, KAT7 crotonylation and acetylation are associated with the prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unidentified role of KAT7 in the regulation of procentriole formation and colorectal tumorigenesis via competitive antagonism of its crotonylation against acetylation.
40064926	Assessment of organophosphate pesticides in soils and vegetables from agricultural areas of Delta Central District, Nigeria.	The application of agrochemicals such as organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) has several benefits in agriculture but also poses great risks to the environment and human well-being. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the concentrations, distribution pattern, relationships, potential risks and sources of OPPs in agricultural soils and vegetables from Delta Central District (DCD) of Nigeria to provide useful information for pollution history, establishment of pollution control measures and risk management. Fourteen OPPs were determined in the soil and vegetables using a gas chromatograph-mass selective detector (GC-MSD). The ∑14 OPPs concentrations varied from 5.29 to 419 ng g<sup>-1</sup> for soil and 0.69 to 130 ng g<sup>-1</sup> for vegetables. On average, pirimiphos methyl (23.8 ng g<sup>-1</sup>) and diazinone (4.74 ng g<sup>-1</sup>) were the dominant OPPs in soils and vegetables respectively. The cumulative ecological risk assessed using the toxicity-exposure-ratio (TER) and risk quotient (RQ) approaches revealed that there was a high risk of OPPs to soil organisms. The increasing order of OPPs toxicity to the soil organisms was chlorpyriphos < fenitrothion < diazinone < pirimiphos methyl while the cumulative human health risk suggested there was adverse non-carcinogenic risk for children but not for adults exposed to OPPs in these agricultural soils and vegetables.
40064932	Enzyme-activating B-cell receptors boost antigen presentation to pathogenic T cells in gluten-sensitive autoimmunity.	Autoantibodies against the enzyme transglutaminase 3 (TG3) are characteristic to the gluten-sensitive skin disorder dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), which is an extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease. We here demonstrate that TG3-specific B cells can activate gluten-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated internalization of TG3-gluten enzyme-substrate complexes. Stereotypic anti-TG3 antibodies using IGHV2-5/IGKV4-1 gene segments enhance the catalytic activity of TG3, and this effect translates into increased gluten presentation to T cells when such antibodies are expressed as BCRs. The crystal structure of TG3 bound to an IGHV2-5/IGKV4-1 Fab shows that antibody binding to a β-sheet in the catalytic core domain causes the enzyme to adopt the active conformation. This mechanism explains the production of stereotypic anti-TG3 autoantibodies in DH and highlights a role for TG3-specific B cells as antigen-presenting cells for gluten-specific T cells. Similar boosting effects of autoreactive BCRs could be relevant for other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.
40064933	Relating the molecular phenotype of ulcerative colitis to the clinical course.	The expanding portfolio of targeted therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC) suggests that a more precise approach to defining disease activity will aid clinical decision-making. This prospective study used genome-wide microarrays to characterize gene expression in biopsies from the most inflamed colon segments from patients with UC and analyzed associations between molecular changes and short-term outcomes while on standard-of-care treatment. We analyzed 141 biopsies-128 biopsies from 112 UC patients and 13 biopsies from eight inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) patients. Endoscopic disease was associated with expression of innate immunity transcripts, e.g. complement factor B (CFB); inflammasome genes (ZBP1 and PIM2); calprotectin (S100A8 and S100A9); and inflammation-, injury-, and innate immunity-associated pathway analysis terms. A cross-validated molecular machine learning classifier trained on the endoscopic Mayo subscore predicted the endoscopic Mayo subscore with area-under-the-curve of 0.85. A molecular calprotectin transcript score showed strong associations with fecal calprotectin and the endoscopic Mayo subscore. Logistic regression models showed that molecular features (e.g. molecular classifier and molecular calprotectin scores) improved the prediction of disease progression over conventional, clinical features alone (e.g. total Mayo score, fecal calprotectin, physician global assessment). The molecular features of UC showed strong correlations with disease activity and permitted development of machine-learning predictive disease classifiers that can be applied to expanded testing in diverse cohorts.
40064934	Neural correlates of reading aloud on the autism spectrum.	Individuals with autism can show intact decoding (i.e., ability to recognize and pronounce written words accurately). However, reading comprehension (i.e., ability to infer meaning from written text) in autistic individuals is often lower than expected based on age or grade level. Having intact decoding skills despite potentially atypical reading comprehension suggests altered reading pathways in autism, particularly when processing semantics (i.e., word meaning). To test for neural differences in word processing between autistic and non-autistic younger adults, we examined behavioral and neural responses to reading aloud words and pronounceable nonsense words (pseudowords). Additionally, we manipulated word imageability, word frequency, and word and pseudoword spelling-sound consistency as probes for different components (i.e., orthography, phonology and semantics) of the reading system. Behaviorally, the autistic group had a greater reduction in reaction time as word imageability increased. Neurally, pseudoword consistency effects, a probe of spelling-sound mappings without semantics, were only observed in the autistic group, where increased consistency was associated with decreased activity in bilateral intraparietal sulcus. Also compared to the non-autistic group, the autistic group showed greater effects of word consistency, where increasing word consistency was associated with increasing activation in the bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus and ventral occipitotemporal cortex. Finally, the autistic group showed stronger effects of pseudoword consistency than the non-autistic group, that is increasing pseudoword consistency was associated with decreasing activation in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex. Together, these results point to differences in how neural resources are used for reading, with more bilateral areas recruited during spelling-sound decoding in autistics to achieve comparable performance to non-autistics.
40064935	Diversity of ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer stem cells attained using selective culture techniques.	Breast cancer stem cells are a promising therapeutic target in cancer. We explored breast cancer stem cell diversity and establish a methodology for selectively culturing breast cancer stem cells. We collected breast cancer tissues from surgical samples of treatment-naïve patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Following isolation, cells were subjected to spheroid culture on non-adherent plates. Of the 57 cases, successful culture was achieved in 48 cases, among which the average ratio of CD44+/CD24- breast cancer cells increased from 13.8% in primary tumors to 61.6% in spheroids. A modest number of spheroid cells successfully engrafted in mice and subsequently re-differentiated within the murine environment, confirming their stemness. ER expression in spheroid cells exhibited negative conversion in 52.1% of cases. The proportion of Twist-, Snail-, and Vimentin-positive cells increased from 43.8%, 12.9%, and 7.7-75.0%, 58.1%, and 37.7%, respectively. ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer stem cells were classified into two groups using DNA microarrays. Gene Ontology analysis unveiled higher expression of immune response-related genes in one group and protein binding-associated genes in the other. We demonstrated stable and selective culture of breast cancer stem cells from patient-derived breast cancer tissue using spheroid cultures.
40064938	Time series analysis of Sentinel 1 A SAR data to retrieve annual rice area maps and long-term dynamics of start of season.	Rice is a vital staple crop globally, and accurate estimation of rice area was crucial for effective agricultural management and food security. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has emerged as a valuable remote sensing tool for rice area estimation due to its ability to penetrate cloud cover and capture backscattered signals from rice fields. The backscatter signature of rice showed a minimum dB value at agronomic flooding indicating the Start of Season (SoS). The parameters viz., the minimum values of -22.03 to -17.69 dB at the start of season, maximum value of -16.10 to -14.20 dB at the peak of season coinciding with heading and corresponding mean increase of 5.07 dB during growing stages were utilized for developing rule-based classification system. Rice area was estimated over the Cauvery Delta Zone of Tamil Nadu, India for the past six years during samba (August-January) season from 2017 to 2023 using Sentinel 1 A Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data. Rice area maps were generated for the region utilizing parameterization with a classification accuracy of 88.5 to 94.5 per cent with a kappa score of 0.77 to 0.87 during the study period. The total classified rice area during samba season in the Cauvery Delta Zone was 508,581 ha, 456,601 ha, 506,844 ha, 511,714 ha, 524,723 ha and 476,586 ha for the years 2017-18 to 2022-23, respectively. The Start of Season (SoS) maps for samba season revealed that the major planting periods for rice were between the second fortnight of September to first fortnight of November in all the years except 2018 when early planting happened during the first fortnight of September due to favorable weather conditions and assured water supply. Near real-time information on rice area, start of season, and progress of planting derived using SAR satellite data will facilitate the development of decision support systems for sustaining the productivity of rice-based ecosystems.
40064941	Chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of pawak croaker (Pennahia pawak).	The diversity of fish coloration is a fascinating scientific question. The pawak croaker (Pennahia pawak) is distinguished by its silver-white colour, setting it apart from other Sciaenidae species. However, the genomic information of this genus remains largely unexplored. This study aims to advance our understanding by assembling and annotating the genome of P. pawak at the chromosome level using multi-platform sequencing data. The assembled genome size of P. pawak is 613.02 Mb, closely matching the estimated size of 570.32 Mb from 21-mer analysis. The assembly features a scaffold N50 of 27.09 Mb, with 24 chromosomes successfully constructed using Hi-C technology, achieving a mounting rate of 99.31%. Genome annotation revealed that 26.20% of the genome consists of repetitive sequences and identified 26,361 protein-coding genes, of which 25,885 have functional annotations. This chromosome-level genome assembly of P. pawak provides valuable resources for comparative genomic studies within the Sciaenidae family and offers foundational data for researchers to understand its unique silver-white pigmentation.

40064954	Precision soil sampling strategy for the delineation of management zones in olive cultivation using unsupervised machine learning methods.	Climate change and environmental degradation pose a significant threat to the global community. Soil management is one of the critical factors for achieving climate neutrality, as plants and soils together currently absorb approximately 30% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by human activities each year. This study focused on delineating soil management zones in olive groves to maintain soil health in complex environmental conditions and minimize adverse effects on the biological systems supported. The results of this study are crucial because they showed the potential of unsupervised machine learning techniques in this setting and important soil characteristics for defining management zones. They might significantly affect applying precision farming techniques and methods in olive groves, providing a possible remedy for the problems caused by climate change. A total of 222 soil samples at a depth of 0-30 cm were collected from three areas in the Region of Western Greece, at a density of 21 × 21 m in each area, and analyzed for physicochemical properties. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to identify the critical soil properties for delineating the management zones. The soil samples were clustered using unsupervised machine learning methods, K-means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. PCA is a method that can help in the selection of critical parameters for the delineation of management zones. Sand (S), Clay (C), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), and total carbonates (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) can delineate management zones in olive cultivation. The management zones and how each field is separated vary depending on the clustering method.
40064955	Integrative single cell transcriptomic analysis reveals 3p deletion associated tumor microenvironment and chemoresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a prevalent and lethal malignancy, with a five-year survival rate of just 50% for cases of locally advanced disease. Chromosomal aberrations, particularly the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p), have been strongly associated with poor prognosis and more aggressive tumor phenotypes. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy. This study aims to elucidate the impact of 3p deletion on the TME, immune cell infiltration, and treatment response in HNSCC, to identify novel therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and bulk transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Pseudo-time trajectory and cell-cell communication analyses were performed with the Monocle and CellChat packages. The Wilcoxon test was used to evaluate the differential gene expression between wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut) groups. Prognostic models were developed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm and Cox regression analyses to find the genes related to survival, with survival analysis conducted via Kaplan-Meier curves. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was employed to investigate pathway dysregulation, and immune cell infiltration was assessed using various immune scoring methodologies to explore the differences immune environment. The Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) database was utilized to predict the potential efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. mRNA and protein expression levels of SPP1 were examined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, while cell proliferation was assessed using the CCK8 assay. The mut group demonstrated significant alterations in cellular composition, characterized by increased endothelial cells and macrophages and decreased fibroblasts and CD8 + T cells, indicative of an immunosuppressive TME. Differential expression analysis revealed downregulation of immune pathways, including antigen processing and presentation, T cell receptor signaling, and B cell receptor signaling pathways in the mut group, along with enhanced metabolic activity in glycolysis and lipid metabolism. The prognostic model identified nine key genes associated with poor survival in HNSCC. The mut group exhibited poorer overall survival and a more immunosuppressive microenvironment compared to the wt group, which correlated with the outcomes observed in high-risk versus low-risk groups. High-risk patients also showed a diminished response to immunotherapy compared to low-risk patients. Additionally, SPP1 emerged as a critical gene associated with chemotherapy resistance and macrophage M2 polarization. This study demonstrates that 3p deletion significantly reshapes the TME, contributing to poor prognosis in HNSCC by fostering an immunosuppressive environment and enhancing chemoresistance. These findings highlight the potential for developing targeted therapies that address the genetic and immunological landscape of HNSCC.
40064960	Impact of drainage on peatland soil environments and greenhouse gas emissions in Northeast China.	Peatlands are vital for global carbon storage, but drainage significantly disrupts their natural carbon cycling. Drainage alters peatland soil environments in complex ways, affecting factors such as water table, soil temperature, organic carbon (SOC), pH, and microbial communities. However, how these factors interact to influence GHG emissions remains unclear. In this study, we compared water table, soil temperature, soil properties, microbial community structure, and GHG emissions across three zones of a peatland in Northeast China undergoing drainage: drained, transition, and natural areas. The average water table in the drained area was significantly lower than in the natural area (from 11.45 cm to -13.47 cm), shifting from waterlogged to unsaturated conditions. Deep soil temperatures in the drained area decreased by 1 ~ 3 °C. The pH of the upper soil layer was higher in the drained area (5.05 ~ 5.29 vs. 4.64 ~ 4.71), while SOC was lower (197.31 ~ 374.75 g/kg vs. 437.05 ~ 512.71 g/kg). Aerobic bacteria (mainly Solibacter) were more abundant in the drained area, while methanogens (mainly hydrogenotrophic) declined significantly. Fungal diversity increased from the natural to drained area with increased negative interactions and enhanced network modularity. Drainage reduced CH<sub>4</sub> emissions but increased CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, resulting in a significant rise in net GHG emissions (8.86 ~ 10.65 vs. 22.27 ~ 24.26 t CO<sub>2</sub>-eq·ha⁻¹·season⁻¹), primarily driven by increased CO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were positively correlated with soil temperature, aerobic bacteria, facultatively anaerobic bacteria and pH, but negatively correlated with water table, anaerobic bacteria, soil moisture and C/N ratio. CH<sub>4</sub> flux was positively correlated with methanogens and water table, but negatively correlated with pH. The effects of drainage were more pronounced near drainage ditches, particularly for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, highlighting the localized impacts of drainage on peatland GHG fluxes.
40064964	Exploring a patient-specific in vitro pipeline for stratification and drug response prediction of microglia-based therapeutics.	The scarcity of effective biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for predicting disease onset and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major challenge. Conventional drug discovery approaches have been unsuccessful in providing efficient interventions due to their 'one-size-fits-all' nature. As an alternative, personalised drug development holds promise to pre-select responders and identifying suitable indicators of drug efficacy. In this exploratory study, we have established a pipeline with the potential to guide patient stratification studies before clinical trials. This pipeline uses 2D and 3D in vitro models of monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (MDMi) from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and matched healthy control (HC) individuals. By profiling cytokine responses in these models using multidimensional analyses, we have observed that the 3D model offers a more defined separation of profiles between individuals based on disease status. While this pilot study focuses on AD and MCI, future investigations incorporating other neurodegenerative disorders will be necessary to validate the pipeline's findings and demonstrate its broader applicability.
40064965	Kallikrein-8 mediates furin-independent Activin-A precursor processing to stimulate tumor growth in melanoma.	Receptor binding of TGF-β and related ligands such as Activin-A requires cleavage of a furin site in their dimeric precursor proteins. Melanoma cells cleave one Activin-A subunit independently of furin and related proprotein convertases, raising questions of how this half-processed intermediate is generated and whether it influences tumor growth. Here, an siRNA library screen for proteases mediating this furin-independent "hemicleavage" identifies kallikrein (Klk)-8. While a KLK8 cleavage site in proActivin-A overlaps with the furin recognition sequence, its exposure is limited and requires prior transient acidification. Therefore, only furin efficiently converts proActivin-A to fully mature form both in tumor cells and in cell-free cleavage assays. Moreover, knockdown of Klk8 in syngeneic melanoma grafts suppresses Activin-A induced tumor growth, demonstrating that cleavage by only furin is not sufficient. Besides elucidating how Activin-A processing is regulated, our findings show that KLK8 holds promise as a target to mitigate Activin-A induced tumor growth.
40064975	Investigating ferroptosis-related genes NFE2L2 in neutrophils for ankylosing spondylitis: therapeutic potential of cassia twigs.	We determined the relationship between ferroptosis and immune cells in ankylosing spondylitis and the role of the Chinese herbal medicine Cassia twigs in treating ankylosing spondylitis. We analyzed clinical data on ankylosing spondylitis, transcriptome data, single-cell sequencing data, and genes related to ferroptosis and Cassia twigs. Clinical variables related to AS were selected through logistic regression analysis of the clinical data combined with machine learning. GSEA and enrichment analysis were performed on genes related to ferroptosis, combined with transcriptome data and drug-related genes, to identify the key genes and drug targets related to AS, as well as, the key immune cells. Then, the single-cell data and cell subtypes were analyzed. Finally, the interconnections between immune cells were analyzed through intercellular communication. Five variables, including neutrophils, were screened for clinical data analysis. The AUC of the experimental group was 0.859 and that of the validation group was 0.807. Ferroptosis gene NFE2L2 was identified as the final drug target of AS; it was upregulated in AS and downregulated in the control group by immunohistochemical verification, both of which were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Neutrophils were divided into two subgroups: high expression of NFE2L2 and low expression of NFE2L2. Through molecular docking, Cassia twigs were found to effectively act on the ferroptosis gene NFE2L2. Neutrophils act as important immune cells in AS. The twigs of the Chinese herb Cassia can treat AS by acting on the protein structure of the ferroptosis gene NFE2L2.
40064976	Protective effects of Rosa roxburghii Tratt. extract against UVB-induced inflammaging through inhibiting the IL-17 pathway.	Chronic inflammation is a critical mechanism contributing to the aging process; however, research specifically addressing chronic inflammation in skin biology remains limited. This study investigates the protective mechanism of Rosa roxburghii Tratt. (RRT) extract against UVB-induced inflammaging. RRT extract effectively reduces the secretion of IL-6, IL-1α, TNF-α, and PGE2 in keratinocytes. Additionally, it attenuates UVB-induced IL-17 pathway activation by downregulating IL-17RA, c-Fos, and c-Jun protein levels, as well as the gene expression of IL-17RA, TRAF6, HSP90, and IKKγ. Co-culturing human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) with inflammatory factors secreted by UVB-exposed keratinocytes reveals that these factors significantly reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby promoting aging in HFF. The anti-inflammaging effects of RRT extract are achieved through the reduction of β-galactosidase activity, targeting of the TGF-β1-Smad2/3 signaling pathway, upregulation of COL1A1 expression, and reduction of senescence-associated secretory phenotype secretion. This study provides a novel perspective and robust scientific foundation for exploring mechanisms of skin aging and potential therapeutic interventions.
40064997	A novel approach for the detection of brain tumor and its classification via independent component analysis.	A brain tumor is regarded as one of the deadliest types of cancer due to its intricate nature.This is why it is important that patients get the best possible diagnosis and treatment options. With the help of machine vision, neurologists can now perform a more accurate and faster diagnosis. There are currently no suitable methods that can be used to perform brain segmentation using image processing recently neural network model is used that it can perform better than other methods. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the model, performing accurate brain segmentation in real images is not feasible. The main objective is to develop a novel method that can be used to analyze brain tumors using a component analysis. The proposed model consists of a deep neural network and an image processing framework. It is divided into various phases, such as the mapping stage, the data augmentation stage, and the tumor discovery stage. The data augmentation stage involves training a CNN to identify the regions of the image that are overlapping with the tumor space marker. The DCNN's predicted performance is compared with the test result. The third stage is focused on training a deep neural system and a SVM. This model was able to achieve a 99% accuracy rate and a sensitivity of 0.973%. It is primarily utilized for identifying brain tumors.
40065001	Constraints of weathering intensity in different climate zones on coal accumulation environment.	There are currently multiple hypotheses regarding coal accumulation models, each with certain limitations in applicability. This article investigates the relationship between modern sedimentation, soil and climate to analyze the distribution of coal across different geological periods, aiming to explain the coal accumulation environment within a unified theoretical framework. The research concludes that the intensity of weathering in various climate zones is a determining factor influencing coal formation, which also affects the distribution of two other climate-sensitive sedimentary deposits - evaporite and bauxite. These three types of sedimentary minerals can be considered as paleoclimatic indicators: cold and humid, warm and dry, and hot and humid. Furthermore, the impact of temperature on the mineralization of organic matter is significantly greater than that of redox conditions; in general, the mineralization of organic matter in high-temperature environments at mid-to-low latitudes exceeds productivity, resulting in low carbon sequestration rates. The conclusion drawn is that the optimal environment for peat or coal enrichment exists in a cold-humid climate zone characterized by low primary productivity, rather than in a tropical zone with high primary productivity. Additionally, the latitudinal shifts of cold temperate climate-controlled coal distribution, and the sediment types in these three climate zones sufficiently constrain coal-forming environments.
40065004	Poly-γ-glutamic acid alleviates slow transit constipation by regulating aquaporin and gut microbes.	Slow transit constipation (STC) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder caused by colon dysfunction. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), an anionic polymer known for its moisture retention, degradability, and food safety, was studied for its effects on loperamide-induced STC in mice. Treatment with γ-PGA for one week significantly increased both defecation frequency and fecal water content, with the high-dose group (10 g/kg/d) restoring fecal water content to 34.23%, outperforming the low- (16.16%) and medium-dose (27.08%) groups and exceeding the positive control, PEG, by 1.35 times. γ-PGA enhanced intestinal peristalsis and reduced the expression of inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, caspase-1, TLR2) and water-electrolyte transport genes (AQP3, AQP4, ENaC-β), while improving the expression of tight junction proteins (Claudin-1, Occludin, ZO-1) damaged by loperamide. Histopathological analyses confirmed γ-PGA's capacity to repair intestinal damage. Additionally, Western Blot analysis indicated reduced AQP3/4 levels in the colon, and molecular docking showed good binding affinity between γ-PGA and AQPs. γ-PGA also positively altered gut microbiota composition. Overall, γ-PGA shows promise in treating STC by modulating aquaporins and gut microbiota.
40065010	EMD missense variant causes X-linked isolated dilated cardiomyopathy with myocardial emerin deficiency.	Pathogenic variants in the EMD gene cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy type 1 (EDMD1), typically presenting with joint contractures and skeletal muscle atrophy, followed by atrial arrhythmias, cardiac conduction defects, and atrial dilatation. Although an association with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been suggested, evidence is currently insufficient to verify the gene-disease association. We investigated the causality of a missense variant, c.23C>G, p.Ser8Trp, in EMD in a large family with a history of DCM and suspected sudden cardiac death (SCD) in males. DCM was diagnosed in six hemizygous males aged 36-50 and detailed phenotyping identified end-stage heart failure, cardiac conduction defects, and ventricular arrhythmias as prominent features. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed late gadolinium enhancement with mixed ischemic and non-ischemic patterns. Muscular dystrophy was absent in all six males, of whom five underwent neuromuscular examination including serum-creatine kinase measurement. Immunohistochemical analysis showed greatly reduced levels of emerin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle samples. The EMD variant c.23C>G co-segregated with DCM, with an estimated LOD score of 3.9 and full-likelihood Bayes factor of >2500:1 in favor of causality. Among the 17 heterozygous females, ages 20-87, one developed DCM at age 72. We concluded that the EMD c.23C>G missense variant is associated with DCM in the absence of muscular dystrophy, thereby providing new evidence of isolated DCM as a distinct cardiac EMD-phenotype, separate from EDMD1. The phenotypic similarities with LMNA-DCM, with a high risk of cardiac conduction defects and ventricular arrhythmias, might warrant early interventions to prevent SCD.
40065011	Building a hereditary cancer program in Colombia: analysis of germline pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants spectrum in a high-risk cohort.	Genetic studies in Latin America have expanded, but further efforts are needed to understand cancer susceptibility genes beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2, especially by characterizing the prevalence and spectrum of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (PVs) in the region. This study aimed to determine the frequency of hereditary cancer syndromes (HCS) in Colombians with solid tumors and to characterize the spectrum of PVs. Using data from the Colombia's largest Institutional Hereditary Cancer Program, we included patients aged ≥18 years with solid tumors who met HCS criteria and were offered genetic testing with a 105-cancer gene panel. We calculated the prevalence of PVs and HCS by cancer type (beyond breast) and gene. For patients with breast cancer, we examined genotype-phenotype correlations with molecular subtypes and stratified positivity rates by different genetic testing criteria. Among 769 patients, we identified 216 PVs in 43 genes in 197 patients (26%). Thirty-three PVs were recurrent. Autosomal HCS was found in 21% (160/769) of patients (159 dominant, one recessive), while 5% (37/769) were heterozygous carriers of PVs in autosomal recessive genes. In 42% (321/769) of the cases, only one or more variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were identified, whereas 33% (251/769) had neither PVs nor VUS detected (negative results). HCS prevalence varied by cancer type (11-26%). The triple-negative subtype and bilateral presentation were strong predictors of inherited breast cancer. Our study reveals a significant presence of PVs among high-risk Colombian patients with solid tumors, underscoring the importance of genetic counseling and testing in the region.
40065017	Egg intake in relation to metabolic health status, serum brain derived neurotrophic factor, and adropin levels in Iranian adults.	There is conflicting information about the association between egg intake and metabolic health status and no previous information on this association was found in Middle Eastern populations. This research aimed to investigate the relationship between egg consumption and metabolic health status in Iranian adults, focusing on the potential involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and adropin. This cross-sectional study was done on a sample of 527 individuals (45.7% female) aged between 20 and 65 years. Participants were selected using a multistage cluster random-sampling method. Dietary intakes of participants were evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Blood samples were collected while the individuals were fasting to assess biochemical markers. Metabolic health status of individuals was assessed based on the criteria established by Wildman. Collecting data on covariates was done using pre-tested procedures. Multivariable-adjusted model revealed a statistically significant association between egg consumption and a decreased odds of metabolically unhealthy (MU) status (OR<sub>T3 vs. T1</sub> = 0.47; 95%CI 0.24-0.92). Also, each tertile increase in egg consumption was significantly associated with decreased odds of MU status (OR = 0.68; 95%CI 0.49-0.96). This association was especially significant among males rather than females. Elevated high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were substantially reduced among individuals with the highest consumption of egg compared to the lowest intake. Additionally, there was a slight inverse association between egg consumption and high blood pressure. There were no relationships between egg intake and having low BDNF, and adropin levels. Increased consumption of egg was associated with a decreased chance of being metabolically unhealthy in Iranian adults, especially in male participants.
40065020	Long-term macular atrophy growth in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: influential factors and role of genetic variants.	This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the long-term growth and associated risk factors of macular atrophy (MA) in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) compounds.
40065021	The effect of MIND diet on sleep status, mental health, and serum level of BDNF in overweight/obese diabetic women with insomnia: a randomized controlled trial.	Insomnia is common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and affects mental health and quality of life. The present study aimed to examine the efficacy of MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet on the anthropometric measurements, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and serum levels of cortisol and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in type 2 diabetic women with insomnia. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 44 type 2 diabetic women with insomnia, aged 30 to 65 years, who were randomly assigned to be under the MIND low-calorie diet (n = 22) or a low-calorie diet (LCD) as the control group (n = 22) for 12 weeks. The above-mentioned variables were assessed at the beginning and the end of intervention. Following the MIND diet for 12 weeks accompanied by the significant decrease of waist circumference and significant improvement of sleep quality, depression, and anxiety compared to the control group. In addition, the MIND diet vs. LCD group exhibited a significant reduction in the cortisol levels and a significant increase in BDNF. This study provides promising evidence of the effectiveness of the MIND diet in improving the sleep quality, mental health, and some related biochemical parameters in diabetic women with insomnia.Trial registration: IRCT20181111041611N8.
40065030	Music tempo modulates emotional states as revealed through EEG insights.	Music can effectively influence human emotions, with different melodies and rhythms eliciting varying emotional responses. Among these, tempo is one of the most important parameters affecting emotions. This study explores the impact of music tempo on emotional states and the associated brain functional networks. A total of 26 participants without any history of neurological or psychiatric disorders and music training took part in the experiment, using classical piano music clips at different tempi (56, 106, 156 bpm) as stimuli. The study was conducted using emotional scales and electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis. The results showed that the valence level of emotions significantly increased with music tempo, while the arousal level exhibited a "V" shape relationship. EEG analysis revealed significant changes in brainwave signals across different frequency bands under different tempi. For instance, slow tempo induced higher Theta and Alpha power in the frontal region, while fast tempo increased Beta and Gamma band power. Moreover, fast tempo enhanced the average connectivity strength in the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, and increased phase synchrony value (PLV) between the frontal and parietal regions. However, slow tempo improves PLV between the occipital and parietal regions. The findings of this study elucidate the effects of music tempo on the brain functional networks related to emotion regulation, providing a theoretical basis for music-assisted diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders. Furthermore, these results suggest potential applications in emotion robotics, emotion-based human-computer interaction, and emotion-based intelligent control.
40065031	Responses of rice plant to multiple abiotic stresses revealed by transcriptome meta-analysis and identification of novel genetic factors.	Plant responses to abiotic stresses have a complex polygenic nature including main and epistatic genetic factors. Several tolerant rice varieties were subjected to drought, salt and cold stresses and their transcriptomic responses were evaluated using affymetrix probe set. Meta-analysis of standardized microarray data was conducted to identify specific and common genes responding to multiple abiotic stresses. 375 and 298 genes were up- and downregulated under drought stress, 281 and 313 genes were up- and downregulated under salt stress, and 1,273 and 2,996 genes were up- and downregulated under cold stress. In addition to many specific genes for each stress condition, common genes were identified for response to drought and salt (n=91), drought and cold (n=121), and salt and cold (n=108), while 14 genes were common for response to all 3 stresses. 12 out of 14 genes were downregulated under the 3 stresses; however, only 2 upregulated genes (including an auxin-responsive protein and a LRR protein) were common among the 3 stresses. One of the common downregulated genes is a non-ABC transporter belonging to proton-dependent oligopeptide transport (POT) family protein which is novel and has a vital role in uptake of nutrients, particularly nitrate, and in recognizing plant defense compounds and hormones. In addition, two other non-ABC transporters (OsAAP7C and OsGT1) were identified which were downregulated under drought, salinity and cold stresses. This finding can explain why and how the uptake of necessary nutrients for growth and development of plants decreases under these oxidative stresses. Another novel downregulated gene under the 3 stresses is a TraB-related protein with vital role for normal mitochondrial function. These results open new insights into genetic engineering and molecular breeding of plants for tolerance to abiotic stresses.
40065034	A study on the causes of viewers' non-continuous following intention in tourism live streaming.	With the advancement of digital technologies, tourism live streaming (TLS) has rapidly gained global popularity due to its real-time and interactive features, showcasing significant marketing potential. However, viewer retention remains a major challenge and a bottleneck for TLS development. This study first defined the concept and dimensions of alternative attractiveness in TLS through qualitative interviews. It then constructs an analytical framework based on the Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) theory. It empirically tests how psychological contract breach, viewer-live streamer social distance, and alternative attractiveness influence viewers' non-continuous following intention (NCFI) in TLS. The findings reveal that these factors significantly impact NCFI. Customer complaining behavior mediates the relationship between psychological contract breach and NCFI, and perceived controllability positively moderates this relationship. This study provides a new theoretical perspective on understanding viewer attrition mechanisms and offers practical suggestions for TLS platforms and streamers to enhance viewer retention.
40065038	Advancing sepsis diagnosis and immunotherapy machine learning-driven identification of stable molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets.	Sepsis represents a significant global health challenge, necessitating early detection and effective treatment for improved outcomes. While traditional inflammatory markers facilitate the diagnosis of sepsis, the aspect of immune suppression remains poorly addressed. This study aimed to identify critical immune-related genes (IIRGs) associated with sepsis through genomic analysis and machine learning techniques, thereby enhancing diagnostic and treatment response predictions. Analyses of two extensive datasets were conducted, identifying significant immune genes using the ESTIMATE algorithm, Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), and five machine learning methods. Prediction models were constructed and validated using six machine learning algorithms, achieving high accuracy (AUC > 0.75). Eleven key IIRGs were identified as active in immune pathways, such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and were significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration in sepsis. Additionally, drug sensitivity analysis indicated that IIRGs correlated with responses to anticancer drugs. These results underscore the potential of these genes in enhancing sepsis diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the imperative for further validation across diverse populations.
40065040	Cloning and expression analysis of RhHsf24 gene in Rose (Rosa hybrida).	Rose (Rosa hybrida) is one of the most important ornamental and perfume industry crops worldwide, both economically and culturally. Abiotic stresses, such as high temperature and salt are crucial factors influencing the quality of roses. In this study, RhHsf24 was isolated from rose (R. hybrida 'Samantha'), which encodes 295 amino acids (aa). Sequence comparison with members of Arabidopsis Hsfs family revealed that this gene is most closely related to AtHsfB1; phylogenetic tree analysis with proteins from other species showed that it clusters with R. rugosa (RrHSF24), Fragaria vesca (FvHSFB1a) and Argentina anserina (AaHSF24), which are the closest relatives and belong to the class B heat shock transcription factors. RhHsf24 was localized in the nucleus. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the gene was expressed in roots, stems, leaves, flowers and buds. Expression analysis of the gene in leaves subjected to various temperatures and durations of heat stress treatment demonstrated that RhHsf24 gene expression is induced by heat stress. Under salt stress, the expression of the RhHsf24 gene generally exhibited a high level of expression with increasing concentration. The above results preliminarily clarified the biological function of RhHsf24, and provide a genetic resource and theoretical reference for the resistance breeding of roses.
40065044	Transcriptome combined with single-cell sequencing explored prognostic markers associated with T cell exhaustion characteristics in head and neck squamous carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) ranks among the most prevalent cancers worldwide, characterized by significant heterogeneity and a complex immune microenvironment. T cell exhaustion is pivotal in the pathogenesis of HNSC, where depleted T cells exhibit reduced proliferative capacity and diminished effector function, facilitating tumor immune escape and subsequent disease progression. A thorough understanding of the primary mechanisms driving T cell depletion within the tumor microenvironment is essential for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches in HNSC, with profound implications for patient outcomes. In this study, a single-cell atlas of HNSC was constructed, enabling an in-depth analysis of T cell heterogeneity. The differentiation trajectory of T cells, transitioning from normal tissue to HNSC, was characterized, revealing a predisposition toward depletion in the C2 T cell subgroup. A subsequent cross-analysis of significantly upregulated differentially expressed genes in the C2 T cell subset identified five characteristics pertinent to T cell C2, which informed the development of a clinical prognostic model. Additionally, maximum half inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values for various pharmacological agents were calculated, leading to the identification of eleven drugs relevant to the risk model, providing an intriguing starting point for further work in personalized cancer treatment. However, certain limitations of this study must be acknowledged. While T cell heterogeneity and differentiation trajectories were mapped, the interrelationships among these subpopulations remain poorly understood. Further research is required to elucidate the specific biological processes and molecular evolutionary mechanisms involved. The insights from this study provide a valuable foundation for future investigations into the molecular mechanisms and immune landscape associated with the progression from normal tissue to malignant squamous cell carcinoma.
40065046	Combination of gut microbiota, proinflammatory cytokine, and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET as potential indicators for predicting breast cancer recurrence.	Breast cancer occurs at a younger age compared to western countries in South Korea. Despite advancements in treatment methods such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the increasing number of patients underscores the importance of improving disease-free survival (DFS). In this study, we evaluated the associations between gut microbiota composition, inflammatory cytokine levels, and breast cancer recurrence in preoperative patients. Additionally, we developed a composite prognostic index by integrating these factors with PET/CT indices and clinical prognostic factors. This study showed that Prevotella abundance was significantly higher in the DFS group than in the recurrence group, and higher Prevotella abundance was associated with lower levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Survival analysis revealed that patients with low Prevotella abundance and high IL-1β levels had a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence. PET markers, such as SUV<sub>tumor</sub>, SUV<sub>VAT</sub>, and SUV<sub>spleen</sub>, were also found to be significant prognostic indicators, with lower values associated with better survival outcomes. An integrated predictive model combining gut microbiota composition, cytokine levels, PET indices, and clinical factors demonstrated superior accuracy (AUC: 0.9025) in predicting breast cancer recurrence compared to individual components.
40065047	Prevalence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and factors influencing successful treatment outcomes among notified cases in South India.	Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant public health issue globally, with extra pulmonary tuberculosis (epTB) accounting for a considerable number of TB cases. This study aims to improve our understanding of epTB epidemiology by evaluating treatment outcomes and identifying factors associated with positive and negative treatment results in epTB patients. A retrospective study was conducted from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019. EpTB and rifampicin-resistant epTB were identified using the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the associated risk factors. Among the 4,526 patients with extra pulmonary tuberculosis, the positivity rate of Mycobacteriuum tuberculosis among the epTB was 16.5%, and the rate of rifampicin-resistant epTB was 4.83%. Most of patients had lymphadenitis TB (n = 348, 38.79%), followed by those with pus (n = 241, 31.95%). Of 746 epTB cases, 679 patients (91.02%) achieved successful treatment outcomes. Of the 36 patients with rifampicin-resistant epTB, 30 (83.3%) exhibited successful treatment outcomes. Tuberculous peritonitis (OR: 1.58), aspirate (OR: 1.59), gastric lavage (OR: 1.45), biopsy (OR: 1.73), Tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) (OR: 1.46), and tissue samples (OR: 3.33) were all significantly associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes. Patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (epTB) aged between 35 and 44 had a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing unsuccessful outcomes (OR = 1.79; 95% CI: 0.74-4.31, p = 0.0912). Additionally, individuals with a history of alcohol use showed a higher likelihood of poor outcomes (OR = 1.90; 95% CI: 0.25-14.42). Moreover, tuberculosis patients who used tobacco also had an increased likelihood of unfavourable treatment outcomes (OR = 2.62; 95% CI: 0.35-19.68).The study indicated that the rate of favourable treatment outcomes among epTB patients surpassed the World Health Organization's target of ≥ 90%. However, a significant number of patients were lost to follow-up during treatment.
40065049	Pseudomonas aeruginosa promoted microbial fuel cells for cytidine acid production wastewater treatment.	Microbial fuel cell (MFC) can convert the chemical energy of organic matter in wastewater into electrical energy with high degradation efficiency. In this study, a type of specialized microorganism, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was screened and added to an MFC to promote the degradation of wastewater generated during the production of cytidine acid while improving the performance of the MFC. The MFC achieved a maximum voltage of 57.7 ± 4.4 mV and a maximum power density of 1.9 ± 0.1 mW/m<sup>2</sup>; moreover, the degradation efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), and phosphate reached 76.3 ± 2.8%, 80.3 ± 3.3%, and 85.3 ± 3.5%, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and metabolomics analysis revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa could effectively degrade organic matter in wastewater. Additionally, the metabolic pathways involved may have been pyrimidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism.
40065050	Anticancer activity of Weizmannia coagulans MZY531on H22 tumor-bearing mice by regulating inflammation, autophagy-dependent apoptosis, and gut microbiota.	Increasing studies have shown that the efficacy of Weizmannia coagulans in treating various cancers. We recently identified W. coagulans MZY531 with potent cell anti-proliferation and exhibiting apoptosis induction activities against the mouse H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line.However, the anti-cancer effect of W. coagulans MZY531 against liver cancer in vivo has not been verified. The objective of this study was to assess the anti-hepatoma effect of W. coagulans MZY531 on H22 tumor-bearing mice and the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that W. coagulans MZY531 reduced the weight and size of the tumor in comparison to the model group. The levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-2 and TNF-α were suppressed by W. coagulans MZY531 administration. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL analyses demonstrated that W. coagulans MZY531 significantly increased the number of cleaved caspase-3 cells and induced apoptosis in tumor tissues. Importantly, W. coagulans MZY531 activated the AMPK/mTOR autophagy-dependent apoptosis pathway, and regulated the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF-6/NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 inflammatory signaling pathways through mechanisms. Additionally, Fecal analysis demonstrated the capacity of W. coagulans MZY531 to remodel the gut microbiota of hepatocellular carcinoma-infected mice. Collectively, this experimental finding suggested that W. coagulans MZY531 exhibited prominent anticancer activities in vivo at least partly via reducing inflammation, inducing autophagy-dependent apoptosis, and regulating gut microbiota in H22 tumor-bearing mice.

40065057	CIRP contributes to multiple organ damage in acute pancreatitis by increasing endothelial permeability.	Acute pancreatitis can lead to systemic inflammation and multiple organ damage. Increased endothelial permeability is a hallmark of systemic inflammation. Several studies have demonstrated that cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) functions as a proinflammatory factor in various diseases. However, its role in endothelial barrier dysfunction during acute pancreatitis remains unknown. To study this, acute pancreatitis was induced by two hourly intraperitoneal injections of 4.0 g/kg L-arginine in wild-type (WT) or CIRP knockout mice. Our results showed that CIRP levels in the pancreas, small intestine, lung, and liver were upregulated at 72 h after the induction of acute pancreatitis in WT mice. CIRP deficiency significantly attenuated tissue injury, edema, and extravasation of Evans blue in the pancreas, small intestine, lung, and liver at 72 h after L-arginine injection. Administration of C23, a specific antagonist of CIRP, at 2 h after the last injection of L-arginine also produced similar protective effects as CIRP knockout in mice. In vitro studies showed that recombinant CIRP caused a significant reduction in transcellular electric resistance in HUVEC monolayers. Immunocytochemical analysis of endothelial cells exposed to CIRP revealed an increased formation of actin stress fibers. VE-cadherin and β-catenin staining showed intercellular gaps were formed in CIRP-stimulated cells. Western blot analysis showed that CIRP induced SRC phosphorylation at TYR416. Exposure to the SRC inhibitor PP2 reduced CIRP-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in HUVEC monolayers. In conclusion, blocking CIRP mitigates acute pancreatitis-induced multiple organ damage by alleviating endothelial hyperpermeability. Targeting CIRP may be a potential therapeutic option for acute pancreatitis.
40065061	Activation of endogenous retroviruses characterizes the maternal-fetal interface in the BTBR mouse model of autism spectrum disorder.	Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic elements derived from a process of germline infection by exogenous retroviruses. Some ERVs have been co-opted for physiological functions, and their activation has been associated with complex diseases, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have already demonstrated an abnormal expression of ERVs in the BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD during intrauterine life till adulthood. Thus, starting from the assumptions that ERVs may contribute to the derailment of neurodevelopment and that ASD has fetal origins as a consequence of adverse intrauterine conditions, the present study aims to characterize the transcriptional activity of selected ERVs (MusD, IAP, Syn-A, Syn-B, ARC and GLN), LINE-1, inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-10, IL-11 CXCL-1) at the maternal-fetal interface and in dissected embryos from BTBR mice. Our results highlight the deregulation of ERVs and inflammatory mediators at the maternal-fetal interface, and in cephalic and non-cephalic embryonic tissues from BTBR compared to C57BL/6 J. Several correlations among ERV expression levels emerged in different tissues from C57BL/6 J mice while, in BTBR mice, no correlations were found, suggesting that in this model, the acquisition of autistic-like traits might be linked to the dysregulation of ERV activity occurring during intra-uterine life.
40065062	Population genetic structure and historical demography of Saccostrea echinata in the Northern South China sea and Beibu Gulf.	Marine invertebrates, such as oysters, were once thought to form large, panmictic populations with little genetic differentiation due to their high reproductive capacity and dual life stages. However, recent studies have shown significant genetic structuring and moderate gene flow across populations, influenced by factors like ocean currents, historical climate events, and environmental changes. The black-lip oyster (Saccostrea echinata), with its extensive dispersal potential, is ideal for population genetics studies. In current study, mitochondrial DNA (COI gene) was utilized to investigate the population structure, genetic diversity, and demographic history of S. echinata in the northern South China Sea (NSCS) and Beibu Gulf. Results revealed high genetic diversity with 82 haplotypes from 190 specimens, a star-shaped haplotype network, and significant genetic differentiation, with most variation occurring within populations. Genetic analysis identified three distinct genetic groups across the sampled regions. Historical demographic analysis indicated population expansion approximately 44-155 Kya after the Last Glacial Maximum. Genetic structure was shaped by historical climatic events causing isolation and secondary contact, as well as contemporary ocean currents influencing gene flow. The study highlights the complex interplay of genetic diversity, population structure, and historical dynamics in S. echinata, with implications for conservation and aquaculture in the Asia-Pacific region.
40065065	The m6A reader IGF2BP3 promotes HCC progression by enhancing MCM10 stability.	Abnormal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications were associated with the occurrence, development, and metastasis of cancer. However, the functions and mechanisms of m6A regulators in cancer remained largely elusive and should be explored. Here, we identified that insulin like growth Factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) was specifically overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, IGF2BP3 promoted HCC cells progression in an m6A-dependent manner, IGF2BP3 silencing significantly inhibited proliferation and migratory ability of tumor cells in vitro and in in vivo. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 interacted with minichromosomal maintenance complex component (MCM10) mRNAs to prolong stability of m6A-modified RNA. Therefore, our findings indicated that m6A reader IGF2BP3 contributed to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis, providing a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.
40065071	MicroRNA 320a-3p up-regulation reduces PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer cells: an experimental and bioinformatic study.	Growing evidence suggests that dysregulated microRNAs were critical in the development of tumors and the progression number of malignancies. This research aimed to check the effect of microRNA 320a-3p transfection on gastric cancer (GC) cell lines. Following transfection, the efficacy was determined by the RT-PCR method. After that, MTT, scratch assay, DAPI staining, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry were used respectively. The results demonstrated that the viability of GC cells considerably decreased following transfection. Moreover, microRNA 320a-3p transfection significantly suppressed cell migration and induced apoptosis in these cells. We found that transfection of microRNA 320a-3p remarkably decreased PD-L1 gene expression and influenced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related and apoptotic gene expressions. The findings propose that microRNA 320a-3p could decrease cell proliferation and migration and induce apoptosis by increasing TP53 and CASP3 expression levels in GC cells. Notably, microRNA 320a-3p might be a potential target in GC immunotherapy by suppressing the PD-L1 gene expression.
40065072	Subcellular proteomics and iPSC modeling uncover reversible mechanisms of axonal pathology in Alzheimer's disease.	Dystrophic neurites (also termed axonal spheroids) are found around amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where they impair axonal electrical conduction, disrupt neural circuits and correlate with AD severity. Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying spheroid formation remain incompletely understood. To address this, we developed a proximity labeling approach to uncover the proteome of spheroids in human postmortem and mouse brains. Additionally, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AD model enabling mechanistic investigation and optical electrophysiology. These complementary approaches revealed the subcellular molecular architecture of spheroids and identified abnormalities in key biological processes, including protein turnover, cytoskeleton dynamics and lipid transport. Notably, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates these processes, was activated in spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylated mTOR levels in spheroids correlated with AD severity in humans. Notably, mTOR inhibition in iPSC-derived neurons and mice ameliorated spheroid pathology. Altogether, our study provides a multidisciplinary toolkit for investigating mechanisms and therapeutic targets for axonal pathology in neurodegeneration.
40065073	Single cell transcriptomic analysis of SGLT2 expression supports an indirect or off-target role for the cardioprotective benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure.	Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), such as empagliflozin, have shown remarkable benefits in reducing cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with heart failure irrespective of diabetes. Because of the magnitude of the benefits and broad application in both heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction, there have been concerted efforts to identify a mechanism for the observed benefits. One hypothesis is that SGLT2i act directly on the heart. Given empagliflozin's high specificity to SGLT2, we reasoned that SGLT2 expression would be a requirement for cells to respond to treatment via the expected drug target. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of SLC5A2, which encodes SGLT2 at the single cell level in multiple datasets from healthy and HF donors, confirming its expression in a subset of kidney epithelial cells but minimal expression in other cell types. This was true irrespective of developmental stage, disease state, sequencing method or depth, and species. Therefore, it is likely that the cardioprotective benefits of SGLT2i cannot be explained by "canonical" interactions with SGLT2.
40065081	Compensatory lymphangiogenesis is required for edema resolution in zebrafish.	Edema, characterized by the accumulation of interstitial fluid, poses significant challenges in various pathological conditions. Lymphangiogenesis is critical in edema clearance, and delayed or inadequate lymphatic responses significantly hinder healing processes. However, real-time observation of dynamic changes in lymphangiogenesis during tissue repair in animal models has been challenging, leaving the mechanisms behind compensatory lymphatic activation for edema clearance largely unexplored. To address this gap, we subjected zebrafish larvae to osmotic stress using hypertonic (375 mOsm/L) and isotonic (37.5 mOsm/L) solutions to induce osmotic imbalance and subsequent edema formation. Intravital imaging of vascular transgenic larvae revealed significant lymphatic vessel remodeling during tissue edema. The observed increase in lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells, alongside the sustained expansion and remodeling of primary lymphatics, indicates active lymphangiogenesis during the recovery phase. We developed a novel method employing translating ribosome affinity purification to analyze the translatome of lymphatic and venous endothelial cells in vivo, which uncovered the upregulation of key pro-lymphangiogenic genes, particularly vegfr2 and vegfr3, during tissue recovery. Inhibition of compensatory lymphangiogenesis impaired edema fluid clearance and tissue recovery. Our findings establish a new model for in vivo live imaging of compensatory lymphangiogenesis and provide a novel approach in investigating lymphatic activation during edema resolution.

40065084	Protein disulfide isomerase is essential for osteoblast differentiation in mice.	Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an oxidoreductase responsible for the formation, reduction and isomerization of disulfide bonds of nascent proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). So far, the role of PDI in bone biology has never been characterized using genetically-modified animal models. In this study we generated osteoblast- specific PDI-deficient mice by crossing PDI-floxed (PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice with Osx-Cre mice. Compared with their littermate control PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, homozygous osteoblast-knockout mice (Osx-Cre/PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup>) were embryonically lethal, but heterozygous knockout mice (Osx-Cre/PDI<sup>fl/wt</sup>) displayed significantly pronounced growth retardation and reduced bone length. Besides, the decreases in bone density, osteoblast and osteoclast numbers, collagen fiber content and bone formation rate were observed in Osx-Cre/PDI<sup>fl/wt</sup> mice. Osteoblast precursors isolated from PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were infected with Cre recombinant adenovirus to produce PDI-deficient osteoblasts, followed by induction of differentiation. Osteoblasts deficient of PDI had decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralizing capacity, and differentiation. Quantitative protein mass spectrometry analysis and immunoblotting showed that PDI deficiency markedly decreased the expression of the α-subunits of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (C-P4H), including P4HA1, P4HA2 and P4HA3. These results demonstrate that PDI plays an essential role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation and is required for the expression of the α-subunit of C-P4H in osteoblasts.
40065098	Surface-mediated bacteriophage defense incurs fitness tradeoffs for interbacterial antagonism.	Bacteria in polymicrobial habitats are constantly exposed to biotic threats from bacteriophages (or "phages"), antagonistic bacteria, and predatory eukaryotes. These antagonistic interactions play crucial roles in shaping the evolution and physiology of bacteria. To survive, bacteria have evolved mechanisms to protect themselves from such attacks, but the fitness costs of resisting one threat and rendering bacteria susceptible to others remain unappreciated. Here, we examined the fitness consequences of phage resistance in Salmonella enterica, revealing that phage-resistant variants exhibited significant fitness loss upon co-culture with competitor bacteria. These phage-resistant strains display varying degrees of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) deficiency and increased susceptibility to contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism, such as the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Utilizing mutational analyses and atomic force microscopy, we show that the long-modal length O-antigen of LPS serves as a protective barrier against T6SS-mediated intoxication. Notably, this competitive disadvantage can also be triggered independently by phages possessing LPS-targeting endoglycosidase in their tail spike proteins, which actively cleave the O-antigen upon infection. Our findings reveal two distinct mechanisms of phage-mediated LPS modifications that modulate interbacterial competition, shedding light on the dynamic microbial interplay within mixed populations.
40065100	Synthesis and antitumor evaluation of amino acid conjugates of monocarbonyl curcumin in hepatocellular carcinoma cell.	Curcumin possesses a variety of pharmacological properties, particularly anticancer activity. However, its clinical utility is limited by its poor water solubility and low bioavailability. To alleviate the problems, our previous research demonstrated that mono-carbonyl curcumin easters can be employed for the development of novel anticancer agents. In this study, further structural optimization was performed and a series of novel amino acid conjugates of mono-carbonyl curcumin H1-H6 were designed, synthesized, and evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies. Compound H1 was found as the most potent derivative (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.66 µM) compared to curcumin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 36.19 µM) by anti-proliferation assay. Subsequently, wound healing, transwell, JC-1 staining, the HepG2 cell xenograft model and H&E staining experiments were performed, and it was found that compound H1 was more effective than curcumin in inhibiting tumor growth. The results of transcriptome sequence, bioinformatics analysis, molecular docking, and western blotting suggested that compound H1 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through the AKT/FOXO1 pathway. Hence, H1 is a promising lead compound with the potential to be developed as a chemotherapy agent for hepatocellular carcinoma.

40065102	A functional single-cell metabolic survey identifies Elovl1 as a target to enhance CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell fitness in solid tumours.	Reprogramming T cell metabolism can improve intratumoural fitness. By performing a CRISPR/Cas9 metabolic survey in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we identified 83 targets and we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to disclose transcriptome changes associated with each metabolic perturbation in the context of pancreatic cancer. This revealed elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 1 (Elovl1) as a metabolic target to sustain effector functions and memory phenotypes in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Accordingly, Elovl1 inactivation in adoptively transferred T cells combined with anti-PD-1 showed therapeutic efficacy in resistant pancreatic and melanoma tumours. The accumulation of saturated long-chain fatty acids in Elovl1-deficient T cells destabilized INSIG1, leading to SREBP2 activation, increased plasma membrane cholesterol and stronger T cell receptor signalling. Elovl1-deficient T cells increased mitochondrial fitness and fatty acid oxidation, thus withstanding the metabolic stress imposed by the tumour microenvironment. Finally, ELOVL1 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with anti-PD-1 response in patients with melanoma. Altogether, Elovl1 targeting synergizes with anti-PD-1 to promote effective T cell responses.
40065106	A nationwide comprehensive genomic profiling and molecular tumor board platform for patients with advanced cancer.	The Belgian Approach for Local Laboratory Extensive Tumor Testing (BALLETT) study assessed the feasibility of using comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in clinical decision-making for patients with advanced cancers. This multi-center study enrolled 872 patients from 12 Belgian hospitals. CGP was performed on tumor tissues using a standardized CGP panel (523 genes) across nine laboratories with success in 93% of patients and a median turnaround time of 29 days. Actionable genomic markers were identified in 81% of patients, substantially higher than the 21% using nationally reimbursed, small panels. A national molecular tumor board (nMTB) recommended treatments for 69% of patients, with 23% receiving matched therapies. Reasons for non-compliance were highly variable across clinical sites. Overall, BALLETT demonstrates the feasibility of implementing decentralized CGP and its potential to identify actionable targets in most patients with advanced cancers. BALLETT reinforces CGP's utility and emphasizes the importance of collaboration, standardization, and addressing implementation challenges.
40065108	Adrenocortical stem cells in health and disease.	The adrenal cortex is the major site of production of steroid hormones, which are essential for life. The normal development and homeostatic renewal of the adrenal cortex depend on capsular stem cells and cortical progenitor cells. These cell populations are highly plastic and support adaptation to physiological demands, injury and disease, linking steroid production and adrenal (organ) homeostasis with systemic endocrine cues and organismal homeostasis. This Review integrates findings from the past decade, outlining the mechanisms that govern the establishment and maintenance of the adrenal stem cell niche under different physiological and pathological conditions. The sophisticated regulation of the stem cell niche by gene regulatory networks, coordinated through paracrine and endocrine signalling, is highlighted in a context-dependent and sex-specific manner. We discuss how dysregulation of this intricate regulatory network is implicated in a wide range of adrenal diseases, and how emerging knowledge from adrenal stem cell research is inspiring the future development of gene-based and cell-based therapeutic strategies.
40065113	Bacterial lysates in modifying sIgA levels in the upper respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients.	A great deal of evidence has accumulated suggesting an important role of mucosal immunity not only in preventing COVID-19 but also in the pathogenesis of this infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in different compartments of the upper respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients in relation to the severity of the disease and treatment with a bacteria-based immunomodulating agent (Immunovac VP4). The titers of sIgA were determined by ELISA in nasal epithelial swabs, pharyngeal swabs, and salivary gland secretions at baseline and on days 14 and 30 of treatment. The levels of nasal, pharyngeal and salivary sIgA were significantly lower in more severe patients (subgroup A) than in less severe patients (subgroup B), p < 0.01. In subgroup A, the patients who received Immunovac VP4 had higher pharyngeal sIgA levels in convalescent period than those who did not receive the therapy p < 0.05. In subgroup B patients, an increase in immunoglobulin levels was observed from baseline to day 14 of treatment whether they received the add-on therapy or not, p < 0.01. On day 30 of treatment, the sIgA levels in the standard treatment group, however, decreased, while the patients receiving the immunomodulating agent maintained high sIgA levels, p < 0.05. Oxygen saturation significantly increased by day 14 in both groups, p < 0.001. However, it was higher in the Immunovac VP4 group than in the standard treatment group, p < 0.01. Thus, addition of a bacterial lysate-based immunomodulating agent to the treatment regimen for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 induces the production of pharyngeal and salivary sIgA. SIgA production is inversely correlated to CRP levels and percentage of lung involvement on CT scan and is directly correlated to SpO<sub>2</sub> levels.
40065116	Biofertilizers containing plant growth promoting rhizobacteria enhance nutrient uptake and improve the growth and yield of chickpea plants in an arid environment.	Integrated nutrient management is anticipated as an environmentally friendly method toward sustainable agricultural development and optimum crop production with reduced environmental impacts. In the present study, the pastel sulfur (SPA), powdered sulfur (SPO), sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB), phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), and potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB) were applied. The experimental treatments included (1) SPA, (2) SPO, (3) SOB, (4) SPA + SOB, (5) SPO + SOB, (6) SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (7) SPO + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (8) SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (9) NFB + PSB + KSB, and (10) control. The result demonstrated that the application of biofertilizers increased soil bacterial population, photosynthetic pigment content, and grain yield. The highest photosynthetic pigments were observed in NFB + PSB + KSB. The greatest nitrogen fixation nodules and active nodules percentage were recorded in SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB. The biofertilizers enhanced the grain, plant, and soil N, P, and K contents compared with the control. The maximum number of pods per plant, biological yield, grain yield, and 100-grain weight were obtained from SPO + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB and SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB. Overall, biofertilizers could be a key strategy to maintain soil quality toward agricultural sustainability.
40065118	Experimental study on gas permeability and radon control performance of red clay covering layer on uranium mill tailings pond.	The decommissioning of uranium mill tailings pond generally employs covering layer to diminish radon exhalation, with soil permeability, thickness, and moisture content being essential considerations in assessing the efficacy of radon reduction. This research uses a proprietary multi-field coupled seepage testing apparatus and a simulated covering layer radon exhalation device to evaluate samples' permeability and radon control effectiveness across different covering layer thicknesses, pressure gradients, and moisture content levels. The findings demonstrate that gas permeability diminishes with increasing covering layer thickness, exhibiting a more pronounced decline at pressures below 0.35 MPa. Moreover, both moisture content and covering layer thickness significantly influence the radon exhalation rate, which decreases nonlinearly with the rise of both variables. A positive link exists between the radon exhalation rate and permeability, aligning with a natural exponential function model.
40065134	Bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria accelerate injury-induced mucosal healing in the colon.	Host-microbiome communication is frequently perturbed in gut pathologies due to microbiome dysbiosis, leading to altered production of bacterial metabolites. Among these, 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids are notably diminished in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Herein, we investigated whether restoration of 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids levels by Clostridium scindens, a human-derived 7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, can reestablish intestinal epithelium homeostasis following colon injury. Gnotobiotic and conventional mice were subjected to chemically-induced experimental colitis following administration of Clostridium scindens. Colonization enhanced the production of 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids and conferred prophylactic and therapeutic protection against colon injury through epithelial regeneration and specification. Computational analysis of human datasets confirmed defects in intestinal cell renewal and differentiation in ulcerative colitis patients while expression of genes involved in those pathways showed a robust positive correlation with 7α-dehydroxylated bile acid levels. Clostridium scindens administration could therefore be a promising biotherapeutic strategy to foster mucosal healing following colon injury by restoring bile acid homeostasis.

40065137	Human neural dynamics of real-world and imagined navigation.	The ability to form episodic memories and later imagine them is integral to the human experience, influencing our recollection of the past and envisioning of the future. While rodent studies suggest the medial temporal lobe, especially the hippocampus, is involved in these functions, its role in human imagination remains uncertain. In human participants, imaginations can be explicitly instructed and reported. Here we investigate hippocampal theta oscillations during real-world and imagined navigation using motion capture and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from individuals with chronically implanted medial temporal lobe electrodes. Our results revealed intermittent theta dynamics, particularly within the hippocampus, encoding spatial information and partitioning navigational routes into linear segments during real-world navigation. During imagined navigation, theta dynamics exhibited similar patterns despite the absence of external cues. A statistical model successfully reconstructed real-world and imagined positions, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human navigation and imagination, with implications for understanding memory in real-world settings.
40065140	Establishment and validation of a simple and accurate qPCR detection method for Haemophilus parasuis.	As an infectious disease that poses a significant threat to the rapidly growing pig breeding industry, the detection of Haemophilus parasuis (HPS) is often compromised by various interfering substances present in the test sample during quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The rapid detection of HPS is important for the isolation of infectious pigs and their treatment. We designed and optimized a rapid qPCR test to detect the INFB gene of HPS in clinical and environmental samples on pig farms. The method was evaluated for its specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, anti-interference capability, and its ability to detect HPS in clinical samples. The results indicated that the method was specific for the detection of HPS when evaluated against pathogens and intestinal probiotics found in pig farms. By using a seven-fold dilution series of the recombinant plasmid DNA in triplicate, it was determined that the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for this method was less than 10 copies/µL. The results of inter-batch and intra-batch repeatability tests showed that the coefficient of variation (CV) was consistently below 1%. Furthermore, the impact of 14 endogenous and exogenous interfering substances on the Ct values detected by the HPS qPCR was found to be less than 5% when compared to the Ct values obtained in the absence of interfering substances. A total of 248 clinical samples were analyzed using the HPS qPCR, commercial kits, and corresponding national standards, yielding positive rates of 9.27%, 6.05%, and 9.27%, respectively. Notably, the positive and negative percent agreement between the detection method developed in this research and the national standard was 100%. These findings demonstrate that the established detection method is suitable for epidemiological research on HPS and for diagnosing clinical samples containing interfering substances, thereby providing essential technical support for the prevention and control of HPS.
40065141	Characteristics stochastic analysis of long and narrow deep excavations under soil spatial variability.	The mechanical properties of soil, resulting from the weathering of rocks through physical and chemical processes, exhibit spatial variability. This variability introduces uncertainties in the design and characteristics of excavation projects. To address these uncertainties caused by soil spatial variability, safety factors are commonly used in excavation design. However, using the same safety factor for different indicators of soil spatial variability is illogical. Therefore, specialized research on the characteristics of deep excavations in the context of soil spatial variability is necessary, as it provides the theoretical basis for rational excavation design. In this study, we assumed that soil parameters follow a lognormal distribution, while spatial correlation adheres to a Gaussian function. We developed a random finite element algorithm for deep excavations, which incorporated Python programming and the ABAQUS computational platform. This algorithm was created within the framework of random field theory and Monte Carlo simulation. The results of our study indicate that, influenced by soil spatial variability, the lateral wall movements and ground surface settlements exhibit discrete distributions near the deterministic results. The maximum deformation of the excavation follows a normal distribution, while the pattern of ground surface settlements demonstrates diversity and chaotic characteristics. The extent to which soil spatial variability affects deep excavations is correlated with indicators of this variability. As the coefficient of soil spatial variability increases, the diversity and chaotic characteristics of ground surface settlements become more prominent. The locations of maximum ground surface settlement and maximum deformation becomes more scattered. Consequently, the probability of excavation failure increases, and the reliability index of the excavation decreases. In summary, soil spatial variability significantly impacts deformation prediction and safety control during the design and construction stages of deep excavations. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the influence of soil spatial variability when designing deep excavations, based on the variability indicators.
40065144	N,N-dimethylacetamide blocks inflammation-induced preterm birth and remediates maternal systemic immune responses.	The common excipient, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), prevents imminent endotoxin-induced preterm birth in mice. The present study hypothesized that DMA forestalls preterm birth to term (defined as day 18.5 or later) by attenuating bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal systemic inflammatory responses and cervix remodeling. Accordingly, LPS (i.p.) on day 15 postbreeding stimulated preterm delivery within 24 h while mice treated with DMA 2 h preceding and 9 h following LPS administration remained pregnant, comparable to saline and DMA controls, to deliver viable pups at term. Irrespective of LPS or DMA + LPS treatment, maternal plasma pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines on day 15.5 (12 h post-LPS) increased tenfold compared to baseline concentrations in controls. On day 16 of pregnancy, plasma concentrations of G-CSF and TNFα were statistically significantly reduced in the prepartum LPS + DMA group compared to those in postpartum mice given LPS. By day 18 of pregnancy, all cytokines returned to baseline-equivalent to low systemic levels throughout the study in saline and DMA controls that gave birth at term. In addition, maternal plasma progesterone declined within 12 h in prepartum LPS-treated mice to postpartum concentrations on day 16. Although a similar transient decrease occurred by 12 h in DMA + LPS mice, plasma progesterone returned to baseline concentrations in controls. Contemporaneously, the progression of prepartum cervix remodeling leading to preterm delivery was acutely forestalled by DMA without impeding birth at term. These findings support the hypothesis that DMA not only prevents inflammation-driven preterm birth, but rescues pregnancy for birth to occur at term. The results raise the possibility that maternal signals can forecast risk of preterm birth while selective suppression of systemic inflammation can mitigate adverse pregnancy outcomes.
40065145	PRDM16 deficiency promotes podocyte injury by impairing insulin receptor signaling.	Impaired glucose uptake regulated by suppressed insulin receptor signaling is a key driving force of podocytopathies. The identification of potential therapeutic targets that mediate podocyte insulin receptor signaling holds significant clinical importance. Here, we observed a substantial reduction in PR domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) expression within damaged podocytes in both humans and mice. Podocyte-specific Prdm16 deletion aggravated podocyte injury, albuminuria, and glomerulosclerosis in diabetic nephropathy (DN) mice. Conversely, exogenous PRDM16 delivered by lentivirus mitigated these pathological changes in DN mice and adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that loss of PRDM16 blocked glucose uptake of podocytes by inhibiting insulin receptor signaling. Mechanistically, PRDM16 deficiency downregulated the transcription of NEDD4L, subsequently enhancing the stability of IKKβ protein. The accumulation of IKKβ caused by the loss of PRDM16 led to the phosphorylation of serine residues on insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), thereby promoting IRS-1 degradation. Exogenous NEDD4L mitigated podocyte injury induced by PRDM16 knockdown in vitro and attenuated ADR nephropathy in vivo. Our study clarified the role and mechanism of PRDM16 in insulin receptor signaling and podocyte injury, providing a potential therapeutic target for podocytopathies.
40065146	Mitochondrial genetics, signalling and stress responses.	Mitochondria are multifaceted organelles with crucial roles in energy generation, cellular signalling and a range of synthesis pathways. The study of mitochondrial biology is complicated by its own small genome, which is matrilineally inherited and not subject to recombination, and present in multiple, possibly different, copies. Recent methodological developments have enabled the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in large-scale cohorts and highlight the far-reaching impact of mitochondrial genetic variation. Genome-editing techniques have been adapted to target mtDNA, further propelling the functional analysis of mitochondrial genes. Mitochondria are finely tuned signalling hubs, a concept that has been expanded by advances in methodologies for studying the function of mitochondrial proteins and protein complexes. Mitochondrial respiratory complexes are of dual genetic origin, requiring close coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear gene-expression systems (transcription and translation) for proper assembly and function, and recent findings highlight the importance of the mitochondria in this bidirectional signalling.
40065148	Comparison of diagnostic tests for chronic endometritis and endometrial dysbiosis in recurrent implantation failure: Impact on pregnancy outcomes.	Chronic endometritis (CE) and endometrial dysbiosis (ED) are major causes of recurrent implantation failure (RIF). CE is diagnosed via hysteroscopy or the endometrial CD138 test; ED is examined using endometrial microbiome testing with next-generation sequencing. ED is characterized by a reduction in Lactobacillus species. However, correlations between the results of the three tests and the efficacy of treatment against CE and ED in pregnancy outcomes remain unclear. We analyzed 73 patients with RIF who underwent all three tests (hysteroscopy, endometrial CD138 test, and endometrial microbiome test). Patients with CE received antibiotics, whereas those with ED received antibiotics and vaginal Lactobacillus probiotics. The incidences of CE diagnosed using hysteroscopy and the CD138 test were 56.2 and 49.3%, respectively, and the prevalence of ED was 53.4%. No correlations were observed among the test-positive individuals in these three tests. Among patients with ED, 88.9% had a post-treatment clinical pregnancy, a significantly higher rate than that in patients without ED (p = 0.021). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ED was associated with clinical pregnancy (odds ratio (OR): 6.29, p = 0.031). In conclusion, the three tests detected different populations of patients with RIF. ED diagnosed using the endometrial microbiome test was associated with favorable pregnancy outcomes after testing.

40065153	Integrating model systems and genomic insights to decipher mechanisms of cancer metastasis.	Deciphering metastatic processes is crucial for understanding cancer progression and potential treatment options. Genetic studies of model systems engineered to mimic metastatic disease, including organoids, genetically engineered mice and human cell lines, have had an important role in shaping our understanding of the metastatic cascade and how it can be manipulated. More recently, advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled human metastases to be studied at single-cell and single-nucleotide resolution, providing insights into metastatic evolution and phenotypes of both cancer cells and immune cells. However, human tissue studies are often correlative and descriptive, whereas experimental models are reductionistic by nature, meaning that individual results should be interpreted with caution. Crucially, these seemingly disparate branches of metastasis research can and should complement each other to strengthen and validate findings. Here we explore the synergies between model systems and sequencing studies and outline key areas that must be explored to improve our understanding of the metastatic process.

40065168	Selection for somatic escape variants in SERPINA1 in the liver of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.	Somatic variants accumulate in non-malignant tissues with age. Functional variants, leading to clonal advantage of hepatocytes, accumulate in the liver of patients with acquired chronic liver disease (CLD). Whether somatic variants are common to CLD from differing etiologies is unknown. We analyzed liver somatic variants in patients with genetic CLD from alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency or hemochromatosis. We show that somatic variants in SERPINA1, the gene encoding A1AT, are strongly selected for in A1AT deficiency, with evidence of convergent evolution. Acquired SERPINA1 variants are clustered at the carboxyl terminus of A1AT, leading to truncation. In vitro and in vivo, C-terminal truncation variants reduce disease-associated Z-A1AT polymer accumulation and disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum, supporting the C-terminal domain swap mechanism. Therefore, somatic escape variants from a deleterious germline variant are selected for in A1AT deficiency, suggesting that functional somatic variants are disease-specific in CLD and point to disease-associated mechanisms.
40065170	LILRB3 genetic variation is associated with kidney transplant failure in African American recipients.	African American (AA) kidney transplant recipients exhibit a higher rate of graft loss compared with other racial and ethnic populations, highlighting the need to identify causative factors. Here, in the Genomics of Chronic Allograft Rejection cohort, pretransplant blood RNA sequencing revealed a cluster of four consecutive missense single-nucelotide polymorphisms (SNPs), within the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B3 (LILRB3) gene, strongly associated with death-censored graft loss. This SNP cluster (named LILRB3-4SNPs) encodes missense mutations at amino acids 617-618 proximal to a SHP1/2 phosphatase-binding immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. The LILRB3-4SNPs cluster is specifically enriched within AA individuals and exhibited a strong association with death-censored graft loss and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline in the AA participants from multiple transplant cohorts. In two large Biobanks (BioMe and All-of-Us), the LILRB3-4SNPs cluster was associated with the early onset of end-stage renal disease and acted synergistically with the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) G1/G2 allele to accelerate disease progression. The SNPs were also linked to multiple immune-related diseases in AA individuals. Last, on multiomics analysis of blood and biopsies, recipients with LILRB3-4SNPs showed enhanced inflammation and monocyte ferroptosis. While larger and prospective studies are needed, our data provide insights on the genetic variation underlying kidney transplant outcomes.
40065171	Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy with laromestrocel in mild Alzheimer's disease: a randomized controlled phase 2a trial.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, severe brain atrophy and neuroinflammation. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline of brain volume and potentially cognitive function. Larger-scale clinical trials of laromestrocel in AD are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05233774 .

40065181	Microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease: mechanisms of disease and therapeutic opportunities.	Perturbations in the intestinal microbiome are strongly linked to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Bacteria, fungi and viruses all make up part of a complex multi-kingdom community colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, often referred to as the gut microbiome. They can exert various effects on the host that can contribute to an inflammatory state. Advances in screening, multiomics and experimental approaches have revealed insights into host-microbiota interactions in IBD and have identified numerous mechanisms through which the microbiota and its metabolites can exert a major influence on the gastrointestinal tract. Looking into the future, the microbiome and microbiota-associated processes will be likely to provide unparalleled opportunities for novel diagnostic, therapeutic and diet-inspired solutions for the management of IBD through harnessing rationally designed microbial communities, powerful bacterial and fungal metabolites, individually or in combination, to foster intestinal health. In this Review, we examine the current understanding of the cross-kingdom gut microbiome in IBD, focusing on bacterial and fungal components and metabolites. We examine therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities, the microbial metabolism, immunity, neuroimmunology and microbiome-inspired interventions to link mechanisms of disease and identify novel research and therapeutic opportunities for IBD.
40065182	miR-708-5p is elevated in bipolar patients and can induce mood disorder-associated behavior in mice.	Mood disorders (MDs) are caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental (GxE) risk factors. However, molecular pathways engaged by GxE risk factors are poorly understood. Using small-RNA sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we show that the bipolar disorder (BD)-associated microRNA miR-708-5p is upregulated in healthy human subjects with a high genetic or environmental predisposition for MDs. miR-708-5p is further upregulated in the hippocampus of rats which underwent juvenile social isolation, a model of early life stress. Hippocampal overexpression of miR-708-5p in adult male mice is sufficient to elicit MD-associated behavioral endophenotypes. We further show that miR-708-5p directly targets Neuronatin (Nnat), an endoplasmic reticulum protein. Restoring Nnat expression in the hippocampus of miR-708-5p-overexpressing mice rescues miR-708-5p-dependent behavioral phenotypes. Finally, miR-708-5p is upregulated in PBMCs from patients diagnosed with MD. Peripheral miR-708-5p expression allows to differentiate male BD patients from patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). In summary, we describe a potential functional role for the miR-708-5p/Nnat pathway in MD etiology and identify miR-708-5p as a potential biomarker for the differential diagnosis of MDs.
40065183	SH3KBP1 promotes skeletal myofiber formation and functionality through ER/SR architecture integrity.	Dynamic changes in the arrangement of myonuclei and the organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum are important determinants of myofiber formation and muscle function. To find factors associated with muscle integrity, we perform an siRNA screen and identify SH3KBP1 as a new factor controlling myoblast fusion, myonuclear positioning, and myotube elongation. We find that the N-terminus of SH3KBP1 binds to dynamin-2 while the C-terminus associates with the endoplasmic reticulum through calnexin, which in turn control myonuclei dynamics and ER integrity, respectively. Additionally, in mature muscle fibers, SH3KBP1 contributes to the formation of triads and modulates the Excitation-Contraction Coupling process efficiency. In Dnm2<sup>R465W/+</sup> mice, a model for centronuclear myopathy (CNM), depletion of Sh3kbp1 expression aggravates CNM-related atrophic phenotypes and impaired autophagic flux in mutant skeletal muscle fiber. Altogether, our results identify SH3KBP1 as a new regulator of myofiber integrity and function.

40065189	Dopamine in the tail of the striatum facilitates avoidance in threat-reward conflicts.	Responding appropriately to potential threats before they materialize is critical to avoiding disastrous outcomes. Here we examine how threat-coping behavior is regulated by the tail of the striatum (TS) and its dopamine input. Mice were presented with a potential threat (a moving object) while pursuing rewards. Initially, the mice failed to obtain rewards but gradually improved in later trials. We found that dopamine in TS promoted avoidance of the threat, even at the expense of reward acquisition. Furthermore, the activity of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons promoted threat avoidance and prediction. In contrast, D2 neurons suppressed threat avoidance and facilitated overcoming the potential threat. Dopamine axon activation in TS not only potentiated the responses of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons to novel sensory stimuli but also boosted them acutely. These results demonstrate that an opponent interaction of D1 and D2 neurons in the TS, modulated by dopamine, dynamically regulates avoidance and overcoming potential threats.
40065195	Evidence for an Asian origin of Sorghum Mosaic Virus Infecting Sugarcane in Louisiana and the Western Hemisphere.	Three viruses causing mosaic-like symptoms in sugarcane and related grasses, namely sorghum mosaic virus (SrMV), sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), and sugarcane streak mosaic virus (SCSMV), have been reported in Louisiana since 1919. In this study, complete genome-coding sequences (9168-9240 nt) were obtained for mosaic viruses from 36 symptomatic leaf samples of cultivated and wild sugarcane and one sample of silver grass. These samples represented historical diseased plants that were collected in Louisiana from the 1940s to the early 2020s. SrMV sequences were obtained from 35 sugarcane samples whereas a SCMV sequence was recovered from one. Miscanthus sinensis mosaic virus (MsiMV) was identified in the silver grass sample. Virus populations of SrMV from the USA and from China differed based on phylogenetic investigations of the complete genome-coding sequence of 59 virus isolates. Recombination events and the greater diversity of SrMV in China suggested that the virus occurring in the USA originated from Asia. All SrMV isolates from the Americas (Argentina, Louisiana, Paraguay, and Texas) also grouped together in a phylogenetic tree based on the coat protein sequence of 683 worldwide virus isolates. These isolates of the Western Hemisphere differed from the isolates from Asia (China, Myanmar, and Vietnam). The isolates of SrMV from the USA, including pathogenic strains H, I, and M, belonged to the same phylogenetic lineage, thus suggesting that the pathogenic variation of the virus needs further investigations and application of strict quarantine measures to avoid further spread of SrMV among sugarcane-producing locations.
40065196	Development of a tetraplex reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay for three carlaviruses and an ilarvirus infecting hop and viral titer quantification in different tissue types.	The hop plant (Humulus lupulus) is an economically important perennial species of plant due to its role in beer production. While the majority of hop production occurs in central Washington State, local production in regions around the United States is gaining popularity due to local micro-breweries wanting to use locally grown hops in their production. In Florida, production has recently increased, and while most hop plants are grown from tissue culture, the development of a cost-effective diagnostic assay for hop viruses is critical to ensure planting material is clean. In this study, a tetraplex RT-dPCR assay was developed for the detection of four common hop viruses; Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), Hop mosaic virus (HMV), Hop latent virus (HLV) and American hop latent virus (AHLV). A synthetic control was generated with corresponding viral sequences inserted in tandem for optimization. Stem, petiole, and leaf tissue sampled from each of three different cultivars with different viral profiles were screened with the tetraplex RT-dPCR assay. Across all tissue types and cultivars, HLV had the highest titer level, followed by HMV and ApMV having the lowest levels. Additionally, there were significant levels of variation among tissue types across cultivars. These data highlight the utility of this assay for detecting viruses in hop tissue and provide a useful diagnostic tool for screening hop plants to confirm they are healthy. This assay will be utilized in vector studies but also integrated into diagnostic services.

We investigated whether these SNPs are associated with prognostic factors and genetic biomarkers of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the Sri Lankan context.
40065205	Building a synthesis-ready research ecosystem: fostering collaboration and open science to accelerate biomedical translation.	In this review article, we provide a comprehensive overview of current practices and challenges associated with research synthesis in preclinical biomedical research. We identify critical barriers and roadblocks that impede effective identification, utilisation, and integration of research findings to inform decision making in research translation. We examine practices at each stage of the research lifecycle, including study design, conduct, and publishing, that can be optimised to facilitate the conduct of timely, accurate, and comprehensive evidence synthesis. These practices are anchored in open science and engaging with the broader research community to ensure evidence is accessible and useful to all stakeholders. We underscore the need for collective action from researchers, synthesis specialists, institutions, publishers and journals, funders, infrastructure providers, and policymakers, who all play a key role in fostering an open, robust and synthesis-ready research environment, for an accelerated trajectory towards integrated biomedical research and translation.

However, whether the efficacy of this new nasal inhalation drug is better than other oral CGRP receptor antagonists remained to be confirmed. Therefore, we designed this network meta-analysis (NMA) to provide a reference for the clinical application of zavegepant.
40065214	Tumor Prognostic Risk Model Related to Monocytes/Macrophages in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Machine Learning and Multi-Omics.	Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are crucial in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and invasion. This study explores monocyte/ macrophage-associated gene expression profiles in HCC, constructs a prognostic model based on these genes, and examines its relationship with drug resistance and immune therapy responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq) data from 10 HCC tissue biopsy samples, totaling 24,597 cells, were obtained from the GEO database to identify monocyte/macrophage-associated genes. A prognostic model was constructed and validated using external datasets and Western blot. Relationships between the model, clinical correlates, drug sensitivity, and immune therapy responses were investigated. From scRNA-seq data, 2,799 monocyte/macrophage marker genes were identified. Using the TCGA dataset, a prognostic model based on the single-gene UQCRH was constructed, stratifying patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on overall survival rates. High-risk group patients showed reduced survival rates and higher UQCRH expression in tumor tissues. Western blot analysis further confirmed the elevated expression of UQCRH in HCC cell lines. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed that high UQCRH expression co-localized with malignant cells in the tumor tissue. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that the high-risk group had lower sensitivity to sorafenib and axitinib. Immune therapy response analysis indicated poorer outcomes in the high-risk group, with more pronounced APC inhibition and a weaker IFN-II response. Clinical indicator analysis showed a positive correlation between high UQCRH expression and tumor invasion. Enrichment analysis of UQCRH and associated molecules indicated involvement in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial electron transport. This study introduces a prognostic model for HCC patients based on monocyte/macrophage marker genes. The single-gene model predicts HCC patient survival and treatment outcomes, identifying high-risk individuals with varying drug sensitivities and immune suppression states.
40065215	Epidemiology and risk factors of fungal pathogens in sepsis: a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study.	The incidence of sepsis with identified fungal pathogens is increasing and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Co-infection with fungal infections in COVID-19 patients is attracting clinical attention.

40065216	Immunization induces inflammation in the mouse heart during spaceflight.	Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA's Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight.
40065221	Using gut microbiota and non-targeted metabolomics techniques to study the effect of xylitol on alleviating DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease in mice.	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a global healthcare issue, with its incidence continuing to rise, but currently there is no complete cure. Xylitol is a widely used sweetener in various foods and beverages, but there is limited research on the effects of xylitol on IBD symptoms.
40065228	SWI/SNF-type complexes-transcription factor interplay: a key regulatory interaction.	ATP-dependent switch/sucrose nonfermenting-type chromatin remodeling complexes (SWI/SNF CRCs) are multiprotein machineries altering chromatin structure, thus controlling the accessibility of genomic DNA to various regulatory proteins including transcription factors (TFs). SWI/SNF CRCs are highly evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes. There are three main subtypes of SWI/SNF CRCs: canonical (cBAF), polybromo (pBAF), and noncanonical (ncBAF) in humans and their functional Arabidopsis counterparts SYD-associated SWI/SNF (SAS), MINU-associated SWI/SNF (MAS), and BRAHMA (BRM)-associated SWI/SNF (BAS). Here, we highlight the importance of interplay between SWI/SNF CRCs and TFs in human and Arabidopsis and summarize recent advances demonstrating their role in controlling important regulatory processes. We discuss possible mechanisms involved in TFs and SWI/SNF CRCs-dependent transcriptional control of gene expression. We indicate that Arabidopsis may serve as a valuable model for the identification of evolutionarily conserved SWI/SNF-TF interactions and postulate that further exploration of the TFs and SWI/SNF CRCs-interplay, especially in the context of the role of particular SWI/SNF CRC subtypes, TF type, as well as cell/tissue and conditions, among others, will help address important questions related to the specificity of SWI/SNF-TF interactions and the sequence of events occurring on their target genes.
40065237	SNPeBoT: a tool for predicting transcription factor allele specific binding.	Mutations in non-coding regulatory regions of DNA may lead to disease through the disruption of transcription factor binding. However, our understanding of binding patterns of transcription factors and the effects that changes to their binding sites have on their action remains limited. To address this issue we trained a Deep learning model to predict the effects of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) on transcription factor binding. Allele specific binding (ASB) data from Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments were paired with high sequence-identity DNA binding Domains assessed in Protein Binding Microarray (PBM) experiments. For each transcription factor a paired DNA binding Domain was selected from which we derived E-score profiles for reference and alternate DNA sequences of ASB events. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to predict whether these profiles were indicative of ASB gain/loss or no change in binding. 18211 E-score profiles from 113 transcription factors were split into train, validation and test data. We compared the performance of the trained model with other available platforms for predicting the effect of SNP on transcription factor binding. Our model demonstrated increased accuracy and ASB recall in comparison to the best scoring benchmark tools.
40065241	Risk factors for rifampicin-susceptible and isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Nanjing.	Globally, Tuberculosis(TB) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly serious, especially the emergence of rifampicin-susceptible and isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis (Hr-TB), which increases the difficulty of treatment and the burden of disease. Therefore, this single-center retrospective cohort study analyzed risk factors of Hr-TB in adult patients with T2DM and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Nanjing to guide clinical practice and improve the long-term prognosis of patients.
40065246	Epigallocatechin -3- gallate mitigates diazinon neurotoxicity via suppression of pro-inflammatory genes and upregulation of antioxidant pathways.	Diazinon is a commonly used organophosphate (OP) insecticide especially in developing countries for the control of insect pests, however, exposure to its toxic impact especially in humans and other non-target species remains an important public health concern. The study aimed to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin -3- gallate (EGCG), abundant in green tea plants on neurobehavioural, biochemical, and pathological changes in the brain of male Wistar rats following exposure to diazinon toxicity. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were acclimatized for seven days and subsequently randomly assigned into six treatment groups as follows: Group I: Control group (0.2 mL distilled water); Group II: Diazinon at 3 mg/kg (1% LD50); Group III: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (50 mg/kg, ~ 2% of LD50); Group IV: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (100 mg/kg, ~ 5% of LD50); Group V: EGCG (50 mg/kg) and Group VI: EGCG (100 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally once daily for 14 days. Neurobehavioural studies, biomarkers of oxidative stress, histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) were performed. Diazinon alone impaired recognition memory, increased oxidative stress markers and altered antioxidant defense in the brain. It upregulated TNF-α and IL-6 genes and repressed GPx 4 gene expressions. It was also associated with increased GFAP, Tau, and α-SN immunoreactivity. Microscopic examination revealed loss of Purkinje and hippocampal cells in brain. Co-treatment with EGCG however improved cognition, lowered oxidative stress markers, improved antioxidant status and suppressed TNF-α and IL-6. In conclusion, findings from this study demonstrated that EGCG offered protection against diazinon-induced neurotoxicity. Hence, natural sources of epigallocatechin -3- gallate such as fruits and vegetables could offer immense benefits by protecting against oxidative stress and inflammation in neurodegenerative disease conditions.Clinical trial number Not applicable.
40065248	Different NGS identification methods of somatic mutation sites in solid tumors impact TMB results.	Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is a predictive biomarker for assessing the response of various tumor types to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). TMB is quantified based on somatic mutations identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) using targeted panel data. This study aimed to investigate whether different NGS methods will affect the results of TMB detection in solid tumors.
40065253	Predicting triage of pediatric patients in the emergency department using machine learning approach.	The efficient performance of an Emergency Department (ED) relies heavily on an effective triage system that prioritizes patients based on the severity of their medical conditions. Traditional triage systems, including those using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS), may involve subjective assessments by healthcare providers, leading to potential inconsistencies and delays in patient care.
40065259	Manganese-Driven Plasmid Nanofibers Formed <i>In Situ</i> for Cancer Gene Delivery and Metalloimmunotherapy.	While nucleic-acid-based cancer vaccines hold therapeutic potential, their limited immunogenicity remains a challenge due in part to the low efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery caused by lysosomal entrapment. In this work, we found that plasmids encoding both an antigen and a STING agonist protein adjuvant can self-assemble into coordination nanofibers, triggered by manganese ions. We developed a strategy to construct a DNA vaccine, termed MnO<sub>2</sub>-OVA-CDA-mem, formed by the coencapsulation of manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>), an antigen-expressing plasmid (encoding ovalbumin, OVA), and an adjuvant enzyme-expressing plasmid (encoding STING agonist, CDA) within dendritic cell (DC) membranes. Upon uptake into acidic lysosomes, Mn<sup>2+</sup> released from MnO<sub>2</sub> triggered the nucleic acids to undergo a morphological change from nanospheres (∼180 nm diameter) to nanofibers (∼1 μm length), resulting in an increase in mechanical strength by about 9-fold and consequently lysosomal membrane disruption. The antigen OVA and adjuvants Mn<sup>2+</sup> and CDA in the cytoplasm triggered strong DC activation and antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell metalloimmune responses, significantly inhibiting the growth of B16-OVA tumors and inducing long-term immune memory. Altogether, MnO<sub>2</sub>-OVA-CDA-mem holds potential as a platform for nucleic acid antigen and adjuvant delivery using an <i>in situ</i> self-assembly strategy in a metal-driven, stimulus-responsive, and programmable manner for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.
40065261	Congenital cytomegalovirus in eastern Uganda: prevalence and outcomes.	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection poses risks to both maternal and neonatal health, however there are limited comprehensive data on congenital CMV in low-resource settings where the virus is widespread, particularly among women of reproductive age. Our research in eastern Uganda aimed to assess the prevalence of congenital CMV and outcomes among infants to inform public health policies and interventions in similar settings, addressing a significant gap in current knowledge.
40065262	The impact and mechanism of neighbourhood social capital on mental health: a cross-sectional survey based on the floating elderly population in China.

40065264	Molecular breeding of pigs in the genome editing era.	To address the increasing demand for high-quality pork protein, it is essential to implement strategies that enhance diets and produce pigs with excellent production traits. Selective breeding and crossbreeding are the primary methods used for genetic improvement in modern agriculture. However, these methods face challenges due to long breeding cycles and the necessity for beneficial genetic variation associated with high-quality traits within the population. This limitation restricts the transfer of desirable alleles across different genera and species. This article systematically reviews past and current research advancements in porcine molecular breeding. It discusses the screening of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) to identify resistance loci in swine and the challenges and future applications of genetically modified pigs.
40065266	Offset analgesia as a marker of dysfunctional pain modulation in episodic and chronic migraine.	The offset analgesia phenomenon refers to the disproportionately large decrease in the perceived pain following a slight decrease in intensity of a noxious heat stimulus. It is considered an expression of the activation of the endogenous pain-modulation system. The main aim of this study was to examine pain processing using the offset analgesia paradigm in subjects with interictal episodic migraine compared to those with non-ictal chronic migraine. Additionally, as secondary outcome measures, we aimed to: (1) explore fluctuations in the endogenous pain modulation system throughout the migraine cycle by including small subgroups of episodic migraine patients in different migraine phases, and (2) compare different subgroups of non-ictal chronic migraine patients with or without medication overuse headache (MOH).
40065269	Tumor protein 53 gene polymorphism, demographic attributes and associated risk factors among liver cancer patients in Calabar, Nigeria.	Mutations in the TP53 gene had been attributed to the development of liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver tumour are liver diseases having high mortality rates in several populations. There is no information on the TP53 gene polymorphism among liver diseases patients in Calabar, Nigeria. This study investigated the genetic polymorphism of TP53 among HCC and liver tumour in Calabar. This research was carried out in the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar. Blood samples were collected from 35 clinically diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma and 10 tumour patients and 10 healthy controls. DNA was extracted from all blood samples and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed using specific primers. The PCR amplicons were digested using Hae III restriction enzyme and the genotypic and allelic frequencies was determined. Demographic data among participants showed that males were 68.9% (31), females (31.1%; 14), sex ratio (2.2: 0.5), mean age was 41.51 ± 2.13 years with an odds ratio of 1.25. The distribution of participants according to marital status were 33(73.3%), 10(22.2%), and 2(4.4%) for married, single, and widowed respectively. The participants were from different extractions with varied representations of Yakurr (22.2%, 10), Efik (20%, 9), Boki (13.3%, 6), Ogoja (13.3%, 6), Annang (8.8%, 4), Ibibio (2.2%, 1) and Igbo (2.2%, 1) and respectively. Approximately, 64.7% (30) of the chronic liver diseases were from the Central and Northern part of Cross River State. The risk factors were HCV infection, HBsAg<sup>+</sup>, alcoholism, smoking, consumption of groundnuts that may have been contaminated with aflatoxin and family history of the disease. PCR product yielded 254 bp and digested PCR product showed homozygous TT mutation (27), heterozygous GT mutation (17) and homozygous GG wild type (1) in cases. The overall TP53 gene mutation frequency was 46.32% (44). The frequency of G allele, T allele, GG, GT and TT were 0.21, 0.79, 0.04, 0.33 and 0.62 respectively among cases, while GG (wild type) was only detected among controls in the study population. The genotypic and allelic frequencies conform to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium meaning that the forces of evolution were not acting on the locus. There were significant differences in the genotypic proportions of the TP53 gene polymorphism among patients and controls. This study on the TP53 gene polymorphism will serve as baseline information on the molecular etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver tumour in Cross River State.
40065282	Use of complement C5-inhibitor eculizumab in patients with infection-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome - a case-series report.	Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (AKI), remains a leading cause of pediatric AKI. The complement system has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and eculizumab (ECZ) was approved as standard of care for its treatment. The two widely characterized forms of infection-associated HUS are Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)-HUS and Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated (SP)-HUS. Extrarenal manifestations such as central nervous system (CNS) involvement occur approximately in 20% of the cases and are accompanied by higher mortality. Abnormalities of the alternative complement pathway may also contribute to the development of both STEC-HUS and SP-HUS, offering a potential treatment option for complement C5 inhibition. Beyond best supportive care as standard therapeutic approach, ECZ has been successfully used in both STEC-HUS and SP-HUS patients. We provide further support that early use of ECZ for infection-associated HUS with severe clinical manifestation and abnormal complement-activation profile may be an effective therapeutic approach.
40065283	A genome-wide association study of methamphetamine use among people with HIV.	Amphetamine-like stimulants are the most used psychostimulants in the world; methamphetamine use is the most prevalent in people with HIV. Prolonged methamphetamine use can cause lasting damage to the heart, gut, and brain, as well as auditory hallucinations and paranoid thinking. However, relatively little is known about methamphetamine use and its genetic contributors.
40065288	Efficacy and safety of medroxyprogesterone acetate on noninvasive ventilation -treated exacerbated COPD patients: a double-blind randomized clinical trial.	In acute exacerbation periods of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), patients may experience hypoxemia or hypercapnia. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and respiratory stimulant drugs are used to treat this condition. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause breathing stimulation and hyperventilation. This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of MPA in hypercapnic exacerbated COPD patients and the possibility of faster weaning of patients from NIV.
40065289	ARMC5 mutations in primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia: a family case report.	Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH) is a rare cause of overt Cushing's syndrome (CS), which usually manifests as bilateral macronodular adrenal nodules and varying levels of cortisol secretion. Previous studies have shown that ARMC5 play a huge role in the occurrence of PBMAH, which may be inherited to family members and lead to more severe clinical symptoms. ARMC5 variants may be associated with meningiomas, which is also illustrated by our report.
40065291	Violence against healthcare workers in Kenya: a cross-sectional sub-analysis of the global vishwas study.	Global concern exists for workplace violence against healthcare workers (HCWs), especially in low and middle-income nations. This violence includes physical, verbal, or sexual abuse and has a significant impact despite initiatives like Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines. We conducted a study in Kenya to address this issue.
40065301	SLC25A35 enhances fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis to promote the carcinogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by upregulating PGC-1α.	Mitochondria dysfunction has been closely linked to a wide spectrum of human cancers, whereas the molecular basis has yet to be fully understood. SLC25A35 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins. However, the role of SLC25A35 in mitochondrial metabolism reprogramming, development and progression in human cancers remains unclear. Here, we found that SLC25A35 markedly reprogramed mitochondrial metabolism, characterized by increased oxygen consumption rate and ATP production and decreased ROS level, via enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Meanwhile, SLC25A35 also enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis characterized by increased mitochondrial mass and DNA content. Mechanistic studies revealed that SLC25A35 facilitated FAO and mitochondrial biogenesis through upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) via increasing acetyl-CoA-mediated acetylation of PGC-1α. Clinically, SLC25A35 was highly expressed in HCC and correlated with adverse patients' survival. Functionally, SLC25A35 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the carcinogenesis in a DEN-induced HCC mice model. Moreover, we found that SLC25A35 upregulation is caused, at least in part, by decreased miR-663a in HCC cells. Together, our results suggest a crucial oncogenic role of SLC25A35 in HCC by reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism and suggest SLC25A35 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
40065304	Prognostic significance of miR-378 in cancers: a meta-analysis.	The prognostic significance of miR-378 in cancers remains controversial. We carried out the meta-analysis to clarify the issue.
40065319	Ginseng exosomes modulate M1/M2 polarisation by activating autophagy and target IKK/IкB/NF-кB to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease.	Exosomes are involved in intercellular communication and regulation of the inflammatory microenvironment. In a previous study, we demonstrated that fresh ginseng exosomes (GEs) alleviated inflammatory bowel disease. However, the precise mechanism by which GEs activate the immune system and subsequently inhibit the formation of intestinal inflammatory microenvironment remains unknown.
40065321	Characterization and genomic analysis of Sharanji: a jumbo bacteriophage of Escherichia coli.	Bacteriophages are the most genetically diverse biological entities in nature. Our current understanding of phage biology primarily stems from studies on a limited number of model bacteriophages. Jumbo phages, characterized by their exceptionally large genomes, are less frequently isolated and studied. Some jumbo phages exhibit remarkable genetic diversity, unique infection mechanisms, and therapeutic potential.
40065324	Lysosomal acidification impairment in astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation.	Astrocytes are a major cell type in the central nervous system (CNS) that play a key role in regulating homeostatic functions, responding to injuries, and maintaining the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes also regulate neuronal functions and survival by modulating myelination and degradation of pathological toxic protein aggregates. Astrocytes have recently been proposed to possess both autophagic activity and active phagocytic capability which largely depend on sufficiently acidified lysosomes for complete degradation of cellular cargos. Defective lysosomal acidification in astrocytes impairs their autophagic and phagocytic functions, resulting in the accumulation of cellular debris, excessive myelin and lipids, and toxic protein aggregates, which ultimately contributes to the propagation of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative pathology. Restoration of lysosomal acidification in impaired astrocytes represent new neuroprotective strategy and therapeutic direction. In this review, we summarize pathogenic factors, including neuroinflammatory signaling, metabolic stressors, myelin and lipid mediated toxicity, and toxic protein aggregates, that contribute to lysosomal acidification impairment and associated autophagic and phagocytic dysfunction in astrocytes. We discuss the role of lysosomal acidification dysfunction in astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation primarily in the context of neurodegenerative diseases along with other brain injuries. We then highlight re-acidification of impaired lysosomes as a therapeutic strategy to restore autophagic and phagocytic functions as well as lysosomal degradative capacity in astrocytes. We conclude by providing future perspectives on the role of astrocytes as phagocytes and their crosstalk with other CNS cells to impart neurodegenerative or neuroprotective effects.
40065328	Extraction of a stromal metastatic gene signature in breast cancer via spatial profiling.	The identification of molecular features characterizing metastatic disease is a critical area of oncology research, as metastatic foci often exhibit distinct biological behaviors compared to primary tumors. While the focus has largely been on the neoplastic cells themselves, the characterization of the associated stroma remains largely underexplored, with significant implications for understanding metastasis.
40065333	Alleviating the emotional burden on families during organ donation requests in neurologic patients declared with brain death: the role of timing and circumstances of death.	Organ donation requests to families often occur during moments of profound grief and create an emotional burden that is compounded by the varying emotional responses to circumstances surrounding death. These responses, in turn, interact with the timing of the request to influence authorization decisions. Understanding the interplay between timing and circumstances of death is crucial for improving authorization rates and addressing the organ donor shortage. The Organ Retrieval and Collection of Health Information for Donation database was used to identify 3,289 potential donors with neurologic mechanisms of brain death. Multivariate logistic regression with interaction between timing and circumstance was used to estimate authorization rates. Results show no significant differences in authorization for requests made within 12 h of death, regardless of circumstance. However, significant differences in authorization were observed between requests made at the time of brain death and those made 12 or more hours later for natural causes, as well as those at 24 or more hours for homicide, motor vehicle accidents, and non-motor vehicle accidents. These findings indicate that the optimal timing for organ donation requests may depend on the emotional intensity of the situation. While quicker requests may be more effective in less emotionally charged cases, extending the time for families to grieve in highly distressing circumstances does not appear to negatively impact authorization rates. Tailoring the timing of donation requests to the circumstances of death, balancing sensitivity with the need for prompt decision-making, could reduce families' emotional burden, ease pressure in decision-making, and help address the shortage of organ donors.
40065336	Modulation of the Epithelial-mesenchymal transition process by Forkhead Box C2 in the repair of airway epithelium after injury.	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regarded as a key process in repair of airway epithelium after injury. Forkhead Box C2 (FOXC2) is a transcription factor involved in EMT process, whether it is involved in repair of bronchial epithelium remains unknown.
40065352	A rapid ecologic analysis, confirmed by a case-control study, identifies class I HLA alleles correlated to the risk of COVID-19.	Several studies suggest that the heterogeneous spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics started on December 2019 could be partially upheld by the prevalence of permissive class I HLA alleles in specific populations. Such HLA alleles are in fact unable to shape an efficient anti-viral immune-response in the hosts or sustain an exaggerated inflammatory T cell mediated response responsible for the COVID-19 disease. We previously reported an ecologic correlation between the risk of COVID-19 spreading across Italy and the germinal expression of permissive HLA-C*01 and -B*44 alleles in specific inter and intraregional populations along the first spreading wave.
40065353	Identification of enterotype for patients with Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and chronic neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, characterized by behavioral and dysexecutive deficits. Its pathogenesis is closely associated with the intestinal flora. This study aimed to explore the enterotypes in AD by identifying key bacteria through machine learning and species co-occurrence network analysis.
40065355	Differential growth and flowering capacity of tulip bulbs and the potential involvement of PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE-BINDING PROTEINS (PEBPs).	Tulipa gesneriana reproduces vegetatively by the development of bulb clusters from axillary meristems in the scales of a mother bulb. While part of the daughter bulbs in a cluster develop into large, flowering bulbs, others stay small and vegetative under the same environmental conditions. This study aims to investigate how these different developmental fates are orchestrated.
40065360	Trans-ancestral rare variant association study with machine learning-based phenotyping for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, rare coding variant studies have been limited by phenotyping challenges and small sample sizes. We test associations of rare and ultra-rare coding variants with proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and MASLD case-control status in 736,010 participants of diverse ancestries from the UK Biobank, All of Us, and BioMe and performed a trans-ancestral meta-analysis. We then developed models to accurately predict PDFF and MASLD status in the UK Biobank and tested associations with these predicted phenotypes to increase statistical power.
40065364	Fidgetin-like 2 knockdown increases acute neuroinflammation and improves recovery in a rat model of spinal cord injury.	Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause permanent dysfunction proceeding from multifaceted neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to damage and repair. Fidgetin-like 2 (FL2), a microtubule-severing enzyme that negatively regulates axon growth, microglial functions, and wound healing, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for central nervous system injuries and neuroinflammation. To test the hypothesis that FL2 knockdown increases acute neuroinflammation and improves recovery after SCI, we examined the effects of nanoparticle-encapsulated FL2 siRNA treatment after a moderate contusion SCI in rats. SCI significantly increased FL2 expression in the lesion site and rostral to the lesion 1 day post-injury (dpi). A single treatment of FL2 siRNA after injury led to modestly improved locomotor recovery consistent with the preservation of corticospinal tract function, accompanied by reduced inflammation and increased presence of oligodendrocytes. In determining the acute effects of treatment, RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that FL2 siRNA modulates early cellular responses, including chemokine signaling, both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune reactions, and neurotransmitter signaling pathways at 1, 4, and 7 dpi. Follow-up analyses at 4 dpi using dual in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that SCI increased FL2 mRNA and that FL2 was colocalized with microglia/macrophages. FL2 downregulation resulted in a marked accumulation of microglia at the lesion site, accompanied by increased inflammatory markers (IL-1β, TGF-β1, and CD68). The results suggest SCI induces an increase in FL2 expression that undermines acute inflammatory responses as well as spinal cord integrity and growth. Overall, our study suggests that targeting FL2 holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for treating SCI.
40065365	Prognostic implications and characterization of tumor-associated tertiary lymphoid structures genes in pancreatic cancer.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the most aggressive cancers, with rising incidence and limited responsiveness to immunotherapy due to its highly suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), ectopic formation structures of immune cells, are linked to better prognosis and improved immunotherapy responses in PDAC. Understanding TLS's role in PDAC could enhance immunotherapy effectiveness.
40065368	Hypoxia-induced MIR31HG expression promotes partial EMT and basal-like phenotype in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma based on data mining and experimental analyses.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common and aggressive type of pancreatic cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 8%. Its high mortality is largely due to late diagnosis, metastatic potential, and resistance to therapy. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in metastasis, enabling cancer cells to become mobile. Partial EMT, where cells maintain both epithelial and mesenchymal traits, is more frequent in tumors than complete EMT and contributes to cancer progression. The long non-coding RNA MIR31 host gene (MIR31HG) has recently emerged as a critical factor in PDAC oncogenesis. This study aimed to investigate MIR31HG's role in partial EMT and its association with the basal-like PDAC subtype.
40065372	Engineered extracellular vesicles promote the repair of acute kidney injury by modulating regulatory T cells and the immune microenvironment.	Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical condition. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKI have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatment options remain limited. Studies have shown that immune cells play a critical role in AKI, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) being one of the most important immunosuppressive lymphocytes. Tregs proliferation can attenuate AKI, whereas depletion exacerbates kidney injury. Given that endothelial cells (ECs) are the initial cells that interact with immune cells when they invade the tissue parenchyma, ECs are closely associated with immune reactions.
40065374	Comparing conventional and Bayesian workflows for clinical outcome prediction modelling with an exemplar cohort study of severe COVID-19 infection incorporating clinical biomarker test results.	Assessing risk factors and creating prediction models from real-world medical data is challenging, requiring numerous modelling decisions with clinical guidance. Logistic regression is a common model for such studies, for which we advocate the use of Bayesian methods that can jointly deliver probabilistic risk factor inference and prediction. As an exemplar, we compare Bayesian logistic regression with horseshoe priors and Projective Prediction variable selection with the established frequentist LASSO approach, to predict severe COVID-19 outcomes (death or ICU admittance) from demographic and laboratory biomarker data. Our study serves as guidance on data curation, variable selection, and performance assessment with cross-validation.
40065379	Study on the clinical characteristics, persistent infection capability, and viral load of human papillomavirus type 82 single infection.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a key factor in the development of cervical cancer and HPV genotyping is crucial for screening. There are significant differences in the pathogenic potential of the various HPV types. Currently, clinical data on HPV82 are scarce, and the relationship between its viral load, pathogenicity, and persistence is unknown. This study analyzed the characteristics of HPV82 single infection.
40065382	Morphological and molecular characterisation of Sarcocystis capracanis, Sarcocystis cornagliai and Sarcocystis rossii n. sp. infecting the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex).	The cyst-forming coccidia of the genus Sarcocystis (Sarcocystidae) are widespread protists of mammals, particularly of domestic and wild ruminants. Research on genus Sarcocystis in wild members of the subfamily Caprinae is, however, rather limited. Sarcocystis in the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) have only been investigated in depth once and then solely by morphological techniques. In the current investigation we aimed to morphologically and genetically characterise Sarcocystis species of Alpine ibex in Austria.
40065383	Autism spectrum disorder and 3p24.3p23 triplication: a case report.	The role of copy number variants as genomic mutations causative of neurodevelopmental disorders has been recently established. They can act as risk factors of conditions with multifactorial etiopathogenesis and incomplete penetrance, such as nonsyndromic autism, and, in this case, are often inherited from an unaffected parent. Conversely, dominant syndromes, with high penetrance, can be caused by de novo occurring variants.
40065384	DNAH9 variants in children with post-infectious bronchiolitis/bronchitis obliterans.	Post-infectious bronchiolitis/bronchitis obliterans (PIBO) is a chronic irreversible obstructive lung disease that results in obstruction and/or obliteration of small airways. Previous reports have indicated that PCD-related gene mutations contribute to PIBO incidence. However, the relationship between DNAH9 variants and PIBO remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between DNAH9 mutations and the incidence of PIBO. In our cohort, 126 PIBO patients conducted Whole Exome Sequence (WES) test and twelve variants of DNAH9 gene were identified. Detailed clinical information, high-resolution computerized tomography and/or electronic bronchoscopy findings of the six pediatric children carried DNAH9 variants were systematically collected, meticulously reviewed, and rigorously analyzed. Clinical evaluation revealed three patients with bronchiolitis obliterans, two patients with bronchitis obliterans and one with both conditions. All patients had at least one previous bout of pneumonia, which in three cases was linked to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, in two cases to adenovirus infection, and in one case to co-infection with both pathogens. Genetic analysis of all cases identified six compound heterozygous DNAH9 mutations encompassing twelve variants: c.12,925 C > T (p.Arg4309*), c.5152-10G > T (-), c.4604 A > G (p.Gln1535Arg), c.12844-14T > C (-), c.4816T > C (p.Phe1606Leu), c.8831G > A (p.Arg2944Gln), c.9479 C > T (p.Ala3160Val), c.7415G > A (p.Arg2472Gln), c.5692G > T (p.Glu1898*), c.11,572 C > T (p.Arg3858Trp), c.11,176 C > T (p.Arg3726Trp), c.1010 C > T (p.Pro337Leu). These variants included two nonsense mutations, two mutations near splice sites, and eight missense mutations. All variants exhibited negligible or low minor allele frequencies based on the gnomAD database and were predicted to be variants of uncertain significance (VUS) or deleterious based on comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Our findings suggest that DNAH9 compound complex variants may contribute to development of PIBO following severe M. pneumoniae and/or adenoviral infectious pneumonia in pediatric patients.
40065387	Additive association of blood group A allele with 15 cardiometabolic diseases: a UK Biobank life-course study.	Although existing studies have reported associations between blood group A and cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), most have focused on dominant inheritance models. However, genome-wide association studies have mostly been based on additive genotypes. This study aims to investigate the association between the blood group A allele and 15 CMD using recessive, dominant, and additive models and identify potential mediators.
40065395	Dopamine D1 receptor agonist alleviates post-weaning isolation-induced neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors in female mice.	Major depressive disorder is a significant global cause of disability, particularly among adolescents. The dopamine system and nearby neuroinflammation, crucial for regulating mood and processing rewards, are central to the frontostriatal circuit, which is linked to depression. This study aimed to investigate the effect of post-weaning isolation (PWI) on depression in adolescent mice, with a focus on exploring the involvement of microglia and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) in the frontostriatal circuit due to their known links with mood disorders.
40065399	Precise engineering of gene expression by editing plasticity.

40065401	Development and validation of potential molecular subtypes and signatures of thyroid eye disease based on angiogenesis-related gene analysis.	Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the orbit, associated with a range of potential clinical sequelae. Tumor cells in TED overexpress pro-angiogenic factors, driving the formation of heterogeneous and immature neovascularization. This dysregulated angiogenesis often leads to a hypoxic microenvironment due to insufficient perfusion. Despite its importance, the role of angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) in TED pathophysiology remains poorly understood.
40065407	N-terminal domain of CTRP9 promotes cardiac fibroblast activation in myocardial infarction via Rap1/Mek/Erk pathway.	In developed nations, myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality, resulting in a significant economic burden and becoming a global public health problem. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 9 (CTRP9) is a secreted protein comprising a variable domain, a collagenous region, and a C-terminal trimerizing globular C1q (gC1q) domain. In vivo, the full-length CTRP9 (fCTRP9) can be cleaved into the globular domain of CTRP9 (gCTRP9). Here, we tested the cardio-protective impacts of fCTRP9, gCTRP9, and N-terminal domain, including the variable and collagenous domain, of CTRP9 (nCTRP9) in the context of MI.
40065420	MSTN knockout enhances the production of MYOD1-mediated steak-type cultivated meat.

40065421	Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and inhibitory control training for excess weight treatment: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (InhibE).	The prevalence of excess weight has increased globally. Despite interventions include targeted goals on essential aspects such as physical activity and diet, their long-term effectiveness remains limited. Research highlights that eating behaviour is influenced by impulsive processes, especially in the context of a food-rich environment. Inhibitory control has been identified as a key factor in regulating eating behaviour. Neuroscience approaches, including inhibitory control training and non-invasive neuromodulation of brain regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, show promise in improving eating behaviour when used in addition to conventional intervention for weight management. This parallel group, randomized, controlled trial aims to study the efficacy of neuromodulation with iTBS as an add-on to the weight loss treatment as usual (TAU: diet and exercise), alone and in combination with inhibitory control training, for excess weight treatment.
40065422	Mortality in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex in the United Kingdom, 2016-2022.	Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic condition caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 genes, affecting around two million people globally. This study aims to examine causes of death in TSC and explore factors contributing to mortality in people with TSC in the United Kingdom in recent years following updated management and surveillance guidelines for the condition.
40065425	Fungal Infections Associated With TNF-Inhibitors: A 20-Year of a Systematic Review Fungal Infections and TNF-Inhibitors.	TNF-α inhibitors, including infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept, are used to treat various inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. However, these treatments may predispose patients to fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, candidiasis and aspergillosis. In this study, we systematically reviewed case reports to critically examine the correlations between anti-TNF-α therapies and the occurrence of invasive and superficial fungal infections. Infliximab was the most commonly used TNF-α inhibitor (50.65%). The highest number of fungal infections during anti-TNF34 α therapy was reported in the USA (84.25%). The conditions treated primarily included rheumatoid arthritis. A total of 517 invasive fungal infections were identified, including histoplasmosis, invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis, with histoplasmosis being the most common. Most studies were conducted in higher-income countries, highlighting the critical lack of research on the use of immunobiologicals in relation to fungal diseases in African countries, which requires further attention. Logistic regression analysis revealed significant associations between adalimumab use and increased risks of candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, onychomycosis and pityriasis versicolor. For etanercept, significant associations were found with aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, dermatophytosis, invasive candidiasis, pityriasis versicolor and onychomycosis. Infliximab use was significantly associated with coccidioidomycosis, onychomycosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis and invasive candidiasis. The data presented in this study clearly demonstrate an association between the use of TNF-α inhibitors and an increased risk of fungal infections. It is imperative that healthcare professionals maintain a high level of vigilance when managing patients on these medications. Regular monitoring and proactive management strategies are essential to mitigate risks and ensure patient safety.
40065427	A review of cerebrospinal fluid circulation with respect to Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia in brachycephalic dogs.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis by facilitating the clearance of metabolic waste and regulating intracranial pressure. Dysregulation of CSF flow can lead to conditions like syringomyelia, and hydrocephalus. This review details the anatomy of CSF flow, examining its contribution to waste clearance within the brain and spinal cord. The review integrates data from human, canine, and other mammalian studies, with a particular focus on brachycephalic dogs. Certain dog breeds exhibit a high prevalence of CSF-related conditions due to artificial selection for neotenous traits, making them valuable models for studying analogous human conditions, such as Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia associated with craniosynostosis. This review discusses the anatomical features specific to some brachycephalic breeds and the impact of skull and cranial cervical conformation on CSF flow patterns, providing insights into the pathophysiology and potential modelling approaches for these conditions.
40065428	Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals cellular heterogeneity in the aortas of Takayasu arteritis.	Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is an inflammatory vasculitis that affects the aorta and its primary branches. The pathogenesis of TAK remains elusive, yet identifying key cell types in the aorta of TAK patients is crucial for uncovering cellular heterogeneity and discovering potential therapeutic targets.
40065431	New Insight Into the Mechanism of Nitrite Enhancement on Heterotrophic Nitrification and Aerobic Denitrification Bacterium in Gene Expression.	The growth and nitrogen metabolism of heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification (HN-AD) bacteria are affected by nitrite, but the mechanisms underlying this for strain Acinetobacter johnsonii EN-J1 are unclear. In this study, the addition of 10 mg/L nitrite increased the reduction rate of ammonium by 1.0 mg/L/h, and 20 mg/L nitrite increased the reduction rate of nitrate by 3.9 mg/L/h. Compared with the control, the nitrate reductase activity, electron transfer activity, and adenosine triphosphate content of EN-J1 were enhanced by 142.0%, 278.0% and 279.0%, respectively, in the nitrate removal process after the addition of 20 mg/L nitrite. The whole genome was annotated with nitrogen removal genes such as narGHI, narK, nsrR, nirBD, nasA, glnA, gltB, gdhA and amt. Transcriptome analysis showed that nitrite triggered significant upregulation of several key pathways, including nitrogen metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism for enhancing denitrification. The expression of key denitrification genes (narG, narK, hmp, nirBD, glnA and nasA) was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. These results suggested that nitrite enhances denitrification by increasing the expression of denitrification genes, electron transfer and adenosine triphosphate levels, which is important for elucidating the mechanism of nitrite promotion of biological nitrogen removal efficiency.

40065475	Aseptic meningitis in the setting of giant cell arteritis (GCA): a case report.	Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis primarily affecting medium- and large-sized arteries. The diagnosis may be challenging and lead to delays in treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis is an uncommon association but may occur due to central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis or pachymeningitis. We describe a case fulfilling the criteria for diagnosing GCA, associated with CSF pleocytosis and normal neuroimaging.
40065477	Network pharmacological approach combined with weighted gene co-expression network analysis identifies CDKN2A as the keg target of Changweiqing against colorectal cancer.	Changweiqing (CWQ) is a Chinese herbal formula for the treatment of the gastrointestinal tract diseases, but its role in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been clarified. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of CWQ in CRC treatment through bioinformatics analysis and network pharmacology.
40065479	Wolbachia bacteria in Mansonella perstans isolates from patients infected in different geographical areas: a pilot study from the ESCMID Study Group for Clinical Parasitology.	Mansonella perstans is a vector-borne filarial parasite widely endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, with sporadic cases in Latin America. Infection is often overlooked; treatment is not standardized, and effectiveness of common regimes is difficult to ascertain. Anti-Wolbachia macrofilaricidal treatment with doxycycline has been applied, but there are scant and contrasting reports about the presence of Wolbachia in M. perstans isolates from different geographical locations. Taking advantage of a network of European centres expert in traveller and migrant health, we aimed to expand the knowledge concerning the distribution of Wolbachia in M. perstans to contribute to the design of optimal treatment approaches.
40065480	GHSR gene knockout alleviates the liver pathological response in Echinococcus granulosus infection by reducing parasite survival.	Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, and the immunosuppressive microenvironment exacerbates disease progression. Ghrelin, a peptide hormone, plays a role in modulating immune inflammation and may influence the progression of E. granulosus infection through its receptor, GHSR (growth hormone secretagogue receptor). However, whether GHSR downregulation can inhibit E. granulosus infection remains unclear. In this study, we extracted liver tissues from E. granulosus-infected mice and those treated with the GHSR antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6. Proteomic analysis revealed 341 differentially expressed proteins, of which 185 were upregulated and 156 were downregulated. Metabolomic sequencing revealed 101 differentially expressed metabolites, including 62 upregulated and 39 downregulated metabolites. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of both proteomic and metabolomic data revealed seven key signalling pathways, 11 key proteins, and 26 key metabolites that interact through metabolic and organic system networks. Next, we examined the disease progression of E. granulosus infection in GHSR-knockout mice. Compared with the E. granulosus (Eg) group, the GHSR-KO group presented a significant reduction in the number of liver infection foci. The serum and liver ghrelin levels were significantly greater in the E. granulosus group than in the control group, along with increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ) and decreased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). In contrast, the GHSR-KO group presented significantly lower ghrelin levels in both the serum and liver, with reduced proinflammatory cytokine secretion and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, similar to those of the control group. Furthermore, ghrelin and inflammation-related factors, including MyD88, NF-κB p65, iNOS, and Arg-1, exhibited coordinated expression changes in liver lesions and surrounding areas. These findings suggest that GHSR gene knockout can ameliorate the progression of liver E. granulosus infection and associated liver inflammation.
40065481	Gram-positive infections in special populations. Expert view on the role of dalbavancin.	This review considers special populations as those patients for whom Gram-positive infections are particularly challenging to treat. We examine the potential benefits of dalbavancin in these patients.
40065484	The pH influence on ectomycorrhizal nitrogen acquisition and decomposition.	In theory, ectomycorrhizal (EM) and saprotrophic fungi compete for nitrogen (N) found in soil organic matter. However, both positive and negative effects of EM fungi on decomposition have been observed across systems, with opposing implications for soil carbon (C) storage. The conditions driving the context dependency of fungal guild interactions remain poorly understood, which has limited our ability to predict the effects of EM fungi on biogeochemical cycling at regional and global spatial scales. To address this knowledge gap, we used a publicly available dataset of soil fungal communities to examine global patterns of relative EM and saprotrophic abundance and their influence on soil carbon and nutrient cycling. We demonstrate that EM fungal dominance and its effects on C and N cycling are predictable across the globe using only soil C : N stoichiometry, host tree functional group, and soil pH as predictors. We argue that because soil pH influences the availability and enzymatic catabolism of organic N, it determines the dominant N acquisition strategy of EM fungi, which in turn governs the directional effect of EM-saprotroph interactions on rates of organic matter decomposition in forests.
40065488	Exploring the Exclusive Isolation of Pseudomonas syringae in Peltigera Lichens via Metabolite Analysis and Growth Assays.	The specific association of the potentially plant-pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae with Peltigera lichens raises questions about the factors driving this host specificity. To explore this, the metabolic profile of seven lichen species belonging to three genera (Cladonia, Peltigera and Stereocaulon) was analysed using LC-MSMS. In addition, we assessed the growth of P. syringae strains in media supplemented with extracts from each lichen species. This revealed that Peltigera exhibits lower metabolite richness compared to other genera, but shows a higher chemical investment in specific compounds. Growth kinetics showed comparable P. syringae growth across lichen-supplemented media, except for Cladonia arbuscula and Cladonia sp., where the former exhibited lower growth rates. Inhibition assays with lichen extracts showed no inhibition of P. syringae. The lichen metabolome is predominantly composed of lipids and organic acids. Furthermore, specific compounds, such as aminoglycosides, may facilitate P. syringae presence in Peltigera by inhibiting Bacillus subtilis and other antagonists. In addition, compounds absent in Peltigera, like anthracene, might serve as a carbon source inhibitor like Bacillus velezensis.
40065489	Soil pH-dependent nitrogen stimulation of plant biomass: magnesium and calcium as key constraints.	Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition can alleviate N limitation and stimulate plant growth in many terrestrial ecosystems. While theoretical models often emphasize phosphorus limitations as a constraint on this positive N effect, the impact of N-induced magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) deficits due to soil acidification has been largely overlooked. Here, we synthesized data from 243 experiments across diverse terrestrial ecosystems to investigate the role of Mg and Ca in plant biomass responses to N addition. We found that the effect of N addition on aboveground biomass (AGB) shifted from neutral in low pH (≤ 4.5) to positive in medium (4.5-7.5) and high pH (> 7.5) soils. By contrast, belowground biomass (BGB) responses to N addition were independent of soil pH, leading to asymmetric increases in AGB and BGB. These variations in biomass accumulation across pH levels were primarily explained by changes in foliar Mg and Ca concentrations, which were negatively affected by N addition in low-pH soils but remained stable in medium and high-pH soils. Our findings underscore the critical role of Mg and Ca in modulating plant responses to N fertilization, providing new insights for improving Earth system models and better predicting climate-biosphere feedback.

40065493	Phylogenetic relationships and the repeated loss of traits associated with sicklebill pollination in Centropogon subgenus Centropogon (Campanulaceae).	Centropogon subgenus Centropogon comprises 55 species found primarily in midelevation Andean forests featuring some of the most curved flowers among angiosperms. Floral curvature is linked to coevolution with the sicklebill hummingbird, which pollinates most species. Despite charismatic flowers, there is limited knowledge about the phylogenetic relationships and floral evolution.
40065494	The DNA N6-adenine methylation target gene GhMAF1 promotes fiber initiation at the base of Gossypium ovules.	DNA methylation consists of 5-methylcytosine and N6-methyl deoxyadenosine (6mA) and is crucial in plant development. However, its specific role and potential mechanism to initiate cotton fibers remain unclear. This study employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to analyze DNA methylation alterations in ZM24 and ZM24 fuzzless-lintless (ZM24fl) during fiber initiation. Our results indicated that DNA 6mA methylation exhibited the most remarkable difference among ovule samples at -2, 0, and 5 d post anthesis of ZM24 and ZM24fl. Subsequently, genes with significant changes in DNA 6mA methylation and transcription during fiber initiation were screened. We found that GhMAF1 displayed significant transcriptional upregulation and 6mA enrichment in its promoter, which could serve as a potential target for DNA 6mA in fiber initiation. Further, we knocked out GhMAF1 using CRISPR-Cas technology and demonstrated that GhMAF1 specifically promotes the initiation of fiber cells at the base of the ovule by mediating the downstream JAZ2/CPC-MML3/MML4 pathway. These findings unveil a novel spatial module of fiber cell initiation on the ovule surface that involves GhMAF1. Ultimately, this work provides significant knowledge for the regulatory network of DNA 6mA modification in fiber initiation to improve fiber yield and quality.

40065499	The transcription factor RIP140 regulates interferon γ signaling in breast cancer.	RIP140 (receptor interacting protein of 140 kDa) is an important player in breast cancer (BC) by regulating key cellular pathways such as nuclear hormone receptor signaling. In order to identify additional genes specifically regulated by RIP140 in BC, we performed a transcriptomic analysis after silencing its expression in MCF-7 cells. We identified the interferon γ (IFNγ) signaling as being substantially repressed by RIP140 knockdown. Using the GBP1 (guanylate binding protein 1) gene as a reporter of IFNγ signaling, we demonstrated its robust induction by RIP140 through an ISRE motif, leading to a significant reduction of its induction upon IFNγ treatment. Furthermore, we showed that low levels of RIP140 amplified the IFNγ-dependent inhibition of BC cell proliferation. In line with these data, reanalysis of transcriptomic data obtained in human BC samples revealed that IFNγ levels were associated with good prognosis only for BC patients exhibiting tumors expressing low levels of RIP140, thus confirming its effect on the anti-tumor activity of IFNγ provided by our experimental data. Altogether, this study identifies RIP140 as a new regulator of IFNγ signaling in breast tumorigenesis.

40065506	DNA methylation signatures of cervical pre-invasive and invasive disease: An epigenome-wide association study.	Epigenetic alterations are essential in the development of cancers, while epigenome-wide exploration in cervical cancer has been limited. In this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) we explore differential DNA methylation signatures associated with CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) grade 3 and cervical cancer to better understand potential drivers and biomarkers of cervical carcinogenesis. 247 women were recruited between 2014 and 2020 (N = 119 benign, N = 74 CIN3/CGIN [cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia] and N = 54 cancer). Methylation signatures were obtained from exfoliated cervical cells and sequenced using the Illumina 850 k array. Logistic regression and conditional analyses were used to test for independent associations between Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites and case-control status, with adjustment for batch, chip, age, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status. 409 CpG sites were strongly associated with CIN3/cancer (p-value <5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Following conditional analysis, two CpG sites located in PAX1 (cg16767801) and NREP-AS1 genes (cg23642047) were independently associated with case status, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (AUC = 0.97 for invasive disease). In a validation dataset (CIN3 only) PAX1/NREP-AS1 yielded a combined AUC of 0.77. Methylation markers offer promise for use in cervical screening, particularly as triage tests and self-sampling. We have identified a novel combined methylation marker that offers a high accuracy for the detection of CIN3 or worse.
40065510	Genotype-Phenotype Correlations, Treatment, and Prognosis of Children With Early-Onset (Neonatal) Marfan Syndrome.	Early-onset Marfan syndrome (eoMFS) is a severe and rare form of Marfan syndrome characterized by severe atrioventricular valve insufficiency developing before or shortly after birth. It is unclear which factors (interventions and/or genotype) influence survival. Forty-one individuals with eoMFS with a fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) variant in exon 24-32 (CRCh37) were included. At the last follow-up, 14/41 (34%) were alive (8 months-18 years) and 27/41 (66%) were deceased. Median age of death was 1 month and 88% of the deaths occurred before 5 months of age. More individuals alive past the age of 16 months versus those who were deceased before that age had undergone cardiovascular surgery at an older age (13 months, range 3-72, vs. 2 months, range 2-2, p = 0.03). Survival was better in those with single amino acid substitutions/small in-frame deletions than in those with large in-frame deletions (p = 0.007), but variants involving a cysteine substitution in an EGF-like domain versus those involving other amino acids did not significantly influence survival. EoMFS ranges from a (pre-)neonatal life-threatening disorder to a disorder with enhanced survival, creating a window for cardiovascular surgery. Individuals with single amino acid substitutions/small in-frame deletions had better survival compared to those with variants significantly impacting exon 24-32 length.
40065514	NAPQI is absent in the mouse brain after Sub-hepatotoxic and hepatotoxic doses of acetaminophen.	Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most-used over-the-counter analgesic among pregnant women. However, concerns have arisen over the safety of APAP exposure during gestation. In particular, it's been speculated that the hepatotoxic metabolite of APAP, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), forms in the brain after maternal use of therapeutic APAP doses and leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, APAP metabolism in the brain is understudied. Here, we tested the hypothesis that NAPQI can be generated in the brain by overdosing BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (common model of the NDD autism) and C57Bl/6J mice with APAP and measuring glutathione loss and APAP-protein adducts as two of the best markers of NAPQI available. Despite glutathione depletion and adducts in the liver, we saw none in the brain. We conclude NAPQI is unlikely to contribute to the pathophysiology of NDDs. IMPACT STATEMENT: It has been hypothesized that NAPQI formation in the brain provides biological plausibility for the purported link between APAP and NDDs. Our results cast doubt on that hypothesis.
40065518	New-Onset, But Not Chronic Atrial Fibrillation, Is a Significant Factor Contributing to Mortality Among Patients with Severe COVID-19.	BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia in the general population and the most frequently presented arrhythmia in the intensive care unit. We investigated the effects of AF on the outcomes of critical COVID-19 patients, especially focusing on differences between chronic (CAF) and new-onset AF (NOAF) during critical disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this case-control study, we investigated the association of CAF and NOAF as an exposure, with in-hospital mortality as an outcome. We identified 2 patient groups, NOAF and CAF, which were compared with controls (all other hospitalized patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia). No specific selection or matching was performed. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables; t test and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for continuous variables, depending on distribution. P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the NOAF group, while in the CAF group, it was similar to that of the control group. The NOAF group had significantly higher markers of inflammation and more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), measured with computed tomography. NOAF was strongly associated with in-hospital death, with OR 6.392 (95% CI, 2.758-14.815), P<0.000. In comparison, the CAF group was older and had more cardiovascular comorbidities, with similar markers of inflammation and severity of ARDS as the control group. CONCLUSIONS NOAF in COVID-19 was linked with significant risk of death, being a sign of extreme cardiac, pulmonary, and metabolic instability. NOAF should be considered as an important marker of instability and predictor of poor outcomes among patients with COVID-19.
40065520	Phylogenetic Study of Local Patterns Influenza A(H3N2) Virus Transmission in a Semi-Isolated Population in a Remote Island in Japan Between 2011 and 2013.	Influenza A outbreak risk is impacted by the potential for importation and local transmission. Reconstructing transmission history with phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences can help assess outbreak risk but relies on regular collection of genetic sequences. Few influenza genetic sequences are collected in Japan, which makes phylogenetic analysis challenging, especially in rural, remote settings. We generated influenza A genetic sequences from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) samples collected using rapid influenza diagnostic tests and used them to analyze the transmission dynamics of influenza in a remote island in Japan.
40065522	Dispositional Awe Predicts Mental Health Through Interpretation Bias During COVID-19 Transmission: A Longitudinal Study.	During a public health emergency, such as the widespread transmission of COVID-19 following loosened COVID-19 policies in China, people's mental health is impacted along with their physical well-being. In order to investigate ways to mitigate these negative effects, this study examined how dispositional awe can predict mental health outcomes during such emergencies using a three-wave longitudinal design. Five hundred twenty seven participants (mean age = 21.18, SD = 3.39; 368 males) took part in the study within the first 2 months after the implementation of loosened COVID-19 policies, with one-month intervals between waves. Cross-lagged analysis revealed that dispositional awe in Wave 1 significantly predicted higher positive and lower negative interpretation bias in Wave 2, which in turn promoted positive mental functioning in Wave 3. Furthermore, negative interpretation bias in Wave 2 acted as a mediator for the predictive role of dispositional awe in Wave 1 on psychosomatic symptoms in Wave 3. These findings suggest that dispositional awe can act as a protective factor for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic by influencing people's interpretation orientation.
40065531	Telomere Position Effect-Over Long Distances Acts as a Genome-Wide Epigenetic Regulator Through a Common Alu Element.	Among epigenetic modifiers, telomeres represent attractive modulators of the genome in part through position effects. Telomere Position Effect-Over Long Distances (TPE-OLD) modulates gene expression by changes in telomere-dependent long-distance loops. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of TPE-OLD, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome and methylome analysis in proliferative fibroblasts and myoblasts or differentiated myotubes with controlled telomere lengths. By integrating omics data, we identified a common TPE-OLD dependent cis-acting motif that behaves as an insulator or enhancer. Next, we uncovered trans partners that regulate these activities and observed the consistent depletion of one candidate factor, RBPJ, at TPE-OLD associated loci upon telomere shortening. Importantly, we confirmed our findings by unbiased comparisons to recent Human transcriptomic studies, including those from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We concluded that TPE-OLD acts at the genome-wide level and can be relayed by RBPJ bridging Alu-like elements to telomeres. In response to physiological (i.e., aging) or pathological cues, TPE-OLD might coordinate the genome-wide impact of telomeres through recently evolved Alu elements acting as enhancers in association with RBPJ.

40065551	Kisspeptin fiber and receptor distribution analysis suggests its potential role in central sensorial processing and behavioral state control.	Kisspeptin (KP) signaling in the brain is defined by the anatomical distribution of KP-producing neurons, their fibers, receptors, and connectivity. Technological advances have prompted a re-evaluation of these chemoanatomical aspects, originally studied in the early years after the discovery of KP and its receptor Kiss1r. Previously, we characterized (Hernández et al. bioRxiv 2024) seven KP neuronal populations in the mouse brain at the mRNA level, including two novel populations, and examined their response to gonadectomy. In this study, we mapped KP fiber distribution in rats and mice using immunohistochemistry under intact as well as short- and long-term post-gonadectomy conditions. Kiss1r mRNA expression was examined via RNAscope, in relation to vesicular GABA transporter (Slc32a1) in whole mouse brain, and to KP and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Slc17a6), Kiss1, and Slc32a1 in hypothalamic RP3V and arcuate regions. We identified KP fibers in 118 brain regions, primarily in extra-hypothalamic areas associated with sensorial processing and behavioral state control. KP-immunoreactive fiber density and distribution were largely unchanged by gonadectomy. Kiss1r was expressed prominently in sensorial and state control regions such as the septal nuclei, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, locus coeruleus, hippocampal layers, thalamic nuclei, and cerebellar structures. Co-expression of Kiss1r and Kiss1 was observed in hypothalamic neurons, suggesting both autocrine and paracrine KP signaling mechanisms. These findings enhance our understanding of KP signaling beyond reproductive functions, particularly in sensorial processing and behavioral state regulation. This study opens new avenues for investigating KP's role in controlling complex physiological processes, including those unrelated to reproduction.
40065552	Implications for soluble iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and glial glutamate release in motor neuron death associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Oxidative stress in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been evidenced by accumulation of oxidatively modified products of nucleic acids, lipids, sugars, and proteins in the motor neuron system of brains and spinal cords obtained at autopsy from the patients. We recently demonstrated soluble iron accumulation in activated microglia of sporadic ALS spinal cords. This finding could indicate that iron-mediated Fenton reaction is most likely to be responsible for oxidative stress associated with this disease. The excitatory amino acid neurotoxicity hypothesis for sporadic ALS has been proposed based on increased glutamate and aspartate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from the patients. Initially, the increase in extracellular excitatory amino acid levels was considered to reflect excessive release from the axon terminal of upper motor neurons. However, it is a question of whether the damaged upper motor neurons continue releasing glutamate even in advanced stage of this disease. To address this issue, we hypothesized that glial cells might be a glutamate release source. Our immunohistochemical analysis on autopsied human spinal cords revealed that ferritin, hepcidin, ferroportin, aconitase 1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE), and glutaminase-C (GAC) were expressed mainly in microglia and that cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) was expressed mainly in astrocytes. We next performed cell culture experiments. Cultured microglia treated with soluble iron over-released glutamate and TNF-α via aconitase 1 and TACE, respectively. Cultured microglia treated with TNF-α over-released glutamate via GAC. Cultured microglia treated with hepcidin, of which expression is known to be upregulated by TNF-α, showed downregulated expression of ferroportin. Cultured astrocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide over-released glutamate via xCT. These observations provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that microglia and astrocytes are glutamate suppliers in response to soluble iron overload and oxidative stress, respectively, in sporadic ALS.
40065563	Cystic fibrosis-causing variants in Chinese patients with congenital absence of the vas deferens: a cohort and meta-analysis.	Individuals with congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD) may transmit cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene to their offspring through assisted reproductive technology (ART). We aimed to delineate the spectrum and estimate the prevalence of CF-causing variants in Chinese individuals with CAVD through a cohort analysis and meta-analysis. CFTR was sequenced in 145 Chinese individuals with CAVD. CFTR variants were classified as CF-causing or non-CF-causing variants regarding clinical significance. A comprehensive genotype analysis was performed in Chinese individuals with CAVD, incorporating previous studies and our study cohort. The prevalence of CF-causing variants was estimated through meta-analysis. In our cohort, 56 different CFTR variants were identified in 108 (74.5%) patients. Twenty variants were categorized as CF-causing and were detected in 28 (19.3%) patients. A comprehensive genotype analysis of 867 patients identified 174 different CFTR variants. Sixty-four were classified as CF-causing variants, 56.3% of which had not been previously reported in Chinese patients with CF. Meta-analysis showed that 14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.0%-18.9%) CAVD cases harbored one CF-causing variant, and 68.6% (95% CI: 65.1%-72.0%) CAVD cases carried at least one CFTR variant. Our study underscores the urgent need for extensive CFTR screening, including sequencing of whole exons and flanking regions and detection of large rearrangements and deep intronic CF-causing variants, in Chinese individuals with CAVD before undergoing ART. The established CF-causing variants spectrum may aid in the development of genetic counseling strategies and preimplantation diagnosis to prevent the birth of a child with CF.
40065567	Recent advances in targeted degradation in the RAS pathway.	<i>RAS</i> (rat sarcoma) is one of the most frequently mutated gene families in cancer, encoding proteins classified as small GTPases. Mutations in RAS proteins result in abnormal activation of the RAS signaling pathway, a key driver in the initiation and progression of various malignancies. Consequently, targeting RAS proteins and the RAS signaling pathway has become a critical strategy in anticancer therapy. While RAS was historically considered an "undruggable" target, recent breakthroughs have yielded inhibitors specifically targeting KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutations, which have shown clinical efficacy in patients. However, these inhibitors face limitations due to rapid acquired resistance and the toxic effects of combination therapies in clinical settings. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies, such as PROTACs and molecular glues, provide a novel approach by selectively degrading RAS proteins, or their upstream and downstream regulatory factors, to block aberrant signaling pathways. These degraders offer a promising alternative to traditional inhibitors by potentially circumventing resistance and enhancing therapeutic precision. This review discusses recent advancements in RAS pathway degraders, with an emphasis on targeting RAS mutations as well as their upstream regulators and downstream effectors for potential cancer treatments.
40065571	Plant-soil feedbacks contribute to coexistence when considering multispecies assemblages over a soil depth gradient.	Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) may determine plant-species coexistence. They may stabilize coexistence, but frequently destabilize it by increasing fitness differences between species. Most studies focus on pairwise models in greenhouses. Thus, whether PSFs favor or deter coexistence is still unclear, especially in multispecies field contexts. We analyzed pairwise and multispecies coexistence over a hydric gradient in a semiarid grassland. Using PSF strength estimates between 17 species, we measured stability and fitness differences between all species pairs, and built all possible multispecies communities to test computationally whether they were stabilized by PSFs. We analyzed whether coexistence probability diminishes with species richness, as previously hypothesized. Because PSFs change with environmental conditions, we investigated their contribution to overall diversity maintenance over the hydric gradient. Strong PSF increased fitness differences, hindering pairwise coexistence. As expected, the probability that an assemblage was stable diminished with its richness, with the largest stable community containing 12 of the 17 species. However, all species coexisted with others in at least one assemblage, highlighting the importance of multispecies analyses. Positive PSFs promoted coexistence in pairwise analyses, but were associated with species-poor communities. Contrastingly, negative PSFs predominated in species-rich associations, perhaps due to indirect positive interactions (an "enemy of my enemy is my friend" scenario) that are known to maintain diversity in this grassland. Changes in the density of different species over the hydric gradient predicted from PSF-stabilized communities matched observations in nature. This seems to promote species turnover and thus coexistence along the gradient. As such, the interplay between environmental conditions and PSFs may be an important driver of diversity. Our results emphasize the need to move beyond pairwise coexistence models. In multispecies systems, crucial indirect interactions may arise. The interplay between environment and PSF under field conditions may provide important insights into coexistence in nature.

40065576	Size Matters: Influence of Available Soil Volume on the Root Architecture and Plant Response at Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Levels in Barley.	Pot size is a critical factor in plant growth experiments, influencing root architecture, nutrient uptake, and overall plant development as well as sensing of stress. In controlled environments, variation in pot size can impact phenotypic and molecular outcomes and may bias experimental results. Here, we investigated how pot size affects the root system architecture and molecular responses of two barley genotypes, the landrace BERE and the modern elite CONCERTO, through assessment of shoot and root traits and by using X-ray computed tomography complemented by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. The two genotypes showed distinctly different adaptations to changes in pot size. The landrace showed greater stability and adaptability with consistent root traits and enhanced accumulation of osmoprotectant metabolites across different pot sizes with respect to CONCERTO. Conversely, the elite line was more sensitive to pot size variations, particularly showing altered root architecture and transcriptomic responses. Overall, this study highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate pot size for plant growth experiments, particularly when focused on root traits, and highlights the importance of considering the physiological and molecular changes due to growth environment choice in experimental design in barley.
40065582	Buprenorphine's Effect on the Human Immune System and Inflammation.	Opioid use disorder is a persistent epidemic despite several FDA-approved medications for its treatment. While the pathogenesis of opioid use disorder has been classically attributed to dopamine pathways in the brain, there is emerging evidence and interest surrounding the role of inflammation and inflammatory signaling in its development and treatment. Buprenorphine has become the most prescribed medication for opioid use disorder, largely due to its ease of access and tolerability. This review aimed to better characterize contemporary knowledge of how buprenorphine modulates the human immune system and inflammatory functions in this population. A comprehensive review was conducted using 11 key databases, including Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. This review captured 8177 records, and 14 studies were ultimately selected for inclusion and discussion in this review. Notably, all 14 clinical studies evaluated buprenorphine's effect on the peripheral immune system, and the majority of the studies supported the notion that initiation and maintenance of buprenorphine restore immune suppression caused by opioid use disorder. In addition, we discuss how recent and ongoing work utilizing advanced imaging and cellular technologies is advancing the understanding of how buprenorphine affects the immune and inflammatory signaling in the brain.

40065595	Glucose Transport by Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Is Mediated Through the Akt/FOXO1 Pathway in Ovine Granulosa Cells.	Glycolysis in granulosa cells (GCs) is the primary location of energy metabolism and its substrates in oocytes and is closely related to follicular development in mammals. The complex morphological structure and physiological functions of GCs are regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but little is known about how FSH regulates glycolysis in GCs, and its mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which FSH activates the Akt/FOXO1 pathway, thereby regulating glucose metabolism in ovine GCs. Granulosa cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of FSH and a CCK-8 assay was used to measure the proliferation of the treated cells. Next, qRT-PCR was performed to measure the transcription of the target genes, glucose transporter (GLUT). Western-blot analysis of the phospho-Akt and -FOXO1 levels induced by FSH through the glucose signalling pathway, in addition to the effects of these proteins on the expression levels of the downstream GLUT genes, was measured. Results showed that the addition of 10ng/mL FSH to the culture medium increased the viability of granulosa cells. Transcription of GLUT1 and 4 was significantly up-regulated in FSH-treated cells through activation of the Akt/FOXO1 phosphorylation pathway, thereby affecting glucose metabolism. This study contributes to the current understanding of the metabolic features of and the associated developmental pathways of ovine follicular GCs.
40065596	Abundance, Identity, and Potential Diazotrophic Activity of nifH-Containing Organisms at Marine Cold Seeps.	Diazotrophic microorganisms alleviate nitrogen limitation at marine cold seeps using nitrogenase, encoded in part by the gene nifH. Here, we investigated nifH-containing organisms (NCOs) inside and outside six biogeochemically heterogeneous seeps using amplicon sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of nifH genes and transcripts. We detected nifH genes affiliated with phylogenetically and metabolically diverse organisms spanning 18 bacterial and archaeal phyla (17 within seeps). Detected NCOs included methane-oxidising ANME-2 archaea and sulfate-reducing Desulfobacteraceae, which have been shown to fix nitrogen at seeps previously, as well as Desulfuromonadales and putatively hydrocarbon-oxidising Desulfoglaeba and Candidatus Methanoliparia. We detected nifH transcripts at five of the six seeps, suggesting widespread diazotrophic activity. We corrected our qPCR data based on our amplicon results, which found that 71% of recovered sequences were not bona fide nifH, and we recommend a similar correction in future qPCR studies that use broad nifH primers. NifH abundance was up to three orders of magnitude higher within seeps, was correlated with mcrA abundance, and, when corrected, was negatively correlated with porewater ammonium < 25 μM, consistent with the inhibition of diazotrophy by ammonium. Our findings expand the known diversity of NCOs at seeps and emphasise seeps as hotspots for deep-sea diazotrophy.
40065603	Prp16 enables efficient splicing of introns with diverse exonic consensus elements in the short-intron rich <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> transcriptome.	DEAH box splicing helicase Prp16 in budding yeast governs spliceosomal remodelling from the branching conformation (C complex) to the exon ligation conformation (C* complex). In this study, we examined the genome-wide functions of Prp16 in the short intron-rich genome of the basidiomycete yeast <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>. The presence of multiple introns per transcript with intronic features that are more similar to those of higher eukaryotes makes it a promising model for studying spliceosomal splicing. Using a promoter-shutdown conditional Prp16 knockdown strain, we uncovered genome-wide but substrate-specific roles in <i>C. neoformans</i> splicing. The splicing functions of Prp16 are dependent on helicase motifs I and II, which are conserved motifs for helicase activity. A small subset of introns spliced independent of Prp16 activity was investigated to discover that exonic sequences at the 5' splice site (5'SS) and 3' splice site (3'SS) with stronger affinity for U5 loop 1 are a common feature in these introns. Furthermore, short (60-100nts) and ultrashort introns (<60nts) prevalent in the <i>C. neoformans</i> transcriptome were more sensitive to Prp16 knockdown than longer introns, indicating that Prp16 is required for the efficient splicing of short and ultrashort introns. We propose that stronger U5 snRNA-pre-mRNA interactions enable efficient transition of the spliceosome from the first to the second catalytic confirmation in Prp16 knockdown, particularly for short introns and introns with suboptimal features. This study provides insights into fine-tuning spliceosomal helicase function with variations in <i>cis-</i>element features.
40065611	[The role of microglia activated by the deletion of immune checkpoint receptor CD200R1 gene in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease].	The study aimed to investigate the effect of the CD200R1 gene deletion on microglia activation and nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss in the Parkinson's disease (PD) process. The CRISPR-Cas9 technology was applied to construct the CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The primary microglia cells of wild-type and CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were cultured and treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia phagocytosis level was assessed by a fluorescent microsphere phagocytosis assay. PD mouse model was prepared by nigral stereotaxic injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector carrying human α-synuclein (α-syn). The changes in the motor behavior of the mice with both genotypes were evaluated by cylinder test, open field test, and rotarod test. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess the loss of dopamine neurons in substantia nigra. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression level of CD68 (a key molecule involved in phagocytosis) in microglia. The results showed that CD200R1 deletion markedly enhanced LPS-induced phagocytosis <i>in vitro</i> by the microglial cells. In the mouse model of PD, CD200R1 deletion exacerbated motor behavior impairment and dopamine neuron loss in substantia nigra. Fluorescence intensity analysis results revealed a significant increase in CD68 expression in microglia located in the substantia nigra of CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The above results suggest that CD200R1 deletion may further activates microglia by promoting microglial phagocytosis, leading to increased loss of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in the PD model mice. Therefore, targeting CD200R1 could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of early-stage PD.
40065613	[The regulation and mechanism of apolipoprotein A5 on myocardial lipid deposition].	The current study aimed to clarify the roles of apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5) and milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (Mfge8) in regulating myocardial lipid deposition and the regulatory relationship between them. The serum levels of ApoA5 and Mfge8 in obese and healthy people were compared, and the obesity mouse model induced by the high-fat diet (HFD) was established. In addition, primary cardiomyocytes were purified and identified from the hearts of suckling mice. The 0.8 mmol/L sodium palmitate treatment was used to establish the lipid deposition cardiomyocyte model <i>in vitro</i>. ApoA5-overexpressing adenovirus was used to observe its effects on cardiac function and lipids. The expressions of the fatty acid uptake-related molecules and Mfge8 on transcription or translation levels were detected. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to verify the interaction between ApoA5 and Mfge8 proteins. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the co-localization of Mfge8 protein with ApoA5 or lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). Recombinant rMfge8 was added to cardiomyocytes to investigate the regulatory mechanism of ApoA5 on Mfge8. The results showed that participants in the simple obesity group had a significant decrease in serum ApoA5 levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and a significant increase in Mfge8 levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in comparison with the healthy control group. The adenovirus treatment successfully overexpressed ApoA5 in HFD-fed obese mice and palmitic acid-induced lipid deposition cardiomyocytes, respectively. ApoA5 reduced the weight of HFD-fed obese mice (<i>P</i> < 0.05), shortened left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and significantly reduced plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol (CHOL) (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In myocardial tissue and cardiomyocytes, the overexpression of ApoA5 significantly reduced the deposition of TG (<i>P</i> < 0.05), transcription of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) (<i>P</i> < 0.05), fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and fatty acid transport protein (FATP) (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and protein expression of Mfge8 (<i>P</i> < 0.05), while the transcription levels of Mfge8 were not significantly altered (<i>P</i> > 0.05). <i>In vitro</i>, the Mfge8 protein was captured using ApoA5 as bait protein, indicating a direct interaction between them. Overexpression of ApoA5 led to an increase in co-localization of Mfge8 with ApoA5 or LAMP2 in cardiomyocytes under lipid deposition status. On this basis, exogenous added recombinant rMfge8 counteracted the improvement of lipid deposition in cardiomyocytes by ApoA5. The above results indicate that the overexpression of ApoA5 can reduce fatty acid uptake in myocardial cells under lipid deposition status by regulating the content and cellular localization of Mfge8 protein, thereby significantly reducing myocardial lipid deposition and improving cardiac diastolic and systolic function.
40065617	[Research progress of nucleus tractus solitarius involved in central regulation of hypertension].	The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) is the primary brain region for receiving and integrating cardiovascular afferent signals. It plays a crucial role in maintaining balance of autonomic nervous system and regulating blood pressure through cardiovascular reflexes. Neurons within the NTS form complex synaptic connections and interact reciprocally with other brain regions. The NTS regulates autonomic nervous system activity and arterial blood pressure through modulating baroreflex, sympathetic nerve activity, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and oxidative stress. Dysfunctions in NTS activity may contribute to hypertension. Understanding the NTS' role in centrally regulating blood pressure and alterations of neurotransmission or signaling pathways in the NTS may provide rationale for new therapeutic strategies of prevention and treatment. This review summarizes the research findings on autonomic nervous system regulation and arterial blood pressure control by NTS, as well as unresolved questions, in order to provide reference for future investigation.
40065622	[Research progress on the mechanisms of Tau phosphorylation and its kinases in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage].	Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is one of the main causes of disability in middle-aged and elderly people, as well as high mortality rates and long-term physical impairments in newborns. The pathological manifestations of HIBD include neuronal damage and loss of myelin sheaths. Tau protein is an important microtubule-associated protein in brain, exists in neurons and oligodendrocytes, and regulates various cellular activities such as cell differentiation and maturation, axonal transport, and maintenance of cellular cytoskeleton structure. Phosphorylation is a common chemical modification of Tau. In physiological condition, it maintains normal cell cytoskeleton and biological functions by regulating Tau structure and function. In pathological conditions, it leads to abnormal Tau phosphorylation and influences its structure and functions, resulting in Tauopathies. Studies have shown that brain hypoxia-ischemia could cause abnormal alteration in Tau phosphorylation, then participating in the pathological process of HIBD. Meanwhile, brain hypoxia-ischemia can induce oxidative stress and inflammation, and multiple Tau protein kinases are activated and involved in Tau abnormal phosphorylation. Therefore, exploring specific molecular mechanisms by which HIBD activates Tau protein kinases, and elucidating their relationship with abnormal Tau phosphorylation are crucial for future researches on HIBD related treatments. This review aims to focus on the mechanisms of the role of Tau phosphorylation in HIBD, and the potential relationships between Tau protein kinases and Tau phosphorylation, providing a basis for intervention and treatment of HIBD.
40065625	[Advances in application of small-molecule compounds in neuronal reprogramming].	Neuronal reprogramming is an innovative technique for converting non-neuronal somatic cells into neurons that can be used to replace lost or damaged neurons, providing a potential effective therapeutic strategy for central nervous system (CNS) injuries or diseases. Transcription factors have been used to induce neuronal reprogramming, while their reprogramming efficiency is relatively low, and the introduction of exogenous genes may result in host gene instability or induce gene mutation. Therefore, their future clinical application may be hindered by these safety concerns. Compared with transcription factors, small-molecule compounds have unique advantages in the field of neuronal reprogramming, which can overcome many limitations of traditional transcription factor-induced neuronal reprogramming. Here, we review the recent progress in the research of small-molecule compound-mediated neuronal reprogramming and its application in CNS regeneration and repair.
40065628	Heart rate variability impairment during sleep in Veterans with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder: an early potential window into autonomic dysfunction?	Individuals with comorbid rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and neurotrauma (NT; defined by traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder) have an earlier age of RBD symptom onset, increased RBD-related symptom severity and more neurological features indicative of prodromal synucleinopathy compared to RBD only. An early sign of neurodegenerative condition is autonomic dysfunction, which we sought to evaluate by examining heart rate variability during sleep. Participants with overnight polysomnography were recruited from the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System. Veterans without NT or RBD (controls, n = 19), with RBD only (RBD, n = 14), and with RBD and NT (RBD+NT, n = 19) were evaluated. Eligible 5-min non-REM (NREM) and REM epochs without apneas/hypopneas, microarousals, and ectopic beats were analysed for frequency and time domain (e.g., low-frequency [LF] power; high-frequency [HF] power; root mean square of successive R-R intervals [RMSSD]; percentage of R-R intervals that vary ≥50 ms [pNN50]) heart rate variability outcomes. Heart rate did not significantly differ between groups in any sleep stage. Time domain and frequency domain variables (e.g., LF power, HF power, RMSSD, and pNN50) were significantly reduced in the RBD+NT group compared to the controls and RBD-only group during NREM sleep. There were no group differences detected during REM sleep. These data suggest significant reductions in heart rate variability during NREM sleep in RBD+NT participants, suggesting greater autonomic dysfunction compared to controls or RBD alone. Heart rate variability during sleep may be an early, promising biomarker, yielding mechanistic insight for diagnosis and prognosis of early neurodegeneration in this vulnerable population.
40065631	Genome Mining and Antagonism of Stenotrophomonas geniculata MK-1, Against Peanut Foliage Fungus Diseases.	Stenotrophomonas geniculata, a bacterium, has been recognized as an eco-friendly substitute for chemical fungicides in managing peanut foliar diseases, web blotch, and early leaf spot. Core genome and pan-genome analysis identified that strain MK-1 belongs to Stenotrophomonas geniculata, and nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis confirmed that strain belongs to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The research revealed that S. geniculata MK-1 had a notable antagonistic impact on Peyronellaea arachidicola and Cercospora arachidicola and demonstrated a biocontrol efficacy of over 95% against peanut early leaf spot and web blotch disease. The nonredundant protein sequences (NR) database identified 4324 annotations related to S. geniculata, with 2682 genes similar to strain MK-1. The COG database categorized 3041 annotations into 22 functional groups, and 33 distinct metabolic pathways associated with 1851 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations. Most genes linked with metabolism are found in S. geniculata, with 380 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 44 genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database identified 194 annotations are linked to non-ribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites. The Pathogen-Host Interactions (PHI) database showed reduced virulence in strain MK-1, while unaffected pathogenicity protein counts were 52. The MK-1 strain can produce antifungal siderophores secondary metabolites, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and siderophores.
40065635	Intake, digestion, and rumen microbial impacts of black soldier fly larvae and frass provided as protein supplements to cattle consuming forage.	Insects reared in large-scale, commercial settings may be a sustainable alternative to conventional livestock feeds. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) has been researched as a potential protein supplement for cattle, but knowledge gaps remain in how BSFL affects rumen microbial populations. Further, frass and larval sheddings (FRS) are produced in greater quantities than larval biomass and are N rich but have not been investigated as feed. Accordingly, the objective of our study was to compare the effects of isonitrogenous levels of cottonseed meal (CSM), BSFL, and FRS on forage utilization responses and rumen microbial communities in cattle consuming low-quality forage. Angus steers (n=8; 240 ± 22.5 kg BW) with ad libitum access to low-quality forage (5.9% crude protein) were used in replicated 4 × 4 Latin squares. One of four treatments was provided daily: no supplemental protein (CON), CSM, partially defatted BSFL, or FRS all provided at 100 mg N/kg BW. There were four 16-d experimental periods which included an 8-d adaptation to treatments, 7-d measurement of intake and digestion, and 1-d for determination of ruminal fermentation and sampling of rumen content for determination of microbial populations. Rumen content samples were separated into liquid and solid fractions, extracted for genomic DNA, PCR amplified for the V3 to V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, sequenced on a MiSeq platform, and analyzed using the QIIME2 pipeline. Protein supplementation increased forage organic matter (OM) intake and total digestible OM intake (TDOMI) relative to CON (P≤0.01). For TDOMI, there were differences (P≤0.03) between CSM (2.84 kg/d) and BSFL (3.07 kg/d) and CSM and FRS (3.05 kg/d). Treatment did not affect OM (P=0.82) or neutral detergent fiber (P=0.43) digestibility. Relative abundances of certain bacterial genera (i.e., Butyrvibrio, NK4A214, Prevotellacaeae UCG003, and Veillonellacaeae) were significantly affected by treatment in either the liquid or solid rumen fraction, but diversity indices, phyla, and dominant families were not affected. These data indicate that BSFL and FRS stimulate forage utilization to a similar or greater extent than a conventional protein supplement. The minor observed impacts on microbial community composition suggests no adverse effects on the rumen microbiome associated with supplementation of BSFL or FRS. Ultimately, BSFL and FRS may be suitable protein supplements for beef steers consuming low-quality forage.
40065639	Genetic origins of the Kiritimati population from central-eastern Micronesia.	The migration of Austronesian-speaking populations through Oceania has intrigued researchers for decades. The Kiribati islands, situated along the boundaries of Micronesia and Polynesia, provide a crucial link in this migration. We analyzed the genome-wide data of the Kiritimati population of Kiribati to uncover their genetic origins and connections with other Oceanian groups. Our study reveals that the Kiritimati population primarily exhibits Remote Oceanian-related ancestry associated with ancient Lapita and present-day Polynesian populations. In addition, our identity-by-descent analysis identifies populations from Philippines as their closest relatives in Island Southeast Asia. The genetic links between Kiritimati, ancient Lapita, and modern Polynesians underscore the shared ancestry and continuous gene flow across these regions. This genetic continuity and ongoing links are supported by linguistic and cultural evidence, illustrating a complex history of migration and admixture in Oceania.

40065653	Coproducing an Ecological Momentary Assessment Measurement Burst Mental Health Study With Young People: The MHIM Coproduction Protocol.	There is now widespread recognition within adolescence mental health research of the ethical imperative and benefits of coproduction. This has led to the development of best practice guidelines and the routine reporting of coproduction methods. However, there are unique considerations associated with involving young people in research with varying designs, e.g., longitudinal. Ideally, these decisions are made in consultation with young people themselves. Thus, the objective and novel contribution of this paper is (1) the involvement of young people in the development of the MHIM protocol, including an evaluative framework, and (2) a study protcol that utilises coproduction in the context of a longitudinal mental health project.

40065657	Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Promotes Glomerular Mesangial Cells Differentiation of Human Bone Marrow Hematopoietic Stem Cells - An In Vitro Study.	Glomerular filtration function and homeostasis are largely due to the cross-talk between podocytes, endothelial cells, and mesangial cells (MCs). Any disturbance in this association causes glomerular diseases (GD). Cell-based therapies are the best option in the treatment of GD. It is contemplated that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are best suited to regenerate these cells; earlier, we have shown the differentiation of HSCs into podocytes. In this study, MCs formation was initiated with retinoic acid (RA), BMP-7, and Activin A, resulting in comma-shaped intermediate mesoderm (IM) cells prominently expressing Osr1. Followed by inducing with EGF, FGF, and BMP-7, which resulted in elongated metanephric mesenchyme (MM) cells conspicuously expressing Pax2, Wt1, Foxd1, and Eya1. Finally, MM cells were induced with platelet-derived growth factor to form polygonal-shaped MCs expressing α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, CD44, and PDGFRβ. The growing MCs showed positivity to periodic acid Schiff's, and ANAE staining with a prominent expression of the Itga8 elucidating phagocytic property of MCs. These MCs showed conspicuous expression of CD133, notch-2, and telomerase, determining the quiescence nature with a 31.2% proliferation rate revealed through Ki-67 staining. The functionality of MCs was assessed by growing MCs in 5.5 and 25 mM glucose concentrations, and noticeable expression of angiotensinogen, angiotensin-I and II, angiotensin-converting enzyme, collagen-4, fibronectin, and TGFβ1 was observed in 25 mM concentration, while lowered expression of these genes was observed in 5.5 mM concentration explaining the role of MCs in regulating the filtration pressure. All these findings demonstrate that HSCs can rejuvenate the insulted glomerulus.
40065658	Advantages of Mutant Generation by Genome Rearrangements of Non-Conventional Yeast via Direct Nuclease Transfection.	We previously developed a genome engineering method (TAQing2.0) based on the direct delivery of DNA endonucleases into living cells, which induces genome rearrangements even in non-sporulating nonconventional yeasts without introducing foreign DNA. Using TAQing2.0 and conventional mutagenesis (by nitrosoguanidine), we obtained mutant asexual Candida utilis strains capable of growing under highly acidic conditions (pH 1.8). Whole genome resequencing revealed that the genomic sequences of mutants generated by both methods contain a negligible small population of unmappable sequences, suggesting that both types of mutants can be regarded as equivalent to naturally occurring mutants. TAQing2.0 mutants exhibit multiple genome rearrangements with few point mutations, whereas conventional mutagenesis produces numerous point mutations. This feature enabled us to easily identify candidate genes (e.g., LYP1 homolog) responsible for acid resistance. TAQing2.0 is a powerful and versatile tool for mutant production and gene hunting without invasion of foreign DNA.
40065683	Rhadinorhynchus villalobosi sp. n. (Acanthocephala: Rhadinorhynchidae) from the gafftopsail pompano Trachinotus rhodopus (Carangiformes: Carangidae) from the Pacific coast in Mexico.	A new species of Acanthocephala is described based on specimens found parasitising the intestine of the gafftopsail pompano Trachinotus rhodopus Gill in the State of Oaxaca, off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Rhadinorhynchus villalobosi sp. n. differs from the other 25 species of the genus known from the Pacific Ocean by a combination of morphological traits, such as the fewer number of rows of hooks along the proboscis, the distribution of spines of the trunk forming two fields, the position of genital pore, subterminal in both sexes, a shorter neck and cement glands, among others. The phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the nuclear 18S and 28S rRNA genes, as well as the mitochondrial cox1, all agree that R. villalobosi sp. n. is part of the genus, and closely related to Rhadinorhynchus trachinoti Grano-Maldonado, Sereno-Uribe, Hernández-Payán, Pérez-Ponce de León et García-Varela, 2025, a recently described Mexican species, despite the marked morphological differences between the two and being distributed in different areas.

40065698	Research progress on glycolipid metabolism of Sertoli cell in the development of spermatogenic cell.	Sertoli cells play an important role in the process of spermatogenesis by providing energy for spermatogenic cells and themselves through glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Abnormalities in spermatogenesis are closely related to disruptions of glucose and lipid metabolism in Sertoli cells. The metabolic environment of Sertoli cells is hypoxic, with glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation being the primary metabolic pathways. In Sertoli cells, glycolysis produces lactate to provide energy for spermatogenic cells, while fatty acid β-oxidation generates ATP. However, the relationship of glucose and lipid metabolism with spermatogenic cell development in Sertoli cells, and the interplay between glucose and lipid metabolism remain unclear. Various hormones, including sex hormones, can affect glucose metabolism of Sertoli cells by endocrine regulation. The activation or inhibition of signaling pathways such as AMPK, mTOR, and Akt can alter the expression levels of glycolysis-related transporter genes and the generation of fatty acids, thereby affecting the glycolipid metabolism in Sertoli cells. Some transcription factors such as PPARγ can regulate downstream fatty acid metabolism-related genes by directly binding to response elements, and can promote the oxidation of fatty acids in Sertoli cells. In this article we elaborate on the key factors influencing glucose and lipid metabolism in Sertoli cells and their interconnections, and their potential clinical implications, offering new insights for the precise targeted treatments of male infertility.

40065718	Deficiency of H3K27 histone demethylase UTX in T cells blunts allergic sensitization and anaphylaxis to peanut.	Whether epigenetic factor UTX, a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, is critical for type 2 immunity, including allergic sensitization and antigen-driven anaphylaxis, is unclear. We used UTXfl/fl x Lck-Cre mice with UTX-deficient T cells (UTX-TCD) to determine whether T cell-specific UTX expression regulates antigen-specific IgE production after airway sensitization to peanut and anaphylaxis following intraperitoneal (i.p.) peanut challenge. UTX-TCD mice sensitized via the airway with peanut and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial component and environmental adjuvant found in house dust, made 2-fold less peanut-IgE and 3.5-fold less peanut-IgG1 than comparably sensitized UTXfl/fl mice, despite higher total IgE and total IgG1 serum antibody levels pre-sensitization. Peanut-induced anaphylaxis was blunted in UTX-TCD mice, with maximum drop in core body temperature after i.p. peanut challenge two-fold lower than in UTXfl/fl mice. Compared to UTXfl/fl controls, UTX-TCD mice had reduced frequencies of CD4+ T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells and germinal center B cells, but higher frequencies of IL-4+ T-helper (Th)2, Tfh2, and IL-13+ Tfh13 cells in airway-draining mediastinal lymph nodes. UTX-TCD mice also skewed toward type 2 antibody and T-helper immune responses independent of allergic sensitization, with fewer IL-10-producing splenic Treg and T-follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells. Our results suggest that UTX expression in T cells impact the production of antigen-specific antibody responses required for allergic sensitization and antigen-specific allergic reactions, suggesting a role for H3K27 histone demethylase UTX in regulating type 2 immunity.
40065719	Endogenous ERMAP Affects T-Cell Function in EAE Mice.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease (AID) mediated by myelin-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of human MS. Erythrocyte membrane-associated protein (ERMAP) is a novel erythrocyte-specific adhesion/receptor molecule associated with erythrocyte adhesion. We have previously characterised it as a novel inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule and demonstrated that recombinant ERMAP proteins ameliorate EAE; however, the specific mechanism of action of ERMAP and the effects of endogenous ERMAP on T-cell function are largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of endogenous ERMAP in T-cell and macrophage homeostasis and EAE development. We show here that erythrocyte membrane-associated protein (ERMAP) gene knockout (ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup>) mice have increased numbers of T cells and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and enhanced T-cell activation, as compared to wild-type (ERMAP<sup>+/+</sup>) mice. When induced to develop EAE, ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice have more severe EAE symptoms and pathology, which are related to increased numbers of T cells (especially Th1 and Th17 T cells) and M1 macrophages, enhanced activation of T cells, and increased generation of inflammatory cytokines, but decreased proportion of Th2 T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Global gene analysis by RNA-seq shows that signalling molecules in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway are decreased in ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results suggest that endogenous ERMAP plays an important role in T-cell and macrophage homeostasis and EAE development.
40065721	HDAC11 in ovarian granulosa cells coordinates LH in the maturation of oocytes in Tan sheep.	Oocyte maturation plays an important role in supporting mammalian reproduction. Histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11), the only member of the class IV histone deacetylase family and the smallest histone deacetylases (HDACs), has been shown to regulate oocyte maturation in mice and pigs. However, the epigenetic effects of HDACs in follicular granulosa cells in response to LH induction remain elusive in sheep. In this study, the effects of follicular somatic cell-derived HDAC11 on oocyte maturation in Tan sheep are evaluated. The expression changes of HDAC11 and related proteins are detected by means of immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results indicate that the level of HDAC11 in follicular granulosa cells as well as oocytes in Tan sheep increases with the growth and maturation of the follicles. Specific inhibition of HDAC11 by SIS17 remarkably reduces the oocyte maturation rate under LH supplementation <i>in vitro</i>. Accordingly, the acetylation level of H3K9 in granulosa cells is increased, while the EGF-like growth factor AREG is remarkably decreased. Furthermore, inhibition of HDAC11 markedly decreases the level of YAP1, which is a negative regulator of AREG in granulosa cells. Conclusively, HDAC11 in the granulosa cells of Tan sheep contributes to the LH induced production of AREG during oocyte <i>in vitro</i> maturation by decreasing the level of H3K9 acetylation and increasing the level of YAP1.

Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT), produced by enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF), is crucial for ETBF-induced colitis. This study aims to investigate the impact of BFT-host interactions on N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of host mRNA and its underlying mechanisms.
40065730	LncRNA CASC2 mediates SOCS6 mRNA stabilization via U2AF2 recruitment to modulate macrophage polarisation in diabetic retinopathy.	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a prevalent microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of vision loss among diabetic individuals. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of DR by releasing cytokines and exosomal cargo, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), that modulate local immune responses, maintain retinal immune homeostasis and influence macrophage polarisation. Recent studies suggest that lncRNA cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (CASC2) may be involved in the regulation of DR progression. However, the regulatory mechanisms linking CASC2 with RPE cells and its role in macrophage polarisation remain insufficiently understood.
40065734	Isolation, phytochemical characterization, and inhibitory potential of essential oil from Citrus hystrix  DC. fruit peels against foodborne and phytopathogenic microbes.	Plant-based essential oils are currently targeted sources because of their non-toxic, bioactivity, and safety of non-targeted organisms. Various volatile components such as terpenoids, phenolics, and alkaloids make it compatible with broad-spectrum applications. In the current study, essential oil from Citrus hystrix DC. fruit peels were isolated. The GCMS analysis of the essential oil has confirmed the presence of various volatile components, in which 3-propylphenol has a maximum peak area percentage of 50.28%. The functional determination through FTIR detected the presence of aldehydic C-H and aldehydic carbonyl C=O group. Antioxidant capability also exhibited 55.61% DPPH scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 84.46 µg/ml. The antibacterial property analysis of essential oil against food spoilage-related bacteria through agar well diffusion methods reveals more effectiveness against gram-positive bacteria with 25 µg/ml MIC values. The antifungal activity analysis of essential oil against phytopathogenic fungi through agar dilution methods shows efficacy in controlling Fusarium oxysporum with the inhibitive percentage of 79.15% at the concentration of 250 µg/ml and Penicillium choerospondiatis with an inhibition percentage of 100% at the concentration of 250 µg/ml. This essential oil exhibits high potency for controlling food-spoilage-related bacteria and can be quite effective for controlling postharvest mold infection caused by phytopathogens.
40065746	Compound screening in human airway basal cells identifies Wnt pathway activators as potential pro-regenerative therapies.	Regeneration of the airway epithelium restores barrier function and mucociliary clearance following lung injury and infection. The mechanisms regulating the proliferation and differentiation of tissue-resident airway basal stem cells remain incompletely understood. To identify compounds that promote human airway basal cell proliferation, we performed phenotype-based compound screening of 1,429 compounds (from the ENZO and Prestwick Chemical libraries) in 384-well format using primary cells transduced with lentiviral luciferase. 17 pro-proliferative compounds were validated in independent donor cell cultures, including the antiretroviral therapy abacavir and several Wnt signalling pathway activating compounds. The effects of compounds on proliferation were further explored in colony formation and 3D organoid assays. Structurally and functionally-related compounds that more potently induced Wnt pathway activation were investigated. One such compound, 1-azakenpaullone, induced Wnt target gene activation and basal cell proliferation in mice. Our results demonstrate the pro-proliferative effect of small-molecule Wnt pathway activators on airway basal cells. These findings contribute to the rationale to develop novel approaches to modulate Wnt signalling during airway epithelial repair.
40065750	Dendritic polyglutamic acid-chelerythrine nanocomplex for the reversal of bacterial tooth decay.	Caries begin with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralization due to the continuous acid production by cariogenic bacteria. However, the development of dental materials that could prevent and treat caries <i>via</i> a simple and efficient mechanism has always been a challenge. To address this issue, therapeutic nanoparticles composed of a dendritic polyglutamic acid (DPGlu) and chelerythrine (CHE) complex (DPGlu@CHE) were developed <i>via</i> hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. DPGlu@CHE could be adsorbed onto the tooth surface, releasing CHE rapidly under acidic conditions to remove cariogenic bacteria, subsequently inducing tooth surface remineralization <i>in situ</i>. Our results demonstrated that more than 99% of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> on the tooth surface were killed, and 84% of the mechanical properties of tooth were restored within 2 weeks. Thus, DPGlu@CHE was proven to be a safe and effective enamel restoration material <i>in vitro</i>, and its safety was verified <i>in vivo</i>, making it a promising mouthwash ingredient to maintain dental health.
40065760	<sup>64</sup>Cu-chelated InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs as PET/fluorescence dual-modal probe for tumor imaging.	Positron emission tomography (PET)/fluorescence dual-modal imaging combines deep penetration and high resolution, making it a promising approach for tumor diagnostics. Semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant attention for fluorescence imaging owing to their tunable emission wavelength, high quantum yield, and excellent photostability. Among these QDs, heavy metal-free InP-based QDs have emerged as a promising candidate, addressing concerns regarding heavy metal-related toxicity. However, to the best of our knowledge, PET/fluorescence dual-modal imaging of InP QDs has yet to be explored. Here, we developed a novel PET/fluorescence imaging probe based on radioisotope (RI) -chelated InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs for tumor imaging. The surface of the InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs was functionalized with polyethylene glycol terminated with either a methoxy group or a 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelator group. Subsequently, the RI <sup>64</sup>Cu was chelated with DOTA on the surface of the InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs, integrating their bright fluorescence with radioactivity. Using the obtained <sup>64</sup>Cu-chelated InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs, PET/fluorescence dual-modal imaging of tumor-bearing mice was conducted, demonstrating successful multi-scale imaging from the whole body to the subcellular level. This novel PET/fluorescence dual-modal probe is expected to contribute to more precise tumor diagnosis.

40065768	Development of a novel anti-erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor B6 monoclonal antibody Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 for flow cytometry.	Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor B6 (EphB6) is a member of the largest Eph subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. EphB6 is widely expressed in various tissues and regulates cellular homeostasis by interacting with its membrane-bound ephrin ligands and other receptors. EphB6 is involved in cancer pathology despite lacking kinase activity. Developing sensitive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for EphB6 has been desired for treatment, diagnosis, and further analysis of EphB6. This study established a novel specific and sensitive anti-human EphB6 mAb clone Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 (mouse IgG<sub>1</sub>, kappa) by the Cell-Based Immunization and Screening (CBIS) method. In flow cytometry, Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 demonstrated reactivity with EphB6-overexpressed Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (CHO/EphB6) and endogenously EphB6-expressing DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells. Cross-reactivity of Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 was not observed. Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 demonstrated a moderate binding affinity (dissociation constant; <i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>) for CHO/EphB6 (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>: 2.6 ± 1.0 × 10<sup>-8</sup> M) and a high binding affinity for DLD-1 (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>: 3.4 ± 1.3 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M). Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 can detect EphB6 protein in CHO/EphB6 lysate in Western blot. Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3, established by the CBIS method, could be valuable for analyzing the EphB6-associated cellular functions and has potential applications in diagnosis and treatment with specificity and high affinity for cancer cells.
40065769	Unveiling functional module associated with fungal disease stress in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>).	Fungal infections pose a considerable threat to the cultivation of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and often limit the crop yield. During infection, the transcriptome undergoes extensive reprogramming involving several regulatory pathways. To address this complexity, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis and co-expression network analysis using rigorously curated RNA-seq datasets from three different fungal diseases. Pre-processing of the data, including batch effect correction, ensured high-quality integration of the datasets. Module-trait relationship (MTR) analysis identified functional modules associated with fungal disease response. Hub genes within these modules were prioritized by multi-model centrality analyses using Cytoscape, which considered the metrics Degree, Closeness, Betweenness and Maximum Clique Centrality together with the MCODE algorithm to detect densely connected subclusters. These hub genes were further validated by cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and achieved AUC values greater than 0.7, confirming their robustness. A total of 6688 consistently expressed genes were identified, including 879 upregulated and 701 downregulated genes. Co-expression networks revealed 19 different gene modules, six of which were significantly associated with the response of barley to fungal infection. The blue module in particular was associated with immune responses such as activation of the MAPK cascade and pathogen recognition, while the green module correlated with defence mechanisms and secondary metabolism. The hub genes within these modules showed high predictive power for fungal resistance, as shown by the AUC values of the ROC curve of over 0.7, emphasizing their potential as biomarkers. This study uniquely integrates multiple RNA-seq datasets to identify novel regulatory networks and hub genes, including 345 transcription factors (TFs) from different families, with MYB and bHLH being particularly abundant. The results provide valuable insights into regulatory networks associated with fungal disease response in barley. These results can support genomic selection and marker-assisted breeding programs and accelerate the development of resistant varieties.
40065784	Resolving phylogenetic conflicts in Pandanales: the dual roles of gene flow and whole-genome duplication.	Accurate phylogenetic reconstruction is crucial for understanding evolutionary relationships and biodiversity. Despite advances in molecular systematics, the relationships within Pandanales-which include Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae, Stemonaceae, Triuridaceae, and Velloziaceae-remain unresolved. This study aims to clarify these relationships by analyzing transcriptomic and genomic data from these families.
40065785	Empowering vital fruit crops with enhanced nutritional contents.	Increasing the nutritional value of any crop plant through various Conventional or non-Conventional methods is known as Biofortification. Deficiency of proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals leads to ailing health and increased vulnerability to various diseases, which in turn lead to uncountable and unpredicted loss in Gross Domestic Product leading to poor economic growth of the country. It is forthcoming and cost-effective approach that will provide a balance of micronutrient deficiency among the people of developing & underdeveloped nations not having the availability to diverse nutritional access. The Biofortified varieties not only provide required calories but also essential nutrients needed for proper growth and development of an individual. It is advantageous in combating malnutrition and hidden hunger by enhancing the micronutrient content of commonly consumed fruits. By increasing essential vitamins, minerals, and beneficial compounds through methods like traditional breeding, genetic engineering, and agronomic practices, biofortified fruits provide a sustainable solution to address deficiencies in regions with limited access to diverse foods. For instance, mango, guava, papaya, and citrus have been improved to offer higher levels of nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin C, and beta-carotene. This makes biofortified fruits a cost-effective way to enhance nutrition, particularly for vulnerable populations, helping to reduce the risks associated with hidden hunger and malnutrition. One of the important targets of United Nation is to provide fortified food enriched with important minerals to the targeted undernourished population in different parts of the world. The lack of essential nutrients, notably minerals such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and vitamin A, is one of the main causes of "hidden hunger", especially in underdeveloped nations. The review covers most of the important aspects of Biofortification in important fruit crops.
40065787	Assessment of metal residues in soil and evaluate the plant accumulation in copper mine tailings of Dongchuan, Southwest China.

40065790	Provenance differences and factors influencing transpiration of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> in a common garden experiment.	Tree transpiration is a key component of forest evapotranspiration, and sap flow monitoring is the primary way to study tree canopy transpiration and water consumption. However, provenance differences in transpiration and the unique responses to environmental factors are not well understood. We measured the sap flow and calculated the canopy evapotranspiration (Ec) of 15 Chinese fir provenances from five provinces in a common garden and monitored soil moisture and meteorological variables between September 2020 and September 2022. Mean daily Ec of the provenances from Guangxi (GX), Sichuan (SC), Anhui (AH), Yunan (YN), and Zhejiang (ZJ) were 1.31 ± 0.99 g·d<sup>-1</sup>, 1.59 ± 1.18 g·d<sup>-1</sup>, 1.62 ± 1.43 g·d<sup>-1</sup>, 1.41 ± 1.01 g·d<sup>-1</sup>, and 1.48 ± 1.13 g·d<sup>-1</sup> during the study period, respectively. The mean daily Ec of Guangxi, Sichuan, Anhui, Yunan, and Zhejiang provenances exhibited significant differences (<i>p</i> <0.01). Overall, the Ec of these provenances was high from June to August. Soil moisture had different effects on the Ec of the provenances. The provenances from Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Anhui showed higher Ec values when REW <0.4 than REW≥0.4 conditions, but the Ec of Guangxi and Yunnan provenances showed no significant differences under the two conditions. When the soil was relatively moist, Ec of the provenances was mainly influenced by Rs and VPD. When the soil was relatively dry, the main influencing factors were the Ta and VPD. Overall, our findings revealed different provenance-specific responses of Ec to biophysical factors, providing valuable insights for the selection of superior provenances of Chinese fir from the perspective of water use in the context of a changing climate.
40065791	Corrigendum: Genetic variation in host-specific competitiveness of the symbiont <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> Symbiovar <i>viciae</i>.	[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fpls.2021.719987.].
40065792	Divergent response associates with the differential amplitudes of immunity against <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> by different blast resistance genes.	Rice blast disease, caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, poses the most devastating threat to global rice production. The products of most blast resistance (<i>R</i>) genes specifically recognize corresponding a virulence effectors from the pathogen, thereby mediating robust immune responses that are crucial for disease resistance. However, it is unclear why different <i>R</i> genes endow with differential amplitudes of immunity against <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>. Here, we demonstrated that different blast <i>R</i> genes confer differential amplitudes of immunity against <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>, presumably due to divergent reprogramming of transcriptional responses. We detected that three rice restorer lines exhibited differential amplitudes of immune responses, despite all lines displaying resistance to <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>. Consistently, different accessions carrying different single <i>R</i> genes exhibited remarkable differentially expressed genes (DEGs) count, indicating different transcriptional re-programming that leads to different fitness cost. Comparative analysis revealed varying degrees of overlap among DEGs across different accessions. By integrating RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data, we recommended some marker genes that distinguish the differential amplitude of immunity against <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i> mediated by different blast <i>R</i> genes. Thus, our study provides valuable insights into the specific and overlapping roles of <i>R</i> gene-mediated immunity. We also propose marker genes that can be used to effectively evaluate the amplitude of immune responses to <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>, thereby facilitating the assessment of <i>R</i> genes with relatively lower amplitude of immunity in order to minimize fitness cost.

40065806	Obesity drives dysregulation in DC responses to viral infection.	Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, with over 1 billion people worldwide living with obesity. It is associated with an increased risk of over 200 chronic co-morbidities, including an increased susceptibility to infection. Numerous studies have highlighted the dysfunction caused by obesity on a wide range of immune cell subsets, including dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are innate immune sentinels that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems. DCs provide critical signals that instruct and shape the immune response. Our group has previously reported that DCs from people with obesity display defective cytokine production; however, the mechanisms underpinning these defects are unclear.
40065807	Comparison of naturalization mouse model setups uncover distinct effects on intestinal mucosa depending on microbial experience.	Concerns regarding the translational value of preclinical mouse models have been addressed by introducing various approaches of 'naturalizing' research mice, which provide them with more diverse microbiomes and physiological immune responses. We have previously shown that 'feralized' mice, that is, inbred laboratory mice raised in a farmyard-like, microbe-rich environment exhibit a shifted gut microbiota, matured immunophenotype, and reduced severity of colorectal cancer. Similar studies occasionally involve co-housing with wild or pet-store-raised mice as microbial donors integrating species-specific commensals and pathogens. To what extent these different practices of microbial exposure are crucial for the resulting mouse phenotype remains unclear.
40065827	A Posteriori Error Analysis for a Coupled Stokes-Poroelastic System with Multiple Compartments.	The computational effort entailed in the discretization of fluid-poromechanics systems is typically highly demanding. This is particularly true for models of multiphysics flows in the brain, due to the geometrical complexity of the cerebral anatomy-requiring a very fine computational mesh for finite element discretization-and to the high number of variables involved. Indeed, this kind of problems can be modeled by a coupled system encompassing the Stokes equations for the cerebrospinal fluid in the brain ventricles and Multiple-network Poro-Elasticity (MPE) equations describing the brain tissue, the interstitial fluid, and the blood vascular networks at different space scales. The present work aims to rigorously derive a posteriori error estimates for the coupled Stokes-MPE problem, as a first step towards the design of adaptive refinement strategies or reduced order models to decrease the computational demand of the problem. Through numerical experiments, we verify the reliability and optimal efficiency of the proposed a posteriori estimator and identify the role of the different solution variables in its composition.
40065834	Raising the bar in respiratory care by EUFOREA: report of the European Union Parliament Symposium, April 2024.	In April 2024, the European Summit "<i>Raising the bar in respiratory care"</i> was organized by the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) in the European Parliament and hosted by Members of the European Parliament Dorien Rookmaker and Mislav Kolakušić. The aim of the Summit was to respond to the need of European patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) by joining forces with European and global organisations in the management of the epidemics of CRD, recognising the weaknesses of current care models and focussing on collaboration to improve care and prevention. Participants belonging to International and National Societies and Committees from the European Rhinologic Society (ERS), International Rhinologic Society (IRS), Belgian Respiratory Society (BeRS), Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD), and from the European Federation of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients Associations (EFA) and the EUFOREA's Patient Advisory Board (PAB) described their vision and action plan to work in partnership to raise the bar in respiratory care. This report summarizes the contributions of the representatives of different European stakeholders in the field of CRDs.
40065838	The tumor coagulome as a potential biological determinant of postsurgical recurrence of oral squamous cell carcinoma.	The tumor coagulome is an intrinsic characteristic of human tumors and a key determinant of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT). Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) establish a local procoagulant state that contributes to a broad range of vascular complications, and potentially also to tumor progression. Recent clinical studies suggest that biomarkers of coagulation might be of interest for predicting postsurgical recurrence of OSCC, but it remains unclear whether specific properties of the coagulome of OSCC are conducive to postsurgical recurrence. We examined this possibility using transcriptomic analyses of OSCC.
40065841	Novel idebenone derivatives attenuated oxidative stress injury and myocardial damage.	Oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was the primary causative factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the existing therapy drugs for oxidative stress were much less investigated, which underlined the necessity for new drug discovery and development. Herein, we aimed to synthesize several novel idebenone (IDE) derivatives and investigate the protective effect and mechanism of these derivatives against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress injury in H9C2 cells by determining cell proliferation rate, detecting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and the expression of related proteins. Additionally, the study also investigated the protective effect of IDE-1 pretreatment on Balb/c mice after hypoxia-reoxygenation. <i>In vivo</i> experiments, the damage to cardiomyocytes was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The results showed that IDE-1 possessed the highest antioxidant damage activity among all IDE derivatives, which could notably decrease the levels of intracellular ROS. Furthermore, the antioxidant mechanism was confirmed to be potentially linked to the expression levels of the oxidation-related pathway heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the apoptosis-related pathway Bcl-2/Bax and caspase-3. Our results demonstrated that IDE derivatives could be a new research direction for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases associated with oxidative stress.
40065879	Successful BRCA2 Mutation Detection via Tissue-Based Gene Panel Testing in Post-bone Marrow Transplant Breast Cancer: Implications for Precision Medicine.	<i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> (<i>BRCA1/2</i>) mutation screening is recommended for patients with advanced breast cancer or early breast cancer suspected to have hereditary origins based on family history or tumor characteristics. Blood-based testing is the standard approach, but it is not feasible in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation due to the replacement of blood cells with donor-derived cells. We report a case of a patient who, following bone marrow transplantation, required an alternative to blood-based germline <i>BRCA1/2</i> screening. A germline <i>BRCA2</i> mutation was inferred through tissue-based gene panel testing on a tumor sample, using variant allele frequency analysis. This approach allowed the initiation of targeted therapy with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, resulting in sustained progression-free intervals. This case demonstrates the potential of tissue-based gene panel testing to identify actionable germline mutations in breast cancer patients when blood-based testing is not feasible, thereby expanding therapeutic options in complex clinical scenarios.
40065899	Transcanal Endoscopic Repair of Cerebrospinal Fluid Otorrhea Secondary to Congenital Inner Ear Anomaly Using Topical Fluorescein.	An eight-year-old female, known to have sensorineural hearing loss due to inner ear anomalies, presented with a history of recurrent attacks of right acute otitis media complicated by bacterial meningitis. Temporal bone computed tomography showed right middle ear and mastoid effusion without bony dehiscence or erosion, with features of common cavity inner ear anomaly on the right side. Given the patient's inner ear malformation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea was suspected. Further evaluation with myringocentesis and beta trace protein analysis confirmed the diagnosis. The patient underwent transcanal endoscopic right ear exploration. Initially, the site of the defect was not revealed; the CSF leak was successfully localized at the oval window, surrounding the stapes footplate. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, describing topical fluorescein application in a transcanal endoscopic approach to obliterating CSF otorrhea due to inner ear malformation.
40065908	<i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> Alleviates Colitis by Regulating FXR-NLRP3 Mediated Macrophage Pyroptosis.	Ulcerative colitis (UC), a typical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is pathologically defined by mucosal inflammation confined to the colonic mucosa. <i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> (Sb), a commonly utilized probiotic yeast for managing digestive disorders like UC, has not been thoroughly investigated regarding its precise mechanisms for alleviating colitis. Increasing evidence indicates the involvement of FXR in UC. Meanwhile, the regulatory role of FXR on NLRP3 has garnered increasing attention. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of Sb supernatant (SbS) on colitis and elucidated the role of the FXR-NLRP3 signaling pathway in this process.
40065909	Adenosine A2A Receptor Activation Alleviated Disease of Mice with Systemic <i>Candida albicans</i> Infection by Regulating Macrophage Function.	The incidence of candidemia, mediated by systemic <i>Candida albicans</i> (<i>C. albicans</i>) infection, was increasing. It is an urgent need to understand the underlying disease mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets. This study aimed to investigate the roles of adenosine-adenosine receptor signal in systemic <i>C. albicans</i> infection.
40065910	The Effect of Acupuncture on the Morphology and Neural Coding Damage of the Central Amygdala in Mice with Chronic Inflammatory Pain and Depression.	Observing the effects and roles of acupuncture on the morphology and neural coding damage of central amygdala (CeA) neurons in chronic inflammatory pain with depression (CIPD) mice and exploring the central nervous mechanism of acupuncture intervention in CIPD.
40065911	Intrinsic retinoic acid synthesis is required for oligodendrocyte progenitor expansion during CNS remyelination.	Myelin regeneration (remyelination) in the CNS depends on the recruitment, proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at demyelinated lesions. However, despite the presence of OPCs, very few oligodendrocytes and myelin are regenerated in chronic multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions for reasons that remain poorly understood. Here, using a spontaneous remyelination model in mice, we found that retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2), a rate-limiting enzyme for retinoic acid (RA) synthesis, is upregulated in OPCs and in a subpopulation of microglia/macrophages during remyelination. Tamoxifen induced deletion of Raldh2 globally, or conditionally in OPCs, resulted in significantly fewer proliferating OPCs in lesions, leading to decreased oligodendrocyte numbers and myelin density. Moreover, induced deletion of Raldh2 globally also resulted in increased microglia/macrophage density in lesions. Further, exogenous RA delivery into lesions significantly increased oligodendrocyte lineage cells, while also decreasing proinflammatory microglia/macrophages, with no significant effect on anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages. Postmortem MS brain sections revealed Raldh2 was absent in the majority of OPCs in chronic inactive lesions compared to the other lesion types. These results suggest that Raldh2 upregulation in lesions is critical for OPC proliferation during remyelination, and reveal that the failure to regenerate sufficient oligodendrocytes and myelin in chronic MS lesions may arise from impaired OPC expansion due to the failure to intrinsically synthesize RA.
40065912	Self-reported history of head injury is associated with cognitive impulsivity on a delay discounting task.	Head injuries are a major health care concern that can produce many long lasting cognitive, mental, and physical problems. An emerging literature indicates increased impulsivity in patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). In a recent study, Veterans with clinically-assessed history of mild TBI had increased cognitive, but not motor, impulsivity. Cognitive impulsivity refers to a preference for smaller immediate rewards (<i>i.e.</i>, less willing to wait for larger rewards) while motor impulsivity refers to difficulty inhibiting a motor response. This study extended this work to investigating cognitive and motor impulsivity in a non-clinical sample of putatively healthy undergraduates self-reporting a history of head injury.
40065917	Broad repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus in Alzheimer's disease: A rationale and study design.	Brain network dysfunction, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), is an increasingly apparent contributor to the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can target key DMN hubs, maintain signaling function, and delay or improve clinical outcomes in AD. Here, we present the rationale and design of a study using off-the-shelf equipment and the latest clinical evidence to expand on prior rTMS work and reduce participant burden in the process.
40065918	Perspective: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.	The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is a measure of the minimal clinically relevant change. The MCID represents the smallest difference in score on the measure or domain of interest which patients or clinicians perceive as beneficial or as meaningful decline. The MCID is not an alternative clinical trial outcome; it does not apply to group measures and is used as a means of determining whether an individual patient has reached a threshold of change. MCIDs have been derived for symptomatic treatments and for disease targeted therapies. MCIDs have been derived for nearly all clinical trial instruments used in AD therapeutic research. Application of the MCID to patients on disease-targeted therapies requires awareness of the expected increasing treatment-no treatment difference exhibited by these agents. The MCID complements other strategies for assessing the meaningfulness of interventions including effect size, number needed to treat, responder analyses, time saved, quality of life, and quality-adjusted life years. MCID is not a required measure for regulatory approval of a therapeutic since it is applicable to individual patients and not to group outcomes or mean differences used to determine treatment benefit in clinical trials.
40065921	Phylogenomic Analysis Reveals Evolutionary Relationships of Tropical Drosophilidae: From <i>Drosophila</i> to <i>Scaptodrosophila</i>.	Species radiation in the family Drosophilidae has led to a diversity of species occupying a wide range of ecological niches. Despite the high diversity within this family, with over thousands of species and more than a hundred species recorded in Thailand and the Malay Peninsula, taxonomic classifications remain complicated due to morphological plasticity and inconsistent phylogenetic reconstructions based on limited genetic data. In this study, we assemble new mitochondrial genomes from <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Scaptodrosophila</i> species collected in Thailand, expanding the genomic resources for these underexplored tropical regions. Phylogenetic analyses of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes revealed well-supported evolutionary relationships, with <i>Scaptodrosophila</i> forming a distinct lineage and several <i>Drosophila</i> subgroups, such as <i>ananassae</i>, <i>montium</i>, and <i>melanogaster</i>, exhibiting monophyly. Notable discrepancies were observed in the placement of the <i>suzukii</i> subgroup, which was not recovered as monophyletic, and the position of the <i>punjabiensis</i> subgroup, reflecting the complexities of lineage sorting and hybridization events. This comprehensive genomic analysis provides a more accurate understanding of evolutionary relationships within the family Drosophilidae's diversification in the tropics.
40065924	Quantitative Ethnobotany of Multiple-Use Species and Management of the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	The Yangambi Biosphere Reserve (YBR) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) faces significant challenges regarding the livelihoods of local communities and biodiversity conservation. The lack of scientific information on the spatial distribution of useful woody species hinders sustainable forest resource management and is a development constraint. This study was conducted in the villages of Yaselia, Lilanda, and Bagbanye on the outskirts of the protected area and aimed to identify the most useful woody species, analyze their socio-cultural value, assess their uses based on local community involvement, and evaluate their abundance beyond village forests to contribute to reforestation and conservation policies. An ethnobotanical survey of 105 households and a forest inventory of 9 ha were conducted to assess the abundance of 29 useful woody species. The results revealed that species such as <i>Entandrophragma cylindricum</i> (Sprague) Sprague and Hoyle<i>, Petersianthus macrocarpus</i> (P.Beauv.) Liben, <i>Ricinodendron heudelotii</i> (Baill.) Pierre ex Heckel, <i>Scorodophloeus zenkeri</i> Harms, <i>Pentaclethra macrophylla</i> Benth., <i>Uapaca guineensis</i> Müll.Arg., <i>Blighia welwitschii</i> (Hiern) Radlk., <i>Chrysophyllum lacourtianum</i> De Wild., <i>Dacryodes edulis</i> (G.Don) H.J.Lam, <i>and Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</i> (De Wild.) J.Léonard have high use and cultural value for local communities. The forest inventory showed that primary forests are better represented in terms of abundance and biomass of species with high use and cultural value, while fallow lands are less diverse and dominated by small-diameter trees. However, most of the useful species identified with high use and cultural value have low density/biomass or are absent in most of the plots in secondary forests and fallow land. These results underscore the urgent need to implement sustainable management strategies that include these species through traditional agroforestry projects. Such initiatives would enhance resource valorization, support local livelihoods, and reduce pressure on the YBR, contributing to the preservation of this biodiversity sanctuary and the promotion of sustainable forest management in the region.
40065930	Morphometric Analysis of Pterygomaxillary Fissure in Dry Skulls and its Clinical Significance During Head and Neck Injury.	The divergence of the maxilla from the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone forms the pterygomaxillary fissure, which lies in the medial part of the infratemporal fossa. It transmits the posterior superior alveolar nerve and the terminal segment of the internal maxillary artery and connects the infratemporal fossa with the pterygopalatine fossa. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the height, width and distance of the pterygomaxillary fissure from the zygomatic bone, articular tubercle, and zygomatico-temporal suture. Forty dry human skulls were examined by the Department of Anatomy. Using a digital caliper, the right and left sides of the skulls of both sexes were measured for height, width, and distance from the upper end of the pterygomaxillary fissure to the articular tubercle of the zygomatic arch (AB), zygomaticotemporal suture (AC), and zygomatic body (AD). The average height of the pterygomaxillary fissure was 22.68 mm in males & 22.34 mm in females, the width was 7.33 mm in males & 7.22 mm in females, distance from the articular tubercle (AB) was 33.37 mm in males & 31.79 mm in female, zygomatic temporal suture (AC) was 36.91 mm in male & 34.89 mm in female, zygomatic bone (AD) was 29.88 mm in male &28.44 mm in female. There is no statistically significant difference between the right and left sides of the skulls of both genders. Because fissures smaller than 2 mm may prevent neurostimulator implants from being inserted into the pterygopalatine fossa, this study attempted to determine the location of the pterygomaxillary fissure using the three anatomical markers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when performing maxillofacial procedures on female patients.
40065940	A Case of Saddle Nose Deformity Secondary to Lepromatous Leprosy.	Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium leprae affecting most commonly skin and peripheral nerves. Patients with Lepromatous Leprosy remain asymptomatic for years, and harbor bacteria in the nasal cavity, and these patients are responsible for the transmission of the disease in the community. In the advanced stage (stages 4 and 5) the involvement of nasal septum results in saddle nose deformity in most patients.
40065954	Mammaglobin negative secretory carcinoma of salivary gland--a diagnostically challenging case report.	Secretory carcinoma, impacting the salivary gland, embodies a low-intermediate grade malignancy characterized by the propensity for local dissemination. The fourth edition of the 2017 head and neck World Health Organization's repertoire has recently integrated SC of the salivary gland into its classification scheme. We aim to delve into a case involving a 35-year-old female presenting with swelling on the left side of her face, persisting for the past 12 years, and exhibiting a negative mammaglobin status.
40065962	Peripheral Odontogenic Myxoma in Anterior Maxilla: A Case Report.	Peripheral odontogenic myxoma (POM), a rare and extra-osseous variant of odontogenic myxoma (OM), is classified as a relatively rare benign odontogenic tumour, yet presenting with locally aggressive behaviour and a wide range of variable clinical presentations. The objective of this case report is to present a patient who reported with the complaint of pus discharge in upper front region of the jaw, in the past one month. No associated history of tooth loss, impacted teeth or intracanal infection was noted clinically as well as radiographically. The lesion was completely excised and was sent for histopathological examination, which was diagnosed to be POM. Thereby, such cases reported in the clinics or the tertiary care hospitals should not come as a surprise as they are encountered commonly and should be diagnosed to be of apt quality.
40065971	Lipoid Proteinosis-An Unusual Cause of Hoarseness of Voice in a Child: Case Report.	Lipoid proteinosis is a rare hereditary multisystemic familial disorder characterised by intracellular deposition of hyaline material (Rao and Koppada in Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol, 2015; Shah and Shah in J Oral Maxillofac Pathol 26:236-241, 2022). The hallmark findings are pox like scarred skin lesion, hoarseness of voice and selective brain parenchymal calcification (Rao and Koppada in Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol, 2015). We present a case of biopsy proven lipoid proteinosis with typical radiological findings.

Sialadenoma papilliferum (SP) is a rare benign neoplasm, commonly affecting the minor salivary glands of the palate. Here we report a case SP, clinically presenting as a verruco-papillary lesion, which was diagnosed based on its characteristic histopathologic features, along with a brief review of literature.
40065976	Solvation, geometry, and assembly of the tobacco mosaic virus.	Biological self-assembly is a fundamental aspect in the development of complex structures in nature. A paradigm for such a process is the assembly of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) capsid proteins into helical rods around the viral genome. The self-assembly process of the virus is typically modelled through attractive interactions between protein subunits, however capsid proteins also interact with their aqueous environment through solvation free energy. An open question is what role solvation plays in virus self-assembly. Here, we show that a purely geometric model of nonpolar solvation free energy, the morphometric approach, is sufficient to simulate the assembly of up to three protein subunits of TMV. The lowest solvation free energy states we find in a geometric simulation setting are remarkably close to the correctly assembled states of various experimentally determined structures. This demonstrates that van der Waals forces and entropic considerations are sufficient to guide assembly in the absence of attractive interactions between protein subunits. It further illustrates the impact of the morphometric approach as a computationally efficient model for nonpolar solvation free energy of solutes, in particular those with complicated geometry. This demonstration of the role of solvation raises important questions about the driving forces behind biological self-assembly and the paramount role of geometry.
40065993	Association between RC/HDL-C and hyperuricemia in adults: evidence from NHANES 2005-2018.	The incidence of hyperuricemia is growing in the world, with a significant influence on the survival and healthy condition of the patient. The connection between serum residual cholesterol (RC) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio and hyperuricemia is uncertain. Consequently, we tried to elucidate the connection between the hyperuricemia and RC/HDL-C ratio.
40065997	The assembly and annotation of two teinturier grapevine varieties, Dakapo and Rubired.	Teinturier grapevines, known for their pigmented flesh berries due to anthocyanin production, are valuable for enhancing the pigmentation of wine, for potential health benefits, and for investigating anthocyanin production in plants. Here, we assembled and annotated the Dakapo and Rubired genomes, two teinturier varieties. For Dakapo, we combined Nanopore sequencing, Illumina sequencing, and scaffolding to the existing grapevine assembly to generate a final assembly of 508.5 Mbp. Combining <i>de novo</i> annotation and lifting over annotations from the existing grapevine reference produced annotation 36,940 gene annotations for Dakapo. For Rubired, PacBio HiFi reads were assembled, scaffolded, and phased to generate a diploid assembly with two haplotypes 474.7-476.0 Mbp long. <i>De novo</i> annotation of the diploid Rubired genome yielded annotations for 56,681 genes. Both genomes are highly contiguous and complete. The Dakapo and Rubired genome assemblies provide genetic resources for investigations into berry flesh pigmentation and other traits of interest in grapevine.

40066021	Anaerobic digestion of whey permeate: Impact of feedstock ratio and organic loading rate in batch and semi-continuous systems.	Anaerobic digestion (AD) plants have been facing significant challenges in maintaining a stable long-time operation when utilizing whey permeate as feedstock. In this study, we investigated the AD performance of whey permeate under batch and semi-continuous stirred tank reactor (s-CSTR) systems to optimize the process. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were initially performed in batch reactors to assess whey permeate potential as AD substrate operating at different inoculum to substrate ratios (ISRs) and pH values under mesophilic temperatures. The kinetic parameters from the best AD performance under batch system were assessed to be used as guideline for s-CSTR operational set ups. The highest methane yield of 653.64 ± 12.16 NL<sub>CH4</sub>kg<sub>VS</sub> <sup>-1</sup> was observed at ISR 2, initial pH 7.5 at 37 °C incubation under batch system. However, when the kinetic parameters from this condition were applied to determine the organic loading rate (OLR) and hydraulic retention times (HRT) in the s-CSTRs, resulted in operational failure. The s-CSTRs were then operated at OLR 2.5 and 4 g<sub>VS</sub>L<sup>-1</sup>d<sup>-1</sup> with 30 d HRT for 150 d to assess the effect of different feeding regimes towards the overall AD performance. The CH<sub>4</sub> production rate declined for 3 HRTs in all reactors before stabilizing for the rest of the experiment. The decline of CH<sub>4</sub> rate was observed to be correlated with volatile solids degradation, volatile fatty acids and microbial composition. Initially, acetogenic bacteria (e.g., <i>Trichococcus</i> and <i>Sedimentibacter</i>) dominated the digestate which shifted to propionic acid producing bacteria (e.g., <i>Actinomyces</i> and <i>Acidipropionibacterium</i>) over the course of 150 d. A change in archaeal abundance was also observed where abundant <i>Methanosarcina</i> declined and finally substituted by <i>Methanobacterium</i>. The change in microbial population of whey permeate AD under s-CSTR system in our study, suggests a shift in methanogenesis pathway, which directly affects the AD performance.
40066030	A novel signature predicts prognosis in pancreatic cancer based on tumor membrane-associated genes.	Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of tumor-related mortality, characterized by short patient survival times and limited treatment options. Some targeted therapies have not succeeded in improving patient prognosis. Tumor membranes possess potential target specificity, offering hope for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy and drug treatment.
40066032	Proteome-wide identification of druggable targets and inhibitors for multidrug-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> using an integrative subtractive proteomics and virtual screening approach.	<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a versatile and antibiotic-resistant gram-negative pathogen, poses a critical threat to both immunocompromised and immunocompetent populations, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic targets. This study applies an extensive subtractive proteomics approach to identify viable drug targets within the core proteome of <i>P. aeruginosa PAO1</i>, analyzing a total of 5563 proteins. Through a rigorous, multi-stage process, we excluded human homologs, identified essential proteins, mapped functional pathways, determined subcellular localization, and assessed virulence and resistance factors. This comprehensive analysis led to the identification of three novel, druggable targets integral to <i>P. aeruginosa's</i> pathogenicity and multidrug resistance: preprotein translocase subunit SecD, chemotaxis-specific methyl esterase, and imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisF2. Following this, inverse virtual screening of 464,867 compounds from the VITAS-M library, performed using Schrödinger's Glide module, initially pinpointed 15 potent hits with favorable binding affinities and pharmacokinetic profiles as confirmed by QikProp analysis. Subsequent molecular dynamics, MMPBSA and DFT calculations refined these to three promising candidates: STK417467 for imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisF2, STL321396 for chemotaxis-specific methylesterase, and STL243336 for preprotein translocase subunit SecD. These compounds show strong potential as inhibitors and could be developed further as therapeutic agents against multidrug-resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections. This study provides a robust computational framework for the discovery of drug targets and candidate inhibitors, marking a significant step toward effective treatments for resistant <i>Pseudomonas</i> infections.
40066033	T and NK cell functionality in a patient harboring heterozygous novel BCL11B p.Asp632fsAla∗91 and STX11 p.R129P mutations.	BCL11B is a transcription factor essential for central nervous system development and T-cell differentiation that regulates numerous genes across various pathways. Heterozygous BCL11B defects can lead to a broad spectrum of phenotypes, including neurological disorders with or without immunological features. STX11 encodes a t-SNARE protein crucial for the final fusion of lytic granules with the plasma membrane of NK-cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Biallelic mutations in STX11 are linked to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 4. We analyzed the functional impact of heterozygous BCL11B (p.Asp632fsAla∗91) and STX11 (p.R129P) variants present in a pediatric patient with Evans syndrome and neurodevelopmental delay, without hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis presentation. The BCL11B p.Asp632fsAla∗91 variant, positioned to escape nonsense-mediated decay, likely produces a truncated protein losing three zinc finger domains. Given that BCL11B is involved in the activation of IL-2 gene expression, we evaluated this function and found a reduced IL-2 production by the patient's CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. On the other hand, structural analysis of STX11 indicated that the proline substitution at position 129 could disrupt key interactions with Munc18-2. The patient's cells exhibited decreased NK-cell degranulation and cytotoxicity, and diminished CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell degranulation compared to healthy donors. <i>In vitro</i> IL-2 treatment restored these functions to healthy donor levels. We also observed a reduced STX11 protein expression in patient PBMCs. We hypothesize that impaired IL-2 secretion caused by the BCL11B mutation may reduce the patient's ability to compensate for STX11 dysfunction, suggesting that the combined effect of BCL11B and STX11 mutations contributes to the observed immune dysfunction and the patient's complex phenotype. Additionally, our findings suggest that abnormal NK- and T-cells function could play a role in the onset of autoimmune disorders.
40066035	Pharmaceutical applications of halophilic enzymes.	Halophiles produce extraordinarily stable enzymes under conditions where conventional enzymes cease to function, denature, and precipitate. Halophilic enzymes have adapted to function optimally at high salt concentrations besides tolerance of organic solvents and thermal stability. These special features offer potential advantages of cost-effectiveness and improved treatment outcomes that make them valuable for pharmaceutical purposes including the synthesis, design, and discovery of new drugs. The article highlights the unique characteristics and adaptation strategies of halophiles towards salinity. It provides an overview of halophilic enzymes' pharmaceutical applications and examines different challenges, opportunities, and recent advances in applying these enzymes in this field.
40066039	Development and evaluation of BDNF-loaded PCL/PVA two-layer nerve guidance conduit with enhanced biomechanical and biological properties for peripheral nerve regeneration.	The repair of damaged peripheral nerves and the following restoration of functionality remain significant therapeutic challenges. Hollow nerve conduits currently available do not align with the ideal human model. Successfully mending nerve gaps requires incorporating biomimetic and functional features into neural conduit design. In this research, a new two-layer conduit that combines topographic support and controlled growth factor release was developed. We used a two-layered framework to amplify the mechanical reinforcement and reduce the risk of tissue collapse post-grafting. The hollow nerve conduits were fabricated through three-dimensional printing, employing Polycaprolactone (PCL) and a slowly biodegradable nanofiber for the intraluminal brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF)-loaded polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/PCL core-shell. The contact angle was indicated to show the hydrophilicity properties and degradation rate for biocompatibility. The scanning electron microscope <b>(</b>SEM) images were analyzed to determine the fiber's diameters, structure morphology, and stem cell adhesion. The performance of core-shell conduits was investigated in human dental pulp stem cells <b>(</b>hDPSC) culture and their differentiation into Schwann cells (SCs) <i>invitro</i>. The vitality of samples was assessed using SEM, MTT assay, and differentiation potential with real-time and Immunofluorescence staining techniques. <i>Invitro</i> cumulated BDNF release followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, demonstrating a strong correlation coefficient of 0.981. Real-time analysis showed that after 14 days of induction, the expression of S100 increased 5.89-fold. We concluded that core-shell PCL/PVA nerve guidance conduits can encourage the adhesion and proliferation of hDPSCs and create the ideal environment for increasing cell survival. Also, the sustained release of BDNF within conduit walls promoted differentiation toward SC.
40066041	Extent of natural soil cadmium, its bioavailability, and pollution treat analysis in the agroforestry systems of the Gedeo Zone of southern Ethiopia.	The research objectives were to determine extent of soil cadmium (Cd) in the major soil types of the Gedeo Zone of Ethiopia thereby assessing the pollution risk on the environmental health. Four profile pits representing Luvisols, Nitisols, Cambisols, and Leptosols, were excavated and soil samples were collected. Total and available Cd, Cu, Zn, and Mn, including other major soil physicochemical properties, were analyzed in the lab. The permutational multivariate analysis of variance results indicated that the significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) level of heterogeneity between soil types is confined to subsurface horizons. The nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination plots also show a marked difference between the physicochemical properties of the subsurface horizons of the Luvisol and the remaining soil types. The mean total Cd levels were high for all soil types and horizons in the range of 5.82-8.48 ppm, however, the mean available Cd contents were low (0.69-0.90 ppm). One-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis test results revealed a significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) soil type effect on total and available Cd contents between the corresponding soil horizons. Based on the single pollution and the Nemerow comprehensive pollution indices, the pollution risk decreases in the order of Cd > Mn > Zn > Cu pollution. According to Pearson's correlation results, no correlation exists between total and available Cd, whereas very strong and significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) correlations are present between total Cd and total nitrogen (<i>r</i> = 0.90), electrical conductivity (<i>r</i> = 0.83), and organic matter (<i>r</i> = 0.77). Our results indicate that Cd contamination is of geogenic origin, further aggravated by organic matter amendments. More research are needed, among other things, to know the Cd status of the major crops grown in the area so as to design appropriate Cd management strategies.
40066042	Characterization of the immune cell infiltration patterns in lung adenocarcinoma to facilitate immunotherapy.	Although Immunotherapy has emerged as an efficient treatment in lung carcinoma, merely a subset of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients could be benefited from it. Increasing evidence revealed that tumor immune cell infiltrating (ICI) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly related to patient prognosis and characteristics of the tumor. Thus far, the immune cell infiltration patterns of LUAD remain unclear. Herein, ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT algorithms were conducted to characterize the ICI patterns of 1155 patients with LUAD. Three ICI subtypes were determined, and the ICI score was constructed by performing PCA. A high ICI score group referred to increased activation of the signaling pathways related to immune activation and drug metabolism, reduced tumor mutation burden (TMB), as well as significantly higher expression levels of CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG3, and immune-activation-related genes. Patients who had high ICI scores showed better overall survival (OS) compared to those with low ICI scores, irrespective of TMB status. This study demonstrated that ICI scores serve as an original and effective indicator for independent prognostic prediction as well as customized immune therapy of LUAD. Establishing the ICI patterns of a larger patient population will extend our knowledg of TME, and it may facilitate the development of immunotherapies specific to LUAD.
40066047	A novel single-domain antibody obtained from immune Bactrian camels against botulinum toxin type A using SPR-based screening method.	Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a highly lethal toxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which leads to nerve paralysis following poisoning. At present, there is no specific drug officially approved. Antibodies, particularly single-domain antibodies, represent safe and effective candidates for specific drugs against BoNT. In this study, the receptor-binding domain of botulinum toxin (BoNT/AHC<sub>C</sub>) was utilized to immunize Bactrian camels, resulting in the generation of a nanobody phage library. From this library, a high-affinity binding antibody, designated A1, and a neutralizing antibody, named HM, were successfully obtained through SPR-based screening. The affinity constant of HM for botulinum toxin is 1.08E-11 M. Results from computer simulations indicate that HM binds at the same site as SV2C. Furthermore, experimental findings demonstrate that HM exhibits significant blocking activity at both the <i>in vitro</i> binding level and the cellular level. In mouse toxicity experiments, HM has been shown to offer protection against a 20 LD<sub>50</sub> dose of BoNT/A. Consequently, HM mitigates botulinum toxin poisoning in mice by obstructing the binding of AHC<sub>C</sub> to SV2C.
40066049	Comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial resistance, biofilm formation and virulence factors of staphylococci isolated from bovine mastitis.	Bovine mastitis, a prevalent disease, is often attributed to staphylococci species. These microorganisms can express a diverse array of virulence genes and have the capability to form biofilms, establishing a robust defense against antimicrobials and host immune responses. In this study, we analyzed 191 <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp.<i>,</i> of which 81 % were identified as <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and 19 % as non-aureus staphylococci (NAS), including species such as <i>S. borealis, S. chromogenes, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, S. capitis, S. ratti,</i> and <i>S. pasteuri</i>. Our analysis involved determining antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, assessing biofilm-forming capacities, and identifying genes associated with virulence, biofilm formation, adhesion, and antimicrobial resistance. Notably, 17.2 % of the strains exhibited resistance to penicillin, with 97 % carrying the <i>blaZ</i> gene, while 9.4 % demonstrated resistance to erythromycin. All strains were sensitive to gentamicin and cefoxitin. Additionally, resistance was observed for clindamycin (8.4 %) and tetracycline (1.0 %). Concerning biofilm development, 2.6 % displayed no formation, 24.6 % were categorized as weak producers, 47.1 % as moderate, and 25.7 % as strong formers. Our investigation also unveiled the presence of virulence genes, such as superantigens like <i>sea</i> (4.7 %), <i>seb</i> (3.7 %), sec (8.4 %), <i>sed</i> (0.5 %), and <i>tst</i> (6.8 %); Panton-Valentine leukocidin (<i>pvl</i>) (59.7 %); haemolysins <i>hla</i> (88.5 %) and <i>hlb</i> (91.1 %); genes responsible for biofilm production <i>icaA</i> (87.9 %), <i>icaD</i> (78.5 %), and <i>bap</i> (4.2 %); and adhesion genes <i>fnbpA</i> (89.5 %), <i>fnbpB</i> (20.4 %), and <i>clfA</i> (89.0 %). Additionally, the strains were categorized into four groups based on their virulence attributes, revealing differences between <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> and NAS, with the latter showing a lower presence of the studied genes compared to <i>S. aureus</i> strains. This research sheds light on the resistance and virulence profiles of staphylococci strains associated with bovine mastitis, providing valuable insights for potential treatment approaches.

40066053	Chestnut (<i>Castanea crenata</i> S. et Z.) inner shell-A by-product promotes anti-obesity by regulating adipogenesis and lipogenesis-related genes and the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.	A by-product is a secondary substance unintentionally produced during manufacturing and can be repurposed through recycling. In particular, by-products generated from the processing of natural materials are valuable because of their bioactive compound content, such as polyphenols and anthocyanins. Obesity is a global health issue, and medicines for obesity have side effects, such as insomnia and headaches. The demand for safe anti-obesity treatments based on natural products has increased. In this study, the anti-obesity efficacy of chestnut inner skin powder (CIS), a by-product, was investigated in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model. CIS (100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) was administered orally for 7 weeks, and 200 mg/kg garcinia was used as the positive control. Body weight (BW) and food intake were monitored weekly. Our results showed that CIS intake reduced BW, liver weight, white adipose tissue (WAT) weight (epididymal, retroperitoneal, and perirenal tissues), leptin levels, LDL-c levels, and expression of adipogenesis- and lipogenesis-related genes, similar to the positive control group. Additionally, CIS activated the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway in the liver and reduced adipocyte size in the WAT H&E stain. In conclusion, these findings suggest that CIS may prevent and treat obesity by regulating adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipid metabolism.
40066058	A Nomogram Based on S100A7 and Clinicopathological Characteristics to Predict the Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Study.	We have previously found that S100 calcium-binding protein A7 (S100A7) is strongly associated with chemoresistance in breast cancer (BC). In this study, we investigated whether S100A7 can be used to predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and assessed its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics in BC.
40066064	Revisiting the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> druggable genome using predicted structures and data mining.	Identification of novel drug targets is a key component of modern drug discovery. While antimalarial targets are often identified through the mechanism of action studies on phenotypically derived inhibitors, this method tends to be time- and resource-consuming. The discoverable target space is also constrained by existing compound libraries and phenotypic assay conditions. Leveraging recent advances in protein structure prediction, we systematically assessed the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> genome and identified 867 candidate protein targets with evidence of small-molecule binding and blood-stage essentiality. Of these, 540 proteins showed strong essentiality evidence and lack inhibitors that have progressed to clinical trials. Expert review and rubric-based scoring of this subset based on additional criteria such as selectivity, structural information, and assay developability yielded 27 high-priority antimalarial target candidates. This study also provides a genome-wide data resource for <i>P. falciparum</i> and implements a generalizable framework for systematically evaluating and prioritizing novel pathogenic disease targets.
40066066	Differential effects of high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota.	Microorganisms contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity, while more studies focus on gut microbiome. However, the relationship between oral microbiota and obesity has yet to be elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the similarities and differences in the effects of a high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota through mouse experiments, exploring the hypothesis that oral microbial mechanisms may contribute to obesity.
40066067	Antivirotics based on defective interfering particles: emerging concepts and challenges.	Viruses are obligate parasites, that use the host's internal metabolic systems for their own reproduction. This complicates the search for molecular targets to prevent the spread of viral infection without disrupting the vital functions of human cells. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are natural competitors of viruses for important resources of viral reproduction. DIPs emerge during infection, originate from the normal viral replication process and inhibit its progression, making them an interesting candidate for antiviral therapy. Here we describe the biology of DIPs, advances in DIP-based antiviral technology, analyze their therapeutic potential and provide a systemic overview of existing preventive and therapeutic antiviral strategies.
40066068	A critical review of microbiome-derived metabolic functions and translational research in liver diseases.	Significant changes in gut microbial composition are associated with chronic liver disease. Using preclinical models, it has been demonstrated that ethanol/alcohol-induced liver disease is transmissible through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). So, the survival rate of people with severe alcoholic hepatitis got better, which suggests that changes in the makeup and function of gut microbiota play a role in metabolic liver disease. The leaky intestinal barrier plays a major role in influencing metabolic-related liver disease development through the gut microbiota. As a result, viable bacteria and microbial products can be transported to the liver, causing inflammation, contributing to hepatocyte death, and causing the fibrotic response. As metabolic-related liver disease starts and gets worse, gut dysbiosis is linked to changes in the immune system, the bile acid composition, and the metabolic function of the microbiota in the gut. Metabolic-related liver disease, as well as its self-perpetuation, will be demonstrated using data from preclinical and human studies. Further, we summarize how untargeted treatment approaches affect the gut microbiota in metabolic-related liver disease, including dietary changes, probiotics, antibiotics, and FMT. It discusses how targeted therapies can improve liver disease in various areas. These approaches may improve metabolic-related liver disease treatment options.
40066069	Drug resistance mutations to integrase inhibitors, proteinase, and reverse transcriptase inhibitors in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections in Hebei province, China, 2018-2022.

Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been conditionally used as a component of HIV/AIDS treatment regimens in recent years. However, the systematic investigation on the changes in primary drug resistance (PDR) in Hebei province, China was limited.
40066070	Biological boundary conditions regulate the internalization of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia by alveolar cells.	The lung environment is defined by unique biological boundary conditions, including complex alveolar geometry, extracellular matrix composition and mechanical forces generated during respiration. These factors were shown to regulate alveolar permeability, surfactant secretion, cell contractility and apoptosis, but their role in fungal infections remains unknown. <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is a critical fungal pathogen that causes severe pulmonary infections in immunocompromised individuals. Our study addresses a knowledge gap by investigating how boundary conditions affect <i>A. fumigatus</i> conidia interactions with alveolar epithelial cells.
40066079	Novel therapeutic strategies and recent advances in gut microbiota synergy with nanotechnology for colorectal cancer treatment.	Over the last two decades, molecular biology advances have revealed the gut microbiota's active and crucial role in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis and its dysregulation during tumorigenesis. This understanding has underscored the urgency of exploring novel therapeutic approaches to address the challenges posed by CRC. Among these approaches, nanosynergistic therapies, with their potential to modulate the gut microbiota, increase drug bioavailability and stability, and reduce side effects, have emerged as a promising avenue. Furthermore, the efficacy of nanotechnology-based approaches can be enhanced by combining them with different therapeutic methods, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, photothermal therapy, and sonodynamic therapy. Herein, recent progress in nano synergistic therapy has been reviewed, focusing on the synergy between gut microbiota and nanotechnology in CRC treatment. Additionally, the diverse applications of nanoparticles have been analyzed to provide innovative ideas and effective solutions for developing highly effective CRC treatment strategies.
40066080	Specnuezhenide Alleviates Senile Osteoporosis by Activating TGR5/FXR Signaling in Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells and RANKL-Induced Osteoclasts.	Specnuezhenide (SPN) is an iridoid glycoside isolated from <i>Fructus Ligustri Lucidi</i>, an herb prescribed for the treatment of senile osteoporosis. However, the direct role of SPN on bone metabolism remains unclear. In this study, the effects of SPN on d-galactose (d-gal)-induced mice, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and nuclear factor-κB ligand-induced osteoclasts were examined.
40066084	Association of NR1I2 Polymorphism with Midazolam Clearance in Mechanically Ventilated ICU Patients: A Population Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacogenetic Study.	Significant variability in the metabolism of midazolam (MDZ) exists among mechanically ventilated (MV) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to complex clinical conditions and genetic factors. The NR1I2 gene (PXR), which encodes a nuclear receptor that regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP3A4, plays a critical role in MDZ metabolism. Polymorphisms in NR1I2, along with variations in genes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, may influence enzyme activity and MDZ pharmacokinetics (PK). Understanding these factors is essential for optimizing MDZ dosing in high-risk patient populations.

40066089	Association between human leukocyte antigen E expression and outcomes in solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Immunotherapy has gained momentum with the discovery of novel antibodies targeting immunosuppressive proteins. HLA-E, a non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) protein, exhibits immunosuppressive properties, potentially influencing tumor immune evasion mechanisms. The association between Human Leukocyte Antigen E (HLA-E) expression and outcomes in solid tumors remains unclear.
40066090	Retrospective BReast Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Multisite (BRIMM) multisoftware study.	The intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) provides imaging biomarkers for breast tumor characterization. It has been extensively applied for both diagnostic and prognostic goals in breast cancer, with increasing evidence supporting its clinical relevance. However, variable performance exists in literature owing to the heterogeneity in datasets and quantification methods.
40066091	Advances in targeting protein S-palmitoylation in tumor immunity and therapy.	S-palmitoylation is a reversible and dynamic post-translational modification of proteins. A palmitoyl group is covalently attached to a cysteine residue of the protein by a thioester link. It regulates the transcription and expression of downstream target genes and cell signaling, influencing cellular functions. Research indicates a substantial correlation between S-palmitoylation and tumorigenesis and immunotherapy, where it plays a pivotal role in modulating T cell activation, cytokine signaling, autophagy, phagocytosis, and death. Moreover, palmitoylation contributes to drug resistance and immunological evasion in tumor cells, enabling them to circumvent the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and immune surveillance. Inhibitors that target S-palmitoylation have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy, offering a novel strategy for cancer treatment. Nonetheless, obstacles such as inhibitor specificity and efficacy persist, requiring more extensive investigations into the exact mechanisms of S-palmitoylation to develop more effective targeted therapeutics. This article summarizes recent developments in S-palmitoylation concerning tumor immunity and treatment. The article examines the regulatory function of S-palmitoylation, its modifying enzymes in tumor cell signaling, and novel tumor immunotherapies that target S-palmitoylation.
40066092	Engineered exosomes restore miR-508-5p expression in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and reduce tumor progression and metastasis by targeting DLL3.

40066095	Efficacy and safety of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel plus cisplatin or nedaplatin plus tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil as induction chemotherapy regimen for hypopharyngeal cancer.	Treatment of hypopharyngeal carcinoma involves surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil as a standard induction chemotherapy regimen allows enhanced laryngeal preservation after surgery. In this study, our objective was to retrospectively analyze the short-term efficacy and adverse events of nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin or nedaplatin plus tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil as an induction chemotherapy regimen for hypopharyngeal cancer.
40066096	The post-orchiectomy systemic inflammatory index is associated with tumor characteristics in clinical stage I germ cell tumors.	Approximately 25% to 30% of clinical stage I (CSI) germ cell cancer (GCT) patients will experience disease relapse after an orchiectomy. Adding adjuvant treatment will decrease the relapse rate but could lead to over-treatment. Prognostic biomarkers such as lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and/or embryonal carcinoma (EC) in non-seminoma (NSGCT) and rete testis invasion (RTI) and/or primary tumor size (PTS) in seminoma (SGCT) add limited value in treatment decision- making. The aim of this study is to assess the systemic inflammatory index (SII) and lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) with clinicopathological findings along with their prognostic impact.
40066097	Lysosome targeted therapies in hematological malignancies.	Lysosomes are dynamic organelles integral to cellular homeostasis, secretory pathways, immune responses, and cell death regulation. In cancers, lysosomes become dysregulated to sustain proliferative signaling, metabolism, and invasion. In hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), leukemia cells demonstrate lysosome dysregulation with increased lysosomal activity, mTORC1 signaling, catabolic reactions, and autophagy. This supports the survival, metabolism, and proliferation of the leukemia cells. Lysosomes also play a critical role in treatment resistance by promoting cell survival and sequestration of drugs. This has led to the development of lysosome-targeted therapies such as cationic amphiphilic drugs (CAD), ATPase inhibitors or autophagy inhibitors to treat hematological malignancies. Lysosome-targeted treatments have shown effectiveness at inducing cell death by inhibiting cell survival mechanisms and inducing apoptosis. In addition, the combination of lysosome-targeted therapies with standard treatments gives synergistic apoptotic responses in leukemia cells. In this review, we will describe the lysosomal functions, their dysregulation in hematological malignancies and the development of lysosomal targeted therapies for leukemia treatment. By understanding lysosome dysregulation and developing lysosome-targeted agents, innovative treatment strategies could be effective in overcoming drug resistance in hematological malignancies.
40066098	An overview of the current evidences on the role of iron in colorectal cancer: a review.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and lethal malignancy that affects millions of people worldwide. Iron is an essential micronutrient that plays a vital role in various biological processes, but also has pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects that may contribute to carcinogenesis. The relationship between iron and CRC is complex and influenced by multiple factors, such as dietary intake, absorption, storage, metabolism, and excretion of iron, as well as genetic and environmental factors that modulate iron homeostasis. This review article aims to provide an overview of the current evidences on the role of iron in CRC, discussing the potential mechanisms by which iron may affect CRC development and progression, as well as the implications for prevention and treatment. This review tries to focus on the following aspects: an introduction to iron and its role in CRC, role of heme and non-heme iron in CRC, dietary patterns, nutrition, and CRC, iron overload in CRC, iron deficiency and its role in CRC especially in surgery outcome and iron therapy and blood transfusion in CRC.
40066100	Cardiovascular toxicity induced by immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), an immunotherapy used in cancer treatment, are associated with potential cardiovascular (CV) toxicity. Monitoring CV issues in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is challenging due to their lower incidence and diversity. Hence, enhancing our understanding of CV toxicities in patients receiving ICIs is required to improve their quality of life and survival. Hence, the main objective of this study is the evaluation of CV side effects in ICI-treated NSCLC patients by assessing the prevalence and hazard of CV events.
40066103	Effect of Fermentation Time on the Physicochemical Properties and Phenolic Composition of Malted Finger Millet Beverages.	Food security is still a significant problem, particularly in less developed nations. Orphan crops, such as finger millet (FM), are essential for meeting dietary and nutritional needs as well as providing a means of livelihood for economies with limited resources in Asia and Africa. Comparing two varieties of FM malt beverages using sorghum grain as an external reference, the research examined the impact of fermentation time on the physicochemical characteristics and phenolic composition of the FM malt beverages. The FM grains were fermented using <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i> and the grain microflora. The beverages' pH decreased in a time-dependent manner throughout fermentation, and their sugar content increased accordingly. A reduction in the beverages' viscosities for both <i>L. fermentum</i> and the grain microflora was observed. The amount of citric acid in the beverages decreased as fermentation progressed, especially for <i>L. fermentum</i>. Catechin, epicatechin, and protocatechuic acid were the phenolics identified in the FM beverages. An increase in fermentation time was correlated with a decrease in the beverages' total phenolic content. At 96 h of fermentation, the beverages' DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP radical scavenging activities were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) reduced for both <i>L. fermentum</i> and the grain microflora. The 24-h fermented beverages maintained higher amounts of total polyphenols and antioxidant effects. The findings indicate that FM may be utilized as a functional grain to produce nonalcoholic beverages with health benefits.
40066106	Neural correlates of fatigue after traumatic brain injury.	Fatigue is the main cause of disability after traumatic brain injury and has negative impact on social, physical and cognitive functions, participation in daily activities, and ability to work. Since the neural underpinnings are largely unknown, few causal treatments are currently available. This study therefore aimed to investigate the neural correlates of subjective fatigue after traumatic brain injury, controlling for differences in cognitive performance, motor performance and subjective psychological covariates such as depression, anxiety and apathy. Seventeen chronic traumatic brain injury patients (10 with and seven without fatigue) and 11 age, sex, and education-matched healthy controls participated in the study. The dependent variable, overall fatigue, was quantified as the sum of the subscales of the multivariate fatigue inventory. Subjective psychological covariates were extracted from appropriate questionnaires. Brain activation during a two-back task and functional connectivity at rest were reconstructed from high-density EEG. Cortical excitability was quantified from motor evoked potentials induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex. Cognitive performance was assessed with a two-back task as well as with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Motor performance was quantified with Jamar dynamometer. Beside the between-group differences in most fatigue subscales resulting from the group attribution, participants also differed in subjective memory functions, depression, anxiety and apathy. Conversely, objective neuropsychological performance was similar across groups in most domains, except for alertness and divided attention (<i>P</i> ≤ 0.039). At the neural level, we observed no difference in corticospinal excitability, but a significant disruption of global resting-state alpha-band functional connectivity between cortical midline structures and the rest of the brain in patients with fatigue (<i>P</i> = 0.006). Furthermore, individuals with fatigue exhibited reduced signs of overall brain activation compared with healthy controls throughout the cognitive task (<i>P</i> = 0.032) without time-on-task effect. In a multivariate regression model, resting-state functional connectivity (<i>P</i> = 0.013) and subjective psychological questionnaire scores (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) were independent predictors of fatigue. In conclusion, our results suggest that disrupted network interactions are the primary independent neural predictor of fatigue. This may serve as a new target for therapy.
40066107	Exploring functional connectivity in clinical and data-driven groups of preterm and term adults.	Adults born very preterm (i.e. at <33 weeks' gestation) are more susceptible to long-lasting structural and functional brain alterations and cognitive and socio-emotional difficulties, compared with full-term controls. However, behavioural heterogeneity within very preterm and full-term individuals makes it challenging to find biomarkers of specific outcomes. To address these questions, we parsed brain-behaviour heterogeneity in participants subdivided according to their clinical birth status (very preterm versus full term) and/or data-driven behavioural phenotype (regardless of birth status). Participants were followed-up in adulthood (median age 30 years) as part of a wider longitudinal case-control cohort study. The Network Based Statistic approach was used to identify topological components of resting state functional connectivity differentiating between (i) 116 very preterm and 83 full-term adults (43% and 57% female, respectively) and (ii) data-driven behavioural subgroups identified using consensus clustering (<i>n</i> = 156, 46% female). Age, sex, socio-economic status and in-scanner head motion were used as confounders in all analyses. <i>Post hoc</i> two-way group interactions between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels explored whether functional connectivity differences between very preterm and full-term adults varied according to distinct behavioural outcomes. Very preterm compared with full-term adults had poorer scores in selective measures of cognitive and socio-emotional processing and displayed complex patterns of hyper- and hypo-connectivity in sub-sections of the default mode, visual and ventral attention networks. Stratifying the study participants in terms of their behavioural profiles (irrespective of birth status) identified two data-driven subgroups: an 'At-Risk' subgroup, characterized by increased cognitive, mental health and socio-emotional difficulties, displaying hypo-connectivity anchored in frontal opercular and insular regions, relative to a 'Resilient' subgroup with more favourable outcomes. No significant interaction was noted between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels in terms of functional connectivity. Functional connectivity differentiating between very preterm and full-term adults was dissimilar to functional connectivity differentiating between the data-driven behavioural subgroups. We speculate that functional connectivity alterations observed in very preterm relative to full-term adults may confer both risk and resilience to developing behavioural sequelae associated with very preterm birth, while the localized functional connectivity alterations seen in the 'At-Risk' subgroup relative to the 'Resilient' subgroup may underlie less favourable behavioural outcomes in adulthood, irrespective of birth status.
40066108	Neural tracking of natural speech: an effective marker for post-stroke aphasia.	After a stroke, approximately one-third of patients suffer from aphasia, a language disorder that impairs communication ability. Behavioural tests are the current standard to detect aphasia, but they are time-consuming, have limited ecological validity and require active patient cooperation. To address these limitations, we tested the potential of EEG-based neural envelope tracking of natural speech. The technique investigates the neural response to the temporal envelope of speech, which is critical for speech understanding by encompassing cues for detecting and segmenting linguistic units (e.g. phrases, words and phonemes). We recorded EEG from 26 individuals with aphasia in the chronic phase after stroke (>6 months post-stroke) and 22 healthy controls while they listened to a 25-min story. We quantified neural envelope tracking in a broadband frequency range as well as in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands using mutual information analyses. Besides group differences in neural tracking measures, we also tested its suitability for detecting aphasia at the individual level using a support vector machine classifier. We further investigated the reliability of neural envelope tracking and the required recording length for accurate aphasia detection. Our results showed that individuals with aphasia had decreased encoding of the envelope compared to controls in the broad, delta, theta and gamma bands, which aligns with the assumed role of these bands in auditory and linguistic processing of speech. Neural tracking in these frequency bands effectively captured aphasia at the individual level, with a classification accuracy of 83.33% and an area under the curve of 89.16%. Moreover, we demonstrated that high-accuracy detection of aphasia can be achieved in a time-efficient (5-7 min) and highly reliable manner (split-half reliability correlations between <i>R</i> = 0.61 and <i>R</i> = 0.96 across frequency bands). In this study, we identified specific neural response characteristics to natural speech that are impaired in individuals with aphasia, holding promise as a potential biomarker for the condition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the neural tracking technique can discriminate aphasia from healthy controls at the individual level with high accuracy, and in a reliable and time-efficient manner. Our findings represent a significant advance towards more automated, objective and ecologically valid assessments of language impairments in aphasia.
40066109	Characterization of a novel zebrafish model of <i>MTMR5</i>-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B3.	Biallelic loss of expression/function variants in <i>MTMR5/SBF1</i> cause the inherited peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. There is an incomplete understanding of the disease pathomechanism(s) underlying Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3, and despite its severe clinical presentation, currently no disease-modifying therapies. A key barrier to the study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3 is the lack of pre-clinical models that recapitulate the clinical and pathologic features of the disease. To address this barrier, we generated a zebrafish Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 mutant line with a full gene deletion of <i>mtmr5.</i> Resulting homozygous deletion zebrafish are born at normal Mendelian ratios and have preserved motor function. However, starting by 10 days post-fertilization, mutant zebrafish develop obvious morphometric changes in head size and brain volume. These changes are accompanied at the pathological level by abnormal axon outgrowths and by the presence of dysmyelination changes reminiscent of the nerve pathology in human Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. Importantly, RNA sequencing from brain-enriched samples identifies novel disease pathways including transcriptional changes in genes responsible for neurogenesis, chromatin remodelling/organization, and synaptic membrane homeostasis. Overall, our <i>mtmr5</i> knockout zebrafish mirror genetic, clinical and pathologic features of human Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. As such, it represents a first pre-clinical model to phenocopy the disease, and an ideal tool for future studies on disease pathomechanism(s) and therapy development.
40066110	Dynamic reconfiguration of brain functional networks in world class gymnasts: a resting-state functional MRI study.	Long-term intensive training has enabled world class gymnasts to attain exceptional skill levels, inducing notable neuroplastic changes in their brains. Previous studies have identified optimized brain modularity related to long-term intensive training based on resting-state functional MRI, which is associated with higher efficiency in motor and cognitive functions. However, most studies assumed that functional topological networks remain static during the scans, neglecting the inherent dynamic changes over time. This study applied a multilayer network model to identify the effect of long-term intensive training on dynamic functional network properties in gymnasts. The imaging data were collected from 13 gymnasts and 14 age- and gender-matched non-athlete controls. We first construct dynamic functional connectivity matrices for each subject to capture the temporal information underlying these brain signals. Then, we applied a multilayer community detection approach to analyse how brain regions form modules and how this modularity changes over time. Graph theoretical parameters, including flexibility, promiscuity, cohesion and disjointedness, were estimated to characterize the dynamic properties of functional networks across global, network, and nodal levels in the gymnasts. The gymnasts showed significantly lower flexibility, cohesion and disjointedness at the global level than the controls. Then, we observed lower flexibility and cohesion in the auditory, dorsal attention, sensorimotor, subcortical, cingulo-opercular and default mode networks in the gymnasts than in the controls. Furthermore, these gymnasts showed decreased flexibility and cohesion in several regions associated with motor function. Together, we found brain functional neuroplasticity related to long-term intensive training, primarily characterized by decreased flexibility of brain dynamics in the gymnasts, which provided new insights into brain reorganization in motor skill learning.

40066117	The Application of Machine Learning in Predicting the Permeability of Drugs Across the Blood Brain Barrier.	The inefficiency of some medications to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is often attributed to their poor physicochemical or pharmacokinetic properties. Recent studies have demonstrated promising outcomes using machine learning algorithms to predict drug permeability across the BBB. In light of these findings, our study was conducted to explore the potential of machine learning in predicting the permeability of drugs across the BBB. We utilized the B3DB dataset, a comprehensive BBB permeability molecular database, to build machine learning models. The dataset comprises 7,807 molecules, including information on their permeability, stereochemistry, and physicochemical properties. After preprocessing and cleaning, various machine learning algorithms were implemented using the Python library Pycaret to predict permeability. The extra trees classifier model outperformed others when using Morgan fingerprints and Mordred chemical descriptors (MCDs), achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 and 0.95 on the test dataset. Additionally, we conducted an experiment to train a voting classifier combining the top three performing models. The best-blended model, trained on MCDs, achieved an AUC of 0.96. Furthermore, Shapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was applied to our best-performing single model, the extra trees classifier trained on MCDs, identifying the Lipinski rule of five as the most significant feature in predicting BBB permeability. In conclusion, our combined model trained on MCDs achieved an AUC of 0.96, an F1 Score of 0.91, and an MCC of 0.74. These results are consistent with prior studies on CNS drug permeability, highlighting the potential of machine learning in this domain.
40066118	Bupropion Showed Neuroprotective Impacts Against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Reducing Oxidative Stress and Inflammation.	Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the most prevalent form of brain stroke, affecting many patients worldwide. It is believed that oxidative stress and inflammation play major roles in the damage that occurs after the initiation of the disease.
40066119	Modulating the Biliverdin Reductase (BVR)/ERK1/2 Axis to Attenuate Oxidative Stress in Rat Arterial Rings.	Biliverdin reductase (BVR) plays a central role in bile pigment metabolism by reducing biliverdin (BV) to bilirubin (BR), a potent antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) under normal and pathological conditions. Elevated oxidative stress activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling, which strongly interacts with BVR's C and D motifs, forming the BVR/ERK1/2 axis. In pathological states, increased ERK1/2 activity inhibits BVR's ability to convert BV to BR, exacerbating oxidative damage and contributing to cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the interaction between BVR and ERK1/2 is critical in modulating oxidative stress.

40066124	Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors: A Systematic Review of Structure-Activity Relationship Studies.	Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) is a serine exopeptidase enzyme that hydrolyzes the amide bond at the N-terminal of peptides. This enzyme converts incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide I and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, into their inactive forms, thereby preventing them from stimulating insulin secretion. Numerous studies have confirmed the role of DPP-4 in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, leading to the development of various DPP-4 inhibitors. In recent years, research on DPP-4 inhibitors has expanded significantly, resulting in the creation of both non-peptidomimetic heterocyclic compounds and peptidomimetic scaffolds.

40066151	Warming stimulates cellulose decomposition by recruiting phylogenetically diverse but functionally similar microorganisms.	Cellulose is the most abundant component of plant litter, which is critical for terrestrial carbon cycling. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how global warming affects cellulose-decomposing microorganisms. Here, we carried out a 3-year litterbag experiment to examine cellulose decomposition undergoing +3°C warming in a tallgrass prairie. Most cellulose-associated bacteria and fungi in litterbags were also detected in bulk soil, and bacteria in litterbags had higher community-level <i>rrn</i> copy numbers, larger genome sizes, and higher genome guanine-cytosine (GC) contents than those in bulk soil, implying higher growth rates. Warming stimulated soil respiration by 32.3% and accelerated mass loss of cellulose, concurring with the increase in relative abundances of most functional genes associated with carbon decomposition in litterbags. Incorporating cellulose-decomposing genes into an ecosystem model reduced model parameter uncertainty and showed that warming stimulated microbial biomass, activity, and soil carbon decomposition. Collectively, our study supports a trait-centric view since cellulose-decomposing genes or genomic traits are amenable for ecosystem modeling. By characterizing the phylogenetically diverse yet functionally similar cellulose-associated microorganisms and their responses to warming, we take a step toward more precise predictions of soil carbon dynamics under future climate scenarios.
40066155	Gut microbiome differences in individuals with PTSD compared to trauma-exposed controls: a systematic review.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental health disorder that can occur following exposure to a traumatic event, and is characterized by symptoms including intrusive memories, dissociation, and nightmares. PTSD poses significant suffering on the individual and can reduce quality of life substantially, however, its mechanisms are not fully understood. It has also been associated with gut abnormalities, such as with irritable bowel syndrome, indicating possible involvement of the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis. Whereas previous research has implicated the gut microbiome and microbiome gut-brain axis in various mental health disorders, the relationship between gut microbiome function and PTSD is unclear. Specifically, little is known about whether specific gut microbiome compositions can increase the risk of developing PTSD, or, vice versa, act as a protective factor for the individual. This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature looking at gut microbiome differences between individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed controls (TEC) while exploring potential risk and resilience factors for development of the disorder. Three studies met the inclusion criteria, and results showed that all studies found differences in gut microbial taxa between PTSD and TEC groups yet varied in their taxonomic level and type. One study found a significant difference in diversity between groups, reporting lower diversity in PTSD, and two studies found certain taxa to be correlated with PTSD symptom severity: <i>Mitsuokella</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i>, <i>Catenibacterium</i> and <i>Olsenella</i> genera, and <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Lentisphaerae</i> and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> phyla. This review has important implications for potential novel treatments for PTSD which target the gut microbiome, for example psychobiotic dietary interventions such as prebiotics and probiotics. It also informs our understanding of potential risk and resilience factors for the disorder, such as certain gut microbiome compositions being potentially protective or increasing susceptibility. More research is needed, as currently sample sizes are small and confounding variables (e.g., diet) are not always controlled for. <b>Systematic review registration:</b> The protocol was registered on PROSPERO, registration number: CRD42024530033.
40066157	Systematic Review of Pediatric Photoprotection in Children of Color.	Early childhood sun exposure contributes to lifetime risk of skin cancer.

40066158	The long non-coding RNA MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module regulates phosphate accumulation and disease resistance to <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> in pear.	Pear ring rot disease (<i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i>) is a significant threat to the healthy development of the pear industry. Recent research has identified the functional role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in various biological processes of plants. The role of lncRNAs in the pear defense response remains unknown. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze lncRNAs in pear stem infected with <i>B. dothidea</i>. It identified 3555 lncRNAs, of which 286 were significantly differentially expressed. GO and KEGG analyses showed that <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-regulated target genes were enriched in multiple disease resistance-related pathways. More specifically, MSTRG.32189, predicted as an endogenous target mimic (eTM), was significantly down-regulated in response to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection, and was confirmed to inhibit the cleavage effect of PcmiR399b on <i>PcUBC24.</i> OE-MSTRG.32189 transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> exhibited lower Pi content and weaker disease resistance to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> compared with wild type. In pear callus, overexpression of MSTRG.32189 negatively regulated PcmiR399b, which decreased Pi content and reduced disease resistance. Overexpressing PcmiR399b in pear callus exhibited the opposite effects compared with OE-MSTRG.32189. Overexpression and knockout of <i>PcUBC24</i> further clarified that <i>PcUBC24</i> negatively regulates Pi content and disease resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection. Furthermore, the ROS levels and expressions of disease resistance pathway-related genes were regulated by the MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module in transgenic pear callus, which contributed to disease resistance. Overall, our results demonstrated the role of lncRNAs in the pear defense response, revealing that the MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module regulates phosphate accumulation and disease resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection in pear.
40066159	Development of an efficient and heritable virus-induced genome editing system in <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>.	The CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to introduce site-specific mutations into the genome of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. However, the direct application of this revolutionary technology to desirable tomato cultivars has been hindered by the challenges of generating transgenic plants. To address this issue, we developed an efficient and heritable genome editing system using tobacco rattle virus (TRV) for an elite tomato cultivar (the paternal line of Saladette). Notably, this virus-induced genome editing (VIGE) system enables the rapid production of various mutant seeds without the need for additional plant transformation and tissue culture, once a Cas9-expressing tomato line is established. This VIGE system consists of transgenic tomato plants that express Cas9 under the control of the tomato ubiquitin 10 (<i>SlUbi1</i>0) gene promoter and a mobile guide RNA scaffold (gRNA:SlmFT) generated using the sequence of the tomato <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>SlFT</i>) gene. We determined its editing efficiency by targeting the tomato phytoene desaturase (<i>SlPDS</i>) gene, which causes photobleaching symptoms when disrupted. Most transgenic seedlings infected with the TRV vectors carrying the <i>SlPDS-</i>targeting sgRNA developed chimeric albino leaves associated with a high frequency of indel mutations in the <i>SlPDS</i> gene. Remarkably, fruits from these plants yielded homozygous <i>SlPDS</i> knockout seeds at rates ranging from 15% to 100%. These results demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of our VIGE system in rapidly generating heritable genome edits in tomato.
40066160	Two shikimate dehydrogenases play an essential role in the biosynthesis of galloylated catechins in tea plants.	Tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>) is widely cultivated throughout the world for its unique flavor and health benefits. Galloylated catechins in tea plants serve as important secondary metabolites that play a pivotal role in tea taste determination and pharmacological effects. However, the genetic basis of galloylated catechins traits remains elusive. We identified a stable and major-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with galloylated catechins index (GCI), designated <i>qGCI6.2</i>. Within the QTL's confidence interval, two shikimate dehydrogenases (<i>CsSDH4</i>, <i>CsSDH3</i>) were identified. These enzymes catalyze gallic acid (GA) production from 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, thereby contributing to galloylated catechins accumulation. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that <i>CsSDH4</i> and <i>CsSDH3</i> expression levels and GA and galloylated catechins contents were positively correlated. Furthermore, overexpressing <i>CsSDH4</i> and <i>CsSDH3</i> in transgenic tomato plants markedly increased GA and galloylated catechin contents. RNA-seq analysis of transgenic tomato indicated that <i>CsSDH4</i> and <i>CsSDH3</i> primarily regulate genes related to shikimic acid and flavonoid pathways, and jointly promote galloylated catechins synthesis. Our findings have further elucidated the galloylated catechins synthesis pathway and provided a theoretical basis for cultivation of tea cultivars with high galloylated catechin contents.
40066161	High-resolution genome assembly and population genetic study of the endangered maple <i>Acer pentaphyllum</i> (Sapindaceae): implications for conservation strategies.	<i>Acer pentaphyllum</i> Diels (Sapindaceae), a highly threatened maple endemic to the dry-hot valleys of the Yalong River in western Sichuan, China, represents a valuable resource for horticulture and conservation. This study presents the first chromosomal-scale genome assembly of <i>A. pentaphyllum</i> (~626 Mb, 2<i>n</i> = 26), constructed using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C sequencing technologies. Comparative genomic analyses revealed significant recent genomic changes through rapid amplification of transposable elements, particularly long terminal repeat retrotransposons, coinciding with the dramatic climate change during recent uplift of the Hengduan Mountains. Genes involved in photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and plant-pathogen interaction showed expansion and/or positive selection, potentially reflecting adaptation to the species' unique dry-hot valley habitat. Population genomic analysis of 227 individuals from 28 populations revealed low genetic diversity (1.04 ± 0.97 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) compared to other woody species. Phylogeographic patterns suggest an unexpected upstream colonization along the Yalong River, while Quaternary climate fluctuations drove its continuous lineage diversification and population contraction. Assessment of genetic diversity, inbreeding, and genetic load across populations revealed concerning levels of inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious mutations in small, isolated populations, particularly those at range edges (TKX, CDG, TES). Based on these results, we propose conservation strategies, including the identification of management units and recommendations for genetic rescue. These findings not only facilitate the conservation of <i>A. pentaphyllum</i> but also serve as a valuable resource for future horticultural development and as a model for similar studies on other endangered plant species adapted to extreme environments.
40066162	Genome-wide association study of salicylic acid provides genetic insights for tea plant selective breeding.	Salicylic acid (SA) is a phenolic phytohormone widely believed to regulate plant growth and stress response. Despite its significance, the genetic basis of SA-mediated resistance to biotic stressors in tea plants is little understood. Our study investigated the genetic diversity, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns of 299 tea accessions using 79 560 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. Our genome-wide association study identified <i>CSS0033791.1</i>, an essential gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (CsNCED1), which catalyzes a vital step in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. Exogenous ABA treatment and transgenic overexpression of the <i>CsNCED1</i> gene lowered SA content in the respective tea plants by inhibiting the expression of the <i>ICS</i> gene. Further analysis revealed that ABA could reduce the expression levels of the SA receptor gene (<i>NPR1</i>) and NPR1 target genes (<i>PR1</i> and <i>WRKY18</i>), increasing the plant's susceptibility to biotic stressors. Furthermore, the feeding behavior of <i>Spodoptera litura</i> revealed that the insect bite area on transgenic leaves was substantially more extensive than that in wild type (WT), implying that the <i>CsNCED1</i> gene had a negative regulatory role in SA-mediated immune response. This study thus provides the foundation for future insect resistance breeding, sustainable tea plant resource usage, and molecular marker-assisted (MAS) tea plant breeding.

40066175	Augmenting the human interactome for disease prediction through gene networks inferred from human cell atlas.	Gene co-expression network inference from bulk tissue samples often misses cell-type-specific interactions, which can be detected through single-cell gene expression data. However, the noise and sparsity of single-cell data challenge the inference of these networks. We developed scNET, a framework for integrative cell-type-specific co-expression network inference from single-cell transcriptome data, demonstrating its utility in augmenting the human interactome for more accurate disease gene prediction. We address the limitations of <i>de novo</i> network inference from single-cell expression data through dropout imputation, metacell formation, and data transformation. Employing this data preprocessing pipeline, we inferred cell-type-specific co-expression links from single-cell atlas data, covering various cell types and tissues, and integrated over 850K of these inferred links into a preexisting human interactome, HumanNet, resulting in HumanNet-plus. This integration notably enhanced the accuracy of network-based disease gene prediction. These findings suggest that with proper data preprocessing, network inference from single-cell gene expression data can be highly effective, potentially enriching the human interactome and advancing the field of network medicine.

40066197	Equine neutrophils selectively release neutrophil extracellular traps in response to chemical and bacterial agonists.	Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a significant role in response to a variety of infectious and inflammatory stimuli in human and veterinary medicine. Although entrapment of bacteria can be an important function of NETs, the exuberant release of DNA and other intracellular molecules has also been negatively implicated in the pathogenesis of different diseases. Thus, NET formation must be tightly controlled and represents an opportunity for therapeutic interventions. Horses are particularly sensitive to bacterial stimuli that have previously been shown to cause NETs in other species, but the species-specific processes that control NET release have not been fully elucidated.
40066199	Targeting Non-Eosinophilic Immunological Pathways in COPD and AECOPD: Current Insights and Therapeutic Strategies.	COPD is a multifactorial illness characterized by a long-term restriction of airflow and an inflammatory reaction in the lungs. The associated emphysema leads to the breakdown of alveolar proteins and abnormal expansion of the lung air spaces. Chronic bronchitis caused by the same disease can result in increased deposition of structural proteins, narrowing of the airways, and excessive mucus secretion leading to acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). The most commonly prescribed medications for it, such as glucocorticoids and bronchodilators, provide important therapeutic benefits, but they also have negative side effects, including immunosuppression and infection. Therefore, it is necessary to develop medications for the treatment of COPD that specifically target the immune system and molecular components. This review focuses on non-eosinophilic aspects of immunological modulation in COPD management. Since, existing literature extensively covers eosinophilic inflammation, this review aims to fill the gap by examining alternative immunological pathways and their therapeutic implications. The findings suggest that targeting specific immune responses may enhance treatment efficacy while minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional therapies. In summary, this review emphasizes the importance of advancing research into non-eosinophilic immunological mechanisms in COPD, prescribing for the development of novel therapies that can more effectively manage this disease.
40066200	Health risk assessment of potentially toxic elements in public pipe-borne water from selected households in Abeokuta, Southwestern, Nigeria.	Public pipe-borne water serves as a significant source of potable water in some communities in Abeokuta. However, the presence of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) at certain concentrations in drinking water can render it unsuitable for consumption due to associated health risks. This study assessed the health risks posed by PTEs in public pipe-borne water collected from ten households in six communities in Abeokuta, Southwestern Nigeria. Pipe-borne water samples were subjected to PTE (lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) analysis using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, following standard digestion procedures for the water samples. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The health risk assessment was conducted for the Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Cancer Risk (CR) using the USEPA IRIS models. The water quality index (WQI) was also evaluated. Results indicated varying levels of PTEs, with certain areas exceeding the permissible limits for Cd (0.01-0.02 mg/L), Cr (0.05-0.11 mg/L), and Pb (0.50-0.97 mg/L), posing significant health risks to humans. The health risk assessment revealed that the HQ for Cd, Cr, and Pb exceeded the permissible limit of 1.0 in pipe-borne water consumed by children and infants, indicating potential adverse effects. Additionally, the CR values for Cd, Cr, and Pb in water samples consumed by all age groups also surpassed the permissible limit of 1.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, suggesting a probable risk of cancer development. The WQIs exceeding the threshold limit of 300 were observed in pipe-borne water samples, indicating that the water is unfit for consumption. Therefore, this study recommends the removal of potential toxic elements at the point of collection by using taps fitted with activated carbon filters.
40066202	Extracellular Vesicles Derived From Regenerating Tissue Promote Stem Cell Proliferation in the Planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted nanoparticles composed of a lipid bilayer that carry lipid, protein, and nucleic acid cargo between cells as a mode of intercellular communication. Although EVs can promote tissue repair in mammals, their roles in animals with greater regenerative capacity are not well understood. Planarian flatworms are capable of whole-body regeneration due to pluripotent somatic stem cells called neoblasts that proliferate in response to injury. Here, using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and protein content examination, we showed that EVs enriched from the tissues of the planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> had similar morphology and size as other eukaryotic EVs, and that these EVs carried orthologs of the conserved EV biogenesis regulators ALIX and TSG101. PKH67-labeled EVs were taken up efficiently by planarian cells, including S/G2 neoblasts, G1 neoblasts/early progeny, and differentiated cells. When injected into living planarians, EVs from regenerating tissue fragments enhanced the upregulation of neoblast-enriched and proliferation-related transcripts. In addition, EV injection increased the number of <i>F-ara</i>-EdU-labelled cells by 49% as compared to buffer injection only. Our findings demonstrate that regenerating planarians produce EVs that promote stem cell proliferation, and suggest the planarian as an amenable in vivo model for the study of EV function during regeneration.
40066205	Treatment of c-MET Antibody-Drug Conjugate Asymptomatic Pneumonitis with a Novel Steroid Regimen in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Case Report.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a potent class of antineoplastic drugs that deliver cytotoxic agents via targeting with monoclonal antibodies; however, ADCs are associated with high rates of lung toxicities, limiting the therapeutic potential in many patients. We report a case of a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer taking the ADC telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso V) plus osimtertinib who developed ADC-induced pneumonitis despite clinical benefit. This patient was able to tolerate treatment for a prolonged period on a novel steroid regimen, using steroids when pneumonitis was asymptomatic but radiologically evident and as a daily suppressant. This treatment strategy may have implications in the broader management of ADC-interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis and underscores its potential mechanisms.
40066207	Safety evaluation of pea fibre concentrate (FIPEA) as food additive.	The EFSA Panel on Food Additive and Flavourings (FAF Panel) provides a scientific opinion on the safety assessment of the proposed use of pea fibre concentrate (FIPEA) as a food additive. FIPEA is a powder consisting mainly of dietary fibres (i.e. pectin and hemicellulose), and low amounts of protein, derived from yellow pea (<i>P. sativum</i>). The manufacturing process includes extensive heat treatments, (e.g. > 100°C for more than 40 min), conditions which lead to inactivation of lectins, that in FIPEA do not pose a safety concern. A specific α-amylase is used in the manufacturing, and this should be included in the definition of the proposed specifications. The Panel considered that the additional contribution of FIPEA to the total fibre intake in adults and toddlers would be acceptable considering the levels that are considered adequate by the NDA Panel. The Panel recommended to lower the specification limits proposed for the toxic elements. The solubility test indicates that the material does not require specific assessment at the nanoscale. No toxicological data have been submitted on FIPEA. The Panel considered that, similarly to water-soluble soybean polysaccharides, FIPEA is not absorbed intact but undergoes extensive fermentation by the intestinal microbiota in humans and is not of genotoxic concern. Dry peas (raw material) are a staple food, with a very long history of safe use in the EU. FIPEA is extracted with hot water from the insoluble fibrous material of dehulled yellow peas, therefore the structure of the fibres is not chemically modified, and no new by-products or components of toxicological concern are expected from the manufacturing process. The Panel concluded that there was no need for a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) and that pea fibre concentrate (FIPEA) as a new food additive does not raise a safety concern at the proposed use and use levels.

40066222	RNA Modification in Metabolism.	Epigenetic regulation in disease development has been witnessed within this decade. RNA methylation is the predominant form of epigenetic regulation, and the most prevalent modification in RNA is N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A). Recently, RNA modification has emerged as a potential target for disease treatment. RNA modification is a posttranscriptional gene expression regulation that is involved in both physiological and pathological processes. Evidence suggests that m<sup>6</sup>A methylation significantly affects RNA metabolism, and its abnormal changes have been observed in a variety of diseases. Metabolic diseases are a series of diseases caused by abnormal metabolic processes of the body, the common metabolic diseases include diabetes mellitus, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, etc.; although the pathogenesis of these diseases differs from each other to the current understanding, most recent studies suggested pivotal role m<sup>6</sup>A in modulating these metabolic diseases, and m<sup>6</sup>A-based drug development has been on the agenda. This paper reviewed recent understanding of RNA modification in metabolic diseases, hoping to provide systematic information for those in this area.
40066223	Tissue-Resident Memory CD8+ T Cells: Differentiation, Phenotypic Heterogeneity, Biological Function, Disease, and Therapy.	CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are strategically located in peripheral tissues, enabling a rapid response to local infections, which is different from circulating memory CD8+ T cells. Their unique positioning makes them promising targets for vaccines designed to enhance protection at barrier sites and other organs. Recent studies have shown a correlation between CD8+ TRM cells and favorable clinical outcomes in various types of cancer, indicating their potential role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the dual nature of CD8+ TRM cells presents challenges, as their inappropriate activation may lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review highlights significant advancements in the field, focusing on the differentiation pathways and phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ TRM cells across different tissues and disease states. We also review their protective roles in various contexts and the implications for vaccine development against infections and treatment strategies for tumors. Overall, this comprehensive review outlines the common features of CD8+ TRM cell differentiation and biological functions, emphasizing their specific characteristics across diverse tissues and disease states, which can guide the design of therapies against infections and tumors while minimizing the risk of autoimmune diseases.
40066224	Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 1A Attenuates Apoptosis and Oxidative Stress via ERK/JNK Pathway in Hyperplastic Prostate.	Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a prevalent disorder in aging males. It is investigated whether heat shock protein family A member 1A (HSPA1A), a cytoprotective chaperone induced under stress, has been implicated in the development of BPH. RNA-sequencing and single-cell sequencing analyses revealed significant upregulation of HSPA1A in BPH compared to controls. In vitro experiments elucidated that HSPA1A was localized in prostatic epithelium and stroma, with upregulated expression in BPH tissues. Moreover, HSPA1A silencing augmented apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, inhibiting proliferation via ERK/JNK activation, while overexpression reversed these effects in prostatic BPH-1 and WPMY-1 cells. Additionally, ERK1/2 suppression with U0126 rescued the effects of HSPA1A silencing. In vivo, testosterone-induced BPH (T-BPH) rat models treated with the HSPA1A antagonist KNK437 exhibited prostatic atrophy and molecular changes consistent with reduced HSPA1A activity. Finally, we conducted a tissue microarray (TMA) analysis of 139 BPH specimens from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, which revealed a positive correlation between HSPA1A expression and clinical parameters, including prostate volume (PV), tPSA, fPSA, and IPSS. In conclusion, our findings suggested that HSPA1A attenuated apoptosis and oxidative stress through the ERK/JNK signaling pathway, contributing to BPH pathogenesis.
40066225	Clinical Utility of <sup>18</sup>Fluorine-Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor-04 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in the Evaluation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: Comparison With <sup>18</sup>Fluorine-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly susceptible to metastasis, making early detection of metastases and associated risk factors crucial for effective management. This study aimed to assess the performance of <sup>18</sup>fluorine (<sup>18</sup>F)- fibroblast activation protein inhibitor-04 (<sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in detecting metastasis and predicting pathological characteristics and risk factors in 67 PDAC patients. Comparisons were made with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) PET/CT. Lesion identifications and radiotracer uptakes were evaluated through visual inspection and semiquantitative analysis using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). We analyzed the risk factors for metastasis and observed that <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04 identified more positive lesions and showed significantly higher SUVmax values than <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in both primary tumors and metastases, leading to upstaging in several cases. In primary tumors, <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04 was associated with higher levels of poorly differentiated PDAC, compared to those with moderately differentiated tumors. Notably, the SUVmax of 18F-FAPI-04 in primary tumors demonstrated a significant correlation with pathological differentiation and served as an independent prognostic factor for peritoneal metastasis, rather than lymph node or liver metastasis. Our findings suggested that <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04 PET/CT offers superior tumor detectability and improved node-metastasis (NM) staging in PDAC patients, positioning it as a more effective tool than <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT.
40066226	Depletion of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 Facilitates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer Cells by Activating the MAPK/ERK Pathway.	Hyperactivation of fatty acid biosynthesis holds promise as a targeted therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer (PCa). However, inhibiting these enzymes could potentially promote metastatic progression in various other cancers. Herein, we found that depletion of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (encoded by ACACA), the enzyme responsible for the first and rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of PCa cells. This finding was validated in vitro through cell migration assays and in vivo using a metastatic model established by tail vein injection of ACACA-depleted cells into BALB/c nude mice. Additionally, depletion of ACACA activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway. Inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway reduced EMT and migration in ACACA-depleted cells. Our study is the first to indicate targeting ACACA induces an "unexpected" escape program through activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in PCa, ultimately leading to EMT and metastasis. Therefore, we strongly recommend that the potential adverse effects of targeting ACACA or its derived therapeutic agents must be given extreme attention, especially in MAPK-related cancers.
40066227	Carabrone Attenuates Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis by Targeting STAT3 in Mice.	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has become one of the most common progressive liver diseases worldwide, but effective treatment options are severely unmet. Carabrone, a sesquiterpene lactone from the traditional Chinese herb <i>Carpesium abrotanoides </i>L., shows various pharmacological properties, whereas its effect on the improvement of MASH and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been reported. In this work, we revealed for the first time the beneficial effect of carabrone on MASH, including reducing liver lipid accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and fibrosis in multiple diet-induced mice. Carabrone also alleviated lipid accumulation and inflammation in palmitic acid/oleic acid-stimulated hepatocytes. Mechanically, we identified signal transducers and transcriptional activator 3 (STAT3) as a key target of carabrone for treating MASH through quantitative chemical proteomic analysis, as well as the verification by the overexpression of STAT3 in vivo and in vitro. Further studies demonstrated that carabrone blocks MASH progression by inhibiting the activation of STAT3. More importantly, a new carabrone derivative <b>CA-21</b> with stronger anti-MASH activity and affinity for STAT3 was discovered through rational structural modification. Taken together, our findings suggest that carabrone and <b>CA-21</b> could be developed as promising drug candidates for MASH treatment.
40066228	<i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> Promotes the Growth and Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer by Activating E-Cadherin/Krüppel-Like Factor 4/Integrin α5 Signaling in a Calcium-Dependent Manner.	Gut microbiota and integrins are known to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether they interact has been unclear. Here, we provided evidence that <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> upregulated integrin α5 (ITGA5) in CRC in both human patients and murine models. Knocking down <i>ITGA5</i> in CRC cells weakened the ability of <i>F. nucleatum</i> to stimulate their malignant characteristics. <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which in turn promoted interaction between E-cadherin and Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), resulting in KLF4 phosphorylation and translocation in the nucleus, where it induced <i>ITGA5</i> transcription and activated the downstream signaling. Knocking down E-cadherin or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> with BAPTA-AM antagonized the impact of <i>F. nucleatum</i> on KLF4, whereas knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> antagonized the bacteria's oncogenic role. Knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or <i>ITGA5</i> attenuated <i>F. nucleatum-</i>induced growth of patient-derived organoids, subcutaneous xenografts, and orthotopic tumors, as well as liver metastasis in nude mice. Integrin α5 antibody antagonized the oncogenic role of <i>F. nucleatum</i> in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that <i>F. nucleatum</i> promotes the growth and metastasis of CRC by activating E-cadherin/KLF4/integrin α5 signaling in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner.
40066229	Pulmonary Hypertension: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Studies.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) stands as a tumor paradigm cardiovascular disease marked by hyperproliferation of cells and vascular remodeling, culminating in heart failure. Complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms collectively contribute to the disruption of pulmonary vascular homeostasis. In recent years, advancements in research technology have identified numerous gene deletions and mutations, in addition to <i>bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2</i>, that are closely associated with the vascular remodeling process in PH. Additionally, epigenetic modifications such as RNA methylation, DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs have been shown to precisely regulate PH molecular networks in a cell-type-specific manner, emerging as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review summarizes and analyzes the roles and molecular mechanisms of currently identified genes and epigenetic factors in PH, emphasizing the pivotal role of long ncRNAs in its regulation. Additionally, it examines current clinical and preclinical therapies for PH targeting these genes and epigenetic factors and explores potential new treatment strategies.
40066230	Sleep Disorders: Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Interventions.	Sleep disorder significantly disrupts the quality of life for patients. Although it is clinically acknowledged, the fundamental neuropathological mechanisms are still not understood. Recent preclinical research has been directed toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the sleep deprivation and sleep/wake dysregulation. Sleep disorder is linked to changes in the structure and function of the neural basis of cognition. We reviewed the neural circuits related to sleep disorders, along with alterations in connectivity and brain region functions, based on advancements in electrophysiology and optogenetic/chemogenetic techniques. We subsequently outline the cellular and molecular modifications linked to sleep disorders in preclinical studies, primarily involving changes in neuronal metabolism, electrophysiological activity, synaptic plasticity, and glial cells. Correspondingly, on the basis of the crosstalk between the brain and peripheral organs, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the involvement of celiac disease and hepatic disease in the pathogenesis of sleep disorders. In this review, we mainly discussed the pathogenesis at molecular, cellular, and neural circuit levels that contribute to sleep disorder. The review also covered potential strategies for treating sleep disorders and future research avenues.
40066231	The Role of Yes-Associated Protein in Inflammatory Diseases and Cancer.	Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays a central role in the Hippo pathway, primarily governing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its significance extends to tumorigenesis and inflammatory conditions, impacting disease initiation and progression. Given the increasing relevance of YAP in inflammatory disorders and cancer, this study aims to elucidate its pathological regulatory functions in these contexts. Specifically, we aim to investigate the involvement and molecular mechanisms of YAP in various inflammatory diseases and cancers. We particularly focus on how YAP activation, whether through Hippo-dependent or independent pathways, triggers the release of inflammation and inflammatory mediators in respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive inflammatory conditions. In cancer, YAP not only promotes tumor cell proliferation and differentiation but also modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby fostering tumor metastasis and progression. Additionally, we provide an overview of current YAP-targeted therapies. By emphasizing YAP's role in inflammatory diseases and cancer, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the protein's pivotal involvement in disease processes, elucidate the intricate pathological mechanisms of related diseases, and contribute to future drug development strategies targeting YAP.
40066232	Multidisciplinary Management of Palpebral Melanoma.	Ocular melanoma encompasses the uveal tract, conjunctiva, eyelid, and orbit. Palpebral localization is extremely infrequent, constituting less than 1% of skin melanomas, the main treatment of which is surgical. However, the radicality of the resection is restricted by anatomical location and functional sequelae. The importance of obtaining free surgical margins, which impact the percentage rate of locoregional recurrence and patient survival, has led to recommendations regarding the distance of the margin in the macroscopic (5 mm) and microscopic (>2 mm) evaluation, as well as the use of Mohs surgical technique for selected groups. Adequate surgical and reconstructive planning are the main objectives of multidisciplinary management in these patients. We present the case of a patient with palpebral melanoma treated in an oncology unit in Latin America.
40066235	Patient-Derived Organoids for Guiding Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Bilateral Primary Breast Cancer: A Case Report.	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard of care for locally advanced breast cancer, but the response to chemotherapy is unpredictable due to unknown information on the tumor drug sensitivity. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have recently been revealed to be a promising platform for assessing drug sensitivity in many cancers. A 46-year-old woman presented to the hospital due to an accidentally discovered mass in the left breast. Based on core-needle biopsies, pathologic examination showed invasive breast cancer in both breasts. In combination with immunohistochemistry, the patient was diagnosed with left breast cancer IIB with axillary lymphatic metastasis and right breast cancer IIA. The NAC with albumin-bound paclitaxel, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide was used. Although partial response was assessed overall, the left tumor did not lessen significantly; thus, organoids from bilateral breasts were cultured. After treatment with PDO-sensitive vinorelbine and carboplatin, partial response was achieved in the left compared with the initial tumor. Meanwhile, bilateral mastectomy was performed successfully, with pathological complete response achieved in the right. This typical case suggests that the PDOs from bilateral primary breast cancers can serve as a powerful tool to identify the sensitivity to NAC, thus providing novel treatment options at the patient-specific level.

40066251	Exploring the underlying molecular connections: a bioinformatics approach to link melanoma and Parkinson's disease.	Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, and Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, have been epidemiologically linked, showing a positive association that suggests a shared etiology. This association implies that individuals with one condition may have an increased risk of developing the other. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in both PD and melanoma to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may contribute to the pathophysiological overlap between these two conditions.
40066253	A Rare Case of <i>PRKACA</i> Duplication-Associated Childhood-Onset Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease.	Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a rare but important cause of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent Cushing syndrome (CS). It usually presents as cyclical CS in young adults. Childhood onset of PPNAD is exceedingly rare. About 90% of cases of PPNAD are associated with Carney complex (CNC). Both PPNAD and CNC are linked to diverse pathogenic variants of the <i>PRKAR1A</i> gene, which encodes the regulatory subunit type 1 alpha of protein kinase A (PKA). Pathogenic variants of <i>PRKACA</i> gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit alpha of PKA, are extremely rare in PPNAD. We report a case of a female child, aged 8 years and 3 months, who presented with features suggestive of CS, including obesity, short stature, hypertension, moon facies, acne, and facial plethora but without classical striae or signs of CNC. Hormonal evaluation confirmed ACTH-independent CS. However, abdominal imaging revealed normal adrenal morphology. Genetic analysis identified a duplication of the <i>PRKACA</i> gene on chromosome 19p, which is linked to PPNAD. The patient underwent bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and histopathological study confirmed the PPNAD diagnosis. Postoperative follow-up showed resolution of cushingoid features and hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a female child with <i>PRKACA</i> duplication presenting as CS due to PPNAD.
40066256	Artificial plasticenta: how polystyrene nanoplastics affect <i>in-vitro</i> cultured human trophoblast cells.	In the human placenta, we have detected the MPs by Raman microspectroscopy analysis and, for the first time, with transmission electron microscopy. MPs fragments have been localized in different compartments of placental tissue, free in the cytoplasm and within organelles like lysosomes. Moreover, their presence has been correlated with ultrastructural alterations of some cell organelles, typical of metabolic stress, mainly dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and numerous swollen electrodense mitochondria, as well as signs derived from involuting organelles. As a result, we have speculated that microplastics in the placenta could be responsible for pathological traits activation such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation causing long-term effects on the health of the mother and child. To demonstrate the cytotoxicity of PS-NPs on the placenta and confirm the <i>in vivo</i> results, we performed <i>in vitro</i> experiments on a trophoblast human cell line, the HTR8/SVneo cells.

40066258	Implications of draxin in neurological disorders.	Axon guidance proteins not only play a role in the formation of proper neural circuits but also have other important functions, such as cell survival, migration, and proliferation in the brain. Therefore, mutations in the genes encoding these proteins frequently cause various types of neurological disorders, including psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously identified an axon guidance protein, draxin, that is essential for the development of several neural circuits and cell survival in the brain. Recently, the deletion of the <i>draxin</i> gene was identified in an inbred BTBR T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup>/J (BTBR/J) mouse, which is a widely used model of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), suggesting that <i>draxin</i> deletion is a genetic factor for ASD-like characteristics in BTBR/J mice. In this review, I summarize the neuroanatomical abnormalities in <i>draxin</i> knockout mice by comparing them to BTBR/J mice and discuss the possible contributions of draxin to anatomical and behavioral phenotypes in BTBR/J mice.
40066259	Autophagy: regulating the seesaw of bone-fat balance.	The interrelationship between bone and fat can be described as a seesaw in bone homeostasis, in which both osteogenesis and adipogenesis occur in a delicate balance. Osteoblasts and adipocytes share a common origin and play key roles in osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Bone-fat balance indicates osteogenesis and adipogenesis keeps a balance for concordant distribution of trabecular bone and bone marrow adipose tissue in bone, thereby leading to the balance between bone metabolism and lipid metabolism. Bone-fat balance is crucial for metabolic health. When disrupted by various factors, this balance can lead to several bone-related metabolic diseases and systemic disorders, such as obesity, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. Recent research highlights the role of autophagy dysfunction in these metabolic conditions. Restoring autophagic function can help restore metabolic homeostasis and re-establish the bone-fat balance. The current review explores the factors that regulate bone-fat balance, the consequences of imbalance under pathological conditions, and the potential of autophagy modulation as a therapeutic approach. Overall, it can be concluded that targeting autophagy presents a promising strategy for treating metabolic disorders and restoring bone-fat balance.
40066261	Comprehensive investigation of proteoglycan gene expression in breast cancer: Discovery of a unique proteoglycan gene signature linked to the malignant phenotype.	Solid tumors present a formidable challenge in oncology, necessitating innovative approaches to improve therapeutic outcomes. Proteoglycans, multifaceted molecules within the tumor microenvironment, have garnered attention due to their diverse roles in cancer progression. Their unique ability to interact with specific membrane receptors, growth factors, and cytokines provides a promising avenue for the development of recombinant proteoglycan-based therapies that could enhance the precision and efficacy of cancer treatment. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the proteoglycan gene landscape in human breast carcinomas. Leveraging the available wealth of genomic and clinical data regarding gene expression in breast carcinoma and using a machine learning model, we identified a unique gene expression signature composed of five proteoglycans differentially modulated in the tumor tissue: Syndecan-1 and asporin (upregulated) and decorin, PRELP and podocan (downregulated). Additional query of the breast carcinoma data revealed that serglycin, previously shown to be increased in breast carcinoma patients and mouse models and to correlate with a poor prognosis, was indeed decreased in the vast majority of breast cancer patients and its levels inversely correlated with tumor progression and invasion. This proteoglycan gene signature could provide novel diagnostic capabilities in breast cancer biology and highlights the need for further utilization of publicly available datasets for the clinical validation of preclinical experimental results.
40066262	Integrated Single-Step Terahertz Metasensing for Simultaneous Detection Based on Exosomal Membrane Proteins Enables Pathological Typing of Gastric Cancer.	Exosomes (Exos) are emerging as noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and progression monitoring of gastric cancer (GC). However, the heterogeneity discrimination and ultrasensitive quantification of Exos presents a considerable analytical challenge, thereby impeding severely their clinical application. Herein, we propose an integrated terahertz metasensing platform for the discrimination of Exos in distinct subtypes of GC in a single step-through the simultaneous evaluation of the category and richness level of Exos membrane proteins. Characterized by dual-sided independent sensing capabilities with enhanced sensitivity (169 and 325 GHz per refractive index unit, respectively), the metasensor functionalized with antibodies simultaneously reflects the content of 2 membrane proteins in the terahertz spectral response. Our approach concurrently completes accurate differentiation and precise quantification of GC-subtype Exos by integrating dual-sided sensing information in merely a single assay. The dual-sided sensing design enhances the reliability of detection results. Moreover, combined with the signal amplification of gold nanoparticles, the platform experimentally demonstrates a superior dynamic response to Exos concentrations spanning from 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> particles/ml, with the limit of detection being 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> particles/ml. This work provides new insights into multisensing metasurface design and paves the way for precise and personalized cancer treatment through the specific sensing of Exos.

40066265	Biodegradation of polyhydroxyalkanoates: current state and future prospects.	Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biobased and biodegradable polymers that offer a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics, addressing the escalating concerns over plastic pollution. While their environmental advantages are well-documented, the efficient degradation of PHAs in natural and engineered environments remains a critical component of their lifecycle. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PHA-degrading bacteria isolated from diverse ecosystems and highlights the pivotal role of PHA depolymerases in achieving PHA circularity. Microbial adaptation to diverse environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, salinity, and pH, significantly influences enzymes properties, including the stability, activity, and substrate specificity of PHA-degrading enzymes. These adaptations often enhance enzyme, performance, enabling functionality under challenging conditions. Consequently, extremophilic microorganisms are invaluable resources for discovering and engineering robust PHA depolymerases for industrial and environmental applications. This review underscores the urgent need for further research to improve the ecological and economic sustainability of PHA waste management.

40066267	<i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> regulates gut microbiota and increases the effective metabolite luteolin to inhibit MAPK/STAT3 signaling pathway to alleviate allergic rhinitis.	The global prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) remains high, posing challenges due to its chronic nature and propensity for recurrence. Gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to immune dysregulation, impacting AR pathogenesis. <i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> (<i>L. reuteri</i>) has great potential in regulating immune function to alleviate AR symptoms. However, the specific active components and mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects in AR remain incompletely clarified. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms of <i>L. reuteri</i> and its metabolites in alleviating AR. The AR mouse model was constructed using ovalbumin (OVA). The analysis of hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE staining) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) suggested that <i>L. reuteri</i> alleviated nasal inflammation, suppressed aberrant Th2 immune responses, and modulated the balance of Treg and Th17 cytokines. The 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolic analysis revealed that <i>L. reuteri</i> restored gut microbiota composition and significantly increased the abundance of <i>Ligilactobacillus</i> and the metabolite luteolin (LO). Through ELISA and Western blotting analysis, LO treatment restored the Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 cytokine balance and suppressed the MAPK/STAT3 signaling pathway in AR mice. The study highlights LO as a key metabolite contributing to the anti-inflammatory effects of <i>L. reuteri</i>, suggesting potential avenues for future therapeutic strategies in AR management.

40066272	The landscape of biofilm models for phage therapy: mimicking biofilms in diabetic foot ulcers using 3D models.	Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) affect up to 15-25% of patients suffering from diabetes and are considered a global health concern. These ulcers may result in delayed wound healing and chronic infections, with the potential to lead to amputations. It has been estimated that 85% of diabetes-related amputations are preceded by a diagnosis of DFU. A critical factor in the persistence of this disease is the presence of polymicrobial biofilms, which generally include <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The involvement of diabetic comorbidities such as ischemia, hyperglycemia, and immune-compromised status creates a perfect niche for these bacteria to evade the body's immune response and persist as biofilms. Bacteriophage therapy can target and lyse specific bacteria and is emerging as an effective treatment for biofilm-related infections. While this treatment shows promise in addressing chronic wounds, our current models, including animal and static systems, fail to capture the full complexity of DFU. Innovative approaches such as 3D bioengineered skin models, organoid models, and hydrogel-based systems are being developed to simulate DFU microenvironments more accurately in 3D without using <i>ex vivo</i> or animal tissues. These advanced models are critical for evaluating bacteriophage efficacy in biofilm-associated DFU, aiming to enhance preclinical assessments and improve therapeutic outcomes for DFU patients.
40066273	Mobile genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>: important pathways for the acquisition of virulence and resistance.	<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> is an opportunistic pathogen primarily associated with nosocomial infections, characterized by a propensity for multi-drug resistance and the potential evolution into hypervirulent strains. Based on its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, <i>K. pneumoniae</i> can be classified into two types: classical <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (cKP) and hypervirulent <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (hvKP). The spread of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> has led to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (CRKP) and carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (CR-hvKP). The emergence of CR-hvKP is particularly concerning due to its multidrug resistance, high pathogenicity, and increased transmissibility. This review summarizes the types of MGEs present in <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, the mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by these mobile elements, their roles in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence genes, and the relationships among MGEs that resemble Russian dolls or exhibit hybrid characteristics. Additionally, the clinical treatment and epidemiological characteristics of CR-hvKP are discussed. Given the high variability and transmissibility of MGEs, continuous monitoring and control of the variation and transmission of such genetic material in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> should be prioritized.
40066274	Addressing the global challenge of bacterial drug resistance: insights, strategies, and future directions.	The COVID-19 pandemic underscored bacterial resistance as a critical global health issue, exacerbated by the increased use of antibiotics during the crisis. Notwithstanding the pandemic's prevalence, initiatives to address bacterial medication resistance have been inadequate. Although an overall drop in worldwide antibiotic consumption, total usage remains substantial, requiring rigorous regulatory measures and preventive activities to mitigate the emergence of resistance. Although National Action Plans (NAPs) have been implemented worldwide, significant disparities persist, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Settings such as farms, hospitals, wastewater treatment facilities, and agricultural environments include a significant presence of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG), promoting the propagation of resistance. Dietary modifications and probiotic supplementation have shown potential in reshaping gut microbiota and reducing antibiotic resistance gene prevalence. Combining antibiotics with adjuvants or bacteriophages may enhance treatment efficacy and mitigate resistance development. Novel therapeutic approaches, such as tailored antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and nanoparticles, offer alternate ways of addressing resistance. In spite of advancements in next-generation sequencing and analytics, gaps persist in comprehending the role of gut microbiota in regulating antibiotic resistance. Effectively tackling antibiotic resistance requires robust policy interventions and regulatory measures targeting root causes while minimizing public health risks. This review provides information for developing strategies and protocols to prevent bacterial colonization, enhance gut microbiome resilience, and mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance.

However, current RT concepts for PCa have an imminent need to be rectified in order to modify the radiotherapeutic strategy by considering (i) the personal PCa biology in terms of radio resistance and (ii) the individual preferences of each patient.
40066284	Mechanical countermeasures for spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome during 30-days of head down tilt bed rest: design, implementation, and tolerability.	After longer duration space missions, some astronauts experience structural and functional changes in the eye and structural changes in the brain, termed Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS). Countermeasures against SANS are required to minimize potential operation impacts and negative long-term health consequences. Headward fluid shifts, which appear to promote SANS, provide a target for countermeasures. The SANS countermeasures study, a 30 days strict head down tilt bed rest (HDTBR) study, tested two mechanical countermeasures aimed at reversing cephalad fluid overload. This work presents design and methodology of the study with a focus on countermeasure implementation and tolerability. Following baseline evaluations, participants were randomized to four groups and HDTBR commenced: Daily application of 25 mmHg lower body negative pressure for 6 h, six-hour bilateral venous constrictive thigh cuffs following moderate cycling exercise on 6 days per week, a negative control group without countermeasures, and a positive control group with HDTBR interruption for 6 h per day by sitting upright. The potential of these countermeasures for future space applications was examined in 86 different experiments, which will be reported elsewhere. Comfort ratings ranging from 1 (very uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable) were used to asses tolerability. Overall, 47 participants (20 women) completed the study. Out of 4,032 h scheduled for both countermeasures, 10.5 h were not performed due to medical issues unrelated to the countermeasures. Mean comfort ratings were 3.9 in men and 4.4 in women in the lower body negative pressure group (p = 0.1356) and 4.2 in men and 3.9 in women in the thigh cuff group (p = 0.1604). We conclude that both countermeasures were well tolerated and applied under well controlled conditions, thus, allowing for meaningful analyses of efficacy in attenuating HDTBR effects.
40066286	Connexin hemichannels and early atrophic signaling in muscle during sepsis.	Sepsis pathogenesis is complex, and effective treatments are limited, leading to high mortality rates between 20% and 55%. Early identification of factors contributing to sepsis-related muscle dysfunction is critical for risk stratification and potential therapeutic development. The immune response during sepsis affects skeletal muscles, contributing to organ dysfunction and worsening prognosis. In this study, we explore the role of connexin hemichannels (Cx HCs) in the early changes in muscle homeostasis during sepsis. Using a cecal ligature and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis model, we assessed IL-6 levels, weight loss, myofiber cross-sectional area, resting membrane potential, and connexin expression in control and Cx43/Cx45-deficient mice. CLP induced IL-6 elevation, sarcolemma permeabilization, reduced membrane potential, and activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in control mice, while Cx43/45-deficient mice exhibited reduced all CLP-induced muscle alterations. These findings suggest that Cx43 and Cx45 are involved in the early development of muscle alterations during sepsis.

40066310	Advances in the detection of biomarkers for ischemic stroke.	Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Prompt intervention is essential for arresting disease progression and minimizing central nervous system damage. Although imaging studies play a significant role in diagnosing ischemic stroke, their high costs and limited sensitivity often result in diagnostic and treatment delays. Blood biomarkers have shown considerable promise in the diagnosis and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Serum markers, closely associated with stroke pathophysiology, aid in diagnosis, subtype identification, prediction of disease progression, early neurological deterioration, and recurrence. Their advantages are particularly pronounced due to their low cost and rapid results. Despite the identification of numerous candidate blood biomarkers, their clinical application requires rigorous research and thorough validation. This review focuses on various blood biomarkers related to ischemic stroke, including coagulation and fibrinolysis-related factors, endothelial dysfunction markers, inflammatory biomarkers, neuronal and axonal injury markers, exosomes with their circular RNAs and other relevant molecules. It also summarizes the latest methods and techniques for stroke biomarker detection, aiming to provide critical references for the clinical application of key stroke biomarkers.

40066315	<i>Cellulophaga algicola</i> alginate lyase and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Psl glycoside hydrolase inhibit biofilm formation by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> CF2843 on three-dimensional aggregates of lung epithelial cells.	<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that produces a biofilm containing the polysaccharides, alginate, Psl, and Pel, and causes chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients. Others and we have previously explored the use of alginate lyases in inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation on plastic and lung epithelial cell monolayers. We now employ a more physiologically representative model system, i.e., three-dimensional aggregates of A549 lung epithelial cells cultured under conditions of microgravity in a rotary cell culture system to mimic the natural lung environment, and a previously isolated clinical strain, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> CF2843 that we engineered by transposon-mediated integration to express Green Fluorescent Protein and for which we also report the complete genome sequence. Immunostaining and lectin binding studies indicated that the three-dimensional cell aggregates harbored sialylated and fucosylated epitopes as well as Muc1, Muc5Ac, and β-catenin on their surfaces, suggestive of mucin secretion and the presence of tight junctions, hallmark features of lung epithelial tissue. Using this validated model system with confocal microscopy and viable bacterial counts as readouts, we demonstrated that <i>Cellulophaga algicola</i> alginate lyase and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Psl glycoside hydrolase, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Pel glycoside hydrolase, inhibit biofilm formation by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> on three-dimensional lung epithelial cell aggregates.
40066316	Cognitive control circuit function predicts antidepressant outcomes: A signal detection approach to actionable clinical decisions.

40066319	Impact of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Cognitive Outcomes in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by a set of deficits not limited to social communication, which is restricted and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of autism has been seen to be consistently increasing globally. Autism is multifactorial in its etiology, and it involves several physiological systems, including the central nervous system and the gut-brain axis. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for neural development and functionality, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). They both play a crucial role in not only reducing the neuroinflammation associated with autism but also supporting cognitive processing as well. Given the low levels of omega-3 noted in ASD individuals, this systematic review aims to assess the influence of omega-3 supplementation on cognitive outcomes in children with ASD. The systematic review was done following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, where different databases were assessed across PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Scopus. MeSH terms used included keywords "Omega-3", "EPA", "DHA" AND "Autism Spectrum Disorder" OR "ASD". Articles published between 2007 and 2023 that focused on ages 2 to 18 years were screened, and cognitive outcomes relevant to omega-3 supplementation were included. Studies with inadequate access to full text excluded non-human trials and older individuals. After generating 25,312 articles, 211 were selected for further review, with 11 meeting the inclusion criteria. The articles reviewed panned over five different countries that involved omega-3 supplementation lasting up to one year. Results suggested that DHA and EPA supplementation may improve cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and executive functioning in children with ASD. The prefrontal cortex development was associated with DHA supplementation, whereas EPA showed improved emotional regulation and reduced neuroinflammation. However, conclusive results were not reached as there was variability in study designs, different dosages, and assessment methods. The power of the studies conducted was also noted to be limited. While promising, extensive research and trials are required to standardize the dosage of omega-3 and the length of intervention. Future studies should aim to identify the long-term effects of omega-3 supplementation, understand the gut-brain axis, and investigate the combination of omega-3 with other therapies to improve cognitive functioning.
40066321	Successful Management of Infective Endocarditis Complicated by Pheochromocytoma: A Case Report.	Pheochromocytomas present with paroxysmal hypertension due to a sudden release of catecholamines stimulated by radiological contrast media, surgery, or anesthetic agents. This often complicates the maintenance of patient hemodynamics during surgery. A 55-year-old man with a high fever was admitted to a hospital. Laboratory blood tests revealed elevated white blood cell and C-reactive protein levels. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed moderate aortic regurgitation, along with aortic valve vegetation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cerebral embolisms, whereas computed tomography showed a left adrenal incidentaloma. Further examinations showed high levels of plasma-free metanephrine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline in the blood and metanephrines in the urine. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy revealed ligand accumulation in the tumor at 6 and 24 h after injection. Based on these results, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed. Doxazosin was promptly administered, and its dosage was escalated. Despite ongoing antimicrobial therapy, transesophageal echocardiography did not reveal any reduction in the size of the vegetation. Hence, the patient underwent surgical treatment. A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was initially performed. The patient's blood pressure increased with insufflation and manipulation around the tumor but dropped immediately after the adrenal tumor was resected. Following the adrenalectomy, a cardiopulmonary bypass was established. The bicuspid aortic valve leaflets along with the vegetation were completely resected. Subsequently, a mechanical aortic valve was implanted. Inotropic agents were completely weaned off within two days after surgery. A pathological examination confirmed the adrenal incidentaloma to be pheochromocytoma. One-stage surgery with adrenalectomy before cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass may be an effective strategy for patients with pheochromocytomas diagnosed with infective endocarditis. In addition, it can reduce the risk of complications with pheochromocytoma by managing the patient's systemic condition as much as possible before cardiac surgery.
40066322	Biomimetic Self-Oxygenated Immunoliposome for Cancer-Targeted Photodynamic Immunotherapy.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy with significant clinical application potential for tumor treatment. However, the tumor hypoxia and limited efficacy against tumor metastasis present significant limitations in the clinical application of PDT. To alleviate tumor hypoxia for PDT against tumor growth and metastasis, we developed a self-oxygenated immunoliposome by encapsulating the catalase (CAT) within the liposome cavity and loading the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and immunoadjuvant MPLA in the lipid bilayer of the immunoliposome (CAT@LP-Ce6-A). Subsequently, we fused it with the cancer cell membrane (CCM) to create the hybrid immunoliposome (CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A). The in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A-based photodynamic immunotherapy (PDIT) was evaluated.

40066327	An Unexplored Diversity for Adaptation of Germination to High Temperatures in <i>Brassica</i> Species.	Elevated temperatures inhibit the germination of a concerning number of crop species. One strategy to mitigate the impact of warming temperatures is to identify and introgress adaptive genes into elite germplasm. Diversity must be sought in wild populations, coupled with an understanding of the complex pattern of adaptation across a broad range of landscapes. By investigating the landraces, wild, and feral populations of Algeria, Italy, France, Slovenia, Spain, and Tunisia, we assessed the response of germination to temperature increase in an unexplored diversity of 117 accessions of <i>Brassica rapa</i> and 66 of <i>Brassica oleracea</i>. Our results show that both species exhibit heat tolerance to the temperature range tested, especially <i>B. rapa</i>, with an increase in speed and uniformity of germination time, as well as an increase in germination rate as temperature increased. As for <i>B. oleracea</i> accessions, the ability to germinate under heat conditions depended on the geographical origin; in particular, southern populations showed a higher germination rate than northern populations, possibly in relation to their warmer climates of origin. These findings highlight the complex interplay between domestication, feralization, and current agronomic practices in shaping germination characteristics in <i>Brassica</i> species.
40066329	Intestinal current measurement detects age-dependent differences in CFTR function in rectal epithelium.	Intestinal current measurement (ICM) provides a sensitive bioassay for assessment of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function in rectal biopsies <i>ex vivo</i> and is used as a diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis (CF). Furthermore, ICM was shown to be sensitive to detect pharmacological rescue of CFTR function by CFTR modulators in people with CF carrying responsive <i>CFTR</i> mutations. Results from clinical trials of CFTR modulators across age groups indicate that CFTR function in the sweat duct may be age-dependent with children reaching higher levels than adults. However, little is known about age dependency of CFTR function in the intestinal epithelium.
40066330	Potential mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine intervention in gastric cancer: targeted regulation of autophagy.	Gastric cancer (GC) is a prevalent malignant tumor that originates from the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa, predominantly in the form of adenocarcinoma. Extensive research has confirmed the significant role of autophagy in the initiation, progression, and chemoresistance of GC. The potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to exert anti-tumor effects by modulating autophagy has been demonstrated, particularly in the context of GC prevention and treatment. Natural products (NPs) have great therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of GC by targeting autophagy-related genes and signaling pathways to intervene in the biological behaviors of gastric cancer cells such as proliferation, metastasis, invasion and death. This article describes the molecular mechanisms and key markers of tumor autophagy, the signaling pathways involved in GC-associated autophagy (PI3K/AKT/mTOR, AMPK, MAPK, p53), and summarizes the mechanism of autophagy and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection in GC, how autophagy interacts with apoptotic and iron-death processes and the wide-ranging influences that these factors play in the process. Finally, this paper systematically summarizes the natural compounds of terpenoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, saponins, and polysaccharides that modulate autophagy-related signaling pathways and potential targets for the treatment of GC, and evaluates the toxic effects of NPs, providing a more compelling rationale and direction for GC therapy.
40066331	Ginsenoside Ro ameliorates cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice via the IBA1/GFAP-MAPK signaling pathway.

Ginsenosides, the active compounds in ginseng, have shown promise in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Ginsenoside Ro and its underlying mechanisms in AD treatment.
40066333	Cepharanthine hydrochloride: a novel ferroptosis-inducing agent for prostate cancer treatment.	Ferroptosis is an intracellular iron-dependent cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Increasing evidence indicated that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in suppressing tumors, thus providing new opportunities for cancer therapy. The drug cepharanthine, commonly used to treat leukopenia, has been discovered to function as an anticancer agent to multiple types of cancer via diverse mechanisms. However, the effect of cepharanthine on prostate cancer remains unclear.
40066335	Gold complex QB1561 suppresses drug-resistant cancer cells by inhibiting TrxR and mitochondrial respiratory function.	Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is one of the leading reasons that cause the failures of cancer treatment. Novel agents that may reverse MDR and neutralize drug-resistant cancer cells are highly desirable for clinical practice. The targeting of cellular redox homeostasis and/or mitochondria-mediated energy metabolism are promising strategies for the suppression of drug-resistant cancer cells. Based on the structure of mono-gold(I) complex auranofin (AF), a drug candidate under clinical trials for cancer, we synthesized a new dual-gold(I) complex QB1561 and tested if it can inhibit drug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We also investigated if QB1561 could inhibit thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a well-known target of AF and other gold complexes, and assessed its impact on mitochondrial respiration.
40066336	Ferroptosis, pathogenesis and therapy in AS co-depression disease.	Atherosclerosis (AS)-related cardiovascular disease and depression are often comorbid, with patients with cardiovascular disease facing an increased risk of depression, which worsens AS. Both diseases are characterized by oxidative stress and lipid metabolism disorders. Ferroptosis, a form of cell death characterized by iron overload and harmful lipid peroxide accumulation, is found in various diseases, including AS and depression. Consistent with the iron deposition and lipid peroxidation (LPO) that characterize the ferroptosis mechanism, disturbances in iron and lipid metabolism are also crucial pathogenic mechanisms in AS and depression. The comorbid mechanisms are complex, posing challenges for clinical treatment. Chinese herbs hold significant potential owing to their multi-target pharmacological effects. Therefore, this review aims to investigate iron overload, LPO, and ferroptosis across various cell types, the shared pathogenesis of AS and depression with ferroptosis, and research on Chinese herbal medicine targeting ferroptosis in the treatment of anti-AS co-depression. This provides a comprehensive understanding of AS co-depression disease from the perspective of ferroptosis.
40066338	Progress of tanshinone IIA against respiratory diseases: therapeutic targets and potential mechanisms.	The respiratory system stands as one of the eight pivotal systems within the human body, responsible for a range of essential functions. Primarily, it facilitates the absorption of oxygen from the external environment and the expulsion of carbon dioxide, thereby playing a crucial role in regulating the body's acid-base balance. Furthermore, it helps to maintain the stability of the internal environment, ensuring the smooth progression of normal metabolic processes and sustaining life activities. In the wake of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak, respiratory diseases have continued to exhibit comparatively high morbidity and mortality rates, underscoring the urgent need for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a bioactive chemical constituent derived from <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge,</i> has emerged as a promising candidate. As a significant fat-soluble compound, Tan IIA has traditionally been utilized in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. As research on Tan IIA has progressed, its multifaceted therapeutic potential has been unveiled. Specifically, Tan IIA has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, anti-fibrosis, and anti-cancer effects. In recent years, a wealth of studies has concentrated on elucidating its impact on various respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, and lung cancer. These findings collectively suggest that Tan IIA holds considerable promise in the realm of anti-respiratory disease therapies. The present article undertakes a comprehensive review of the targets and potential mechanisms of Tan IIA against respiratory diseases, offering valuable insights that can serve as a reference for future research endeavors and clinical applications of Tan IIA in the treatment of respiratory ailments.
40066340	Asiatic acid in anticancer effects: emerging roles and mechanisms.	Medicinal plants are crucial in the comprehensive treatment of anti-tumor with the advantages of high efficacy, low toxicity, multiple pathways and multi-targets synergy, leading to be a focal point of study for many oncologists. Identifying effective monomer components with anti-tumor properties from medicinal plants has long been a crucial focus in the study and development of traditional Chinese medicine. This endeavor has significant research value and promising possibilities for further advancement. Asiatic Acid (AA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid derived from <i>Centella asiatica</i> (L.) Urb, is used in traditional Chinese medicine and has been shown to have anti-tumor properties on a range of tumor types. The present study assessed the anti-tumor properties of AA from five different perspectives: inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, inhibiting invasion and metastasis, regulating cell autophagy, enhancing the resistance of tumor cells to drugs, and minimizing adverse side effects.
40066341	Thromboprophylaxis and adult congenital heart disease: The latest on indications, risk scoring and therapy.	Advances in medical care have significantly extended the lifespan of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), allowing most to survive into adulthood. However, they continue to face significant cardiovascular morbidity, particularly atrial arrhythmias (AA), heart failure, and thromboembolic (TE) events. TE events in adult CHD patients arise from various factors, including AA, intracardiac repairs, cyanotic CHD, Fontan palliation, pregnancy, and mechanical heart valves (MHV). As randomized clinical trials are lacking, most current guidelines rely on observational data and expert opinions, leading to inherent variability. While vitamin K antagonists are the only option for patients with MHV and significant mitral stenosis, direct oral anticoagulants appear to be a reasonable choice for other indications. In the presence of AA, complex conditions alone may justify anticoagulation, whereas thromboembolic and haemorrhagic risks should be evaluated individually for simpler lesions. This review summarizes the available evidence and makes relevant recommendations regarding thromboprophylaxis in ACHD patients, focusing on indications, risk scores, and therapies.
40066342	Pulmonary arterial hypertension in Latin America. The age and comorbidity paradox.	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been classically described as a disease in young adults, predominantly females with no comorbidities. However, in recent registries, the epidemiology has changed to older patients with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, systemic hypertension, and coronary heart disease. Nevertheless, there is not enough inclusion of these patients in clinical trials. In contrast, in Latin America, registries have shown that PAH patients are younger and have fewer comorbidities, which raises the question of whether Latin American patients present a different phenotype or if we are lagging behind developed countries and whether we will experience a change in epidemiology in the next couple of years. We analyzed these trends in this review.
40066344	The root of the matter: Linking oral health to chronic diseases prevention.	Oral health is increasingly recognized as a vital component of general health, influencing various systemic systems. Periodontal diseases, particularly periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the gums and supporting tissues of teeth, have far-reaching implications beyond the oral cavity. Treating periodontitis not only benefits oral health but also plays a crucial role in reducing the burden of these chronic conditions, improving patient outcomes and lowering healthcare costs. Regular screenings for oral health issues, especially in patients with conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, should become standard practice in medical settings. Additionally, oral health professionals must be empowered to identify early signs of systemic diseases, creating a bidirectional flow of referrals between dentists and physicians. Ultimately, prioritizing oral health not only enhances individual well-being but also serves the greater public health good.
40066345	Pregnancy and pulmonary artery hypertension: Management challenges.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a term used to describe a complex heterogenous group of conditions defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of more than 20 mmHg at rest on right-heart catheterization. PH in pregnancy is associated with high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality and poor fetal outcomes. Currently, pregnancy in these women is classified as modified WHO class IV (pregnancy contraindicated). More recent data suggest that the prognosis varies with the underlying aetiology as well as with PH severity. Consequently, management during pregnancy must be individualised, with patients cared for in a tertiary unit as part of an experienced multidisciplinary team. In this article, we will discuss the importance of preconception counselling, the impact of the haemodynamic changes induced by pregnancy, the maternal and fetal risks of pregnancy in women with PH, and how these can be minimised by close antenatal, intrapartum and post-partum care and the development of individualised pregnancy plans.
40066346	Burden of rotavirus and other microorganisms in hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis in Yangon, Myanmar, before the introduction of rotavirus vaccine.	In developing countries, acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years. In Myanmar, no comprehensive study has been done to investigate the microorganisms responsible for AGE among hospitalized children. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the microorganisms responsible for AGE in children hospitalized in Myanmar before the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine.
40066347	Constitutive overexpression of <i>Qui-Quine Starch</i> gene simultaneously improves starch and protein content in bioengineered cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz).	Cassava is a crucial source of daily calorie intake for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) but has an inferior protein content. Despite numerous attempts utilizing both traditional and biotechnological methods, efforts to address protein deficiency in cassava have yet to meet with much success. We aim to leverage modern biotechnologies to enhance cassava's nutritional value by creating bioengineered cassava cultivars with increased protein and starch content. In this study, we utilized <i>Qui-Quine Starch</i> (<i>QQS</i>), a novel orphan gene unique to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, to develop transgenic cassava plants with increased protein and starch accumulation in their tissues. A total of 10 independent transgenic cassava lines expressing <i>QQS</i> were successfully regenerated in this study, among which line R7 (F) demonstrated superior growth vigor. Quantitative RT-PCR verified the expression of the <i>QQS</i> gene in the transgenic lines. Data showed that <i>QQS</i> expression in cassava plants increased leaf protein content by 36% in line R''' (LA) L2 and root protein by 17% for the same line compared to their wild-type and empty vector (NPTII) control plants. Moreover, leaf-soluble total carbohydrates increased by 51.76% in line R (G) L2, and root-soluble total carbohydrates increased by 46.75% in line R7 (F). The novel function of <i>QQS</i> in increasing the starch content in the transgenic biomass is demonstrated. No significant change in the content of specific amino acids was observed among the lines and various plant parts. In addition, <i>QQS</i> expression revealed increased biomass, plant vigor, and early In vitro mini-tubers production for line R7 (F). Gene interaction study between AtQQS and 59 interacting partners generated 184 interactions or edges. These gene networks comprised several functional categories regulating the starch metabolic and auxin biosynthetic processes. The role of <i>QQS</i> in imparting starch and protein content of transgenic cassava plants is validated. The next logical step is the evaluation of biochemical profiles of cassava lines expressing <i>QQS</i> that reach maturity and the transferability of these findings to consumer-preferred cassava cultivars and local landraces grown in SSA. This study represents the first biotechnological report demonstrating a simultaneous increase of protein and starch content in bioengineered cassava.
40066349	Intraprocedural activated clotting time and heparin dosage in pulsed field ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.	Whether the intraprocedural anticoagulation regimen and activated clotting time (ACT) in pulsed field ablation (PFA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) are the same as those for radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is currently unknown.
40066350	Association between estimated glucose disposal rate and incident cardiovascular disease in a population with Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic syndrome stages 0-3: insights from CHARLS.	Estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) is a reliable marker of insulin resistance (IR), which has been proven to be strongly linked to cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, the link between eGDR and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals exhibiting Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic (CKM) syndrome stages 0-3 remains ambiguous.
40066351	Diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence models in detecting congenital heart disease in the second-trimester fetus through prenatal cardiac screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a major contributor to morbidity and infant mortality and imposes the highest burden on global healthcare costs. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of CHD contribute to enhanced neonatal outcomes and survival rates; however, there is a shortage of proficient examiners in remote regions. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ultrasound provides a potential solution to improve the diagnostic accuracy of fetal CHD screening.
40066352	Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of hub genes in ischemic heart failure and atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) frequently coexist and mutually influence each other. The association between AF and the subtype of HF, Ischaemic heart failure (IHF), remains insufficiently described, despite their high prevalence. Hence, comprehending their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic targets are urgently needed.
40066353	Modeling thoracic aortic genetic variants in the zebrafish: useful for predicting clinical pathogenicity?	Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) significantly impact cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A large subset of TAAD cases, particularly those with an earlier onset, is linked to heritable genetic defects. Despite progress in characterizing genes associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic heritable TAAD, the causative gene remains unknown in most cases. Another important bottleneck in the correct and timely diagnosis of TAAD is the large proportion of variants of unknown significance (VUS) that are routinely encountered upon medical genetic testing. Reliable functional modeling data is required to accurately identify new causal genes and to determine the pathogenicity of VUS. To address this gap, our collaborative effort-comprising teams from Yale University, University of Kentucky, and Ghent University-explores a novel approach: modeling TAAD in zebrafish. Leveraging the unique advantages of this animal model promises to allow for accelerated variant pathogenicity assessment, ultimately enhancing patient care. In this review, we critically explore the currently available zebrafish-based approaches that can be used for testing pathogenicity of genes and variants related to TAAD, and we offer an outlook on the implementation of these strategies for clinical applications.
40066356	Adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation in post-PCI patients: a latent class analysis.	Coronary heart disease seriously jeopardizes human health and has become a principal public health problem of global concern. While percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) repairs narrowed arteries and extends patients' lives, cardiac rehabilitation offers additional benefits post-PCI. Numerous previous studies have shown that cardiac rehabilitation can inhibit the progression of atherosclerotic plaques in patients after coronary intervention, effectively controlling patients' clinical symptoms and improving their quality of life. However, the current status of adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation is poor, and the variation in adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation among post-PCI patients in China are not well understood. This study aimed to identify the heterogeneity of adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation and its influencing factors in post-PCI patients through latent class analysis (LCA) to support individualized interventions.
40066359	Hydrogel and scalp/skin conductivities impact dose from tumor treating fields.	Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are delivered by transducer arrays applied to scalp or body surface for treatment of multiple malignancies. Dermatologic complications are thought to be related to hydrogel situated between the electrodes and scalp or skin to facilitate electric field penetration. High intensity of TTFields on these surfaces may also be a contributing factor. We explored conductivity changes in the hydrogel and skin to improve TTFields coverage and penetration.
40066360	Selenium-modified hydroxyapatite titanium coating: enhancing osteogenesis and inhibiting cancer in bone invasion by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) frequently invades the jaw, and surgical treatment often leads to bone defects requiring reconstruction with titanium plates. To enhance the anti-tumor and bone regeneration properties of titanium, a selenium-modified hydroxyapatite coating was developed on titanium surfaces.
40066361	There and turn back again: the application of phage serine integrases in eukaryotic systems.	Serine integrases (Ints) have gained prominence and have been extensively used in Synthetic Biology due to their ability to modify DNA sequences. Ints are recombinases encoded by the phage genome and have been used to unidirectionally catalyze an insertion, excision, or inversion of a specific DNA sequence between the two attachment sites (<i>att</i>) <i>attB</i> (bacterial attachment site) and <i>attP</i> (phage attachment site). The entire process is highly specific and accurate; therefore, Ints are widely used in genetic engineering and have been extensively studied due to their unique site-specific recombination properties and potential genome editing applications. Furthermore, new recombinational factors (RDFs) and their determinants are constantly being discovered, underlining the need to update progress in research involving Ints in eukaryotic cells. In this way, this review aims to provide an overview of Ints in eukaryotic cells and highlight how Ints can be used in innovative ways to advance genetic engineering applications in health, agriculture, and environmental sciences.
40066363	Metabolic pathways to sustainability: review of purple non-sulfur bacteria potential in agri-food waste valorization.	Agri-food waste (AFW) represents a significant fraction of the material generated by the agri-food industry, which itself accounts for almost one-third of the annual global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Considering the growing global population and the consequent rise in food demand, the management and valorization of this waste are essential to ensure the sustainability of the entire food chain for future generations. Recycling agri-food waste offers a promising strategy to mitigate the sector's environmental impact, particularly when the waste consists of food-grade materials that enhance its intrinsic value. Retaining such products within the agri-food chain by converting them into feed or food, a process referred to as "waste upcycling," is therefore of critical importance. Purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) are emerging as promising candidates for AFW upcycling due to their remarkable metabolic versatility, which allows them to metabolize a wide range of organic substrates, including carbohydrates, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and alcohols, into valuable microbial biomass. This biomass is notably rich in superior quality proteins, vitamins, pigments, and other high-value compounds. The phototrophic metabolism of PNSB is particularly advantageous for organic matter valorization, as the carbon conversion yield approaches unity by utilizing light as an energy source. This review explores the potential of PNSB in upcycling AFW streams derived from various sources, such as fruit and vegetable residues, as well as effluents from the dairy, brewery, and sugar industries. The pre-treatment methods required to optimize substrate availability are also discussed. Furthermore, we examine the metabolic pathways utilized by PNSB under phototrophic conditions to assimilate the most common carbon substrates found in AFW, highlighting critical gaps in our understanding of their metabolism. Additionally, challenges and opportunities in AFW valorization, with a focus on PNSB applications, are identified. This review underscores recent advancements and ongoing challenges, emphasizing the potential role of PNSB in driving sustainable circular bioeconomy applications for AFW.
40066367	Expanding the Ingredient Basket in Aquaculture: Growth Performance and Feed Utilization of Australian Hybrid Abalone (<i>Haliotis laevigata × H. rubra</i>) Fed Methanotrophic Single Cell Protein.	There is growing interest in the use of single cell proteins (SCPs) derived from methanotrophic bacteria for inclusion in aquafeed to reduce reliance on other, potentially less sustainable proteins. This two-part experiment aimed to investigate first (i) the dose effect of replacing soy protein concentrate with SCP in Australian hybrid abalone diets (<i>Haliotis laevigata Haliotis rubra</i>) and second, (ii) the potential for improved palatability of the SCP by using commercially produced liquid protein hydrolysate (PH). This was assessed in a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design. The diets were formulated to be iso-proteic (~40% crude protein as fed) and iso-energetic (~18 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup> as fed). The diets (SCP 0%, SCP 5%, SCP 10%, SCP 20%, SCP 0% + PH, and SCP 20% + PH) were fed to the abalone (~9.25 g initial weight) once daily in the evening for 94 days to apparent satiation. The growth performance and feed utilization of abalone fed with up to 10% SCP was comparable to the control; however, there was a significant reduction in most parameters at the highest inclusion of 20%. In the second experiment, there was a decline in measured protein and energy retention in the abalone fed 20% SCP, with a concomitantly lower apparent biological value. Positively, there were significant improvements in the apparent digestibility of the diet at the 20% SCP inclusion. There was no significant impact of using the PH on growth performance or feed intake. No effects were observed on the digestive enzyme activity (<i>α</i>-amylase, lipase, and trypsin) examined among the treatments. Considering these results collectively, the maximum recommended inclusion of methanotrophic SCP meal should be 10% for hybrid abalone. Reasons for the decline in performance at the highest inclusion may be related to palatability; however, this remains to be fully confirmed.
40066370	Vagal heart rate variability during rapid eye movement sleep reduces negative memory bias.	Emotional memories change over time, but the mechanisms supporting this change are not well understood. Sleep has been identified as one mechanism that supports memory consolidation, with sleep selectively benefitting negative emotional consolidation at the expense of neutral memories, with specific oscillatory events linked to this process. In contrast, the consolidation of neutral and positive memories, compared to negative memories, has been associated with increased vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) during wakefulness. However, how HRV during sleep contributes to emotional memory consolidation remains unexplored. We investigated how sleep oscillations (i.e., sleep spindles) and vagal activity during sleep contribute to the consolidation of neutral and negative memories. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject, cross-over design, we examined the impact of pharmacological vagal suppression using zolpidem on overnight emotional memory consolidation. Thirty-three participants encoded neutral and negative pictures in the morning, followed by picture recognition tests before and after a night of sleep. Zolpidem or placebo was administered in the evening before overnight sleep, and participants were monitored with electroencephalography and electrocardiography. In the placebo condition, greater overnight improvement for neutral pictures was associated with higher vagal HRV in both Non-Rapid Eye Movement Slow Wave Sleep (NREM SWS) and REM. Additionally, the emotional memory tradeoff (i.e., difference between consolidation of neutral versus negative memories) was associated with higher vagal HRV during REM, but in this case, neutral memories were remembered better than negative memories, indicating a potential role for REM vagal HRV in promoting a positive memory bias overnight. Zolpidem, on the other hand, reduced vagal HRV during SWS, increased NREM spindle activity, and eliminated the positive memory bias. Lastly, we used stepwise linear mixed effects regression to determine how NREM spindle activity and vagal HRV during REM independently explained the variance in the emotional memory tradeoff effect. We found that the addition of vagal HRV in combination with spindle activity significantly improved the model's fit. Overall, our results suggest that sleep brain oscillations and vagal signals synergistically interact in the overnight consolidation of emotional memories, with REM vagal HRV critically contributing to the positive memory bias.
40066371	Robotic animals as new tools in rodent neuroscience research: proposed applications of zooinspired robots for mouse behavioral testing.	Bioinspired robots are machines which reproduce structural or functional features of a living organism. In particular, the bioinspired robots which reproduce features of animals can be more specifically defined as zooinspired robots. Currently, the applications of animal robots are various and range across different fields, such as, for instance, nature conservation, search and rescue of humans after natural or man-made disasters, exploration of extraterrestrial environments and robotic pets for elderly people under care for dementia. Several animal species have been imitated up to now, from lizards to butterflies, and from fish to dogs. Animal robots used to investigate the social behavior of an animal species through animal-robot interactions are called ethorobots. Intriguingly, ethorobots are able to reproduce in the laboratory behaviors that are generally produced spontaneously in nature and are difficult or impossible to evoke and modulate in captive animals, which makes these animal robots particularly useful tools for experimental ethology and ethological neuroscience. Rodents, primarily mice and rats, are the most common animal model in biomedical research. Coherently with the importance of these species for scientific research, robotic mice and rats have been attracting increasing efforts in bioinspired robotics over the course of the past five decades. The technological advancement of animal robots will make their employment for scientific research increasingly useful. However, clear experimental applications of animal robots should be identified in order to challenge engineers to design robots that can serve these experimental scopes. In the present work, we will describe possible practical applications of robotic animals for mouse behavioral testing across six different behavioral domains, namely courtship, parental care, antipredatory behavior, helping behavior, predation and territory defense-related aggression. In particular, we will outline how robotic animals could be employed to interact with living mice in a series of specific tests of social behavior. Finally, in the conclusion we will consider the ethical and epistemological advantages of the use of robotic animals in behavioral neuroscience. Indeed, robotic animals can benefit scientific research on social behaviors both in terms of optimized animal welfare of the tested subjects and of extended opportunities of experimental designing due to an unprecedented control over the independent variables.
40066372	Application of Ultrasound Localization Microscopy in Evaluating the Type 2 Diabetes Progression.	Type 2 diabetes is considered as a chronic inflammatory disease in which the dense microvasculature reorganizes with disease progression and is highly correlated with β cell mass and islet function. In this study, we constructed rat models of type 2 diabetes and used ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) imaging to noninvasively map the pancreatic microvasculature at microscopy resolution in vivo to reflect β cell loss and islet function deterioration, and evaluate the efficacy after anti-cytokine immunotherapy. It was unveiled that ULM morphological and hemodynamic parameters have a strong link with β cell loss and deterioration of pancreatic islet function. This correlation aligns with the observed pathological alterations in the microvessels of islet and demonstrated that ULM can effectively mirror the functionality of β cells during rapid fluctuations in blood glucose levels by observing changes in mean velocity. Furthermore, it was revealed that treatment with anti-cytokine immunotherapy enhances the function and health of β cells by restoring the microvascular environment. Remarkable improvements in vessel morphology (measured by fractal dimension) and hemodynamics (indicated by mean velocity and vessel density) were noted following the anti-cytokine immunotherapy, signifying a significant enhancement at the treatment's conclusion (<i>P</i> < 0.05). These observations suggested that ULM technology holds promise as a visible and efficient tool for monitoring the effectiveness of anti-cytokine immunotherapy in managing type 2 diabetes. Pancreatic microvessel-based ULM may serve as a novel noninvasive method to assess β cells, providing a valuable clinical tool for tracking the progression of type 2 diabetes.
40066373	Extralobar Pulmonary Sequestration in an Adult Female Patient Mimicking Lung Abscess: A Case Report.	Congenital lung malformations (CLMs) are rare developmental anomalies of the lung, including congenital pulmonary airway malformations, bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), congenital lobar overinflation, bronchogenic cyst, and isolated congenital bronchial atresia. CLMs occur in 4 out of 10,000 live births. BPS can be intralobar or extralobar sequestration. The condition is often misdiagnosed; therefore, more research on the clinical characteristics of pulmonary sequestration should be carried out to improve the preoperative diagnosis rate. The goal of our case report is to increase awareness of this condition, to diagnose and treat it early, so that it is resected before the development of complications appear. We presented a case of a 32-year-old female patient who presented with a lung abscess and was diagnosed with pulmonary sequestration.
40066374	Bioactive and degradable collagen-based three-dimensional scaffold encapsulated with adipose mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes improved diabetic wound healing.	A diabetic wound is the most frequent form of chronic wound. Because diabetic wounds have multiple factors contributing to their development, the best treatments involve using a combination of approaches. Herein we assessed whether bioactive and degradable bioengineered micro-porous collagen-based three-dimensional scaffold (CTS) encapsulated with adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs)-derived exosomes could accelerate the wound healing process in diabetic rats. Diabetic animals were assigned to the control group, CTS group, Exo group, and CTS+Exo group. Tissue samples were collected on days 7, 14, and 21 for evaluations including stereological, molecular, and tensiometrical assessments. The findings showed that in the treatment groups, there was a notably increase in wound closure rate, total volumes of newly formed epidermis and dermis, numerical densities of fibroblasts and blood vessels, collagen density, and biomechanical parameters than the control group, with the most noticeable changes seen in the CTS+Exo group. Additionally, there was a notably increase in the transcript of miRNA-146a, TGF-β, bFGF, and VEGF genes in the treatment groups than the control group, with the highest expression observed in the CTS+Exo group. In the CTS+Exo group, there was a much greater decrease in TNF-α and IL-1β expression, as well as in the number of neutrophils, compared to the other groups. These results validated that the combination of CTS and ASCs-derived exosomes has a greater effect on improving diabetic wound healing.
40066375	Optimizing the commercial manufacturing of tisagenlecleucel for patients in Japan: A 4-year experiential journey.	Tisagenlecleucel, an autologous CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, was approved in Japan, in March 2019 for patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukamia and r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and in August 2022 for patients with r/r follicular lymphoma. Post-approval, a key goal has been to upscale and continuously improve manufacturing and shipment success rates (MSR and SSR, respectively) in the commercial setting to meet the needs of patients worldwide, including in Japan. Herein, we report accrued experience from a 4-year journey of commercial tisagenlecleucel manufacturing process optimization for patients in Japan.
40066376	Novel approaches on root canal disinfection methods against <i>E. faecalis</i>.	Enterococcus faecalis (<i>E. faecalis</i>), the main pathogenic bacterium of root canal infection, can penetrate deep into the dentin tubule, form a biofilm, and resist host defense mechanisms, thereby increasing treatment complexity. Therefore, the key to the treatment of root canal infections is to completely kill the bacteria and prevent secondary infection. This review assesses advancements in traditional and novel disinfection methods targeting <i>E. faecalis</i> biofilm.
40066379	The Diagnosis and Management of a Ewing's Sarcoma of the Pterygopalatine fossa in a 5-year-old girl.	Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is a small round cell tumor that mainly involves the skeleton, with an incidence of 2.93 per million. It is responsible for 4-10% of all bone tumors, with long bones and pelvis being the most frequently observed locations, whereas it affects the skull in only about 1-4% of cases. After osteosarcoma, ES is the most frequently observed bony primary malignant tumour in children. It more frequently regards adolescents or young adults. It is rarely diagnosed below 5 years of age or after the age of 30. ES rarely occurs in the head and neck district and, when it occurs, the jaw and skull base are the two most frequently involved locations. Clinically, head and neck ES does not show any pathognomonic finding, with the most frequent signs and symptoms usually due to the mass effect of the neoplasm. The aim of this paradigmatic case report is to present and discuss the diagnosis and management of a rare case of ES of the right pterygo-palatine region in a 5-year-old girl, that had been previously misdiagnosed and managed as a dental abscess.
40066382	To Study the Incidence of Biofilm Formation, its Microbiology and its Effect on the Development of Acute and Chronic Rhinosinusitis- A Prospective Study.	Bacterial biofilms are organised complex structures having polymicrobial nature in a single community, which provide protection to bacteria from antibiotics by various means. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of biofilm-forming bacteria in clinical isolates of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis (ARS and CRS) patients with sinonasal mucopurulence. To know the incidence of bacterial biofilms in patient with ARS and CRS, to study the microbiology of bacterial biofilms in ARS and CRS, to assess the role and effects of biofilm in ARS and CRS and to correlate the association between the formation of the biofilm and development of rhinosinusitis. This prospective study was carried out at a tertiary care centre in Eastern part of India, in which 60 patients were taken as sample size. All patients of rhinosinusitis between age-group of 10 to70 years, who came to our out-patient department, were taken for our study. Biofilm formation was observed in 50% cases and were absent in 50% cases of chronic rhinosinusitis in our study. 83.3% (50) of patients out of 60 patients got improved after treatment and recurrence was observed in only 16.6% (10) of patients. Recurrence was more at 3 months follow-up as compared to follow-up at 1 month, though it was not statistically significant. Though our study highlighted the incidence and role of biofilms in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis, but few more randomized controlled studies involving larger sample sizes should be done to exactly determine the pathophysiological role of biofilms in the development and recurrence of acute and chronic rhinosinusuitis.
40066385	Prevalence of Elevated IgG4 in Patients with Nasopharynx and Laryngopharynx Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Elevated Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels have been implicated in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including those affecting the nasopharynx and laryngopharynx. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated IgG4 and associated risk factors in patients with nasopharynx and laryngopharynx diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was performed from inception until July 2024. Keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms A random-effects model was used to pool prevalence estimates, and heterogeneity was assessed using the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test.From 922 records, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of elevated IgG4 levels was 33.9% (95% CI: 19.1%-52.6%), with significant heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 85.433%, P < 0.001). The highest frequency was reported in a Chinese study (96.9%), and the lowest in a Turkish study (0.2%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results, and no significant bias was detected. The findings illustrated a high level of elevated IgG4 levels among patients with nasopharynx and laryngopharynx diseases, with considerable variability across different populations and settings, highlighting the need for further research to understand the clinical implications and diagnostic utility of IgG4 in ENT diseases.
40066386	Allergen Immunotherapy in Autoimmune Terrain: A Case Study.	Allergen immunotherapy (AIT), or specific immunotherapy (SIT), is an effective treatment for inducing immune tolerance to specific allergens. It is widely used for allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and Hymenoptera venom allergies, with recent applications to food allergies and atopic dermatitis. Despite its benefits, the use of SIT in patients with autoimmune diseases is controversial due to concerns about its potential to induce or exacerbate autoimmune conditions. This report examines a case of autoimmune hypothyroidism developing during AIT and the management decisions involved. A 26-year-old female with a history of moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis and childhood asthma presented with severe malaise, weakness, and fatigue over the past three months. She had a family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The patient had been on AIT for six months and was using intranasal fluticasone furoate nasal spray daily. Initial laboratory investigations prior to AIT showed normal thyroid function. Three months into AIT, she developed hypothyroidism, confirmed by elevated TSH levels and positive anti-TPO antibodies. A causality assessment suggested a "possible" link between AIT and hypothyroidism. However, a risk-benefit analysis favored the continuation of AIT along with the initiation of L-thyroxine therapy. After six months of thyroid hormone replacement, her TSH levels normalized, and her allergic rhinitis symptoms significantly improved. This case underscores the complexity of managing coexisting allergic and autoimmune conditions. The decision to continue AIT, despite the onset of hypothyroidism, was based on a thorough risk-benefit analysis, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment plans. Understanding the immunological mechanisms, particularly the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, is crucial. Neutrophils play a significant role as both effectors and modulators of immune responses. The clinical pharmacologist's recommendation was informed by these factors and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy. The continuation of AIT was justified by its benefits in managing allergic rhinitis and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone therapy. This case highlights the importance of personalized medicine and continuous monitoring in treatment decisions for patients with coexisting conditions.
40066387	Clinico-Pathological Predictors Affecting Lymph Node Status in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	To analyze the correlation of age, gender, subsite, and histopathological factors such as tumour grade, depth of invasion (DOI), lymphovascular invasion(LVI), perineural invasion(PNI), bone invasion and worst pattern of invasion(WPOI) with cervical lymph node metastasis(LNM), extranodal extension(ENE), lymph node ratio(LNR), number of positive nodes(+ veN) and T stage in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We conducted a retrospective study on cases with OSCC of all stages and any designated anatomical subsite of the oral cavity, who reported to us from the year 2018-2023, and underwent curative-intent surgery with or without appropriate adjuvant treatment. Various clinic-pathological parameters were recorded and their correlation with lymph node metastasis, lymph node ratio(LNR), number of positive nodes(+ veN), extranodal extension(ENE) and T stage was analyzed. A total of 301 patients with a mean of 43.94 ± 11.23 years were enrolled in the study, out of which 86% were males and 14%were females. Tumour grade, DOI, LVI, PNI, medullary bone invasion were found to be predictors of LNM, LNR and + veN, All these histopathological parameters excluding tumor grade had a significant association with ENE as well, and excluding LVI, all of them had a significant association with T stage. Histopathological parameters have a major role to play in determining the lymph node status in OSCC patients.
40066391	A Study of Effect of Manuka Honey Healing in Post Operative Fess Surgery.	The aim of this study was to observe the effect of topical application of manuka honey in healing of nasal mucosa in Post Endoscopic Sinus Surgery. A total of 50 patients were selected and were operated for sinonasal diseases. Post operative after nasal pack removal manuka honey was applied. Post- operative healing was assessed and scoring was done. The present study was to evaluate and observe faster healing after application of Manuka honey. The median time to achieve clean cavity, mucosal transition and complete epithelialization was 14.0 (14.0-14.0) days. The present study concluded that application of manuka honey promotes faster healing of nasal cavity and lessens chances of postoperative infections.
40066395	Anatomical Variations in Nasal Cavities and Paranasal Sinuses on Computed Tomography in Chronic Rhinosinusitis: Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment.	Chronic rhinosinusitis is a prevalent condition characterized by inflammation of the nasal and paranasal sinus cavities, significantly impacting quality of life and healthcare utilization. Computed tomography imaging is vital in assessing anatomical variations that may contribute to chronic rhinosinusitis pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify anatomical variations in the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses using CT imaging and explore their relationship with sinus mucosal abnormalities. 154 chronic rhinosinusitis patients were recruited. The study revealed a high prevalence of anatomical variations, with deviated nasal septum being the most common (71.4%), followed by Agger nasi cell (66.2%), spur formation (51.3%), ICA into the sphenoid sinus (44.8%) and Concha bullosa (34.4%). Most anatomical variations are commonly found on both sides. Significant correlations were found between some variations and sinusitis involvement on the same side. However, no significant correlations were observed between angles of septal deviation and CRS incidence. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing anatomical variations in CRS management to mitigate risks and improve treatment outcomes. Further research, including a comparison group of patients without CRS, would provide a comprehensive understanding of the anatomical variations observed in the study.

40066401	Epidemiology of Iodine Deficiency Disorders in North-Eastern Part of Karnataka, India.	The north-eastern part of Karnataka lies on the Deccan Plateau of the South Indian Peninsula, characterized by black soil. This region is known for its mineral resources, including a gold ore mine in Hatti (Raichur District), an iron ore mine in Toranagallu (Bellary District), and uranium deposits in Gogi (Yadgir District). However, the soil in this area is deficient in iodine, leading to iodine deficiency disorders such as goiter and hypothyroidism. More than 80,000 cases of these disorders have been reported in the region, along with a few cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease. The younger age group is predominantly affected, with a higher prevalence in females compared to males. As a result, hypothyroidism contributes to pregnancy-related complications and obesity in women. Early detection is possible due to the visible swelling in the neck, prompting patients to seek medical attention. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment can reduce goiter size, restore the body to a euthyroid state, and alleviate symptoms.
40066404	Do The Inflammatory Cells In The Blood And Tissues Have Predictive And Prognostic Value In Benign, Premalignant And Malignant Lesions Of The Larynx?	The aim of our study is to investigate the predictive and prognostic value of inflammatory cells in blood and tissues in laryngeal lesions.
40066406	Continuous Positive and Negative Pressure Dressing - A Novel Approach in the Treatment of Auricular Seroma.	Auricular seroma is a benign ear condition characterized by the accumulation of sterile serous fluid between the perichondrium and auricular cartilage. It presents as a painless, solitary or diffuse, and fluctuant swelling, diagnosis hinges on these distinctive features. Treating this condition is challenging due to its high recurrence rate. Medical treatments have limited success rate, making surgical intervention the preferred option. However, even invasive surgical procedures such as incision and drainage or aspiration often result in a high recurrence rate.
40066409	Expression of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in Nasal Polyp: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	Nasal polyp (NP) is a pathological benign mass that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. This lesion is occasionally associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which is named chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) indicates abnormal cell proliferation which may help assess the nasopharyngeal lesions and upper airway cancers. This study aimed to examine the PCNA expression in NP tissue. This study was conducted under the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A thorough search using relevant keywords was performed on the electronic database to identify studies examining the PCNA expression in NP. Meta-analysis on pooled single group proportion and means of PCNA expression was conducted by the metamean and metaprop functions in R software (version 4.4.0). Quality assessment was done according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Ten articles were included in this study. The PCNA expression in NP was higher than in normal nasal mucosa (NNM), while its expression in NP was lower than in inverted papilloma (IP). The mean percentage of PCNA expression in NP was 15.73% (95%-CI[2.87-28.58]) with considerable heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 97%[96-98%],<i>p</i>-value < 0.01). Based on a cutoff staining (> 5%), 64% of NP samples were PCNA-positive (95%-CI[42-81%]) with high heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 76%[47-89%], <i>p</i>-value < 0.01). NP tissue has a relatively high expression of the PCNA oncoprotein based on the immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Although more than half of NP samples were positive for PCNA, still the mean expression of this marker in NP was lower than in IP tissue.
40066410	Lymphoepithelial Cyst in the Elderly Neck: A Diagnostic Conundrum.	A 50-year-old male, chronic tobacco chewer, presented with right-sided lateral neck cyst.

40066413	Papillary Carcinoma in Thyroglossal Cyst: A Case Report with Comprehensive Review of Treatment Modalities.	Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common form of congenital neck cysts. The incidence of thyroid papillary carcinoma in thyroglossal duct cyst is less than 1%. In most cases, the diagnosis is made postoperatively. We present a 52-year-old male with sonographically confirmed thyroglossal duct cyst with a large dystrophic calcification in the midline just cranial to the thyroid isthmus, which showed suspicious atypical cells in fine needle aspiration cytology. However, clinically and by contrast enhanced computed tomography neck, it was free from its adjacent tissues with no lymph node involvement. Various treatment modalities were reviewed to formulate a plan of treatment for further management of the patient. Some studies considered near total thyroidectomy as treatment of choice, whereas others categorised the patients into groups according to the risk factors involved and suggested Sistrunk's operation with follow up as the treatment modality in the low-risk group. Present case belonged to low-risk group and so underwent Sistrunk's operation. Histopathology revealed lesion to be encapsulated papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient has been on regular follow- up for the last 3 months with no radiological or clinical recurrence.
40066416	Assessment of Prevalence and Factors Affecting Trismus in Cases of Oral and Oropharyngeal Malignancies after Complete Treatment.	Trismus, or restricted mouth opening is a very common and often neglected side effect in oral and oropharyngeal malignancies owing to the disease itself as well as its treatment with surgery and/or chemoradiation. This study aims at assessing the prevalence of trismus occurring after complete treatment in diagnosed cases of oral and oropharyngeal malignancy and to assess various risk factors associated with development of trismus in these patients. A prospective, observational study conducted over a 2 years at a tertiary care hospital. All newly diagnosed cases of oral and oropharyngeal malignancy seeking treatment were included. Maximal mouth opening as the interincisoral distance measured using a Vernier Calliper was done so in each patient at presentation before initiation of treatment, before adjuvant therapy, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment and the results were analysed. The primary modality of treatment, type of surgery, reconstruction performed and patient's recovery were monitored. Out of 72 patients included, 60 had oral cancers and the remaining oropharyngeal. The overall prevalence was 61.1%. The following variables were found to be associated with higher prevalence of trismus- Tumour size, advanced primary disease (T3, T4 disease), oral submucous fibrosis and radiation. There is a high prevalence of trismus in treated patients of oral and oropharyngeal malignancies more so in cases of oral cancer undergoing surgery with adjuvant therapy. There is a need to find treatment modalities with better functional outcomes and direct oral rehabilitation strategies towards alleviation of trismus.
40066417	Brain Metastasis from Oral Cancer Presenting with Seizures and Cranial Nerve Palsy in Immediate Post Operative Period- A Rare Occurrence.	Metastasis is the hallmark of malignancy but the spread to brain is an exceedingly rare occurrence for oral cancer. Two of our patients who underwent definitive surgery for oral cancer developed manifestations of Central nervous system (CNS) involvement within 7 days of surgery, one with seizures and other with cranial nerve palsies (3rd and 7th ), who were otherwise symptom free for CNS involvement preoperatively. These cases highlight the need for thorough metastasis workup including CNS.
40066422	The Impact of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Treatment Planning of Attico Antral Disease.	Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a useful method for investigating cholesteatomas since it may be performed without the need for a contrast agent and can prevent unnecessary "second look" operations. This study aims to evaluate the role of DWI-MRI in monitoring residual or recurrent disease and preventing second look procedures when physical examination is difficult or CT is ambiguous. This single centric, cross-sectional study was conducted on 33 patients with suspected cases of attico-antral disease at a tertiary sector, subjected to DWI sequence of MRI for a study period of 1.6 years. The average age of patients was 36 ± 14.40 years with male predominance (66.66%). A right-sided laterality with hearing loss and ear discharge was commonest symptom. MRI findings and surgical presence of cholesteatoma was present in 81.81% cases. Sensitivity, Specificity of MRI in the diagnosis of AAD was 100%. The study concluded that DWI-MRI is an important tool in the diagnosis of suspected cases of AAD with 100% diagnostic test characteristics.
40066425	Global Prevalence of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has increased worldwide in recent years, becoming a significant public health concern. One of the most important complications experienced by individuals with OSA is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). This study aims to investigate the prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, and the Google Scholar search engine were systematically searched for studies investigating the prevalence of EDS in people with OSA up to December 2023. Data analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 2), employing a random effects model. The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I² index. In review of 15 studies with a combined sample size of 42,924 individuals found that the global prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA was 39.9% (95% CI: 34.4-45.7). The regression results indicated that as the sample size increased, the prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, an increase in the years of the studies conducted was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA, although this trend was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.856). Based on the results of this study, the global prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA is significant. Given the increasing prevalence of OSA, it is crucial for health decisionmakers to recognize the importance of this issue, raise public awareness, and address the dangerous effects of EDS on the population.
40066427	Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte Ratio: A Shunned Entity as a Novelty in Diagnosing Peripheral Vestibular Disorders.	Vestibular vertigo is a condition characterized by dizziness or imbalance, often resulting from changes in head position. With an incidence of 1.4% in adults, vertigo is a common symptom in the general population (Oxford Textbook of Vertigo and Imbalance, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2013). To study the potential association of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in patients with peripheral vestibular disorders. A one year cross-sectional observational study with a total of 51 confirmed cases of peripheral vestibular disorders was conducted in the department ENT and HNS. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio(NLR) and DHI scoring was analysed. Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis. 41.18% of patients in the study were male, while 58.82% of the patients were female. In terms of numbers, it was discovered that the mean age of females (50.97) exceeded the mean age of males (48.43). The DHI score indicated a severe handicap in 58.82% of the study subjects with a mean NLR 6.93, while 39.22% participants showed moderate handicap with a mean NLR 7.20. Majority of the study subjects ellicited mild to moderate stress levels with respect to their NLR. Based on our results, we have concluded that neutrophil to lymphocyte plays a major role as a marker of peripheral vestibular diseases. With the majority of patients exhibiting moderate to severe handicap on dizziness handicap inventory scoring and mild to moderate stress levels; neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio should be touted as a marker for peripheral vertigo.
40066428	Applicability of Paediatric Kerrison's Punch in Endoscopic Transcanal Mastoidectomy-Harnessing a Fresh Perspective.	The science of endoscopic ear surgery is gaining popularity and increasing momentum with reported outcomes comparable to conventional microscopic ear surgery. Endoscopic ear surgery has numerous advantages including access to visualization of occult areas of middle ear like sinus tympani. The endoscopic transcanal mastoidectomy via conventional drilling technique(Inside-out) has also established itself as a successful procedure with excellent post-operative outcomes. However, transcanal drilling is a challenging procedure as it requires extreme coordination, repeated irrigation and suction, injury to vital structures, tympanomeatal flap tear. We here propose a novel technique of doing Endoscopic transcanal mastoidectomy using upcutting and downcutting, straight and angled Paediatric Kerrison's punch to remove the attic and posterosuperior bony canal wall with substantial benefits of significant reduction in chances of injury to vital structures, no repeated suction-irrigation required, less operative time and good visualization. Paediatric Kerrison's punch is an instrument which is essentially available in the armamentarium of all ENT surgeons as it has been used since a long time in dacryocystorhinostomy surgery. In our quest for simplifying transcanal mastoidectomy, we have devised a novel utility of this same punch in the otology surgery. And in our experience, it has proven a pragmatic instrument in the otology surgeries as much as it is in the nasal surgeries.
40066429	Pterygopalatine Fossa- A Keystone Area in Disease Progression and Management in Rhino-Oculo-Cerebral Mucormycosis.	To analyze the involvement of disease in pterygopalatine fossa (PPF), its relation to regional extension of disease and the treatment outcome in rhino-oculo-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM). A prospective study was done including 50 patients diagnosed with ROCM. All patients were examined and evaluated with high resolution CT and MRI imaging. Intravenous liposomal Amphotericin B was started, and endoscopic debridement was done based on the disease extension. Liposomal Amphotericin B is given until complete response for atleast a total dose of 3-4 g. T. Posaconasole 300 mg is given for 3-4 months in case of orbital or intracranial disease. 58% (29) patients showed involvement of disease in PPF. In MRI T1 contrast images, 21 of these patients showed hypo-intense lesion in the PPF and had necrotic tissue in PPF during surgery. Whereas, hyper-intense lesion that depicts inflammatory tissue was seen in the 8 patients. The tissue from these lesions showed aseptate fungal hyphae elements in histopathology in all these patients. 96% of patients with orbital mucormycosis (25 patients), 92% of patients with palatal mucormycosis (24 patients) and all patients with intracranial (15 patients) involvement had correlating PPF involvement in the disease process. The pterygopalatine fossa is the nidus for spread of disease and an important prognostic factor for extent of spread. Radiological imaging with CT and MRI are useful to assess the involvement of disease in PPF, and it is important to remove this disease during endoscopic debridement.
40066431	The Impact of Primary Tumor Volume on Survival of Patients with Non-Surgically Treated Advanced-Stage Hypopharyngeal Cancer- Retrospective Study and Literature Overview.	To determine the prognostic value of tumor volume in predicting the survival in patients with stage III-IV of hypopharyngeal carcinoma. We studied 71 patients with advanced stage of hypopharyngeal carcinoma. The volume of primary tumor was calculated by approximation of the ellipsoid volume. Correlation between carcinoma volume and demographic, clinical and carcinoma characteristics has shown that male patients and patients consuming alcohol had greater tumor volumes. The median of overall survival was at 12 months (95% CI: 9.25-14.75); the median of progression-free survival was at 9 months (95% CI: 6.6-11.3). ROC Curve Analysis of carcinoma volumes in outcome prediction shows that the cutoff of 14.69 had the sensitivity of 61% and specifics of 89%. Based on significant independent impact of tumor volume on survival, it is important to include this parameter among possible new treatment protocols.

Although systemic therapies have improved considerably over the last decade, up to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma still die due to disease progression. Oncological treatment at the end-of-life phase is challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and type of systemic therapy received by melanoma patients in their end-of-life phase.
40066438	Update on tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative review.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, affecting approximately 1% of the adult population. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor, has emerged as an effective treatment for RA. This narrative review provides an update on TCZ's efficacy and safety based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world evidence (RWE). TCZ, available in subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) formulations, has shown significant benefits in RA management. Key clinical trials, including SAMURAI, OPTION, RADIATE, and TOWARD, have demonstrated TCZ's efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), particularly in patients with inadequate responses to methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. Long-term studies, such as STREAM, have highlighted TCZ's sustained efficacy and favorable safety profile over 5 years. The impact of TCZ on cardiovascular health, lipid profiles, and the risk of infections has been a focal point, with findings suggesting no significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk compared to other RA therapies. RWE further highlights the effectiveness of TCZ, identifying predictors of response, such as age, and emphasizes its suitability for biologic-naïve and overweight patients. Special considerations include TCZ use in RA-associated interstitial lung disease and amyloidosis. Overall, TCZ remains a pivotal option in RA treatment, with a well-established safety and efficacy profile supported by extensive clinical and real-world data.
40066439	Tissue-resident memory T cells in urinary tract diseases.	Tissue-resident memory T (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells are a specialized subset of memory T cells that permanently reside in non-lymphoid tissues, providing localized and long-lasting immune protection. In the urinary tract, T<sub>RM</sub> cells play critical roles in defending against infections, mediating tumor immunity, and influencing the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic potential is immense, with promising avenues for vaccine development, enhanced cancer immunotherapy, and targeted treatments for chronic inflammation. However, challenges remain in harnessing their protective roles while minimizing their pathological effects, particularly in immunosuppressive or inflammatory microenvironments. This review explores the diverse roles of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in urinary tract diseases, including infections, cancer, and chronic inflammation, and discusses therapeutic strategies and future directions for leveraging T<sub>RM</sub> cells to improve clinical outcomes. By advancing our understanding of T<sub>RM</sub> cell biology, we can develop innovative interventions that balance their immune-protective and regulatory functions.
40066440	In-depth analysis of the safety of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors.	In recent years, the rapid progress in oncology, immunology, and molecular biology has dramatically advanced cancer immunotherapy, particularly CAR-T cell therapy. This innovative approach involves engineering a patient's T cells to express receptors that specifically target tumor antigens, enhancing their ability to identify and eliminate cancer cells. However, the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors is often hampered by the challenging tumor microenvironment (TME). The complex TME includes dense stroma that obstructs T cell infiltration, abnormal blood vessel structures leading to hypoxia, and an acidic pH, all of which hinder CAR-T cell function. Additionally, the presence of immunosuppressive factors in the TME reduces the efficacy of CAR-T cells, making successful targeting of tumors more difficult. The safety of CAR-T therapy has gained interest, especially CAR-T therapy has shown considerable effectiveness in various cancers, with notable results in multiple myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, among others. Nonetheless, CAR-T cell therapy is associated with several adverse reactions primarily driven by heightened levels of proinflammatory cytokines. These reactions include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (CANS), and organ toxicity, often leading to serious complications. CRS, characterized by systemic inflammation due to cytokine release, can escalate to severe organ dysfunction. It typically occurs within the first week post-infusion, correlating with CAR-T cell expansion and often presents with fever and hypotension. Meanwhile, CANS encompasses neurological issues ranging from mild symptoms to severe seizures, possibly exacerbated by CRS. Organ toxicity can also arise from CAR-T therapy, with potential damage affecting the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, and lungs, often tied to shared antigens found in both tumor and healthy tissues. Moreover, long-term effects like cytokine-associated hematotoxicity (CAHT) and secondary malignancies represent significant concerns that could affect the patient's quality of life post-treatment. The long-term adverse effects and challenges in treating solid tumors underscore the need for ongoing research. Strategies to improve CAR-T cell efficacy, minimize adverse reactions, and enhance patient safety are critical. Future explorations could include designing CAR-T cells to better navigate the TME, identifying specific target antigen profiles to minimize off-target damage, and developing adjunct therapies to mitigate cytokine-related toxicity. Continued monitoring for long-term effects will also be paramount in improving patient outcomes and maintaining their quality of life. Overall, while CAR-T therapy holds great promise, it must be administered with careful consideration of potential side effects and rigorous management strategies to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy.

40066442	A comprehensive prognostic and immunological implications of Gremlin 1 in lung adenocarcinoma.	Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a prevalent form of lung cancer globally, known for its high invasiveness, metastatic potential, and notable heterogeneity, particularly in its response to immunotherapy. Gremlin 1 (GREM1) is implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis in multiple cancers. However, GREM1's specific role in LUAD remains unclear. This study systematically examines GREM1 expression in LUAD and its association with tumor progression, immune microenvironment, and prognosis.
40066443	Unveiling SSR4: a promising biomarker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) represents a frequent cancer with a poor prognosis. Altered glucose metabolism contributes factor to ESCC progression. In our previous study, signal sequence receptor subunit delta (SSR4) was included in an ESCC prognostic model; however, the mechanisms underlying SSR4 implication in ESCC remain ambiguous. Accordingly, we aim to determine the interconnection between SSR4 expression and clinical characteristics of ESCC.
40066444	The changes of NLRs family members in the brain of AD mouse model and AD patients.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is primarily characterized by progressive neuron loss and memory impairment. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are crucial for immune regulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recently, NLRs have been identified as important contributors to neuroinflammation, thus presenting a potential approach for reducing inflammation and slowing AD progression.
40066445	<i>Ex vivo</i> lung perfusion: recent advancements and future directions.	Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) has emerged as a transformative technique in lung transplantation, offering a solution for evaluating and rehabilitating donor lungs that would otherwise be deemed unsuitable. This review article examines the significant advancements in EVLP technology and its application in clinical practice. We discuss the criteria for selection and rehabilitation of donor lungs, emphasizing the use of EVLP for lungs with compromised function due to factors like prolonged ischemic time and donor smoking history. Further, we elaborate on the technological advancements that have improved the functional assessment of lungs, including the development of more sophisticated perfusion solutions and the integration of artificial intelligence for real-time assessment. Additionally, we discuss the future prospects of EVLP, focusing on potential innovations in perfusion solutions, the integration of regenerative medicine and gene therapy to improve allograft quality. Through this comprehensive review, we aim to provide a clear understanding of the current status of EVLP and its promising future directions, ultimately contributing to improved outcomes in lung transplantation.
40066446	Exercise boost after surgery improves survival in model of metastatic breast cancer.	Despite advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment of the primary tumor, metastatic breast cancer tumors remain largely incurable, and their growth is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. There is therefore a critical need to identify ways to reduce metastatic tumor burden and increase breast cancer patient survival. While surgery and pharmacological treatments are the cornerstones of breast cancer intervention, epidemiological data suggests that physical activity can lower the risk of breast cancer development, improve adjuvant treatment tolerance, reduce the risk of disease recurrence and lower breast cancer-related death.
40066447	Case Report: Complete response to four cycles of camrelizumab in a PD-L1 negative patient with advanced oral squamous cancer.	Immunotherapy has brought better survival benefits in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). However, owing to the lack of relevant biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of this treatment, it often has to be maintained. Here we report on a patient with stage IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue who developed an unresectable lesion in the neck after surgery and radical chemoradiotherapy. After four cycles of intermittent immunotherapy with camrelizumab, complete response (CR) was achieved. Next-generation sequencing showed that the TP53/FANCA/FAT1 gene mutations and negative PD-L1 expression were involved. The patient has been followed up for 4 years without R/M. This situation has not been reported previously, suggesting that some patients can benefit from short-term immunotherapy and even achieve CR; moreover, there may be more molecular markers to be discovered that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy. We can conduct in-depth research on relevant molecular markers, formulate personalized immunotherapy strategies and plans, and facilitate the development of new precision treatment strategies for HNSCC.
40066448	BLIMP-1-dependent differentiation of T follicular helper cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory type 1 cells.	T-regulatory-type-1 (TR1) cells are a subset of interleukin-10-producing but Foxp3<sup>-</sup> Treg cells that arise in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. We have shown that systemic delivery of autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NP) triggers the formation of large pools of disease-suppressing Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells from cognate T-follicular helper (TFH) cell precursors. Here we show that, upon treatment withdrawal, these Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells spontaneously differentiate into a novel immunoregulatory Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subset that inherits epigenetic and transcriptional hallmarks of their precursors, including clonotypic T-cell receptors, and is distinct from other Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg subsets. Whereas the transcription factor BLIMP-1 is dispensable for development of conventional Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, it is necessary for development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 cells. In a model of central nervous system autoimmunity, abrogation of BLIMP-1 or IL-10 expression in the Foxp3<sup>-</sup> and/or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subsets inhibits their development or anti-encephalitogenic activity. Thus, the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway results in the generation of two distinct autoimmune disease-suppressing, IL-10-producing TR1 subsets that are distinguished by the expression of Foxp3 and Foxp3 target genes.
40066449	Case report: Efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for high tumour mutational burden malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast as revealed by comprehensive genomic profiling.	High tumour mutational burden (TMB-high), identified through comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP), is a biomarker that predicts the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. CGP testing is recommended for rare cancers with limited effective treatment options. Here, we provide the first report of a malignant phyllodes tumour of the breast demonstrating TMB-high status and effective treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient initially underwent right breast tumour resection and was diagnosed with a malignant phyllodes tumour. Recurrence was observed at the same site with metastases to the pulmonary hilar and right axillary lymph nodes. CGP testing revealed TMB-high status and microsatellite stable. Pembrolizumab was initiated after chemotherapy for the soft tissue sarcoma. After two treatment cycles, imaging revealed a partial response of the pulmonary hilar lymph nodes and necrotic enlargement of the right axillary lymph node. After four cycles, all lymph nodes had reduced in size. Eight months after ten cycles of pembrolizumab treatment, multiple new nodules were observed in both lungs, indicating disease progression. This case highlights the utility of CGP testing in rare cancers, demonstrating the first evidence of TMB-high malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast responding to pembrolizumab and underscoring the value of expanding CGP testing to improve therapeutic strategies for rare cancers.
40066450	Case Report: MOGAD - a steroid-responsive autoimmune meningoencephalitis mimicking infection.	This case series reports three patients initially managed for presumed infectious meningoencephalitis, who were ultimately diagnosed with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated disease (MOGAD). Their clinical presentations were strikingly similar to those of acute infectious meningoencephalitis, which posed a challenge to the initial diagnostic process. Notably, despite the absence of typical radiological changes associated with MOGAD, such as cerebral cortical encephalitis, these patients exhibited focal neurological and electroencephalographic changes. This series highlights the importance of considering MOG antibody testing in cases of aseptic meningoencephalitis, where early and accurate diagnosis can influence treatment decisions and patient outcomes in this steroid-responsive condition.
40066451	The role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification during macrophage metabolic reprogramming in human diseases and animal models.	Macrophage metabolic reprogramming refers to the process by which macrophages adjust their physiological pathways to meet survival and functional demands in different immune microenvironments. This involves a range of metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and cholesterol transport. By modulating the expression and activity of key enzymes and molecules within these pathways, macrophages can make the transition between pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes, thereby linking metabolic reprogramming to inflammatory responses and the progression of several diseases, such as atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and acute lung injury (ALI). N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification has emerged as a critical regulatory mechanism during macrophage metabolic reprogramming, broadly affecting RNA stability, translation, and degradation. Therapeutic strategies targeting m<sup>6</sup>A modification can regulate the onset of metabolic diseases by influencing macrophage metabolic changes, for instance, small molecule inhibitors of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) can affect glucose metabolism and inhibit IBD. This review systematically explores recent findings on the role and molecular mechanisms of m<sup>6</sup>A modification during macrophage metabolic reprogramming in human diseases and animal models, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.

40066455	Identification and functional characterization of T-cell exhaustion-associated lncRNA AL031775.1 in osteosarcoma: a novel therapeutic target.	Osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone malignancy predominantly affecting children and adolescents, presents significant therapeutic challenges with a 5-year survival rate below 30% in metastatic cases. T-cell exhaustion, characterized by the overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules, contributes to osteosarcoma progression and immune evasion. Although targeting these inhibitory pathways has shown potential in restoring T-cell activity, the molecular regulators of T-cell depletion in osteosarcoma are poorly understood.
40066456	Influence of gut microbial metabolites on tumor immunotherapy: mechanisms and potential natural products.	In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, individual differences in efficacy have been observed in clinical practice. There is increasing evidence that gut microbial metabolites influence the efficacy of distal tumor immunotherapy via the gut-liver axis, the gut-brain axis and the gut-breast axis, a process that may involve modulating the expression of immune cells and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we systematically explore the relationship between gut microbial metabolites and tumor immunotherapy, and examine the corresponding natural products and their mechanisms of action. The in-depth exploration of this research area will provide new ideas and strategies to enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy and mitigate adverse effects.
40066457	Ferroptosis and cuproptosis in periodontitis: recent biological insights and therapeutic advances.	Periodontitis is a significant global public health issue associated with the onset and progression of various systemic diseases, thereby requiring additional research and clinical attention. Although ferroptosis and cuproptosis have emerged as significant areas of research in the medical field, their precise roles in the pathogenesis of periodontitis remain unclear. We aim to systematically summarize the current research on ferroptosis and cuproptosis in periodontal disease and investigate the roles of glutathione pathway and autophagy pathway in connecting ferroptosis and cuproptosis during periodontitis. Further, we propose that a homeostatic imbalance of copper and iron, driven by periodontal pathogens, may contribute to elevated periodontal oxidative stress, representing a potential unifying link between ferroptosis and cuproptosis involved in periodontitis. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying ferroptosis and cuproptosis in periodontitis, offering novel theoretical insights into its pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.

40066459	Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of <i>CYP450</i>s under various stress treatment in <i>Dendrobium huoshanense</i>.	The cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP450) are the largest enzyme family in plant metabolism, playing a key role in the biosynthesis of both primary and secondary metabolites. However, the CYP450 has not yet been systematically characterized in Dendrobium species. In this study, 193 <i>DhCYP450</i> genes were identified in the genome of <i>Dendrobium huoshanense</i> through bioinformatics, and divided into 2 groups and 10 clans. Chromosome localization results revealed that <i>DhCYP450</i> genes are distributed across 19 chromosomes. We identified eight common conserved motifs within the <i>DhCYP450</i> family of <i>D. huoshanense</i>. Furthermore, prediction analysis of <i>cis</i>-acting elements in the promoter region indicated the presence of elements responsive to low temperature, drought, and hormones responsive elements in most <i>DhCYP450</i> genomes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated the experiments expression patterns of <i>DhCYP450</i> genes in response to cold, drought treatment, and hormones, suggesting their involvement in abiotic stress responses and their role in Dendrobium growth. Overall, these results provide valuable insights into the functional dynamics of the <i>DhCYP450</i> genes and highlight potential candidates for further study of their biological roles.
40066460	Unraveling the effect of spermidine on biochemical, anatomical and yield attributes in chickpea under chloride dominated salinity.	This study investigates the effect of foliar application of spermidine (Spd) on salt-stressed chickpea genotypes under natural environmental conditions. Four chickpea genotypes were treated with chloride-dominated salinity levels of 4.0 and 8.0 dSm<sup>-1</sup>, followed by foliar application with 0.5 and 1.0 mM Spd during the reproductive stage. The findings reveal that Spermidine application markedly enhances the total chlorophyll upto 21.27%. It also enhanced the total soluble carbohydrate about 46.68% and protein content upto 40% in all chickpea genotypes but HC 3 shows maximum increase, thereby augmenting yield about 36% in HC 5 genotypes under salt stress. Additionally, Spermidine application facilitates the enlargement of xylem vessels diameter upto 34.53% in pedicel and reduction in epidermal wall thickening about 29.33% of filament under salt stress. Importantly, the efficacy of Spermidine application is particularly pronounced in salt-affected chickpea genotypes, especially the 0.5 mM concentration. The insights gained offer a potential solution to enhance plant tolerance and productivity under adverse conditions.
40066461	Roles of methyl-CpG-binding-domain (MBD) protiens in regulation of biological processes in plants.	DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mark found in both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic genomes. It is essential for regulating expression of genes and preservation of genomic integrity. Both plants and animals possess specific proteins that mediate biological effects of DNA methylation. Many families of such methylated DNA binding proteins have been discovered in plants; the most prominent of them being the methyl-CpG- binding domain (MBD) proteins. Some of the MBD proteins have the ability to recognize methylated CpGs in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we have described MBD proteins and their functions in a wide range of cellular processes in various plant species. We have also outlined their mechanism of action and interacting protein partners.
40066462	Exploring the plant growth promoting attributes of pteridophyte-associated microbiome for agricultural sustainability.	Pteridophytes, encompassing ferns and fern allies, are integral components of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. These vascular plants characterized by their spore-based reproduction, fulfil various ecological roles such as influencing biodiversity, soil stability, nutrient dynamics, and ecological succession. Similar to higher plants, pteridophytes too are known to have close symbiotic associations with a diverse array of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. Exploring the microbial diversity in pteridophytes has prospects both in pure and applied research. Research on pteridophyte microbial communities have revealed their role in plant growth promotion, nutrient acquisition and tolerance against stresses. Besides, it would be interesting to unravel the microbial diversity associated with pteridophytes, which are the first vascular plants. Further, study of pteridophytes-associated microbes would also help in conservation programmes of these rare and endangered group of plants. In spite of the immense potential of pteridophyte microbiome, only few studies have been undertaken in this area, thereby creating a huge research gap. Hence, this review compiles pteridophyte microbiome research, and explores its prospects in agricultural sustainability. Our literature survey sheds light on the tremendous potential of pteridophyte-associated microbes as plant growth promoters and biocontrol agents for sustainable agriculture, which is highly relevant in the era of climate change.
40066463	The influence of genetic polymorphisms on cytokine profiles in pediatric COVID-19: a pilot study.	Recent studies have underscored the importance of genetic factors in predicting COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. While cytokine storms are crucial in disease severity, genetic predisposition significantly influences immune responses. Our study examined genes related to SARS-CoV-2 invasion <i>(ACE2 rs2074192</i>) and interferon-induced immunity (<i>IFNAR2 rs2236757, TYK2 rs2304256, OAS1 rs10774671, OAS3 rs10735079</i>). Additionally, we investigated genes linked to Kawasaki disease (<i>CD40 rs4813003, FCGR2A rs1801274, CASP3 rs113420705</i>) that play roles in immunogenesis.

40066468	Impact of prostate cancer screening in European ancestry un-affected men with germline DNA repair pathogenic variants.	Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant global health concern, ranking as the second most prevalent cancer among men worldwide. Genetic factors, particularly germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in DNA repair genes (DRGs), play a crucial role in PCa predisposition. Our study aimed to assess patients' adherence to a targeted PCa screening program targeting high-risk individuals with DRG PVs and evaluate the potential reduction in biopsy and MRI rates by employing our screening protocol.
40066469	3D anatomical digital twins: New generation virtual models to navigate robotic partial nephrectomy.	Objective 3D virtual models have gained interest in urology, particularly in the context of robotic partial nephrectomy. From these, newly developed "anatomical digital twin models" reproduce both the morphological and anatomical characteristics of the organs, including the texture of the tissues they comprise. The aim of the study was to develop and test the new digital twins in the setting of intraoperative guidance during robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). Patient and Methods The production path of the 3D model-digital twin of an organ begins with a phantom of virtual elements, including the kidney's parenchyma, vessels, tumour and collecting system. Textures are created from intraoperative robotic surgery images using machine learning algorithms. The result is a 3D model - digital twin that replicates the organ's shape and appearance. Two surgeons, one experienced and one young, used both the standard 3D model and the digital twin in four surgical phases: identifying the organ and its boundaries, dissecting the vascular pedicle, isolating the neoplastic lesion and identifying the renal pelvis and ureter. Results 4 patients, 2 per each surgeon harbouring a low and intermediate complexity (PADUA 6 and 8) renal masses respectively, underwent RAPN. From the assessment made by the surgeons at the end of each procedure, the 3D digital twin models were found to be superior to their standard counterparts both in terms of concordance with real anatomy and in usefulness to guide the identification of the tumour, vascular pedicle and ureter, while they did not demonstrate significant advantages in identifying the kidney and its margins. Conclusions The new 3D digital twin models represent a step forward towards the personalization of virtual reconstructions. Approaching real anatomy more closely, they offer the surgeons a perceived higher degree of concordance with the intraoperative environment, making it easier to identify the structures of interest during the surgical procedure.
40066471	Tracking In Vivo Lipolysis of Lipid Nanocarriers Using NIR-II Polarity-Sensitive Fluorescent Probes.	Elucidating in vivo lipolysis is crucial for clarifying the underlying mechanisms and in vivo fates of lipid-based nanocarriers, which are essential oral drug delivery carriers. Current mainstream methodologies use various in vitro digestion models to predict the in vivo performance of lipid formulations; however, their accuracy is often impeded by the complicated environment of the gastrointestinal tract. Although fluorescence labeling with conventional probes partly reveals the in vivo translocation of lipid nanocarriers, it fails to elucidate the lipolysis process because of poor signal discrimination among nanocarriers, free probes, and mixed micelles (lipolysis end-products). Here, a polarity-sensitive probe (PN-C18) with aggregation-caused quenching properties for labeling lipid nanocarriers is developed and optimized. PN-C18 successfully eliminates interference from both free probes and mixed micelles during lipolysis. In a representative in vitro lipolysis model, PN-C18 labeling shows stronger correlation between fluorescence intensity and lipolysis progression than those of previous methods. In vivo, the translocation and lipolysis of lipid nanoparticles are clearly visualized and effectively monitored, owing to the high tissue-penetrating capability of PN-C18 NIR-II photons. This study provides practical means for elucidating the in vivo fate of lipid-based drug delivery systems and offers valuable insights and reference for further studies in this domain.
40066473	Galvanic Cell Bipolar Microneedle Patches for Reversing Photoaging Wrinkles.	Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major factor in the development of skin photoaging wrinkles. While current treatments can slow the progression of photoaging, it is very difficult to achieve complete reversal. This study introduces galvanic cell microneedle (GCMN) patches with magnesium-containing bipolar electrodes. These patches operate through a galvanic cell mechanism, generating microcurrents and releasing hydrogen gas and magnesium ions via a redox reaction. The combination of hydrogen's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, microcurrent-induced stimulation of cell migration, and magnesium's promotion of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 anti-inflammatory polarization synergistically works to reverse photoaging wrinkles and rejuvenate the skin. Furthermore, this work examines how GCMNs may influence the transforming growth factor-β/Smad (TGF-β/Smad) pathway. This approach shows promise for advancing research and development in the field of medical cosmetology.
40066478	Metaproteomic Profiling of the Secretome of a Granule-forming Ca. Accumulibacter Enrichment.	Extracellular proteins are supposed to play crucial roles in the formation and structure of biofilms and aggregates. However, often little is known about these proteins, in particular for microbial communities. Here, we use two advanced metaproteomic approaches to study the extracellular proteome in a granular Candidatus Accumulibacter enrichment as a proxy for microbial communities that form solid microbial granules, such as those used in biological wastewater treatment. Limited proteolysis of whole granules and metaproteome isolation from the culture's supernatant successfully classified over 50% of the identified protein biomass to be secreted. Moreover, structural and sequence-based classification identified 387 proteins, corresponding to over 50% of the secreted protein biomass, with characteristics that could aid the formation of aggregates, including filamentous, beta-barrel containing, and cell surface proteins. While various of these aggregate-forming proteins originated from Ca. Accumulibacter, some proteins associated with other taxa. This suggests that not only a range of different proteins but also multiple organisms contribute to granular biofilm formation. Therefore, the obtained extracellular metaproteome data from the granular Ca. Accumulibacter enrichment provides a resource for exploring proteins that potentially support the formation and stability of granular biofilms, whereas the demonstrated approaches can be applied to explore biofilms of microbial communities in general.
40066481	3D Soft Liquid Metal Electrodes for High-Resolution and Long-Term Electromyography in Muscle Trauma Assessment.	Electromyography (EMG) is a widely used diagnostic technique for evaluating the electrical activity of muscles and their controlling nerves. However, conventional surface electrodes with planar structures often suffer from low spatial resolution and suboptimal signal quality. Here, 3D-shaped, substrate-free, soft, and biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) are presented as a wearable interface for neuromuscular signal recording. These electrodes enable the acquisition of high-quality EMG signals while their intrinsic mechanical softness supports long-term use in clinical settings. In a human pilot study, continuous, high-spatial-resolution EMG monitoring of musculoskeletal activity over 25 days is achieved. Furthermore, in vivo EMG monitoring in mouse models of ischemia and volumetric muscle loss demonstrated the therapeutic effects of extracellular muscle-rehabilitative drugs. This work highlights the potential of LMe for advanced drug screening and long-term clinical diagnostics.

40066484	Co-Delivery of Morphologically Switchable Au Nanowire and Hemoglobin-Resveratrol Nanoparticles in the Microneedle for Diabetic Wound Healing Therapy.	Diabetic wounds are a common complication of diabetes and pose a significant threat to human health. High glucose concentration in the wound remains a major obstacle, necessitating effective strategies to achieve sustained glucose consumption for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In this study, an Au-based nanomaterial is developed that can adjust its morphology in different therapeutic processes. The prepared Au nanowire (ANW) can be converted into Au nanospheres (AS) under ultrasonic conditions by adjusting the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on its surface for convenient delivery. Intriguingly, AS is depolymerized into ANW again in the wound area, prolonging the retention time, and ensuring continuous consumption of glucose. After constructing the morphologically switchable Au nanowire, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is applied it to microneedle and co-delivered it with hemoglobin (Hb)-resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model, the microneedle degraded gradually, and the Hb-RES nanoparticles synergistically ameliorated hypoxia, scavenged ROS, and inhibited macrophage differentiation into pro-inflammatory M1 phenotypes. During this process, ANW continuously catalyzed glucose through its inherent glucose oxidase activity. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the long-term management of glucose concentration during synergistic diabetic wound healing.
40066485	Highly Stable, Excellent Foliar Adhesion and Anti-Photodegradation Nucleic Acid-Peptide Coacervates for Broad Agrochemicals Delivery.	Agrochemicals play a pivotal role in the management of pests and diseases and the way agrochemicals are utilized exerts significant impacts on the environment. Ensuring rational application and improving utilization rates of agrochemicals are major demands in developing green delivery systems. Herein, a model of nucleic acid-peptide coacervate (NPC) for agrochemical delivery is presented, which is formed by mixing negatively charged single-stranded DNAs with positively charged poly-L-lysine. The NPC microsystem exhibits broad loading capacities for various types of agrochemicals. Furthermore, the NPCs demonstrate remarkable protection against photodegradation for photosensitive agrochemicals. In the foliar interactions, the NPCs exhibit excellent wetting performances and foliar adhesion on hydrophobic cabbage leaves and wheat leaves infected with powdery mildew to facilitate direct spaying in practical applications. Subsequently, the NPC microsystem is stabilized against coalescence by a charged comb polymer. Then, the NPC loaded with emamectin benzoates (EBs) exhibited significantly higher insecticidal activity compared to free EBs. This enhanced efficacy can be attributed to the higher insect uptake efficiency of the NPC formulation, as evidenced by fluorescent imaging of mosquito larvae. This coacervate model provides a new biocompatible and highly efficient system for future agrochemical delivery that actively contributes to eco-friendly and sustainable agriculture.
40066486	A Comprehensive Review of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Management of Ulcerative Colitis.	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, and urgency during defecation. While the primary site of involvement is the colon, UC can extend to encompass the entire rectum and colon. The causes and development mechanisms of UC are still not well understood; nonetheless, it is currently held that factors including environmental influences, genetic predispositions, intestinal mucosal integrity, gut microbiota composition, and immune dysregulation contribute to its development. Dysregulated immune responses are pivotal in the pathophysiology of UC, and these aberrant responses are considered key contributors to the disease onset. In patients with UC, immune cells become hyperactive and erroneously target normal intestinal tissue, resulting in inflammatory cascades and damage to the intestinal mucosa. The therapeutic strategies currently employed for UC include immunosuppressive agents such as aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. However, these treatments often prove costly and carry significant adverse effects - imposing a considerable burden on patients. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has attracted worldwide attention because of its multi-target approach, minimal side effects, cost-effectiveness, and favorable efficacy profiles. In this review, the ways in which TCM modulates inflammatory responses in the treatment of ulcerative colitis have been outlined. Research into TCM modalities for modulating inflammatory pathways in the treatment of UC, which has yielded promising advancements, including individual herbs, herbal formulations, and their derivatives, has been summarized. TCM has been utilized to treat UC and the immune system plays a key role in regulating intestinal homeostasis. It is imperative to facilitate large-scale evidence-based medical research and promote the clinical application of TCM in the management of UC.
40066487	Mesoporous Nanogel Sprays as Universal Evaporation Interface Modifiers for Boosting Water-Cluster Evaporation.	Accelerating water evaporation is vital for processes like photosynthesis, dehydration, and desalination. Optimizing the pore structure and interfacial properties of evaporative materials can reduce evaporation enthalpy and increase efficiency. However, integrating the evaporation interface with water transport channels poses significant design challenges and complicates low-enthalpy evaporation analysis. To address these challenges, a hydrophilic nanovesicle gel is developed with a hydrophobic mesoporous structure as an ideal spray. This spray effectively upgrades their interface of universal substrates (including PVA hydrogels, balsa wood, nanofiltration membrane, cellulose paper, nylon fabrics, etc.), enabling the simple preparation of evaporation materials. The sprayed samples, at a low spraying dose of 40 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>, achieved evaporation rates of 1.58 and 3.26 kg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> under 0.5 and 1 sun irradiance, which are 297% and 268% higher than their respective substrates. These nanogels offer benefits like edibility, low cost, ease of use, and compatibility with various substrates, showing great potential in seawater desalination, dehydration technology, crop yield enhancement, and coating/paint drying. More importantly, this work highlights the need for researchers to focus on the surface structure of materials, rather than merely using bulk gels, in the development of high-performance evaporative materials.
40066488	Tailoring Self-Catalytic N─Co Bonds into Heterostructure Architectures: Deciphering Polytellurides Conversion Mechanism Toward Ultralong-Lifespan Potassium Ion Storage.	Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion-diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (K<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub>). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe<sub>2</sub> composite equipped with a self-catalytic center (N-CoTe<sub>2</sub>/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low-tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self-catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N-CoTe<sub>2</sub>/LTTC provides a short-range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K<sup>+</sup> diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N─Co bonds self-catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for K<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub> under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N-CoTe<sub>2</sub>/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong‑lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te-based anodes. Finally, the N-CoTe<sub>2</sub>/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of K<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub> and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong-lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.
40066492	Geometric Design of Interface Structures and Electrolyte Solvation Chemistry for Fast Charging Lithium-Ion Batteries.	The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li<sup>+</sup> ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li<sup>+</sup> ions during fast-charging of Li-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile-based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li<sup>+</sup> ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN-containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li<sup>+</sup> ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 °C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.
40066493	Impact of diabetes on risk of major adverse cardiovascular events associated with lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.	Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an emerging risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). However, evidence on MACE risk according to Lp(a) level in atherosclerotic patients is insufficient, and more data is needed about whether type 2 diabetes (T2DM) additionally contributes to this risk. We aimed to investigate the association between Lp(a) and MACE in atherosclerotic patients and compare the magnitude of Lp(a)-MACE association in the patients with and without T2DM.

40066500	Who cares about the dying? - Unpacking integration of palliative care and oncology in the Danish context.	Integrating palliative care into the trajectories of patients with incurable cancer has been a priority for years. Yet, the intended outcomes of this integration remain elusive. Many patients with advanced cancer continue to receive so-called aggressive treatments in the end-of-life phase or miss out on specialised palliative care entirely. To examine this impasse in the Danish context, we employ the concept of <i>professional value scripts</i> to analyse policy documents and guidelines aimed at guiding professionals working with this patient group. The three identified scripts - cancer treatment, medical palliation and holistic palliative care - embody a distinct understanding of integration, contributing to the challenges of forging an integrated approach. We argue that the central role of the cancer treatment script in patient trajectories creates an obligatory passage point, influencing both the symbolic and practical enactment of integrated palliative care throughout these trajectories.
40066501	FLOT1 Is a Novel Serum Biomarker of Ovarian Cancer Targeted by N6-methyladenosine Modification Inhibition.	Ovarian cancer (OC) is a deadly disease and lacks a precise marker for diagnosis worldwide. Our previous work has shown the overexpression of flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in OC tissue. To improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, we evaluated the serum level of FLOT1 in OC patients and found that the serum concentration of FLOT1 as well as CA125 was significantly increased in patients with OC compared with healthy control (p < 0.01) and those with benign tumors (p < 0.05). The detection rate (above the upper limit of a cut-off value) of FLOT1 and CA125 was 77.78% and 72.22%, respectively, in patients with OC, which was increased to 88.89% in combination. The elevation of FLOT1 was confirmed in the serum of nude mice after the implantation of human OC cells. A high level of FLOT1 protein in the serum was positively correlated with the overexpression of FLOT1 protein in OC tissues. Furthermore, the level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of FLOT1 mRNA was significantly high in OC cells compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells, leading to an increase in FLOT1 mRNA expression. Application of a methylation inhibitor, 3-deazaadenosine, decreased FLOT1 mRNA expression in OC cells and suppressed tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that FLOT1 is a novel serum biomarker of OC and can be targeted by m<sup>6</sup>A modification inhibition. These data highlight the potential application of FLOT1 as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for patients with OC.
40066506	Indirect ELISA-based detection of histatin 3 and cystatin D for the forensic identification of human saliva.	Analyzing forensically relevant body fluids contributes to proving criminal acts, and saliva is often left on the scene, especially in sexual assault cases. Currently, saliva is presumptively identified using its salivary α-amylase activity as an indicator. However, the specificity of saliva presumptive tests is low, and therefore, they cannot confidently prove the presence of saliva. This study aimed to develop and validate an indirect ELISA-based saliva confirmatory test using the novel human salivary protein markers histatin 3 and cystatin D. Histatin 3 and cystatin D are known to be uniquely expressed in human salivary glands, and the molecular evolution of both genes occurred after the divergence of hominoids; thus, the high specificity of human saliva for both markers was expected. As a result of the validation experiments, both histatin 3 and cystatin D markers were able to distinguish human saliva from other human body fluids and animal saliva using appropriate thresholds of the quantitative absorbance values. Our results indicate that both histatin 3 and cystatin D markers are human saliva-specific; thus, we consider that this method will be useful and practical in identifying human saliva.
40066507	Sensing Dog Brain Reactions to Smell by AI Speckle Pattern Analysis.	Investigation of a dog's brain activity related to their outstanding olfactory capabilities has been a topic of interest among researchers. For this specific study, we identified three areas of the brain that have been shown in previous studies to be relevant during the process of smell discrimination in dogs: the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and amygdala. We set up a detection structure system based on laser and a camera to capture speckle patterns on the three regions in four dog breeds for smell stimuli: garlic, menthol, alcohol, and marijuana. The results were analyzed using an XGBoost model. Our analysis revealed that the amygdala plays a crucial role in scent differentiation. Our work offers insight into leveraging the features that characterize distinct scents in the canine brain, paving the way for developing a compact device that can interpret and translate a dog's olfactory perceptions for human understanding.
40066509	Harnessing Lithiophilic Hetero-Interfacial Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries with Low Negative/Positive Capacity Ratios.	Lithium (Li) metal batteries hold great promise for next-generation energy storage due to their high energy density. However, their application is hindered by uncontrollable Li plating/stripping, leading to limited cycle life, especially under practical conditions with a low negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratio. Here, it is demonstrated that stable cycling of low N/P ratio Li metal batteries can be realized by harnessing hetero-interfacial redox chemistry to regulate Li nucleation and deposition behavior. It is shown that replacing pure Li metal with intercalated Li in graphite facilitates the formation of an increasingly lithiophilic heterointerface upon discharge, which homogenizes Li deposition during subsequent charge, resulting in highly reversible Li plating/stripping with minimal active Li loss under lean Li conditions. This enables Li metal cells with a Li/graphite hybrid anode to demonstrate remarkable improvements in cycling life, even with an N/P ratio as low as 0.4, compared to those with a pure Li metal anode. This strategy provides new insights into the role of hetero-interfacial chemistry in constructing highly reversible composite anodes for high-energy and long-cycling Li metal batteries.
40066510	An In Situ Curing, Shear-Responsive Biomaterial Designed for Durable Embolization of Microvasculature.	Endovascular embolization is a minimally-invasive technique whereby blood vessels supplying pathological structures are selectively occluded with various embolic agents. In many scenarios, it is desirable for the embolic to distally penetrate to the level of the microvasculature, which maximizes devascularization. Existing agents exhibit inconsistent distal penetration and have other limitations including tendency for proximal reflux, patient pain during infusion, lack of fluoroscopic radiopacity, potential for catheter adhesion, susceptibility to recanalization, and other usability challenges. NeoCast is an in situ curing, solvent-free, non-adhesive biomaterial composed of polydimethylsiloxane, bismuth trioxide, and fumed silica that possesses shear-responsive properties enabling manual injectability through commercially-available microcatheters with large and small diameter lumens. Here, embolization performance with and without flow arrest, in both arterial and venous preclinical anatomies is reported. NeoCast reproducibly achieves a rate of distal penetration with microvascular occlusion that is superior to existing agents, exhibits excellent fluoroscopic visibility, and provides durable occlusion. There is mild inflammation when NeoCast is infused into blood vessels and absence of neurotoxicity when implanted directly into brain tissue. The engineered NeoCast material is poised to become a next-generation, liquid embolic agent for applications in which distal microvascular occlusion is desired.

Given the complexity of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) and their overlapping symptoms with other conditions, an accurate diagnosis necessitates a thorough examination, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Consequently, innovative diagnostic tools are required to increase TMD diagnosis efficiency and precision. Therefore, the purpose of this umbrella review was to examine the existing evidence about the usefulness of artificial intelligence (AI) in TMD diagnosis.
40066513	Stacking Pressure Modulated Deposition and Dissolution of Zinc Anode.	Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are emerging as a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage, offering enhanced safety and low costs. Nevertheless, the disordered growth of zinc dendrites has resulted in low coulombic efficiency and the dangers of short circuits, limiting the commercialization of ZIBs. In this study, a planar growth of zinc along the (002) direction is achieved by regulating the moderate initial stacking pressure during cell cycling and facilitating a larger zinc deposition particle size. The pivotal role of stacking pressure on the zinc nucleation, growth, and dissolution processes is elucidated with in situ pressure X-ray diffraction (XRD), time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMs), and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). By adjusting the staking pressure from 20 to 300 kPa, the battery cycle time increased 5 times. This work highlights the opportunity to precisely manipulate metal deposition/dissolution with stacking pressure for long-cycle life batteries.
40066516	Quantitative Detection of Orthotopic Liver Cancer in Mice Using Indocyanine Green and Dynamic Diffuse Fluorescence Tomography Imaging.	Orthotopic tumor model has become an essential tool for studying drug biodistribution and tumor progression over time owing to the rapid development of in vivo imaging and immunological science. Dynamic diffuse fluorescence tomography (DFT) is a promising imaging modality that can map the three-dimensional distribution of a fluorophore within the object and capture the metabolic parameters of fluorophores in vivo. It has been widely applied in tumor detection, drug development, and efficacy evaluation. To detect orthotopic liver tumors, we combined indocyanine green (ICG) and a DFT system to perform fluorescence imaging and quantitative analysis for orthotopic liver tumors in mice. The orthotopic liver models were first established, and the liver fluorescence yields were detected in pre- and post-cancerous liver using the DFT system. The results showed that there was higher liver uptake and prolonged retention in orthotopic tumor liver compared to normal liver. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic parameters suggested the uptake coefficient of tumor liver was above twice that of normal liver, while the excretion rates were similar. Additionally, to intuitively assess tumor occurrence, we propose using normalized fluorescence ratios of 5 and maximum fluorescence values of 0.01 mm<sup>-1</sup> as evaluation criteria. The study demonstrates DFT imaging is a promising tool in orthotopic tumor model detection and drug or agent metabolic evaluation.
40066517	Precise Control Over Crystallization Kinetics by Combining Nucleating Agents and Plasticizers for 20.1% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells.	Obtaining controllable active layer morphology plays a significant role in boosting the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a quaternary strategy, which incorporates polymer donor D18-Cl and small molecule acceptor AITC into the host D18:N3, is employed to precisely modulate crystallization kinetics for favorable morphology evolution within the active layer. In situ spectroscopic measurements during film-formation demonstrate that while D18-Cl works as a nucleator to promote aggregation of D18 and foster donor/acceptor intermixing, AITC has exactly the opposite impact on aggregation of N3 and intermixing kinetics of donor and acceptor, working as a plasticizer. The mutually compensational effect of the dual-guests, as a result, enables synergistic control over fibrillar networks, multi-length scale morphology, and vertical phase distribution, leading to optimized 3D morphology for greatly enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transfer, suppressed charge recombination, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, the quaternary OSCs based on D18:D18-Cl:N3:AITC achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, which represents one of the highest efficiencies for single-junction OSCs. This work presents an effective strategy to precisely regulate crystallization kinetics toward advanced morphology control for high-performance OSCs.
40066518	LAMP2-FLOT2 interaction enhances autophagosome-lysosome fusion to protect the septic heart in response to ILC2.	Cardiac dysfunction is a serious complication of sepsis-induced multiorgan failure in intensive care units and is characterized by an uncontrolled immune response to overwhelming infection. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), as a part of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in the inflammatory process of heterogeneous cardiac disorders. However, the role of ILC2 in regulating sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that autophagic flux blockage exacerbated inflammatory response and cardiac dysfunction, which was associated with mortality of sepsis. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model, we observed an expansion of ILC2s in the septic heart. Furthermore, IL4 derived from ILC2 mitigated cardiac inflammatory responses and improved cardiac function during sepsis. Additionally, IL4 enhanced LAMP2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2) expression through STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation to stabilize lysosomal homeostasis and rescue the impaired autophagic flux during sepsis. Notably, LAMP2 was preferentially bound to FLOT2 (flotillin 2) after IL4 exposure, and the interaction enhanced autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cardiac endothelial cells. Loss of FLOT2 reversed the regulatory effects of LAMP2 on autophagy mediated by IL4, leading to autophagosome accumulation and suppressed autophagosome clearance. Conclusively, these findings provide novel insights that ILC2 regulates incomplete autophagic flux to protect septic heart and expand our understanding of immunoregulation for sepsis.<b>Abbreviation</b>: ACTB: actin beta; ACTN: actinin, alpha; ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; ANXA5/annexin V: annexin A5; AO: acridine orange; BECN1/Beclin1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CKM: creatine kinase, muscle; CKB: creatine kinase, brain; CLP: cecal ligation and puncture; CO: cardiac output; CQ: chloroquine; CTS: cathepsin; DAPI: 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EC: endothelial cell; EF: ejection fraction; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FLOT: flotillin; FS: fractional shortening; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GATA3: GATA binding protein 3; GLB1/β-Gal: galactosidase, beta 1; HCMEC: human cardiac microvascular endothelial cell; IL: interleukin; ILC: innate lymphoid cell; IL1RL1/ST2: interleukin 1 receptor-like 1; IL4c: IL4 complex; IL7R/CD127: interleukin 7 receptor; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; LAMP: lysosomal-associated membrane protein; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LMP: lysosome membrane permeabilization; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LVEDd: left ventricular end-diastole diameter; LVEDV: left ventricular end-diastole volume; LVESd: left ventricular end-systolic diameter; LVESV: left ventricular end-systole volume; MAN: mannosidase alpha; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MS: mass spectrometry; PECAM1/CD31: platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; PTPRC/CD45: protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C; RORC/RORγt: RAR related orphan receptor gamma; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TBX21/T-bet: T-box 21; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; THY1/CD90.2: thymus cell antigen 1, theta; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-translocating ATPase; VIM: vimentin.
40066521	The impact of adolescent traumatic brain injury on health risk behaviors.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with disinhibition, impulsivity, and other sequelae which may make adolescent TBI survivors more likely to engage in health risk behaviors though this has not yet been comprehensively investigated. Extant literature on TBI-related health risk behaviors is limited by a dearth of studies on adolescents, reliance on self-report of TBI, lack of an orthopedic injury (OI) control group, and the fact that TBI's effects on various health risk behavior domains are generally examined separately. The current study clarifies the impact of TBI on health risk behaviors among adolescents, specifically those related to 1) unintentional injury and violence (including aggression- and suicide-related behaviors); 2) tobacco use; and 3) alcohol and other drug use in an analytic sample of 74 adolescents (<i>n</i> = 43 for youth with a complicated mild to severe TBI, <i>n</i> = 31 for youth with an OI). Results indicate youth with a TBI exhibited more suicide-related health risk behaviors at 12-month follow-up (<i>F</i> = 6.063; <i>p</i> = .016; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .079), as well as a nonsignificant trend toward greater marijuana use (<i>F</i> = 3.747; <i>p</i> = .057; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .050), compared to youth with an OI while controlling for age. Youth with an OI exhibited greater increases in violence and victimization over the 12-month post-injury period compared to youth with a TBI (<i>F</i> = 4.243; <i>p</i> = .044; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .067) while controlling for age. Interventions to reduce psychological distress and improve social connectedness, problem-solving, coping, and emotion regulation skills may be most relevant for youth who receive a TBI. Emotion regulation and anger management skills may be relevant for youth who receive an OI.

40066525	Direct Integration of Spent LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with High Voltage Aqueous Zinc-Manganese Redox Flow Batteries as a Practical Upcycling Process.	With the explosive growth of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), research on the recycling of spent batteries is widely conducted. However, conventional processes involve complex procedures, high costs, and environmental issues. This study introduces the electrochemical upcycling of spent LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LMO) cathode material, incorporating pre-filtration (PF) and pre-reduction (PR) processes to enable its direct application in redox flow batteries (RFBs). Moreover, a double membrane system is applied to address the low operating voltage and energy density by balancing the different pH levels of the zinc anode and manganese cathode. The aqueous zinc-manganese RFB, derived from spent LMO pouch full cells, achieves coulombic efficiency of 90% and energy efficiency (EE) exceeding 70% over 250 cycles. The LMO-containing electrolyte is further treated to precipitate the manganese ions by a simple pH adjustment, enabling 100% separation of lithium, thereby enhancing the sustainability of rare metal resources. This work presents a remarkable advancement in the upcycling method of LIB cathode materials and contributes to establishing a circular system for battery materials.
40066528	Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Suppresses Mitophagy to Alleviate Muscle Atrophy in Chronic Renal Failure With Protein-Energy Wasting.	Protein-energy wasting (PEW) facilitates major adverse clinical outcomes in chronic renal failure (CRF), with current therapies not suitable for all patients. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) can alleviate chronic kidney disease, with unclear effects and mechanisms on CRF with PEW. The CRF rat model was constructed by adenine administration, and PEW was induced by a 4% casein diet. The serum creatinine (SCR), urinary protein (UPR), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pathology of the gastrocnemius muscle was estimated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of mitophagy-related markers was detected to assess the mitophagy level. Dexamethasone-induced L6 myotubes established myotube atrophy models. The levels of mitophagy-related markers, muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), and atrophy gene 1 (Atrogin1) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. F. prausnitzii suppressed the SCR, UPR, and BUN expression in serum and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy, which were promoted by CRF with PEW. Dexamethasone-induced expression of MuRF1 and Atrogin1 in L6 myotubes was decreased by F. prausnitzii. Additionally, F. prausnitzii repressed mitophagy in the gastrocnemius muscle and L6 myotubes. In conclusion, F. prausnitzii suppressed renal failure progression and muscle atrophy by inhibiting mitophagy in CRF with PEW.

40066532	Clinical, Immunologic, and Genetic Characteristics of T-lymphoblastic Leukemia with STIL-TAL1 Fusion.	T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with a less favorable prognosis. The genetic background of T-ALL is widely heterogeneous, with the co-occurrence of multiple genetic abnormalities. The STIL-TAL1 rearrangement results from a submicroscopic deletion on chromosome 1p33 and is present in 15 - 25% of T-ALL cases. Submicroscopic deletions are not detected by conventional cytogenetic ana-lyses but can be identified through array comparative genomic hybridization and/or high-throughput RNA sequencing. Patients with the STIL-TAL1 fusion exhibit distinct characteristics, such as a young age, high white blood cell count, typical immunophenotype, and specific genetic abnormalities. However, the clinical, laboratory, and prognostic significance of this rearrangement remains unclear. This study was performed to identify STIL-TAL1 rearrangement resulting from submicroscopic 1p33 deletion in T-ALL and to investigate the clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics of T-ALL patients with STIL-TAL1 fusion.

40066564	[WHO guidance on non-nutritive sweeteners - A critical analysis].	The use of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) has gained prominence as an alternative to reduce free sugar consumption, aligning with global efforts to combat the growing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). By providing sweetness without caloric energy, NSS are viewed as potential tools in addressing diet-related health challenges. However, their long-term effects on health remain contentious, especially within the medical community. In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) released guidelines evaluating the role of NSS in promoting healthy eating, preventing weight gain, and mitigating NCDs. While some studies highlight benefits, such as lower body weight and reduced energy intake, the evidence is inconclusive. Observational research predominantly raises concerns about potential risks associated with NSS, but these studies face limitations, including biases and confounding variables that hinder causal conclusions. This analysis underscores the urgent need for comprehensive, high-quality research to clarify the risks and benefits of NSS. Current evidence is limited in scope and fails to address critical knowledge gaps, particularly regarding their long-term implications for the general population and individuals with NCDs. Expanding the scientific understanding of NSS is essential to inform public health recommendations and clinical guidelines effectively.

40066573	A proximal policy optimisation algorithm-based algorithm for cardiovascular disorders detection.	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) significantly impact athletes, impacting the heart and blood vessels. This article introduces a novel method to assess CVD in athletes through an artificial neural network (ANN). The model utilises the mutual learning-based artificial bee colony (ML-ABC) algorithm to set initial weights and proximal policy optimisation (PPO) to address imbalanced classification. ML-ABC uses mutual learning to enhance the learning process by updating the positions of the food sources with respect to the best fitness outcomes of two randomly selected individuals. PPO makes updates in the ANN stable and efficient to improve the model's reliability. Our approach formulates the classification problem as a series of decision-making processes, rewarding every classification act with higher rewards for correctly identifying the instances of the minority class, hence handling class imbalance. We evaluated the model's performance on a diversified medical dataset including 26,002 athletes who were examined within the Polyclinic for Occupational Health and Sports in Zagreb, further validated with NCAA and NHANES datasets to verify generalisability. Our findings indicate that our model outperforms existing models with accuracies of 0.88, 0.86 and 0.82 for the respective datasets. These results enhance clinical model application and advance cardiovascular disorder detection and methodologies.

Data on sex differences in peripheral vascular disease are ill defined, and there is a need to report and understand those sex-related differences to mitigate adverse outcomes related to those disparities. Although peripheral vascular disease is a highly diverse group of disorders affecting the arteries, veins, and lymphatics, this scientific statement focuses on disorders affecting the peripheral arteries to include the aorta and its branch vessels. The purpose of this scientific statement is to report the current status of sex-based differences and disparities in peripheral vascular disease and to provide research priorities to achieve health equity for women with peripheral vascular disease.
40066580	Comorbidities of hypothyroidism.	Hypothyroidism is a relatively common condition that may affect as many as 10% of the population worldwide when its overt and subclinical presentations are considered. Important clinical comorbidities are highly prevalent in people with hypothyroidism and diminish quality of life and functional status in a manner that is proportional to the number of comorbidities present and their severity. This article reviews the common comorbidities of hypothyroidism, as reported in the literature. The comorbidities of hypothyroidism include clinical conditions commonly associated with hypothyroidism, such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, fatigue or (possibly) cardiovascular disease, and can appear whether or not intervention with LT4 is applied appropriately to ensure biochemical euthyroidism. Other comorbidities may share some pathogenetic background with hypothyroidism, including depression or anxiety, or autoimmune conditions. Hypothyroidism may arise as a comorbidity of some other conditions, e.g. following the application of targeted cancer therapies or alemtuzumab for multiple sclerosis. Other common treatments, including metformin, glucocorticoids or proton pump inhibitors among others, may alter levels of thyrotropin, thus impacting on the monitoring of thyroid dysfunction and the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Ensuring good control of hypothyroidism is a necessary first step in managing any patient with hypothyroidism. Then, physicians should be aware of the possibility of other comorbid conditions that must be addressed to achieve an optimal patient outcome.

40066598	Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2/3 gene deletions and repeat motifs in Chhattisgarh, India (2017-2018).	Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are vital for malaria diagnosis, especially in resource-limited areas. RDTs targeting histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and its structural homologue PfHRP3 are commonly used for detecting Plasmodium falciparum. However, genetic deletions in these proteins can affect test accuracy. This study aims to examine the gene deletions and sequence variation in the Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes in P. falciparum isolates from Chhattisgarh, India, and assess their correlation with RDT reactivity.
40066599	Insights from traditional fermented legumes towards the innovation of modern plant-based meat analogues.	There has been a major growth in the development of plant-based meat alternatives (PBMA) in recent years. However, current PBMA often contain ultra processed ingredients and numerous additives to be able to mimic animal-based meat (ABM) including the meaty (umami) flavour, characteristic firm/chewy structure and juicy mouthfeel. In this review, the potential of ancient fermentation techniques as a minimally processed alternative to ABM and current PBMA are explored. Fermented foods including tempeh, natto, dawadawa and ugba are naturally high in protein and umami flavours. The nutritional, aroma, flavour and techno-functional properties are provided and discussed in the context of ABM and PBMA. The fermented foods have potential to be used as whole foods ingredients, or their constituents can be used as ingredients in plant-based foods. Particularly the umami flavours and high protein content combined with the naturally occurring high water holding capacity (WHC), solubility and other material properties make fermented legume foods suitable candidates for use in high-protein plant-based foods. Understanding the sensory characteristics and material properties generated during legume fermentation and their similarities to ABM can aid in stimulating innovations in food technology to obtain a new generation of less-processed PBMA with limited additives.
40066601	Unlocking the Gates: A Novel Diagnostic Molecule for Quantifying Efflux Levels in Gram-Positive Bacteria.	Efflux-mediated antibiotic resistance poses a significant global threat, affecting diverse bacterial species. Clinicians recognize the danger of efflux mechanisms during antibiotic treatment, yet precise diagnostic tools remain unavailable. The antibiogram currently infers abnormal efflux pump activity in clinical isolates, which is subsequently confirmed through transcriptomic or genomic analysis. This study harnesses the colorimetric, fluorescence, and solubility properties of phenazinium derivatives to develop a rapid protocol for detecting bacterial efflux. Among several synthesized phenazinium compounds, the compound demonstrating differential MIC in Staphylococcus efflux mutants and exhibiting appropriate physicochemical properties is selected. A diagnostic protocol is developed using the selected compound to assess efflux levels, categorized as no, weak, or strong, through colorimetry and spectroscopy techniques. Testing on Gram-positive efflux mutants and clinical Staphylococcus isolates further validates the approach. In-silico docking analysis confirms the interaction between the chosen compound and the NorA efflux pump in S. aureus. Flow cytometry is employed to re-evaluate the detection assays. The developed molecule and protocol represent the first known method to evaluate efflux levels in any Gram-positive species through a streamlined and user-friendly process. This pioneering test significantly advances the epidemiological analysis of efflux mechanisms and enables more informed therapeutic decision-making, leading to more effective treatment.
40066602	The Effect of Heparin on Bone Metabolism and Orthodontic Tooth Movement in Rats.	Various attempts have been made to increase the rate of orthodontic tooth movement (OTM).

40066605	Noncontact Detection of Blood Coagulation Dynamics Based on Speckle Deviation Analysis Using Optical Coherence Tomography.	Red blood cells aggregate from individual cells into larger aggregates during blood coagulation. This process causes the light-scattering particles to enlarge and their motion to become restricted. The size and motion of these light-scattering particles during coagulation provide valuable information on the progress of blood coagulation. This paper proposes an optical coherence tomography speckle deviation (OCT-SD) method for the noncontact assessment of blood coagulation dynamics by detecting changes in the size and motion of scattering particles. The coagulation characteristics of static and flowing blood were quantitatively evaluated through coagulation reaction time and clot formation duration by monitoring the blood coagulation process. The OCT imaging, incorporating SD analysis, enables noncontact coagulation assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently and accurately assess coagulation dynamics, offering significant potential for in situ coagulation detection.
40066607	[Early conversion to belatacept post-transplantation: state of the art and expert opinion].	The standard immunosuppressive treatment after organ transplantation typically includes a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine A), an antimetabolite (mycophenolic acid) or an mTOR inhibitor, and corticosteroids. However, these treatments are associated with multiple side effects, including nephrotoxicity. Belatacept, a fusion protein blocking the CD80/86 costimulation pathway, emerges as an effective and well-tolerated alternative. Initial phase III studies showed that de novo belatacept improves renal function and reduces the incidence of donor-specific antibodies, despite a higher rate of acute cellular rejections. Early conversion studies (within the first 6 months post-transplantation) demonstrate significant improvement in renal function, particularly when conversion is performed early. However, the risk of acute rejection and opportunistic infections must be monitored. This article summarizes the available studies on early conversion to belatacept in kidney transplanted patients.
40066610	Being autonomous in dialysis: association with occupational status, social activity level, quality of life, and physical activity level.	End-stage kidney disease radically alters the patients' lives. The aim of this pilot study was to describe this impact in patients treated with autonomous dialysis modality in France: Long Nocturnal Hemodialysis (LNHD), Daily Home Hemodialysis (DHHD), Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD), and hemodialysis in a self-care unit (SCHD).
40066614	Superficial Temporal Artery-Middle Cerebral Artery Bypass Treatment Planning for Cerebral Ischaemia Based on Multi-Scale Model.	Superficial temporal artery and middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass surgery is an effective method to enhance cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ischemic patients. However, the effectiveness of various bypass techniques varies with the diversity of Circle of Willis (CoW) structures. This study aims to develop a physiologically realistic hemodynamic model to optimize STA-MCA bypass planning for cerebral ischemia patients with different CoW structures. This study developed a 0D-1D geometric multi-scale haemodynamic model that coupled the stenosis model and the cerebral autoregulation model. Based on this model, nine CoW structural models before and after end-to-side (E-S) and side-to-side (S-S) bypass were constructed, and their haemodynamic properties were calculated to evaluate the efficacy of different bypass methods in different CoW structures. The validity of the model and results was verified by clinical data. For the mRACA1, mRACA1-fRPCA1, and mACoA CoW structures, there was a risk of hyperperfusion (13.96%, 12.81%, and -2.64%) after E-S bypass but not S-S bypass. In the mACoA-mLPCoA structure, both bypass techniques posed hyperperfusion risk (112.41% and 30.57%). Other CoW structures showed that E-S bypass could restore CBF without the risk of hyperperfusion. The model's predictions were within 5% of clinical data. The mRACA1, mRACA1-fRPCA1, and mACoA structures were suitable for S-S bypass; the mACoA-mLPCoA structure was not suitable for bypass, and other CoW structures favored E-S bypass. The developed model can effectively simulate the cerebral hemodynamic environment and predict the risk of hyperperfusion, offering valuable insights for personalized bypass planning in cerebral ischemia patients.
40066615	NTRK protein expression in NSCLC and its clinicopathological correlation.	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. Since the discovery of the oncogenic neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion in colorectal cancer in 1986, its understanding has gradually progressed. NTRK's relevance is crucial to understanding some tumor development and how specific tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitors (TRKI) work. <i>NTRK1, NTRK2,</i> and <i>NTRK3</i> (encoding the neurotrophin receptors TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, respectively) rearrangement induces high tumor transforming ability. This study investigates the clinical relevance of NTRK immunohistochemistry in NSCLC patients in a cohort of 482 patients from Karolinska University Hospital with detailed clinical and pathological studies. Immunohistochemical staining for NTRK expression was performed, and the results were correlated with patient demographics, histological subtypes, tumor extent, and staging. Our findings revealed that NTRK expression, predominantly membranous and cytoplasmic, was detected in 22 out of 482 cases (4.56%). Notably, NTRK expression was more frequently observed in squamous-cell carcinoma (SqCC) than in adenocarcinoma (AdCa). Clinical correlations indicated a significant association between NTRK expression and histologic subtypes (<i>p</i><0.001) and grade of differentiation (<i>p</i>=0.036). However, no significant correlations were observed with age, sex, tumor size, staging, or OS. NTRK immunohistochemistry represents a potential biomarker for a subset of NSCLC patients, particularly those with SqCC histology. Understanding the clinical implications of NTRK expression may contribute to personalized treatment strategies in NSCLC.
40066620	Parallelized Droplet Vitrification for Single-Run Vitrification of Hepatocytes from an Entire Rat Liver.	Drug discovery pipelines rely on the availability of isolated primary hepatocytes for investigating potential hepatotoxicity prior to clinical application. These hepatocytes are isolated from livers rejected for transplantation and subsequently cryopreserved for later usage. The gold standard cryopreservation technique, slow-freezing, is a labor-intensive process with significant poststorage viability loss. In this work, we introduce parallelized droplet vitrification, a technique for high-volumetric, rapid vitrification of suspended cells. We show the utility of this technique through the single-run vitrification of the whole rat liver hepatocyte yield, resulting in the vitrification of 250 million cells in 40 mL of a vitrification solution at 10 mL/min. Additionally, we showed that these implementations maintained improved postpreservation outcomes in primary rat hepatocytes.
40066621	Lyophilized monkeypox mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines with long-term stability and robust immune responses in mice.	The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared another global health emergency due to the rapidly spreading monkeypox (Mpox) outbreak in numerous African countries. To address the unmet need to contain the outbreak using the existing vaccines, this study developed a lyophilization process for an effective, scalable and affordable Mpox mRNA-LNP vaccine candidate to address the global health crisis. A comprehensive evaluation and optimization of the vaccine formulation (the type/concentration of cryoprotectants, the type/concentration of buffer system, as well as the mRNA concentration and reconstitution solvent) and the freeze-drying process parameters (freezing method, temperature, cooling rate and primary/secondary drying conditions) were conducted. The freeze-dried product exhibits a uniform appearance and a moisture content of less than 1%. Reconstitution of the lyophilized mRNA-LNP resulted in equivalent particle size/polydispersity index, encapsulation efficiency and mRNA integrity compared to that of freshly prepared mRNA-LNP. Furthermore, the lyophilization process can be scaled up 100-fold to 2000 vials/batch. Notably, the lyophilized mRNA-LNP demonstrated a storage stability of at least 12 months at 4°C, and at ambient temperature for a minimum of 8 h post-reconstitution, exhibiting minimal deterioration in product quality. The in vitro biological activity and in vivo immunogenicity of the lyophilized mRNA-LNP was comparable to that of the freshly prepared mRNA-LNP. These results provide a compelling rationale for the utilization of lyophilization technology in enhancing the accessibility of the Mpox mRNA vaccine in developing countries, a strategy that is crucial for containing the global epidemic of Mpox infection.
40066622	Mpox virus poxin-schlafen fusion protein suppresses innate antiviral response by sequestering STAT2.	<b>ABSTRACT</b>Mpox virus (MPXV) has to establish efficient interferon (IFN) antagonism for effective replication. MPXV-encoded IFN antagonists have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the IFN antagonism of poxin-schlafen (PoxS) fusion gene of MPXV was characterized. MPXV PoxS was capable of decreasing cGAS-produced 2'3'-cGAMP, like its ortholog poxin of vaccinia virus, which is the first known cytosolic nuclease that hydrolyzes the 3'-5' bond of 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). However, MPXV PoxS did not suppress cGAS-STING-mediated type I IFN production. Instead, MPXV PoxS antagonized basal and type I IFN-induced expression of IFN-stimulated genes such as OAS1, SAMD9, SAMD9L, ISG15, ISG56 and IFIT3. Consistently, MPXV PoxS inhibited both basal and type I IFN-stimulated activity of interferon-stimulated response elements, but did not affect activation of IFN-γ-activated sites. Mechanistically, MPXV PoxS interacted with STAT2 and sequestered it in the cytoplasm. Both the viral schlafen fusion and the active site of 2'3'-cGAMP nuclease were required for STAT2 sequestration and consequent suppression of IFN-stimulated gene expression. MPXV PoxS conferred resistance to the suppression of MPXV replication by type I IFN. Taken together, our findings suggested that MPXV PoxS counteracts host antiviral response by sequestering STAT2 to circumvent basal and type I IFN-induced expression of antiviral genes.
40066623	Have we reached a new baseline for blood collection and transfusion in the United States? National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey, 2023.

Data from the 2023 NBCUS were analyzed to further understand national trends in US blood availability.
40066628	Synergistic Effects of a Novel Multifunctional Bionic Scaffold and Electrical Stimulation Promote Bone Tissue Regeneration.	Electrical stimulation (ES) can effectively regulate cell behavior and promote bone tissue regeneration, and conductive biomaterials can further enhance this effect by enhancing the conduction of electrical signals between cells. In this study, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(l-lactide)-aniline pentamer triblock copolymer (PAP) were used as raw materials to prepare a conductive bionic scaffold (PLGA/PAP). Subsequently, bone morphogenetic protein 2 mimetic peptide containing a DOPA tag (DBMP2MP) was loaded on the scaffold surface. The prepared scaffold (DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP) had a porosity of 79.17% and a porous structure similar to that of natural cancellous bone. After PAP was added, the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the scaffold were increased to 2.79 ± 0.1 kPa and 1.29 ± 0.023 × 10<sup>-6</sup> s/cm. The addition of DBMP2MP significantly improved the hydrophilicity of the scaffold material, and the contact Angle of the scaffold material decreased from 102.45 ± 7.67° to 30.36 ± 5.25°. At the same time, DBMP2MP and scaffold surface bonding ability increased by two times compared with commercial BMP2. The polypeptide DBMP2MP can bind to the surface of scaffolds and exhibit long-lasting biological effects. In vitro cell experiments revealed that the DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP scaffold could significantly promote the proliferation and adhesion of MC3T3-E1 cells and that the combination of DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP with pulsed ES could further synergistically induce cell mineralization and osteogenic differentiation. The results of the rabbit radius defect experiments revealed that grafting the DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP scaffold at the defect site significantly promoted the formation of new bone and collagen fibers. When the DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP scaffold was combined with ES, the regeneration rate of bone tissue further improved, and the newborn collagen tissue is close to normal bone collagen. Therefore, this bionic scaffold with excellent electrical and biological activity shows considerable potential in the field of bone defect repair.
40066641	A NAC transcription factor and a MADS-box protein antagonistically regulate sucrose accumulation in strawberry receptacles.	Sugar accumulation during fruit ripening is an essential physiological change that influences fruit quality. While NAC transcription factors are recognized for their role in modulating strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruit ripening, their specific contributions to sugar accumulation have remained largely unexplored. This study identified FvNAC073, a NAC transcription factor, as a key regulator that not only exhibits a gradual increase in gene expression during fruit ripening but also enhances the accumulation of sucrose. Further investigation showed that FvNAC073 positively regulates the expression of sucrose-6-phosphate synthase 1 (FvSPS1), a gene associated with sucrose synthesis, and negatively regulates sucrose synthase 2 (FvSUS2), which is involved in sucrose breakdown, through direct promoter binding. Additionally, we uncovered that FvCMB1L, a MADS-box protein, exhibits high gene expression levels at the premature fruit stage and acts to repress FvSPS1 while activating FvSUS2, thus negatively affecting sucrose accumulation. Notably, we demonstrated a competitive interaction between FvNAC073 and FvCMB1L in binding to the promoters of FvSPS1 and FvSUS2, resulting in antagonistic regulation of these genes. This intricate dynamic between FvCMB1L and FvNAC073 elucidates a mechanism for balancing sugar content during strawberry fruit development. Our findings offer insights into the complex regulatory network governing sucrose accumulation in strawberries, highlighting the potential for targeted genetic interventions to enhance fruit quality.
40066644	Impact of Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Pleural Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy in Multimodality Treatment for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.	Few malignancies provoke as many controversies about treatment as pleural mesothelioma. There is limited experience with novel radiotherapy techniques worldwide in adjuvant and particularly in neoadjuvant settings within multimodality treatment. The objective of the current study was to investigate the long-term outcome of neoadjuvant and adjuvant pleural intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) combined with macroscopic complete resection with or without chemotherapy.
40066645	Synergistic Inactivation of Airborne Viruses by Low-Concentration Ozone With High Humidity and Temperature.	Ambient humidity, temperature, and ozone influence the viability of airborne viruses, but their synergistic effects are poorly understood, particularly regarding ozone with humidity/temperature changes. Therefore, we examined the inactivation of airborne influenza viruses and coronaviruses under combinations of low ambient ozone concentrations, relative humidity (RH) levels, and temperatures typical of daily life. Viral fluid was atomized in a closed chamber conditioned with different combinations of these factors. The atomized aerosol particles containing the virus were exposed to ambient air and then sampled for titration. Active virus levels in ambient air at 50%-85% RH with 15, 35, and 55 ppb ozone significantly decreased compared with those in ambient air with 0 ppb ozone, whereas those in ambient air at < 40% RH decreased only slightly, even with 100 ppb ozone. Viral gene copy numbers, assayed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, remained similar across all conditions. Inactivation increased with higher temperatures, although not at 15°C. These findings suggest that low concentrations of ambient ozone, when combined with high humidity and temperature, effectively inactivate airborne viruses, potentially influencing viral transmission in real-world environments.

40066647	Reporting a Homozygous Case of Neurodevelopmental Disorder Associated With a Novel PRPF8 Variant.	While recently identified heterozygous PRPF8 variants have been linked to various human diseases, their role in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) remains ambiguous. This study investigates the potential association between homozygous PRPF8 variants and NDDs. Most PRPF8 variants are primarily associated with retinal diseases; however, we analyze a family with multiple members diagnosed with NDDs.
40066648	Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in aortic stenosis patients scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.	The prevalences of aortic stenosis (AS) and transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) increase with age. Identification of occult ATTR-CM in patients with AS can help explain out-of-proportion myocardial dysfunction, aid in prognostication and prompt initiation of disease-modifying treatment. Studies have suggested that many patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have concomitant ATTR-CM, but some have included unverified ATTR-CM in patients with ambiguous scintigrams. We aimed to assess the co-occurrence of ATTR-CM in patients scheduled for TAVI.
40066650	Chronotype, sleep timing, sleep regularity, and cancer risk: A systematic review.	Sleep is a multidimensional modifiable lifestyle factor related to cancer risk. Prior research has primarily focused on sleep duration, despite the increasing importance of sleep timing and sleep regularity in the health research field. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the existing literature on the relationship of chronotype, sleep timing, and sleep regularity with cancer risk. We searched four databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Embase) in October 2024. The sleep exposures of interest included sleep timing, sleep regularity, sleep midpoint, social jetlag, chronotype, and weekend catch-up sleep, and the outcome of interest was cancer incidence (overall or site-specific). A total of 22 studies were included, of which 18 investigated chronotype, two investigated social jetlag, two investigated sleep midpoint, and one investigated weekend catch-up sleep as the sleep exposure. The majority of studies assessed sleep using self-reported questionnaires (95%) and investigated site-specific cancer incidence (91%). We found no consistent evidence linking late chronotype, later sleep midpoint, increased social jetlag, or weekend catch-up sleep to elevated risk of cancer. This review highlights the heterogeneity in how sleep timing and sleep regularity are assessed. Future research should standardize measures on how to quantify sleep timing and sleep regularity and replication studies in diverse populations are needed. Current evidence on linking sleep timing, sleep regularity, and chronotype with cancer risk remains inconclusive.
40066651	The Dual Role of Active Site Hydroxylated Residue in Peroxiredoxin Sulfinylation Catalysis.	<b><i>Aims:</i></b> Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are ubiquitous Cys peroxidases regulated by sulfinylation, a modification that occurs when the sulfenic acid generated on the catalytic Cys by peroxide reduction reacts with a second molecule of peroxide. In the Prx1 family, sulfinylation sensitivity is controlled by competition between a structural transition from a fully folded (FF) to locally unfolded (LU) conformation and the chemical step of sulfinylation. The initial peroxide reduction relies on a conserved catalytic hydroxylated residue that allows peroxide optimal activation. This study aimed at investigating the role of this catalytic residue in sulfinylation. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Sulfenate attack on peroxide was favored by one order of magnitude when a catalytic Thr was present, for yeast cytosolic Prx1-type enzymes, human Prx1 and yeast mitochondrial Prx, a Prx6-type enzyme. Furthermore, pKa determination supported the notion of electrostatic interaction between the catalytic hydroxyl and sulfenate intermediate. Finally, FF-LU transition kinetics was faster with a catalytic Thr, supporting that the hydroxyl group proximity to the nascent sulfenate group also promotes the FF-LU transition. <b><i>Innovation:</i></b> We identify a major mechanism that activates sulfinylation in hyperoxidation-sensitive Prxs from the Prx1 and Prx6 families. Furthermore, we show that the catalytic hydroxylated residue holds a dual role in regulating hyperoxidation sensitivity, by activating the sulfinylation reaction, while also promoting the competing FF to LU transition, thus acting as an important regulatory determinant. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The present work sets the basis for investigating other instances of Cys proteins regulated by sulfinylation, a modification increasingly recognized in cell redox regulation and signaling. <i>Antioxid. Redox Signal.</i> 00, 000-000.
40066652	Intestinal polyps and chronic schistosomiasis.	Intestinal polyps have been described in association with chronic schistosomiasis, and must be differentiated from malignant tumors and appropriately managed. This uncommon condition may be very rarely detected in people from non-endemic areas of this zoonosis, who were occasionally infected during some travel period. The lesions are more frequently described in men, and predominating in the colon. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathological evaluations and finding eggs of Schistosoma in biopsy samples. The use of Praziquantel has been a very effective treatment. The authors emphasize the diagnosis confirmation as early as possible, avoiding mistakes with cancer.

40066659	Inhibition of HDAC4 in granulosa cells improved co-cultured oocyte maturation in vitro independent of LH in porcine.	In domestic animals, the mechanisms by which the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge induces oocyte meiosis resumption and maturation through follicular somatic cells remain unclear. Given the pivotal roles of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in regulating gametogenesis, this study investigated the roles of HDACs in follicular granulosa cells (GCs) in mediating LH action during oocyte maturation in pigs. The results showed that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) levels in cultured GCs increased in a time-dependent manner with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation but significantly decreased with LH treatment. The LH-induced reduction of HDAC4 was mediated by the accumulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which subsequently increased H3K18 acetylation and promoted the recruitment of SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) to the promoter of the EGF-like growth factor amphiregulin (Areg). Notably, specific inhibition of HDAC4 promoted oocyte maturation independently of LH in vitro, and the developmental potential of these matured oocytes was comparable to those induced by LH in vitro. In conclusion, HDAC4 in follicular somatic cells serves as a gonadotrophin-responsive epigenetic modification factor that negatively regulates oocyte meiosis resumption in pigs.
40066660	Evaluation of pancreatic microvascularization in chronic pancreatitis by EUS-guided detective flow imaging (DFI): a prospective, single-centre, observational study.	Early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a clinical challenge. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided detective flow imaging (EUS-DFI) can evaluate pancreatic microvascularization, which may be altered in chronic inflammation. Our study aimed to evaluate EUS-DFI findings in patients with CP.
40066661	The Glutamate/GABA-Glutamine Cycle: Insights, Updates, and Advances.	Synaptic homeostasis of the principal neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA is tightly regulated by an intricate metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes known as the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle. In this cycle, astrocytes take up glutamate and GABA from the synapse and convert these neurotransmitters into glutamine. Astrocytic glutamine is subsequently transferred to neurons, serving as the principal precursor for neuronal glutamate and GABA synthesis. The glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle integrates multiple cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, uptake, synthesis, and metabolism. All of these processes are deeply interdependent and closely coupled to cellular energy metabolism. Astrocytes display highly active mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and several unique metabolic features, including glycogen storage and pyruvate carboxylation, which are essential to sustain continuous glutamine release. However, new roles of oligodendrocytes and microglia in neurotransmitter recycling are emerging. Malfunction of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle can lead to severe synaptic disruptions and may be implicated in several brain diseases. Here, I review central aspects and recent advances of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle to highlight how the cycle is functionally connected to critical brain functions and metabolism. First, an overview of glutamate, GABA, and glutamine transport is provided in relation to neurotransmitter recycling. Then, central metabolic aspects of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the critical metabolic roles of glial cells. Finally, I discuss how aberrant neurotransmitter recycling is linked to neurodegeneration and disease, focusing on astrocyte metabolic dysfunction and brain lipid homeostasis as emerging pathological mechanisms. Instead of viewing the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle as individual biochemical processes, a more holistic and integrative approach is needed to advance our understanding of how neurotransmitter recycling modulates brain function in both health and disease.

40066670	Ciliopathy due to genetic alterations of TULP3 as an uncommon cause of hepatorenocardiac fibrosis.	Hepatorenocardiac fibrosis is a group of rare, clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited disorders affecting the development and degenerative function of the liver and kidneys. It is associated with ciliopathies, a group of diseases characterized by dysfunction of the primary cilium, a key organelle in cell signaling. We present a clinical case of ciliopathy linked to a genetic alteration in the protein TULP3 (TUB Like Protein 3) as a cause of hepatorenocardiac fibrosis.
40066672	Multifunctional Liposomes with Enhanced Stability for Imaging-Guided Cancer Chemodynamic and Photothermal Therapy.	Improvements in tumor therapy require a combination of strategies where targeted treatment is critical. We developed a new versatile nanoplatform, MA@E, that generates high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with effective photothermal conversions in the removal of tumors. Enhanced stability liposomes were employed as carriers to facilitate the uniform distribution and stable storage of encapsulated gold nanorods (AuNRs) and Mn-MIL-100 metal-organic frameworks, with efficient delivery of MA@E to the cytoplasm. In the targeted phagocytosis of tumor cells, MA@E can effectively deplete the reduced glutathione (GSH) with increased hydroxyl radicals that combine with Mn<sup>2+</sup> released from Mn-MIL-100 to trigger Fenton-like reactions, generating ROS that induces cell apoptosis. Exposure to near-infrared (NIR-II) irradiation results in a AuNRs-induced thermogenic effect that expedites the release of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and promotes Fenton-like reactions, achieving increased production of <sup>•</sup>OH. In the murine tumor model, MA@E effectively removed the implanted tumor tissue within 2 days without any obvious toxic effects. This response is attributed to a synergism involving the photothermal capability of AuNRs and ROS chemodynamic treatment. The proposed MA@E provides a new approach to utilizing unstable nanomaterials in effective tumor therapy.

40066679	Advancing Tumor Microenvironment Analysis: A Fluorescence Nanosystem for Caspase-1 Monitoring and Synergistic Therapy.	The lack of precise, real-time analytical tools for monitoring tumor microenvironment changes during treatment hinders advancements in integrated diagnostic and therapeutic platforms. Traditional caspase-3 monitoring strategies are limited by their inability to address drug resistance and newly discovered apoptotic pathways, leading to reduced accuracy and practicality. To overcome these limitations, we developed a fluorescence-based "Trojan horse" nanosystem, PFpR@CM, featuring high-sensitivity Caspase-1 detection, tumor-targeted delivery, and photothermal therapy. Caspase-1 was selected as a biomarker due to its ability to provide accurate feedback on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The system employs Fe-doped polydopamine nanoparticles and red fluorescent carbon quantum dots (RCQDs) as the analytical core, achieving a detection limit of 0.024 U/mL for Caspase-1 with a linear range of 0.05-1.0 U/mL. By integrating MG-63 cell membrane camouflage, PFpR@CM ensures tumor specificity and immune evasion, allowing precise in situ monitoring of ROS production during ferroptosis. Experimental results demonstrate that the system enables simultaneous real-time fluorescence tracking and localized therapeutic interventions, achieving over 80% tumor volume reduction in vivo with minimal systemic toxicity. This work establishes a novel analytical chemistry approach for multifunctional tumor monitoring and treatment, providing an innovative solution to challenges in precision oncology.

40066691	Robust Sensory Traits Across Light Habitats: Visual Signals but Not Receptors Vary in Centrarchids Inhabiting Distinct Photic Environments.	Visual communication in fish is often shaped by their light environment, which influences both sensory (e.g., eye size, opsin gene expression) and signalling traits (e.g., body reflectance). This study explores the phenotypic variation in the visual communication traits of six species of centrarchids (Centrarchidae) inhabiting two contrasting light environments. We measured morphological, molecular and signalling traits to determine their variation across photic conditions. Our findings reveal significant interspecific variation in sensory traits but no consistent phenotypic variation between light environments. Centrarchids showed robust visual systems with green-sensitive rh2 and red-sensitive lws opsin genes representing the main chromatic channels, with their expression remaining largely unaffected between distinct light habitats. We also found significant molecular evolution in the visual opsin genes, although these changes were not associated with environmental conditions. However, body reflectance displayed species-specific responses to environmental conditions, suggesting that signalling traits may be more flexible than sensory traits. Overall, our results challenge the generality of the current paradigm in visual ecology, which portrays visual systems in fish as highly tunable owing to photic conditions. Our study highlights the potential evolutionary or developmental constraints on centrarchid visual systems and their implications for adaptability to various habitats and novel environmental threats.
40066692	Factors influencing vaccine hesitancy among United Kingdom adolescents in a senior high school environment and actions to address it.	We explored adolescent viewpoints on vaccines and hesitancy using an anonymized, validated, self-completed electronic questionnaire amongst state-school Year 12-13 adolescents in London, UK. As the response rate was low (Cohort 1; <i>n</i> = 112/486, 23.0%), we repeated the survey with incoming students (cohort 2, <i>n</i> = 256/275; 93%). A focus group (<i>n</i> = 31) evaluated international HPV campaign posters. Cohort 1 participants were 82.1% female, 13.4% male, and ethnically diverse (32.1% Asian/Asian British, 29.5% Black/Black British, 25.9% White, 7.1% Mixed); Cohort 2 were 80% female, 18% male, with participants identifying as 38% Black/Black British, 34% Asian/Asian British, 15% White, 12% Mixed/Others. Across both cohorts, participants believed childhood vaccinations were safe (Cohort 1 = 95.8%, Cohort 2 = 91%). COVID-19 vaccination uptake was higher in Cohort 1 than 2 (76.8% vs 67%), with fewer participants believing it was adequately tested (56.3% vs 47%). Support for mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for healthcare workers (HCW) was high (Cohort 1:77.8-79% "all" vs "patient-facing HCWs;" Cohort 2 = 62-64%). Similar patterns were observed for mandatory influenza vaccination (Cohort 1: 62.5-66.7%; Cohort 2: 62-63%). Vaccination decisions in Cohort 2 were primarily influenced by parents (96%), healthcare providers (48%), and school friends (36%) (Cohort 1 = 30.2%, 19.6%, and 12%, respectively). Recommendations by doctors, experts and parents (but not politicians) and school-based vaccine availability boosted vaccine confidence. Social media had minimal impact. Most participants received HPV vaccine (Cohort 1 = 83.1%, Cohort 2 = 77.2%). International HPV posters received strong but mixed support; direct design input from the target group is needed to ensure the success of visual vaccine promotions.
40066693	xDev: a mixed-signal, software-defined neurotechnology interface platform for accelerated system development.	<i>Objective.</i>Advances in electronics and materials science have led to the development of sophisticated components for clinical and research neurotechnology systems. However, instrumentation to easily evaluate how these components function in a complete system does not yet exist. In this work, we set out to design and validate a software-defined mixed-signal routing fabric, 'xDev', that enables neurotechnology system designers to rapidly iterate, evaluate, and deploy advanced multi-component systems.<i>Approach.</i>We developed a set of system requirements for xDev, and implemented a design based on a 16 × 16 analog crosspoint multiplexer. We then tested the impedance and switching characteristics of the design, assessed signal gain and crosstalk attenuation across biological and high-speed digital signaling frequencies, and evaluated the ability of xDev to flexibly reroute microvolt-scale amplitude and high-speed signals. Finally, we conducted an intraoperative<i>in vivo</i>deployment of xDev to rapidly conduct neuromodulation experiments using diverse neurotechnology submodules.<i>Main results.</i>The xDev system impedance matching, crosstalk attenuation, and frequency response characteristics accurately transmitted signals over a broad range of frequencies, encapsulating features typical of biosignals and extending into high-speed digital ranges. Microvolt-scale biosignals and 600 Mbps Ethernet connections were accurately routed through the fabric. These performance characteristics culminated in an<i>in vivo</i>demonstration of the flexibility of the system via implanted spinal electrode arrays in an ovine model.<i>Significance.</i>xDev represents a first-of-its-kind, low-cost, software-defined neurotechnology development accelerator platform. Through the public, open-source distribution of our designs, we lower the obstacles facing the development of future neurotechnology systems.

40066695	Privileged natural product compound classes for anti-inflammatory drug development.	Covering: up to early 2025Privileged compound classes of anti-inflammatory natural products are those where there are many reported members that possess anti-inflammatory properties. The identification of these classes is of particular relevance to drug discovery, as they could serve as valuable starting points in developing effective and safe anti-inflammatory agents. The privileged compound classes of natural products include the polyphenols, coumarins, labdane diterpenoids, sesquiterpene lactones, isoquinoline and indole alkaloids, each offering a variety of molecular scaffolds and functional groups that enable diverse interactions with biological targets. From a medicinal chemistry point of view, natural products are both a boon and a bane. The multi-targeting nature of natural products is a boon in the treatment of multi-factorial diseases such as inflammation, but promiscuity, poor potency and pharmacokinetic properties are significant hurdles that must be addressed to ensure these compounds can be effectively used as therapeutics. In addition, there are continued controversies regarding the efficacies of some of these natural products that will continue to polarise their use. In this review, examples of natural products of six privileged compound classes will be discussed for their potential use and possible further development as anti-inflammatory drugs.
