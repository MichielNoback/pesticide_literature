40066601	Unlocking the Gates: A Novel Diagnostic Molecule for Quantifying Efflux Levels in Gram-Positive Bacteria.	Efflux-mediated antibiotic resistance poses a significant global threat, affecting diverse bacterial species. Clinicians recognize the danger of efflux mechanisms during antibiotic treatment, yet precise diagnostic tools remain unavailable. The antibiogram currently infers abnormal efflux pump activity in clinical isolates, which is subsequently confirmed through transcriptomic or genomic analysis. This study harnesses the colorimetric, fluorescence, and solubility properties of phenazinium derivatives to develop a rapid protocol for detecting bacterial efflux. Among several synthesized phenazinium compounds, the compound demonstrating differential MIC in Staphylococcus efflux mutants and exhibiting appropriate physicochemical properties is selected. A diagnostic protocol is developed using the selected compound to assess efflux levels, categorized as no, weak, or strong, through colorimetry and spectroscopy techniques. Testing on Gram-positive efflux mutants and clinical Staphylococcus isolates further validates the approach. In-silico docking analysis confirms the interaction between the chosen compound and the NorA efflux pump in S. aureus. Flow cytometry is employed to re-evaluate the detection assays. The developed molecule and protocol represent the first known method to evaluate efflux levels in any Gram-positive species through a streamlined and user-friendly process. This pioneering test significantly advances the epidemiological analysis of efflux mechanisms and enables more informed therapeutic decision-making, leading to more effective treatment.

40066546	Evaluation of In Vitro Activity of Ceftazidime-Avibactam and Colistin with VITEK 2 AST-XN21.	Ceftazidime-avibactam and colistin are antibiotics of new and regaining importance used for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. The broth microdilution (BMD) test recommended for detecting colistin sensitivity is labor-intensive and difficult to perform under routine conditions. There is a need for alternative methods that produce fast and reliable results in routine laboratory studies. In our study, we aimed to compare the results obtained with the newly introduced Vitek-2 AST-XN21 cards, which allow the detection of ceftazidime-avibactam and colistin sensitivity simultaneously, with the ceftazidime-avibactam disk diffusion and Diagnostics MIC COL results that we use routinely.

40066528	Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Suppresses Mitophagy to Alleviate Muscle Atrophy in Chronic Renal Failure With Protein-Energy Wasting.	Protein-energy wasting (PEW) facilitates major adverse clinical outcomes in chronic renal failure (CRF), with current therapies not suitable for all patients. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) can alleviate chronic kidney disease, with unclear effects and mechanisms on CRF with PEW. The CRF rat model was constructed by adenine administration, and PEW was induced by a 4% casein diet. The serum creatinine (SCR), urinary protein (UPR), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pathology of the gastrocnemius muscle was estimated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of mitophagy-related markers was detected to assess the mitophagy level. Dexamethasone-induced L6 myotubes established myotube atrophy models. The levels of mitophagy-related markers, muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), and atrophy gene 1 (Atrogin1) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. F. prausnitzii suppressed the SCR, UPR, and BUN expression in serum and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy, which were promoted by CRF with PEW. Dexamethasone-induced expression of MuRF1 and Atrogin1 in L6 myotubes was decreased by F. prausnitzii. Additionally, F. prausnitzii repressed mitophagy in the gastrocnemius muscle and L6 myotubes. In conclusion, F. prausnitzii suppressed renal failure progression and muscle atrophy by inhibiting mitophagy in CRF with PEW.

40066463	The influence of genetic polymorphisms on cytokine profiles in pediatric COVID-19: a pilot study.	Recent studies have underscored the importance of genetic factors in predicting COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. While cytokine storms are crucial in disease severity, genetic predisposition significantly influences immune responses. Our study examined genes related to SARS-CoV-2 invasion <i>(ACE2 rs2074192</i>) and interferon-induced immunity (<i>IFNAR2 rs2236757, TYK2 rs2304256, OAS1 rs10774671, OAS3 rs10735079</i>). Additionally, we investigated genes linked to Kawasaki disease (<i>CD40 rs4813003, FCGR2A rs1801274, CASP3 rs113420705</i>) that play roles in immunogenesis.
40066462	Exploring the plant growth promoting attributes of pteridophyte-associated microbiome for agricultural sustainability.	Pteridophytes, encompassing ferns and fern allies, are integral components of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. These vascular plants characterized by their spore-based reproduction, fulfil various ecological roles such as influencing biodiversity, soil stability, nutrient dynamics, and ecological succession. Similar to higher plants, pteridophytes too are known to have close symbiotic associations with a diverse array of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. Exploring the microbial diversity in pteridophytes has prospects both in pure and applied research. Research on pteridophyte microbial communities have revealed their role in plant growth promotion, nutrient acquisition and tolerance against stresses. Besides, it would be interesting to unravel the microbial diversity associated with pteridophytes, which are the first vascular plants. Further, study of pteridophytes-associated microbes would also help in conservation programmes of these rare and endangered group of plants. In spite of the immense potential of pteridophyte microbiome, only few studies have been undertaken in this area, thereby creating a huge research gap. Hence, this review compiles pteridophyte microbiome research, and explores its prospects in agricultural sustainability. Our literature survey sheds light on the tremendous potential of pteridophyte-associated microbes as plant growth promoters and biocontrol agents for sustainable agriculture, which is highly relevant in the era of climate change.
40066448	BLIMP-1-dependent differentiation of T follicular helper cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory type 1 cells.	T-regulatory-type-1 (TR1) cells are a subset of interleukin-10-producing but Foxp3<sup>-</sup> Treg cells that arise in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. We have shown that systemic delivery of autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NP) triggers the formation of large pools of disease-suppressing Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells from cognate T-follicular helper (TFH) cell precursors. Here we show that, upon treatment withdrawal, these Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells spontaneously differentiate into a novel immunoregulatory Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subset that inherits epigenetic and transcriptional hallmarks of their precursors, including clonotypic T-cell receptors, and is distinct from other Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg subsets. Whereas the transcription factor BLIMP-1 is dispensable for development of conventional Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, it is necessary for development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 cells. In a model of central nervous system autoimmunity, abrogation of BLIMP-1 or IL-10 expression in the Foxp3<sup>-</sup> and/or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subsets inhibits their development or anti-encephalitogenic activity. Thus, the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway results in the generation of two distinct autoimmune disease-suppressing, IL-10-producing TR1 subsets that are distinguished by the expression of Foxp3 and Foxp3 target genes.

A statistically significant difference was seen between the disease severity and outcome. <b>"Arora-Nagarkar Prognostic Classification for Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis</b> <sup>©</sup> <b>"</b> a novel staging system was developed with a focus on long-term patient outcomes. ANPCRM tapers patients' expectations and provides an ordinal measure of treatment outcome. It allows triaging of patients and better allocation of resources based on the final outcome which is the chances of survival of the patients.
40066382	To Study the Incidence of Biofilm Formation, its Microbiology and its Effect on the Development of Acute and Chronic Rhinosinusitis- A Prospective Study.	Bacterial biofilms are organised complex structures having polymicrobial nature in a single community, which provide protection to bacteria from antibiotics by various means. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of biofilm-forming bacteria in clinical isolates of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis (ARS and CRS) patients with sinonasal mucopurulence. To know the incidence of bacterial biofilms in patient with ARS and CRS, to study the microbiology of bacterial biofilms in ARS and CRS, to assess the role and effects of biofilm in ARS and CRS and to correlate the association between the formation of the biofilm and development of rhinosinusitis. This prospective study was carried out at a tertiary care centre in Eastern part of India, in which 60 patients were taken as sample size. All patients of rhinosinusitis between age-group of 10 to70 years, who came to our out-patient department, were taken for our study. Biofilm formation was observed in 50% cases and were absent in 50% cases of chronic rhinosinusitis in our study. 83.3% (50) of patients out of 60 patients got improved after treatment and recurrence was observed in only 16.6% (10) of patients. Recurrence was more at 3 months follow-up as compared to follow-up at 1 month, though it was not statistically significant. Though our study highlighted the incidence and role of biofilms in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis, but few more randomized controlled studies involving larger sample sizes should be done to exactly determine the pathophysiological role of biofilms in the development and recurrence of acute and chronic rhinosinusuitis.
40066376	Novel approaches on root canal disinfection methods against <i>E. faecalis</i>.	Enterococcus faecalis (<i>E. faecalis</i>), the main pathogenic bacterium of root canal infection, can penetrate deep into the dentin tubule, form a biofilm, and resist host defense mechanisms, thereby increasing treatment complexity. Therefore, the key to the treatment of root canal infections is to completely kill the bacteria and prevent secondary infection. This review assesses advancements in traditional and novel disinfection methods targeting <i>E. faecalis</i> biofilm.
40066367	Expanding the Ingredient Basket in Aquaculture: Growth Performance and Feed Utilization of Australian Hybrid Abalone (<i>Haliotis laevigata × H. rubra</i>) Fed Methanotrophic Single Cell Protein.	There is growing interest in the use of single cell proteins (SCPs) derived from methanotrophic bacteria for inclusion in aquafeed to reduce reliance on other, potentially less sustainable proteins. This two-part experiment aimed to investigate first (i) the dose effect of replacing soy protein concentrate with SCP in Australian hybrid abalone diets (<i>Haliotis laevigata Haliotis rubra</i>) and second, (ii) the potential for improved palatability of the SCP by using commercially produced liquid protein hydrolysate (PH). This was assessed in a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design. The diets were formulated to be iso-proteic (~40% crude protein as fed) and iso-energetic (~18 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup> as fed). The diets (SCP 0%, SCP 5%, SCP 10%, SCP 20%, SCP 0% + PH, and SCP 20% + PH) were fed to the abalone (~9.25 g initial weight) once daily in the evening for 94 days to apparent satiation. The growth performance and feed utilization of abalone fed with up to 10% SCP was comparable to the control; however, there was a significant reduction in most parameters at the highest inclusion of 20%. In the second experiment, there was a decline in measured protein and energy retention in the abalone fed 20% SCP, with a concomitantly lower apparent biological value. Positively, there were significant improvements in the apparent digestibility of the diet at the 20% SCP inclusion. There was no significant impact of using the PH on growth performance or feed intake. No effects were observed on the digestive enzyme activity (<i>α</i>-amylase, lipase, and trypsin) examined among the treatments. Considering these results collectively, the maximum recommended inclusion of methanotrophic SCP meal should be 10% for hybrid abalone. Reasons for the decline in performance at the highest inclusion may be related to palatability; however, this remains to be fully confirmed.
40066363	Metabolic pathways to sustainability: review of purple non-sulfur bacteria potential in agri-food waste valorization.	Agri-food waste (AFW) represents a significant fraction of the material generated by the agri-food industry, which itself accounts for almost one-third of the annual global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Considering the growing global population and the consequent rise in food demand, the management and valorization of this waste are essential to ensure the sustainability of the entire food chain for future generations. Recycling agri-food waste offers a promising strategy to mitigate the sector's environmental impact, particularly when the waste consists of food-grade materials that enhance its intrinsic value. Retaining such products within the agri-food chain by converting them into feed or food, a process referred to as "waste upcycling," is therefore of critical importance. Purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) are emerging as promising candidates for AFW upcycling due to their remarkable metabolic versatility, which allows them to metabolize a wide range of organic substrates, including carbohydrates, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and alcohols, into valuable microbial biomass. This biomass is notably rich in superior quality proteins, vitamins, pigments, and other high-value compounds. The phototrophic metabolism of PNSB is particularly advantageous for organic matter valorization, as the carbon conversion yield approaches unity by utilizing light as an energy source. This review explores the potential of PNSB in upcycling AFW streams derived from various sources, such as fruit and vegetable residues, as well as effluents from the dairy, brewery, and sugar industries. The pre-treatment methods required to optimize substrate availability are also discussed. Furthermore, we examine the metabolic pathways utilized by PNSB under phototrophic conditions to assimilate the most common carbon substrates found in AFW, highlighting critical gaps in our understanding of their metabolism. Additionally, challenges and opportunities in AFW valorization, with a focus on PNSB applications, are identified. This review underscores recent advancements and ongoing challenges, emphasizing the potential role of PNSB in driving sustainable circular bioeconomy applications for AFW.

40066274	Addressing the global challenge of bacterial drug resistance: insights, strategies, and future directions.	The COVID-19 pandemic underscored bacterial resistance as a critical global health issue, exacerbated by the increased use of antibiotics during the crisis. Notwithstanding the pandemic's prevalence, initiatives to address bacterial medication resistance have been inadequate. Although an overall drop in worldwide antibiotic consumption, total usage remains substantial, requiring rigorous regulatory measures and preventive activities to mitigate the emergence of resistance. Although National Action Plans (NAPs) have been implemented worldwide, significant disparities persist, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Settings such as farms, hospitals, wastewater treatment facilities, and agricultural environments include a significant presence of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG), promoting the propagation of resistance. Dietary modifications and probiotic supplementation have shown potential in reshaping gut microbiota and reducing antibiotic resistance gene prevalence. Combining antibiotics with adjuvants or bacteriophages may enhance treatment efficacy and mitigate resistance development. Novel therapeutic approaches, such as tailored antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and nanoparticles, offer alternate ways of addressing resistance. In spite of advancements in next-generation sequencing and analytics, gaps persist in comprehending the role of gut microbiota in regulating antibiotic resistance. Effectively tackling antibiotic resistance requires robust policy interventions and regulatory measures targeting root causes while minimizing public health risks. This review provides information for developing strategies and protocols to prevent bacterial colonization, enhance gut microbiome resilience, and mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance.
40066272	The landscape of biofilm models for phage therapy: mimicking biofilms in diabetic foot ulcers using 3D models.	Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) affect up to 15-25% of patients suffering from diabetes and are considered a global health concern. These ulcers may result in delayed wound healing and chronic infections, with the potential to lead to amputations. It has been estimated that 85% of diabetes-related amputations are preceded by a diagnosis of DFU. A critical factor in the persistence of this disease is the presence of polymicrobial biofilms, which generally include <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The involvement of diabetic comorbidities such as ischemia, hyperglycemia, and immune-compromised status creates a perfect niche for these bacteria to evade the body's immune response and persist as biofilms. Bacteriophage therapy can target and lyse specific bacteria and is emerging as an effective treatment for biofilm-related infections. While this treatment shows promise in addressing chronic wounds, our current models, including animal and static systems, fail to capture the full complexity of DFU. Innovative approaches such as 3D bioengineered skin models, organoid models, and hydrogel-based systems are being developed to simulate DFU microenvironments more accurately in 3D without using <i>ex vivo</i> or animal tissues. These advanced models are critical for evaluating bacteriophage efficacy in biofilm-associated DFU, aiming to enhance preclinical assessments and improve therapeutic outcomes for DFU patients.

40066265	Biodegradation of polyhydroxyalkanoates: current state and future prospects.	Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biobased and biodegradable polymers that offer a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics, addressing the escalating concerns over plastic pollution. While their environmental advantages are well-documented, the efficient degradation of PHAs in natural and engineered environments remains a critical component of their lifecycle. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PHA-degrading bacteria isolated from diverse ecosystems and highlights the pivotal role of PHA depolymerases in achieving PHA circularity. Microbial adaptation to diverse environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, salinity, and pH, significantly influences enzymes properties, including the stability, activity, and substrate specificity of PHA-degrading enzymes. These adaptations often enhance enzyme, performance, enabling functionality under challenging conditions. Consequently, extremophilic microorganisms are invaluable resources for discovering and engineering robust PHA depolymerases for industrial and environmental applications. This review underscores the urgent need for further research to improve the ecological and economic sustainability of PHA waste management.
40066228	<i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> Promotes the Growth and Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer by Activating E-Cadherin/Krüppel-Like Factor 4/Integrin α5 Signaling in a Calcium-Dependent Manner.	Gut microbiota and integrins are known to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether they interact has been unclear. Here, we provided evidence that <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> upregulated integrin α5 (ITGA5) in CRC in both human patients and murine models. Knocking down <i>ITGA5</i> in CRC cells weakened the ability of <i>F. nucleatum</i> to stimulate their malignant characteristics. <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which in turn promoted interaction between E-cadherin and Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), resulting in KLF4 phosphorylation and translocation in the nucleus, where it induced <i>ITGA5</i> transcription and activated the downstream signaling. Knocking down E-cadherin or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> with BAPTA-AM antagonized the impact of <i>F. nucleatum</i> on KLF4, whereas knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> antagonized the bacteria's oncogenic role. Knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or <i>ITGA5</i> attenuated <i>F. nucleatum-</i>induced growth of patient-derived organoids, subcutaneous xenografts, and orthotopic tumors, as well as liver metastasis in nude mice. Integrin α5 antibody antagonized the oncogenic role of <i>F. nucleatum</i> in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that <i>F. nucleatum</i> promotes the growth and metastasis of CRC by activating E-cadherin/KLF4/integrin α5 signaling in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner.
40066197	Equine neutrophils selectively release neutrophil extracellular traps in response to chemical and bacterial agonists.	Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a significant role in response to a variety of infectious and inflammatory stimuli in human and veterinary medicine. Although entrapment of bacteria can be an important function of NETs, the exuberant release of DNA and other intracellular molecules has also been negatively implicated in the pathogenesis of different diseases. Thus, NET formation must be tightly controlled and represents an opportunity for therapeutic interventions. Horses are particularly sensitive to bacterial stimuli that have previously been shown to cause NETs in other species, but the species-specific processes that control NET release have not been fully elucidated.

40066151	Warming stimulates cellulose decomposition by recruiting phylogenetically diverse but functionally similar microorganisms.	Cellulose is the most abundant component of plant litter, which is critical for terrestrial carbon cycling. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how global warming affects cellulose-decomposing microorganisms. Here, we carried out a 3-year litterbag experiment to examine cellulose decomposition undergoing +3°C warming in a tallgrass prairie. Most cellulose-associated bacteria and fungi in litterbags were also detected in bulk soil, and bacteria in litterbags had higher community-level <i>rrn</i> copy numbers, larger genome sizes, and higher genome guanine-cytosine (GC) contents than those in bulk soil, implying higher growth rates. Warming stimulated soil respiration by 32.3% and accelerated mass loss of cellulose, concurring with the increase in relative abundances of most functional genes associated with carbon decomposition in litterbags. Incorporating cellulose-decomposing genes into an ecosystem model reduced model parameter uncertainty and showed that warming stimulated microbial biomass, activity, and soil carbon decomposition. Collectively, our study supports a trait-centric view since cellulose-decomposing genes or genomic traits are amenable for ecosystem modeling. By characterizing the phylogenetically diverse yet functionally similar cellulose-associated microorganisms and their responses to warming, we take a step toward more precise predictions of soil carbon dynamics under future climate scenarios.

40066103	Effect of Fermentation Time on the Physicochemical Properties and Phenolic Composition of Malted Finger Millet Beverages.	Food security is still a significant problem, particularly in less developed nations. Orphan crops, such as finger millet (FM), are essential for meeting dietary and nutritional needs as well as providing a means of livelihood for economies with limited resources in Asia and Africa. Comparing two varieties of FM malt beverages using sorghum grain as an external reference, the research examined the impact of fermentation time on the physicochemical characteristics and phenolic composition of the FM malt beverages. The FM grains were fermented using <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i> and the grain microflora. The beverages' pH decreased in a time-dependent manner throughout fermentation, and their sugar content increased accordingly. A reduction in the beverages' viscosities for both <i>L. fermentum</i> and the grain microflora was observed. The amount of citric acid in the beverages decreased as fermentation progressed, especially for <i>L. fermentum</i>. Catechin, epicatechin, and protocatechuic acid were the phenolics identified in the FM beverages. An increase in fermentation time was correlated with a decrease in the beverages' total phenolic content. At 96 h of fermentation, the beverages' DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP radical scavenging activities were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) reduced for both <i>L. fermentum</i> and the grain microflora. The 24-h fermented beverages maintained higher amounts of total polyphenols and antioxidant effects. The findings indicate that FM may be utilized as a functional grain to produce nonalcoholic beverages with health benefits.
40066098	An overview of the current evidences on the role of iron in colorectal cancer: a review.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and lethal malignancy that affects millions of people worldwide.

HIV-1 protease (PR)-reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors as national free antiretroviral drugs have been used for 20 years. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been conditionally used as a component of HIV/AIDS treatment regimens in recent years. However, the systematic investigation on the changes in primary drug resistance (PDR) in Hebei province, China was limited.
40066068	A critical review of microbiome-derived metabolic functions and translational research in liver diseases.	Significant changes in gut microbial composition are associated with chronic liver disease. Using preclinical models, it has been demonstrated that ethanol/alcohol-induced liver disease is transmissible through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). So, the survival rate of people with severe alcoholic hepatitis got better, which suggests that changes in the makeup and function of gut microbiota play a role in metabolic liver disease. The leaky intestinal barrier plays a major role in influencing metabolic-related liver disease development through the gut microbiota. As a result, viable bacteria and microbial products can be transported to the liver, causing inflammation, contributing to hepatocyte death, and causing the fibrotic response. As metabolic-related liver disease starts and gets worse, gut dysbiosis is linked to changes in the immune system, the bile acid composition, and the metabolic function of the microbiota in the gut. Metabolic-related liver disease, as well as its self-perpetuation, will be demonstrated using data from preclinical and human studies. Further, we summarize how untargeted treatment approaches affect the gut microbiota in metabolic-related liver disease, including dietary changes, probiotics, antibiotics, and FMT. It discusses how targeted therapies can improve liver disease in various areas. These approaches may improve metabolic-related liver disease treatment options.
40066067	Antivirotics based on defective interfering particles: emerging concepts and challenges.	Viruses are obligate parasites, that use the host's internal metabolic systems for their own reproduction. This complicates the search for molecular targets to prevent the spread of viral infection without disrupting the vital functions of human cells. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are natural competitors of viruses for important resources of viral reproduction. DIPs emerge during infection, originate from the normal viral replication process and inhibit its progression, making them an interesting candidate for antiviral therapy. Here we describe the biology of DIPs, advances in DIP-based antiviral technology, analyze their therapeutic potential and provide a systemic overview of existing preventive and therapeutic antiviral strategies.
40066066	Differential effects of high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota.	Microorganisms contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity, while more studies focus on gut microbiome. However, the relationship between oral microbiota and obesity has yet to be elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the similarities and differences in the effects of a high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota through mouse experiments, exploring the hypothesis that oral microbial mechanisms may contribute to obesity.
40066064	Revisiting the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> druggable genome using predicted structures and data mining.	Identification of novel drug targets is a key component of modern drug discovery. While antimalarial targets are often identified through the mechanism of action studies on phenotypically derived inhibitors, this method tends to be time- and resource-consuming. The discoverable target space is also constrained by existing compound libraries and phenotypic assay conditions. Leveraging recent advances in protein structure prediction, we systematically assessed the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> genome and identified 867 candidate protein targets with evidence of small-molecule binding and blood-stage essentiality. Of these, 540 proteins showed strong essentiality evidence and lack inhibitors that have progressed to clinical trials. Expert review and rubric-based scoring of this subset based on additional criteria such as selectivity, structural information, and assay developability yielded 27 high-priority antimalarial target candidates. This study also provides a genome-wide data resource for <i>P. falciparum</i> and implements a generalizable framework for systematically evaluating and prioritizing novel pathogenic disease targets.

40066035	Pharmaceutical applications of halophilic enzymes.	Halophiles produce extraordinarily stable enzymes under conditions where conventional enzymes cease to function, denature, and precipitate. Halophilic enzymes have adapted to function optimally at high salt concentrations besides tolerance of organic solvents and thermal stability. These special features offer potential advantages of cost-effectiveness and improved treatment outcomes that make them valuable for pharmaceutical purposes including the synthesis, design, and discovery of new drugs. The article highlights the unique characteristics and adaptation strategies of halophiles towards salinity. It provides an overview of halophilic enzymes' pharmaceutical applications and examines different challenges, opportunities, and recent advances in applying these enzymes in this field.
40066021	Anaerobic digestion of whey permeate: Impact of feedstock ratio and organic loading rate in batch and semi-continuous systems.	Anaerobic digestion (AD) plants have been facing significant challenges in maintaining a stable long-time operation when utilizing whey permeate as feedstock. In this study, we investigated the AD performance of whey permeate under batch and semi-continuous stirred tank reactor (s-CSTR) systems to optimize the process. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were initially performed in batch reactors to assess whey permeate potential as AD substrate operating at different inoculum to substrate ratios (ISRs) and pH values under mesophilic temperatures. The kinetic parameters from the best AD performance under batch system were assessed to be used as guideline for s-CSTR operational set ups. The highest methane yield of 653.64 ± 12.16 NL<sub>CH4</sub>kg<sub>VS</sub> <sup>-1</sup> was observed at ISR 2, initial pH 7.5 at 37 °C incubation under batch system. However, when the kinetic parameters from this condition were applied to determine the organic loading rate (OLR) and hydraulic retention times (HRT) in the s-CSTRs, resulted in operational failure. The s-CSTRs were then operated at OLR 2.5 and 4 g<sub>VS</sub>L<sup>-1</sup>d<sup>-1</sup> with 30 d HRT for 150 d to assess the effect of different feeding regimes towards the overall AD performance. The CH<sub>4</sub> production rate declined for 3 HRTs in all reactors before stabilizing for the rest of the experiment. The decline of CH<sub>4</sub> rate was observed to be correlated with volatile solids degradation, volatile fatty acids and microbial composition. Initially, acetogenic bacteria (e.g., <i>Trichococcus</i> and <i>Sedimentibacter</i>) dominated the digestate which shifted to propionic acid producing bacteria (e.g., <i>Actinomyces</i> and <i>Acidipropionibacterium</i>) over the course of 150 d. A change in archaeal abundance was also observed where abundant <i>Methanosarcina</i> declined and finally substituted by <i>Methanobacterium</i>. The change in microbial population of whey permeate AD under s-CSTR system in our study, suggests a shift in methanogenesis pathway, which directly affects the AD performance.
40065975	Sialadenoma Papilliferum: An Uncommon Verruco-Papillary Lesion of the Oral Cavity.	Sialadenoma papilliferum (SP) is a rare benign neoplasm, commonly affecting the minor salivary glands of the palate. Here we report a case SP, clinically presenting as a verruco-papillary lesion, which was diagnosed based on its characteristic histopathologic features, along with a brief review of literature.
40065962	Peripheral Odontogenic Myxoma in Anterior Maxilla: A Case Report.	Peripheral odontogenic myxoma (POM), a rare and extra-osseous variant of odontogenic myxoma (OM), is classified as a relatively rare benign odontogenic tumour, yet presenting with locally aggressive behaviour and a wide range of variable clinical presentations. The objective of this case report is to present a patient who reported with the complaint of pus discharge in upper front region of the jaw, in the past one month. No associated history of tooth loss, impacted teeth or intracanal infection was noted clinically as well as radiographically. The lesion was completely excised and was sent for histopathological examination, which was diagnosed to be POM. Thereby, such cases reported in the clinics or the tertiary care hospitals should not come as a surprise as they are encountered commonly and should be diagnosed to be of apt quality.
40065940	A Case of Saddle Nose Deformity Secondary to Lepromatous Leprosy.	Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium leprae affecting most commonly skin and peripheral nerves. Patients with Lepromatous Leprosy remain asymptomatic for years, and harbor bacteria in the nasal cavity, and these patients are responsible for the transmission of the disease in the community. In the advanced stage (stages 4 and 5) the involvement of nasal septum results in saddle nose deformity in most patients.
40065930	Morphometric Analysis of Pterygomaxillary Fissure in Dry Skulls and its Clinical Significance During Head and Neck Injury.	The divergence of the maxilla from the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone forms the pterygomaxillary fissure, which lies in the medial part of the infratemporal fossa. It transmits the posterior superior alveolar nerve and the terminal segment of the internal maxillary artery and connects the infratemporal fossa with the pterygopalatine fossa. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the height, width and distance of the pterygomaxillary fissure from the zygomatic bone, articular tubercle, and zygomatico-temporal suture. Forty dry human skulls were examined by the Department of Anatomy. Using a digital caliper, the right and left sides of the skulls of both sexes were measured for height, width, and distance from the upper end of the pterygomaxillary fissure to the articular tubercle of the zygomatic arch (AB), zygomaticotemporal suture (AC), and zygomatic body (AD). The average height of the pterygomaxillary fissure was 22.68 mm in males & 22.34 mm in females, the width was 7.33 mm in males & 7.22 mm in females, distance from the articular tubercle (AB) was 33.37 mm in males & 31.79 mm in female, zygomatic temporal suture (AC) was 36.91 mm in male & 34.89 mm in female, zygomatic bone (AD) was 29.88 mm in male &28.44 mm in female. There is no statistically significant difference between the right and left sides of the skulls of both genders. Because fissures smaller than 2 mm may prevent neurostimulator implants from being inserted into the pterygopalatine fossa, this study attempted to determine the location of the pterygomaxillary fissure using the three anatomical markers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when performing maxillofacial procedures on female patients.
40065834	Raising the bar in respiratory care by EUFOREA: report of the European Union Parliament Symposium, April 2024.	In April 2024, the European Summit "<i>Raising the bar in respiratory care"</i> was organized by the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) in the European Parliament and hosted by Members of the European Parliament Dorien Rookmaker and Mislav Kolakušić. The aim of the Summit was to respond to the need of European patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) by joining forces with European and global organisations in the management of the epidemics of CRD, recognising the weaknesses of current care models and focussing on collaboration to improve care and prevention. Participants belonging to International and National Societies and Committees from the European Rhinologic Society (ERS), International Rhinologic Society (IRS), Belgian Respiratory Society (BeRS), Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD), and from the European Federation of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients Associations (EFA) and the EUFOREA's Patient Advisory Board (PAB) described their vision and action plan to work in partnership to raise the bar in respiratory care. This report summarizes the contributions of the representatives of different European stakeholders in the field of CRDs.
40065807	Comparison of naturalization mouse model setups uncover distinct effects on intestinal mucosa depending on microbial experience.	Concerns regarding the translational value of preclinical mouse models have been addressed by introducing various approaches of 'naturalizing' research mice, which provide them with more diverse microbiomes and physiological immune responses. We have previously shown that 'feralized' mice, that is, inbred laboratory mice raised in a farmyard-like, microbe-rich environment exhibit a shifted gut microbiota, matured immunophenotype, and reduced severity of colorectal cancer. Similar studies occasionally involve co-housing with wild or pet-store-raised mice as microbial donors integrating species-specific commensals and pathogens. To what extent these different practices of microbial exposure are crucial for the resulting mouse phenotype remains unclear.

40065750	Dendritic polyglutamic acid-chelerythrine nanocomplex for the reversal of bacterial tooth decay.	Caries begin with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralization due to the continuous acid production by cariogenic bacteria. However, the development of dental materials that could prevent and treat caries <i>via</i> a simple and efficient mechanism has always been a challenge. To address this issue, therapeutic nanoparticles composed of a dendritic polyglutamic acid (DPGlu) and chelerythrine (CHE) complex (DPGlu@CHE) were developed <i>via</i> hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. DPGlu@CHE could be adsorbed onto the tooth surface, releasing CHE rapidly under acidic conditions to remove cariogenic bacteria, subsequently inducing tooth surface remineralization <i>in situ</i>. Our results demonstrated that more than 99% of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> on the tooth surface were killed, and 84% of the mechanical properties of tooth were restored within 2 weeks. Thus, DPGlu@CHE was proven to be a safe and effective enamel restoration material <i>in vitro</i>, and its safety was verified <i>in vivo</i>, making it a promising mouthwash ingredient to maintain dental health.
40065734	Isolation, phytochemical characterization, and inhibitory potential of essential oil from Citrus hystrix  DC. fruit peels against foodborne and phytopathogenic microbes.	Plant-based essential oils are currently targeted sources because of their non-toxic, bioactivity, and safety of non-targeted organisms. Various volatile components such as terpenoids, phenolics, and alkaloids make it compatible with broad-spectrum applications. In the current study, essential oil from Citrus hystrix DC. fruit peels were isolated. The GCMS analysis of the essential oil has confirmed the presence of various volatile components, in which 3-propylphenol has a maximum peak area percentage of 50.28%. The functional determination through FTIR detected the presence of aldehydic C-H and aldehydic carbonyl C=O group. Antioxidant capability also exhibited 55.61% DPPH scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 84.46 µg/ml. The antibacterial property analysis of essential oil against food spoilage-related bacteria through agar well diffusion methods reveals more effectiveness against gram-positive bacteria with 25 µg/ml MIC values. The antifungal activity analysis of essential oil against phytopathogenic fungi through agar dilution methods shows efficacy in controlling Fusarium oxysporum with the inhibitive percentage of 79.15% at the concentration of 250 µg/ml and Penicillium choerospondiatis with an inhibition percentage of 100% at the concentration of 250 µg/ml. This essential oil exhibits high potency for controlling food-spoilage-related bacteria and can be quite effective for controlling postharvest mold infection caused by phytopathogens.
40065658	Advantages of Mutant Generation by Genome Rearrangements of Non-Conventional Yeast via Direct Nuclease Transfection.	We previously developed a genome engineering method (TAQing2.0) based on the direct delivery of DNA endonucleases into living cells, which induces genome rearrangements even in non-sporulating nonconventional yeasts without introducing foreign DNA. Using TAQing2.0 and conventional mutagenesis (by nitrosoguanidine), we obtained mutant asexual Candida utilis strains capable of growing under highly acidic conditions (pH 1.8). Whole genome resequencing revealed that the genomic sequences of mutants generated by both methods contain a negligible small population of unmappable sequences, suggesting that both types of mutants can be regarded as equivalent to naturally occurring mutants. TAQing2.0 mutants exhibit multiple genome rearrangements with few point mutations, whereas conventional mutagenesis produces numerous point mutations. This feature enabled us to easily identify candidate genes (e.g., LYP1 homolog) responsible for acid resistance. TAQing2.0 is a powerful and versatile tool for mutant production and gene hunting without invasion of foreign DNA.
40065631	Genome Mining and Antagonism of Stenotrophomonas geniculata MK-1, Against Peanut Foliage Fungus Diseases.	Stenotrophomonas geniculata, a bacterium, has been recognized as an eco-friendly substitute for chemical fungicides in managing peanut foliar diseases, web blotch, and early leaf spot. Core genome and pan-genome analysis identified that strain MK-1 belongs to Stenotrophomonas geniculata, and nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis confirmed that strain belongs to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The research revealed that S. geniculata MK-1 had a notable antagonistic impact on Peyronellaea arachidicola and Cercospora arachidicola and demonstrated a biocontrol efficacy of over 95% against peanut early leaf spot and web blotch disease. The nonredundant protein sequences (NR) database identified 4324 annotations related to S. geniculata, with 2682 genes similar to strain MK-1. The COG database categorized 3041 annotations into 22 functional groups, and 33 distinct metabolic pathways associated with 1851 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations. Most genes linked with metabolism are found in S. geniculata, with 380 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 44 genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database identified 194 annotations are linked to non-ribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites. The Pathogen-Host Interactions (PHI) database showed reduced virulence in strain MK-1, while unaffected pathogenicity protein counts were 52. The MK-1 strain can produce antifungal siderophores secondary metabolites, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and siderophores.
40065603	Prp16 enables efficient splicing of introns with diverse exonic consensus elements in the short-intron rich <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> transcriptome.	DEAH box splicing helicase Prp16 in budding yeast governs spliceosomal remodelling from the branching conformation (C complex) to the exon ligation conformation (C* complex). In this study, we examined the genome-wide functions of Prp16 in the short intron-rich genome of the basidiomycete yeast <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>. The presence of multiple introns per transcript with intronic features that are more similar to those of higher eukaryotes makes it a promising model for studying spliceosomal splicing. Using a promoter-shutdown conditional Prp16 knockdown strain, we uncovered genome-wide but substrate-specific roles in <i>C. neoformans</i> splicing. The splicing functions of Prp16 are dependent on helicase motifs I and II, which are conserved motifs for helicase activity. A small subset of introns spliced independent of Prp16 activity was investigated to discover that exonic sequences at the 5' splice site (5'SS) and 3' splice site (3'SS) with stronger affinity for U5 loop 1 are a common feature in these introns. Furthermore, short (60-100nts) and ultrashort introns (<60nts) prevalent in the <i>C. neoformans</i> transcriptome were more sensitive to Prp16 knockdown than longer introns, indicating that Prp16 is required for the efficient splicing of short and ultrashort introns. We propose that stronger U5 snRNA-pre-mRNA interactions enable efficient transition of the spliceosome from the first to the second catalytic confirmation in Prp16 knockdown, particularly for short introns and introns with suboptimal features. This study provides insights into fine-tuning spliceosomal helicase function with variations in <i>cis-</i>element features.
40065596	Abundance, Identity, and Potential Diazotrophic Activity of nifH-Containing Organisms at Marine Cold Seeps.	Diazotrophic microorganisms alleviate nitrogen limitation at marine cold seeps using nitrogenase, encoded in part by the gene nifH. Here, we investigated nifH-containing organisms (NCOs) inside and outside six biogeochemically heterogeneous seeps using amplicon sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of nifH genes and transcripts. We detected nifH genes affiliated with phylogenetically and metabolically diverse organisms spanning 18 bacterial and archaeal phyla (17 within seeps). Detected NCOs included methane-oxidising ANME-2 archaea and sulfate-reducing Desulfobacteraceae, which have been shown to fix nitrogen at seeps previously, as well as Desulfuromonadales and putatively hydrocarbon-oxidising Desulfoglaeba and Candidatus Methanoliparia. We detected nifH transcripts at five of the six seeps, suggesting widespread diazotrophic activity. We corrected our qPCR data based on our amplicon results, which found that 71% of recovered sequences were not bona fide nifH, and we recommend a similar correction in future qPCR studies that use broad nifH primers. NifH abundance was up to three orders of magnitude higher within seeps, was correlated with mcrA abundance, and, when corrected, was negatively correlated with porewater ammonium < 25 μM, consistent with the inhibition of diazotrophy by ammonium. Our findings expand the known diversity of NCOs at seeps and emphasise seeps as hotspots for deep-sea diazotrophy.

40065520	Phylogenetic Study of Local Patterns Influenza A(H3N2) Virus Transmission in a Semi-Isolated Population in a Remote Island in Japan Between 2011 and 2013.	Influenza A outbreak risk is impacted by the potential for importation and local transmission. Reconstructing transmission history with phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences can help assess outbreak risk but relies on regular collection of genetic sequences. Few influenza genetic sequences are collected in Japan, which makes phylogenetic analysis challenging, especially in rural, remote settings. We generated influenza A genetic sequences from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) samples collected using rapid influenza diagnostic tests and used them to analyze the transmission dynamics of influenza in a remote island in Japan.
40065518	New-Onset, But Not Chronic Atrial Fibrillation, Is a Significant Factor Contributing to Mortality Among Patients with Severe COVID-19.	BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia in the general population and the most frequently presented arrhythmia in the intensive care unit. We investigated the effects of AF on the outcomes of critical COVID-19 patients, especially focusing on differences between chronic (CAF) and new-onset AF (NOAF) during critical disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this case-control study, we investigated the association of CAF and NOAF as an exposure, with in-hospital mortality as an outcome. We identified 2 patient groups, NOAF and CAF, which were compared with controls (all other hospitalized patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia). No specific selection or matching was performed. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables; t test and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for continuous variables, depending on distribution. P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the NOAF group, while in the CAF group, it was similar to that of the control group. The NOAF group had significantly higher markers of inflammation and more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), measured with computed tomography. NOAF was strongly associated with in-hospital death, with OR 6.392 (95% CI, 2.758-14.815), P<0.000. In comparison, the CAF group was older and had more cardiovascular comorbidities, with similar markers of inflammation and severity of ARDS as the control group. CONCLUSIONS NOAF in COVID-19 was linked with significant risk of death, being a sign of extreme cardiac, pulmonary, and metabolic instability. NOAF should be considered as an important marker of instability and predictor of poor outcomes among patients with COVID-19.

40065488	Exploring the Exclusive Isolation of Pseudomonas syringae in Peltigera Lichens via Metabolite Analysis and Growth Assays.	The specific association of the potentially plant-pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae with Peltigera lichens raises questions about the factors driving this host specificity. To explore this, the metabolic profile of seven lichen species belonging to three genera (Cladonia, Peltigera and Stereocaulon) was analysed using LC-MSMS. In addition, we assessed the growth of P. syringae strains in media supplemented with extracts from each lichen species. This revealed that Peltigera exhibits lower metabolite richness compared to other genera, but shows a higher chemical investment in specific compounds. Growth kinetics showed comparable P. syringae growth across lichen-supplemented media, except for Cladonia arbuscula and Cladonia sp., where the former exhibited lower growth rates. Inhibition assays with lichen extracts showed no inhibition of P. syringae. The lichen metabolome is predominantly composed of lipids and organic acids. Furthermore, specific compounds, such as aminoglycosides, may facilitate P. syringae presence in Peltigera by inhibiting Bacillus subtilis and other antagonists. In addition, compounds absent in Peltigera, like anthracene, might serve as a carbon source inhibitor like Bacillus velezensis.

40065479	Wolbachia bacteria in Mansonella perstans isolates from patients infected in different geographical areas: a pilot study from the ESCMID Study Group for Clinical Parasitology.	Mansonella perstans is a vector-borne filarial parasite widely endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, with sporadic cases in Latin America. Infection is often overlooked; treatment is not standardized, and effectiveness of common regimes is difficult to ascertain. Anti-Wolbachia macrofilaricidal treatment with doxycycline has been applied, but there are scant and contrasting reports about the presence of Wolbachia in M. perstans isolates from different geographical locations. Taking advantage of a network of European centres expert in traveller and migrant health, we aimed to expand the knowledge concerning the distribution of Wolbachia in M. perstans to contribute to the design of optimal treatment approaches.

40065431	New Insight Into the Mechanism of Nitrite Enhancement on Heterotrophic Nitrification and Aerobic Denitrification Bacterium in Gene Expression.	The growth and nitrogen metabolism of heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification (HN-AD) bacteria are affected by nitrite, but the mechanisms underlying this for strain Acinetobacter johnsonii EN-J1 are unclear. In this study, the addition of 10 mg/L nitrite increased the reduction rate of ammonium by 1.0 mg/L/h, and 20 mg/L nitrite increased the reduction rate of nitrate by 3.9 mg/L/h. Compared with the control, the nitrate reductase activity, electron transfer activity, and adenosine triphosphate content of EN-J1 were enhanced by 142.0%, 278.0% and 279.0%, respectively, in the nitrate removal process after the addition of 20 mg/L nitrite. The whole genome was annotated with nitrogen removal genes such as narGHI, narK, nsrR, nirBD, nasA, glnA, gltB, gdhA and amt. Transcriptome analysis showed that nitrite triggered significant upregulation of several key pathways, including nitrogen metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism for enhancing denitrification. The expression of key denitrification genes (narG, narK, hmp, nirBD, glnA and nasA) was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. These results suggested that nitrite enhances denitrification by increasing the expression of denitrification genes, electron transfer and adenosine triphosphate levels, which is important for elucidating the mechanism of nitrite promotion of biological nitrogen removal efficiency.
40065425	Fungal Infections Associated With TNF-Inhibitors: A 20-Year of a Systematic Review Fungal Infections and TNF-Inhibitors.	TNF-α inhibitors, including infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept, are used to treat various inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. However, these treatments may predispose patients to fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, candidiasis and aspergillosis. In this study, we systematically reviewed case reports to critically examine the correlations between anti-TNF-α therapies and the occurrence of invasive and superficial fungal infections. Infliximab was the most commonly used TNF-α inhibitor (50.65%). The highest number of fungal infections during anti-TNF34 α therapy was reported in the USA (84.25%). The conditions treated primarily included rheumatoid arthritis. A total of 517 invasive fungal infections were identified, including histoplasmosis, invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis, with histoplasmosis being the most common. Most studies were conducted in higher-income countries, highlighting the critical lack of research on the use of immunobiologicals in relation to fungal diseases in African countries, which requires further attention. Logistic regression analysis revealed significant associations between adalimumab use and increased risks of candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, onychomycosis and pityriasis versicolor. For etanercept, significant associations were found with aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, dermatophytosis, invasive candidiasis, pityriasis versicolor and onychomycosis. Infliximab use was significantly associated with coccidioidomycosis, onychomycosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis and invasive candidiasis. The data presented in this study clearly demonstrate an association between the use of TNF-α inhibitors and an increased risk of fungal infections. It is imperative that healthcare professionals maintain a high level of vigilance when managing patients on these medications. Regular monitoring and proactive management strategies are essential to mitigate risks and ensure patient safety.
40065379	Study on the clinical characteristics, persistent infection capability, and viral load of human papillomavirus type 82 single infection.	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a key factor in the development of cervical cancer and HPV genotyping is crucial for screening. There are significant differences in the pathogenic potential of the various HPV types. Currently, clinical data on HPV82 are scarce, and the relationship between its viral load, pathogenicity, and persistence is unknown. This study analyzed the characteristics of HPV82 single infection.
40065374	Comparing conventional and Bayesian workflows for clinical outcome prediction modelling with an exemplar cohort study of severe COVID-19 infection incorporating clinical biomarker test results.	Assessing risk factors and creating prediction models from real-world medical data is challenging, requiring numerous modelling decisions with clinical guidance. Logistic regression is a common model for such studies, for which we advocate the use of Bayesian methods that can jointly deliver probabilistic risk factor inference and prediction. As an exemplar, we compare Bayesian logistic regression with horseshoe priors and Projective Prediction variable selection with the established frequentist LASSO approach, to predict severe COVID-19 outcomes (death or ICU admittance) from demographic and laboratory biomarker data. Our study serves as guidance on data curation, variable selection, and performance assessment with cross-validation.
40065353	Identification of enterotype for patients with Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and chronic neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, characterized by behavioral and dysexecutive deficits.

This study aimed to explore the enterotypes in AD by identifying key bacteria through machine learning and species co-occurrence network analysis.
40065352	A rapid ecologic analysis, confirmed by a case-control study, identifies class I HLA alleles correlated to the risk of COVID-19.	Several studies suggest that the heterogeneous spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics started on December 2019 could be partially upheld by the prevalence of permissive class I HLA alleles in specific populations. Such HLA alleles are in fact unable to shape an efficient anti-viral immune-response in the hosts or sustain an exaggerated inflammatory T cell mediated response responsible for the COVID-19 disease. We previously reported an ecologic correlation between the risk of COVID-19 spreading across Italy and the germinal expression of permissive HLA-C*01 and -B*44 alleles in specific inter and intraregional populations along the first spreading wave.
40065321	Characterization and genomic analysis of Sharanji: a jumbo bacteriophage of Escherichia coli.	Bacteriophages are the most genetically diverse biological entities in nature. Our current understanding of phage biology primarily stems from studies on a limited number of model bacteriophages. Jumbo phages, characterized by their exceptionally large genomes, are less frequently isolated and studied. Some jumbo phages exhibit remarkable genetic diversity, unique infection mechanisms, and therapeutic potential.
40065282	Use of complement C5-inhibitor eculizumab in patients with infection-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome - a case-series report.	Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (AKI), remains a leading cause of pediatric AKI. The complement system has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and eculizumab (ECZ) was approved as standard of care for its treatment. The two widely characterized forms of infection-associated HUS are Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)-HUS and Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated (SP)-HUS. Extrarenal manifestations such as central nervous system (CNS) involvement occur approximately in 20% of the cases and are accompanied by higher mortality. Abnormalities of the alternative complement pathway may also contribute to the development of both STEC-HUS and SP-HUS, offering a potential treatment option for complement C5 inhibition. Beyond best supportive care as standard therapeutic approach, ECZ has been successfully used in both STEC-HUS and SP-HUS patients. We provide further support that early use of ECZ for infection-associated HUS with severe clinical manifestation and abnormal complement-activation profile may be an effective therapeutic approach.
40065261	Congenital cytomegalovirus in eastern Uganda: prevalence and outcomes.	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection poses risks to both maternal and neonatal health, however there are limited comprehensive data on congenital CMV in low-resource settings where the virus is widespread, particularly among women of reproductive age. Our research in eastern Uganda aimed to assess the prevalence of congenital CMV and outcomes among infants to inform public health policies and interventions in similar settings, addressing a significant gap in current knowledge.
40065253	Predicting triage of pediatric patients in the emergency department using machine learning approach.	The efficient performance of an Emergency Department (ED) relies heavily on an effective triage system that prioritizes patients based on the severity of their medical conditions. Traditional triage systems, including those using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS), may involve subjective assessments by healthcare providers, leading to potential inconsistencies and delays in patient care.
40065241	Risk factors for rifampicin-susceptible and isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Nanjing.	Globally, Tuberculosis(TB) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly serious, especially the emergence of rifampicin-susceptible and isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis (Hr-TB), which increases the difficulty of treatment and the burden of disease. Therefore, this single-center retrospective cohort study analyzed risk factors of Hr-TB in adult patients with T2DM and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Nanjing to guide clinical practice and improve the long-term prognosis of patients.
40065221	Using gut microbiota and non-targeted metabolomics techniques to study the effect of xylitol on alleviating DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease in mice.	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a global healthcare issue, with its incidence continuing to rise, but currently there is no complete cure. Xylitol is a widely used sweetener in various foods and beverages, but there is limited research on the effects of xylitol on IBD symptoms.
40065215	Epidemiology and risk factors of fungal pathogens in sepsis: a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study.

40065181	Microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease: mechanisms of disease and therapeutic opportunities.	Perturbations in the intestinal microbiome are strongly linked to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Bacteria, fungi and viruses all make up part of a complex multi-kingdom community colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, often referred to as the gut microbiome. They can exert various effects on the host that can contribute to an inflammatory state. Advances in screening, multiomics and experimental approaches have revealed insights into host-microbiota interactions in IBD and have identified numerous mechanisms through which the microbiota and its metabolites can exert a major influence on the gastrointestinal tract. Looking into the future, the microbiome and microbiota-associated processes will be likely to provide unparalleled opportunities for novel diagnostic, therapeutic and diet-inspired solutions for the management of IBD through harnessing rationally designed microbial communities, powerful bacterial and fungal metabolites, individually or in combination, to foster intestinal health. In this Review, we examine the current understanding of the cross-kingdom gut microbiome in IBD, focusing on bacterial and fungal components and metabolites. We examine therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities, the microbial metabolism, immunity, neuroimmunology and microbiome-inspired interventions to link mechanisms of disease and identify novel research and therapeutic opportunities for IBD.
40065170	LILRB3 genetic variation is associated with kidney transplant failure in African American recipients.	African American (AA) kidney transplant recipients exhibit a higher rate of graft loss compared with other racial and ethnic populations, highlighting the need to identify causative factors. Here, in the Genomics of Chronic Allograft Rejection cohort, pretransplant blood RNA sequencing revealed a cluster of four consecutive missense single-nucelotide polymorphisms (SNPs), within the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B3 (LILRB3) gene, strongly associated with death-censored graft loss. This SNP cluster (named LILRB3-4SNPs) encodes missense mutations at amino acids 617-618 proximal to a SHP1/2 phosphatase-binding immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. The LILRB3-4SNPs cluster is specifically enriched within AA individuals and exhibited a strong association with death-censored graft loss and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline in the AA participants from multiple transplant cohorts. In two large Biobanks (BioMe and All-of-Us), the LILRB3-4SNPs cluster was associated with the early onset of end-stage renal disease and acted synergistically with the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) G1/G2 allele to accelerate disease progression. The SNPs were also linked to multiple immune-related diseases in AA individuals. Last, on multiomics analysis of blood and biopsies, recipients with LILRB3-4SNPs showed enhanced inflammation and monocyte ferroptosis. While larger and prospective studies are needed, our data provide insights on the genetic variation underlying kidney transplant outcomes.
40065148	Comparison of diagnostic tests for chronic endometritis and endometrial dysbiosis in recurrent implantation failure: Impact on pregnancy outcomes.	Chronic endometritis (CE) and endometrial dysbiosis (ED) are major causes of recurrent implantation failure (RIF). CE is diagnosed via hysteroscopy or the endometrial CD138 test; ED is examined using endometrial microbiome testing with next-generation sequencing. ED is characterized by a reduction in Lactobacillus species. However, correlations between the results of the three tests and the efficacy of treatment against CE and ED in pregnancy outcomes remain unclear. We analyzed 73 patients with RIF who underwent all three tests (hysteroscopy, endometrial CD138 test, and endometrial microbiome test). Patients with CE received antibiotics, whereas those with ED received antibiotics and vaginal Lactobacillus probiotics. The incidences of CE diagnosed using hysteroscopy and the CD138 test were 56.2 and 49.3%, respectively, and the prevalence of ED was 53.4%. No correlations were observed among the test-positive individuals in these three tests. Among patients with ED, 88.9% had a post-treatment clinical pregnancy, a significantly higher rate than that in patients without ED (p = 0.021). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ED was associated with clinical pregnancy (odds ratio (OR): 6.29, p = 0.031). In conclusion, the three tests detected different populations of patients with RIF. ED diagnosed using the endometrial microbiome test was associated with favorable pregnancy outcomes after testing.
40065140	Establishment and validation of a simple and accurate qPCR detection method for Haemophilus parasuis.	As an infectious disease that poses a significant threat to the rapidly growing pig breeding industry, the detection of Haemophilus parasuis (HPS) is often compromised by various interfering substances present in the test sample during quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The rapid detection of HPS is important for the isolation of infectious pigs and their treatment. We designed and optimized a rapid qPCR test to detect the INFB gene of HPS in clinical and environmental samples on pig farms. The method was evaluated for its specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, anti-interference capability, and its ability to detect HPS in clinical samples. The results indicated that the method was specific for the detection of HPS when evaluated against pathogens and intestinal probiotics found in pig farms. By using a seven-fold dilution series of the recombinant plasmid DNA in triplicate, it was determined that the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for this method was less than 10 copies/µL. The results of inter-batch and intra-batch repeatability tests showed that the coefficient of variation (CV) was consistently below 1%. Furthermore, the impact of 14 endogenous and exogenous interfering substances on the Ct values detected by the HPS qPCR was found to be less than 5% when compared to the Ct values obtained in the absence of interfering substances. A total of 248 clinical samples were analyzed using the HPS qPCR, commercial kits, and corresponding national standards, yielding positive rates of 9.27%, 6.05%, and 9.27%, respectively. Notably, the positive and negative percent agreement between the detection method developed in this research and the national standard was 100%. These findings demonstrate that the established detection method is suitable for epidemiological research on HPS and for diagnosing clinical samples containing interfering substances, thereby providing essential technical support for the prevention and control of HPS.
40065134	Bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria accelerate injury-induced mucosal healing in the colon.	Host-microbiome communication is frequently perturbed in gut pathologies due to microbiome dysbiosis, leading to altered production of bacterial metabolites. Among these, 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids are notably diminished in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Herein, we investigated whether restoration of 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids levels by Clostridium scindens, a human-derived 7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, can reestablish intestinal epithelium homeostasis following colon injury. Gnotobiotic and conventional mice were subjected to chemically-induced experimental colitis following administration of Clostridium scindens. Colonization enhanced the production of 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids and conferred prophylactic and therapeutic protection against colon injury through epithelial regeneration and specification. Computational analysis of human datasets confirmed defects in intestinal cell renewal and differentiation in ulcerative colitis patients while expression of genes involved in those pathways showed a robust positive correlation with 7α-dehydroxylated bile acid levels. Clostridium scindens administration could therefore be a promising biotherapeutic strategy to foster mucosal healing following colon injury by restoring bile acid homeostasis.
40065116	Biofertilizers containing plant growth promoting rhizobacteria enhance nutrient uptake and improve the growth and yield of chickpea plants in an arid environment.	Integrated nutrient management is anticipated as an environmentally friendly method toward sustainable agricultural development and optimum crop production with reduced environmental impacts. In the present study, the pastel sulfur (SPA), powdered sulfur (SPO), sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB), phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), and potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB) were applied. The experimental treatments included (1) SPA, (2) SPO, (3) SOB, (4) SPA + SOB, (5) SPO + SOB, (6) SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (7) SPO + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (8) SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (9) NFB + PSB + KSB, and (10) control. The result demonstrated that the application of biofertilizers increased soil bacterial population, photosynthetic pigment content, and grain yield. The highest photosynthetic pigments were observed in NFB + PSB + KSB. The greatest nitrogen fixation nodules and active nodules percentage were recorded in SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB. The biofertilizers enhanced the grain, plant, and soil N, P, and K contents compared with the control. The maximum number of pods per plant, biological yield, grain yield, and 100-grain weight were obtained from SPO + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB and SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB. Overall, biofertilizers could be a key strategy to maintain soil quality toward agricultural sustainability.
40065113	Bacterial lysates in modifying sIgA levels in the upper respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients.	A great deal of evidence has accumulated suggesting an important role of mucosal immunity not only in preventing COVID-19 but also in the pathogenesis of this infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in different compartments of the upper respiratory tract in COVID-19 patients in relation to the severity of the disease and treatment with a bacteria-based immunomodulating agent (Immunovac VP4). The titers of sIgA were determined by ELISA in nasal epithelial swabs, pharyngeal swabs, and salivary gland secretions at baseline and on days 14 and 30 of treatment. The levels of nasal, pharyngeal and salivary sIgA were significantly lower in more severe patients (subgroup A) than in less severe patients (subgroup B), p < 0.01. In subgroup A, the patients who received Immunovac VP4 had higher pharyngeal sIgA levels in convalescent period than those who did not receive the therapy p < 0.05. In subgroup B patients, an increase in immunoglobulin levels was observed from baseline to day 14 of treatment whether they received the add-on therapy or not, p < 0.01. On day 30 of treatment, the sIgA levels in the standard treatment group, however, decreased, while the patients receiving the immunomodulating agent maintained high sIgA levels, p < 0.05. Oxygen saturation significantly increased by day 14 in both groups, p < 0.001. However, it was higher in the Immunovac VP4 group than in the standard treatment group, p < 0.01. Thus, addition of a bacterial lysate-based immunomodulating agent to the treatment regimen for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 induces the production of pharyngeal and salivary sIgA. SIgA production is inversely correlated to CRP levels and percentage of lung involvement on CT scan and is directly correlated to SpO<sub>2</sub> levels.

40065098	Surface-mediated bacteriophage defense incurs fitness tradeoffs for interbacterial antagonism.	Bacteria in polymicrobial habitats are constantly exposed to biotic threats from bacteriophages (or "phages"), antagonistic bacteria, and predatory eukaryotes. These antagonistic interactions play crucial roles in shaping the evolution and physiology of bacteria. To survive, bacteria have evolved mechanisms to protect themselves from such attacks, but the fitness costs of resisting one threat and rendering bacteria susceptible to others remain unappreciated. Here, we examined the fitness consequences of phage resistance in Salmonella enterica, revealing that phage-resistant variants exhibited significant fitness loss upon co-culture with competitor bacteria. These phage-resistant strains display varying degrees of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) deficiency and increased susceptibility to contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism, such as the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Utilizing mutational analyses and atomic force microscopy, we show that the long-modal length O-antigen of LPS serves as a protective barrier against T6SS-mediated intoxication. Notably, this competitive disadvantage can also be triggered independently by phages possessing LPS-targeting endoglycosidase in their tail spike proteins, which actively cleave the O-antigen upon infection. Our findings reveal two distinct mechanisms of phage-mediated LPS modifications that modulate interbacterial competition, shedding light on the dynamic microbial interplay within mixed populations.
40065071	MicroRNA 320a-3p up-regulation reduces PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer cells: an experimental and bioinformatic study.	Growing evidence suggests that dysregulated microRNAs were critical in the development of tumors and the progression number of malignancies. This research aimed to check the effect of microRNA 320a-3p transfection on gastric cancer (GC) cell lines. Following transfection, the efficacy was determined by the RT-PCR method. After that, MTT, scratch assay, DAPI staining, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry were used respectively. The results demonstrated that the viability of GC cells considerably decreased following transfection. Moreover, microRNA 320a-3p transfection significantly suppressed cell migration and induced apoptosis in these cells. We found that transfection of microRNA 320a-3p remarkably decreased PD-L1 gene expression and influenced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related and apoptotic gene expressions. The findings propose that microRNA 320a-3p could decrease cell proliferation and migration and induce apoptosis by increasing TP53 and CASP3 expression levels in GC cells. Notably, microRNA 320a-3p might be a potential target in GC immunotherapy by suppressing the PD-L1 gene expression.
40065061	Activation of endogenous retroviruses characterizes the maternal-fetal interface in the BTBR mouse model of autism spectrum disorder.	Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic elements derived from a process of germline infection by exogenous retroviruses. Some ERVs have been co-opted for physiological functions, and their activation has been associated with complex diseases, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have already demonstrated an abnormal expression of ERVs in the BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD during intrauterine life till adulthood. Thus, starting from the assumptions that ERVs may contribute to the derailment of neurodevelopment and that ASD has fetal origins as a consequence of adverse intrauterine conditions, the present study aims to characterize the transcriptional activity of selected ERVs (MusD, IAP, Syn-A, Syn-B, ARC and GLN), LINE-1, inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-10, IL-11 CXCL-1) at the maternal-fetal interface and in dissected embryos from BTBR mice. Our results highlight the deregulation of ERVs and inflammatory mediators at the maternal-fetal interface, and in cephalic and non-cephalic embryonic tissues from BTBR compared to C57BL/6 J. Several correlations among ERV expression levels emerged in different tissues from C57BL/6 J mice while, in BTBR mice, no correlations were found, suggesting that in this model, the acquisition of autistic-like traits might be linked to the dysregulation of ERV activity occurring during intra-uterine life.
40065050	Anticancer activity of Weizmannia coagulans MZY531on H22 tumor-bearing mice by regulating inflammation, autophagy-dependent apoptosis, and gut microbiota.	Increasing studies have shown that the efficacy of Weizmannia coagulans in treating various cancers. We recently identified W. coagulans MZY531 with potent cell anti-proliferation and exhibiting apoptosis induction activities against the mouse H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line.However, the anti-cancer effect of W. coagulans MZY531 against liver cancer in vivo has not been verified. The objective of this study was to assess the anti-hepatoma effect of W. coagulans MZY531 on H22 tumor-bearing mice and the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that W. coagulans MZY531 reduced the weight and size of the tumor in comparison to the model group. The levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-2 and TNF-α were suppressed by W. coagulans MZY531 administration. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL analyses demonstrated that W. coagulans MZY531 significantly increased the number of cleaved caspase-3 cells and induced apoptosis in tumor tissues. Importantly, W. coagulans MZY531 activated the AMPK/mTOR autophagy-dependent apoptosis pathway, and regulated the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF-6/NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 inflammatory signaling pathways through mechanisms. Additionally, Fecal analysis demonstrated the capacity of W. coagulans MZY531 to remodel the gut microbiota of hepatocellular carcinoma-infected mice. Collectively, this experimental finding suggested that W. coagulans MZY531 exhibited prominent anticancer activities in vivo at least partly via reducing inflammation, inducing autophagy-dependent apoptosis, and regulating gut microbiota in H22 tumor-bearing mice.
40065049	Pseudomonas aeruginosa promoted microbial fuel cells for cytidine acid production wastewater treatment.	Microbial fuel cell (MFC) can convert the chemical energy of organic matter in wastewater into electrical energy with high degradation efficiency. In this study, a type of specialized microorganism, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was screened and added to an MFC to promote the degradation of wastewater generated during the production of cytidine acid while improving the performance of the MFC. The MFC achieved a maximum voltage of 57.7 ± 4.4 mV and a maximum power density of 1.9 ± 0.1 mW/m<sup>2</sup>; moreover, the degradation efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), and phosphate reached 76.3 ± 2.8%, 80.3 ± 3.3%, and 85.3 ± 3.5%, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and metabolomics analysis revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa could effectively degrade organic matter in wastewater. Additionally, the metabolic pathways involved may have been pyrimidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism.
40065047	Prevalence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and factors influencing successful treatment outcomes among notified cases in South India.	Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant public health issue globally, with extra pulmonary tuberculosis (epTB) accounting for a considerable number of TB cases. This study aims to improve our understanding of epTB epidemiology by evaluating treatment outcomes and identifying factors associated with positive and negative treatment results in epTB patients. A retrospective study was conducted from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019. EpTB and rifampicin-resistant epTB were identified using the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the associated risk factors. Among the 4,526 patients with extra pulmonary tuberculosis, the positivity rate of Mycobacteriuum tuberculosis among the epTB was 16.5%, and the rate of rifampicin-resistant epTB was 4.83%. Most of patients had lymphadenitis TB (n = 348, 38.79%), followed by those with pus (n = 241, 31.95%). Of 746 epTB cases, 679 patients (91.02%) achieved successful treatment outcomes. Of the 36 patients with rifampicin-resistant epTB, 30 (83.3%) exhibited successful treatment outcomes. Tuberculous peritonitis (OR: 1.58), aspirate (OR: 1.59), gastric lavage (OR: 1.45), biopsy (OR: 1.73), Tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) (OR: 1.46), and tissue samples (OR: 3.33) were all significantly associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes. Patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (epTB) aged between 35 and 44 had a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing unsuccessful outcomes (OR = 1.79; 95% CI: 0.74-4.31, p = 0.0912). Additionally, individuals with a history of alcohol use showed a higher likelihood of poor outcomes (OR = 1.90; 95% CI: 0.25-14.42). Moreover, tuberculosis patients who used tobacco also had an increased likelihood of unfavourable treatment outcomes (OR = 2.62; 95% CI: 0.35-19.68).The study indicated that the rate of favourable treatment outcomes among epTB patients surpassed the World Health Organization's target of ≥ 90%. However, a significant number of patients were lost to follow-up during treatment.
40065046	Combination of gut microbiota, proinflammatory cytokine, and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET as potential indicators for predicting breast cancer recurrence.	Breast cancer occurs at a younger age compared to western countries in South Korea. Despite advancements in treatment methods such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the increasing number of patients underscores the importance of improving disease-free survival (DFS). In this study, we evaluated the associations between gut microbiota composition, inflammatory cytokine levels, and breast cancer recurrence in preoperative patients. Additionally, we developed a composite prognostic index by integrating these factors with PET/CT indices and clinical prognostic factors. This study showed that Prevotella abundance was significantly higher in the DFS group than in the recurrence group, and higher Prevotella abundance was associated with lower levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Survival analysis revealed that patients with low Prevotella abundance and high IL-1β levels had a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence. PET markers, such as SUV<sub>tumor</sub>, SUV<sub>VAT</sub>, and SUV<sub>spleen</sub>, were also found to be significant prognostic indicators, with lower values associated with better survival outcomes. An integrated predictive model combining gut microbiota composition, cytokine levels, PET indices, and clinical factors demonstrated superior accuracy (AUC: 0.9025) in predicting breast cancer recurrence compared to individual components.
