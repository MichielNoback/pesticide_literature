40066695	Privileged natural product compound classes for anti-inflammatory drug development.	Covering: up to early 2025Privileged compound classes of anti-inflammatory natural products are those where there are many reported members that possess anti-inflammatory properties. The identification of these classes is of particular relevance to drug discovery, as they could serve as valuable starting points in developing effective and safe anti-inflammatory agents. The privileged compound classes of natural products include the polyphenols, coumarins, labdane diterpenoids, sesquiterpene lactones, isoquinoline and indole alkaloids, each offering a variety of molecular scaffolds and functional groups that enable diverse interactions with biological targets. From a medicinal chemistry point of view, natural products are both a boon and a bane. The multi-targeting nature of natural products is a boon in the treatment of multi-factorial diseases such as inflammation, but promiscuity, poor potency and pharmacokinetic properties are significant hurdles that must be addressed to ensure these compounds can be effectively used as therapeutics. In addition, there are continued controversies regarding the efficacies of some of these natural products that will continue to polarise their use. In this review, examples of natural products of six privileged compound classes will be discussed for their potential use and possible further development as anti-inflammatory drugs.
40066692	Factors influencing vaccine hesitancy among United Kingdom adolescents in a senior high school environment and actions to address it.	We explored adolescent viewpoints on vaccines and hesitancy using an anonymized, validated, self-completed electronic questionnaire amongst state-school Year 12-13 adolescents in London, UK. As the response rate was low (Cohort 1; <i>n</i> = 112/486, 23.0%), we repeated the survey with incoming students (cohort 2, <i>n</i> = 256/275; 93%). A focus group (<i>n</i> = 31) evaluated international HPV campaign posters. Cohort 1 participants were 82.1% female, 13.4% male, and ethnically diverse (32.1% Asian/Asian British, 29.5% Black/Black British, 25.9% White, 7.1% Mixed); Cohort 2 were 80% female, 18% male, with participants identifying as 38% Black/Black British, 34% Asian/Asian British, 15% White, 12% Mixed/Others. Across both cohorts, participants believed childhood vaccinations were safe (Cohort 1 = 95.8%, Cohort 2 = 91%). COVID-19 vaccination uptake was higher in Cohort 1 than 2 (76.8% vs 67%), with fewer participants believing it was adequately tested (56.3% vs 47%). Support for mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for healthcare workers (HCW) was high (Cohort 1:77.8-79% "all" vs "patient-facing HCWs;" Cohort 2 = 62-64%). Similar patterns were observed for mandatory influenza vaccination (Cohort 1: 62.5-66.7%; Cohort 2: 62-63%). Vaccination decisions in Cohort 2 were primarily influenced by parents (96%), healthcare providers (48%), and school friends (36%) (Cohort 1 = 30.2%, 19.6%, and 12%, respectively). Recommendations by doctors, experts and parents (but not politicians) and school-based vaccine availability boosted vaccine confidence. Social media had minimal impact. Most participants received HPV vaccine (Cohort 1 = 83.1%, Cohort 2 = 77.2%). International HPV posters received strong but mixed support; direct design input from the target group is needed to ensure the success of visual vaccine promotions.

40066663	Gastric siderosis: an endoscopic diagnosis challenge.	A 71-year-old man presented for a routine physical examination with multiple comorbidities, including severe panvascular disease and valvulopathy, requiring anticoagulation therapy. He had a history of chronic hemolytic anemia and had been taking oral ferrous sulfate for two years. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) was performed, as part of the study of the persist anemia, revealing an extensive nodular area with multiple brownish deposits and spontaneous hemorrhage. Biopsy showed mild inflammation in the lamina propria and ferric pigment confirmed by positive Perl's iron stain, suggesting drug-induced injury. After diagnosis of GS, iron supplements were discontinued and a UGE nine months later showed no remaining lesions.
40066661	The Glutamate/GABA-Glutamine Cycle: Insights, Updates, and Advances.	Synaptic homeostasis of the principal neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA is tightly regulated by an intricate metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes known as the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle. In this cycle, astrocytes take up glutamate and GABA from the synapse and convert these neurotransmitters into glutamine. Astrocytic glutamine is subsequently transferred to neurons, serving as the principal precursor for neuronal glutamate and GABA synthesis. The glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle integrates multiple cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, uptake, synthesis, and metabolism. All of these processes are deeply interdependent and closely coupled to cellular energy metabolism. Astrocytes display highly active mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and several unique metabolic features, including glycogen storage and pyruvate carboxylation, which are essential to sustain continuous glutamine release. However, new roles of oligodendrocytes and microglia in neurotransmitter recycling are emerging. Malfunction of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle can lead to severe synaptic disruptions and may be implicated in several brain diseases. Here, I review central aspects and recent advances of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle to highlight how the cycle is functionally connected to critical brain functions and metabolism. First, an overview of glutamate, GABA, and glutamine transport is provided in relation to neurotransmitter recycling. Then, central metabolic aspects of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the critical metabolic roles of glial cells. Finally, I discuss how aberrant neurotransmitter recycling is linked to neurodegeneration and disease, focusing on astrocyte metabolic dysfunction and brain lipid homeostasis as emerging pathological mechanisms. Instead of viewing the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle as individual biochemical processes, a more holistic and integrative approach is needed to advance our understanding of how neurotransmitter recycling modulates brain function in both health and disease.

40066648	Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in aortic stenosis patients scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.	The prevalences of aortic stenosis (AS) and transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) increase with age. Identification of occult ATTR-CM in patients with AS can help explain out-of-proportion myocardial dysfunction, aid in prognostication and prompt initiation of disease-modifying treatment. Studies have suggested that many patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have concomitant ATTR-CM, but some have included unverified ATTR-CM in patients with ambiguous scintigrams. We aimed to assess the co-occurrence of ATTR-CM in patients scheduled for TAVI.
40066647	Reporting a Homozygous Case of Neurodevelopmental Disorder Associated With a Novel PRPF8 Variant.	While recently identified heterozygous PRPF8 variants have been linked to various human diseases, their role in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) remains ambiguous. This study investigates the potential association between homozygous PRPF8 variants and NDDs. Most PRPF8 variants are primarily associated with retinal diseases; however, we analyze a family with multiple members diagnosed with NDDs.
40066645	Synergistic Inactivation of Airborne Viruses by Low-Concentration Ozone With High Humidity and Temperature.	Ambient humidity, temperature, and ozone influence the viability of airborne viruses, but their synergistic effects are poorly understood, particularly regarding ozone with humidity/temperature changes. Therefore, we examined the inactivation of airborne influenza viruses and coronaviruses under combinations of low ambient ozone concentrations, relative humidity (RH) levels, and temperatures typical of daily life. Viral fluid was atomized in a closed chamber conditioned with different combinations of these factors. The atomized aerosol particles containing the virus were exposed to ambient air and then sampled for titration. Active virus levels in ambient air at 50%-85% RH with 15, 35, and 55 ppb ozone significantly decreased compared with those in ambient air with 0 ppb ozone, whereas those in ambient air at < 40% RH decreased only slightly, even with 100 ppb ozone. Viral gene copy numbers, assayed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, remained similar across all conditions. Inactivation increased with higher temperatures, although not at 15°C. These findings suggest that low concentrations of ambient ozone, when combined with high humidity and temperature, effectively inactivate airborne viruses, potentially influencing viral transmission in real-world environments.
40066623	Have we reached a new baseline for blood collection and transfusion in the United States? National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey, 2023.

Data from the 2023 NBCUS were analyzed to further understand national trends in US blood availability.
40066615	NTRK protein expression in NSCLC and its clinicopathological correlation.	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. Since the discovery of the oncogenic neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion in colorectal cancer in 1986, its understanding has gradually progressed. NTRK's relevance is crucial to understanding some tumor development and how specific tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitors (TRKI) work. <i>NTRK1, NTRK2,</i> and <i>NTRK3</i> (encoding the neurotrophin receptors TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, respectively) rearrangement induces high tumor transforming ability. This study investigates the clinical relevance of NTRK immunohistochemistry in NSCLC patients in a cohort of 482 patients from Karolinska University Hospital with detailed clinical and pathological studies. Immunohistochemical staining for NTRK expression was performed, and the results were correlated with patient demographics, histological subtypes, tumor extent, and staging. Our findings revealed that NTRK expression, predominantly membranous and cytoplasmic, was detected in 22 out of 482 cases (4.56%). Notably, NTRK expression was more frequently observed in squamous-cell carcinoma (SqCC) than in adenocarcinoma (AdCa). Clinical correlations indicated a significant association between NTRK expression and histologic subtypes (<i>p</i><0.001) and grade of differentiation (<i>p</i>=0.036). However, no significant correlations were observed with age, sex, tumor size, staging, or OS. NTRK immunohistochemistry represents a potential biomarker for a subset of NSCLC patients, particularly those with SqCC histology. Understanding the clinical implications of NTRK expression may contribute to personalized treatment strategies in NSCLC.

40066598	Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2/3 gene deletions and repeat motifs in Chhattisgarh, India (2017-2018).	Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are vital for malaria diagnosis, especially in resource-limited areas. RDTs targeting histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and its structural homologue PfHRP3 are commonly used for detecting Plasmodium falciparum. However, genetic deletions in these proteins can affect test accuracy. This study aims to examine the gene deletions and sequence variation in the Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes in P. falciparum isolates from Chhattisgarh, India, and assess their correlation with RDT reactivity.

40066580	Comorbidities of hypothyroidism.	Hypothyroidism is a relatively common condition that may affect as many as 10% of the population worldwide when its overt and subclinical presentations are considered. Important clinical comorbidities are highly prevalent in people with hypothyroidism and diminish quality of life and functional status in a manner that is proportional to the number of comorbidities present and their severity. This article reviews the common comorbidities of hypothyroidism, as reported in the literature. The comorbidities of hypothyroidism include clinical conditions commonly associated with hypothyroidism, such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, fatigue or (possibly) cardiovascular disease, and can appear whether or not intervention with LT4 is applied appropriately to ensure biochemical euthyroidism. Other comorbidities may share some pathogenetic background with hypothyroidism, including depression or anxiety, or autoimmune conditions. Hypothyroidism may arise as a comorbidity of some other conditions, e.g. following the application of targeted cancer therapies or alemtuzumab for multiple sclerosis. Other common treatments, including metformin, glucocorticoids or proton pump inhibitors among others, may alter levels of thyrotropin, thus impacting on the monitoring of thyroid dysfunction and the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Ensuring good control of hypothyroidism is a necessary first step in managing any patient with hypothyroidism. Then, physicians should be aware of the possibility of other comorbid conditions that must be addressed to achieve an optimal patient outcome.
40066579	Sex Differences in Peripheral Vascular Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.	Sex differences in the risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of patients with cardiovascular disease have been well described; however, the bulk of the literature has focused on heart disease in women. Data on sex differences in peripheral vascular disease are ill defined, and there is a need to report and understand those sex-related differences to mitigate adverse outcomes related to those disparities. Although peripheral vascular disease is a highly diverse group of disorders affecting the arteries, veins, and lymphatics, this scientific statement focuses on disorders affecting the peripheral arteries to include the aorta and its branch vessels. The purpose of this scientific statement is to report the current status of sex-based differences and disparities in peripheral vascular disease and to provide research priorities to achieve health equity for women with peripheral vascular disease.

However, few studies have considered long-term cumulative blood pressure (cBP) exposure in middle-aged and older population in China. The aim of this study was to investigate whether long-term cBP was associated with subsequent cardiovascular outcomes among participants without CVD at baseline in Chinese over 45 years old.
40066573	A proximal policy optimisation algorithm-based algorithm for cardiovascular disorders detection.	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) significantly impact athletes, impacting the heart and blood vessels. This article introduces a novel method to assess CVD in athletes through an artificial neural network (ANN). The model utilises the mutual learning-based artificial bee colony (ML-ABC) algorithm to set initial weights and proximal policy optimisation (PPO) to address imbalanced classification. ML-ABC uses mutual learning to enhance the learning process by updating the positions of the food sources with respect to the best fitness outcomes of two randomly selected individuals. PPO makes updates in the ANN stable and efficient to improve the model's reliability. Our approach formulates the classification problem as a series of decision-making processes, rewarding every classification act with higher rewards for correctly identifying the instances of the minority class, hence handling class imbalance. We evaluated the model's performance on a diversified medical dataset including 26,002 athletes who were examined within the Polyclinic for Occupational Health and Sports in Zagreb, further validated with NCAA and NHANES datasets to verify generalisability. Our findings indicate that our model outperforms existing models with accuracies of 0.88, 0.86 and 0.82 for the respective datasets. These results enhance clinical model application and advance cardiovascular disorder detection and methodologies.

40066570	Evaluation of adherence to the Mediterranean diet after a nutritional dietary intervention from primary care.	currently there are changes in lifestyle that have been modifying the nutritional culture, moving away from the Mediterranean diet (DMed) and acquiring a more sedentary lifestyle, a fact that has contributed to a significant increase in risk factors. (CVRF) such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and consequently to a global increase in metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which in the 21st century reinforces being the first cause of morbidity and mortality To reduce this pandemic, a multidisciplinary approach is required focused on the application of primary and secondary prevention strategies for modifiable CVRFs, focused on nutritional promotion and education through the promotion of a healthier lifestyle and diet from childhood, as the one that encompasses the MedD. This dietary pattern, together with physical exercise, has been shown to contribute to the primary and secondary prevention of DM2 and coexisting CVRF.

40066564	[WHO guidance on non-nutritive sweeteners - A critical analysis].	The use of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) has gained prominence as an alternative to reduce free sugar consumption, aligning with global efforts to combat the growing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). By providing sweetness without caloric energy, NSS are viewed as potential tools in addressing diet-related health challenges. However, their long-term effects on health remain contentious, especially within the medical community. In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) released guidelines evaluating the role of NSS in promoting healthy eating, preventing weight gain, and mitigating NCDs. While some studies highlight benefits, such as lower body weight and reduced energy intake, the evidence is inconclusive. Observational research predominantly raises concerns about potential risks associated with NSS, but these studies face limitations, including biases and confounding variables that hinder causal conclusions. This analysis underscores the urgent need for comprehensive, high-quality research to clarify the risks and benefits of NSS. Current evidence is limited in scope and fails to address critical knowledge gaps, particularly regarding their long-term implications for the general population and individuals with NCDs. Expanding the scientific understanding of NSS is essential to inform public health recommendations and clinical guidelines effectively.

40066528	Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Suppresses Mitophagy to Alleviate Muscle Atrophy in Chronic Renal Failure With Protein-Energy Wasting.	Protein-energy wasting (PEW) facilitates major adverse clinical outcomes in chronic renal failure (CRF), with current therapies not suitable for all patients. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) can alleviate chronic kidney disease, with unclear effects and mechanisms on CRF with PEW. The CRF rat model was constructed by adenine administration, and PEW was induced by a 4% casein diet. The serum creatinine (SCR), urinary protein (UPR), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pathology of the gastrocnemius muscle was estimated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of mitophagy-related markers was detected to assess the mitophagy level. Dexamethasone-induced L6 myotubes established myotube atrophy models. The levels of mitophagy-related markers, muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), and atrophy gene 1 (Atrogin1) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. F. prausnitzii suppressed the SCR, UPR, and BUN expression in serum and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy, which were promoted by CRF with PEW. Dexamethasone-induced expression of MuRF1 and Atrogin1 in L6 myotubes was decreased by F. prausnitzii. Additionally, F. prausnitzii repressed mitophagy in the gastrocnemius muscle and L6 myotubes. In conclusion, F. prausnitzii suppressed renal failure progression and muscle atrophy by inhibiting mitophagy in CRF with PEW.
40066524	Global research trends and hotspots in mitochondria and asthma: A bibliometric and visualized analysis.

40066501	FLOT1 Is a Novel Serum Biomarker of Ovarian Cancer Targeted by N6-methyladenosine Modification Inhibition.	Ovarian cancer (OC) is a deadly disease and lacks a precise marker for diagnosis worldwide. Our previous work has shown the overexpression of flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in OC tissue. To improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, we evaluated the serum level of FLOT1 in OC patients and found that the serum concentration of FLOT1 as well as CA125 was significantly increased in patients with OC compared with healthy control (p < 0.01) and those with benign tumors (p < 0.05). The detection rate (above the upper limit of a cut-off value) of FLOT1 and CA125 was 77.78% and 72.22%, respectively, in patients with OC, which was increased to 88.89% in combination. The elevation of FLOT1 was confirmed in the serum of nude mice after the implantation of human OC cells. A high level of FLOT1 protein in the serum was positively correlated with the overexpression of FLOT1 protein in OC tissues. Furthermore, the level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of FLOT1 mRNA was significantly high in OC cells compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells, leading to an increase in FLOT1 mRNA expression. Application of a methylation inhibitor, 3-deazaadenosine, decreased FLOT1 mRNA expression in OC cells and suppressed tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that FLOT1 is a novel serum biomarker of OC and can be targeted by m<sup>6</sup>A modification inhibition. These data highlight the potential application of FLOT1 as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for patients with OC.

However, evidence on MACE risk according to Lp(a) level in atherosclerotic patients is insufficient, and more data is needed about whether type 2 diabetes (T2DM) additionally contributes to this risk. We aimed to investigate the association between Lp(a) and MACE in atherosclerotic patients and compare the magnitude of Lp(a)-MACE association in the patients with and without T2DM.
40066486	A Comprehensive Review of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Management of Ulcerative Colitis.	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, and urgency during defecation. While the primary site of involvement is the colon, UC can extend to encompass the entire rectum and colon. The causes and development mechanisms of UC are still not well understood; nonetheless, it is currently held that factors including environmental influences, genetic predispositions, intestinal mucosal integrity, gut microbiota composition, and immune dysregulation contribute to its development. Dysregulated immune responses are pivotal in the pathophysiology of UC, and these aberrant responses are considered key contributors to the disease onset. In patients with UC, immune cells become hyperactive and erroneously target normal intestinal tissue, resulting in inflammatory cascades and damage to the intestinal mucosa. The therapeutic strategies currently employed for UC include immunosuppressive agents such as aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. However, these treatments often prove costly and carry significant adverse effects - imposing a considerable burden on patients. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has attracted worldwide attention because of its multi-target approach, minimal side effects, cost-effectiveness, and favorable efficacy profiles. In this review, the ways in which TCM modulates inflammatory responses in the treatment of ulcerative colitis have been outlined. Research into TCM modalities for modulating inflammatory pathways in the treatment of UC, which has yielded promising advancements, including individual herbs, herbal formulations, and their derivatives, has been summarized. TCM has been utilized to treat UC and the immune system plays a key role in regulating intestinal homeostasis. It is imperative to facilitate large-scale evidence-based medical research and promote the clinical application of TCM in the management of UC.
40066485	Highly Stable, Excellent Foliar Adhesion and Anti-Photodegradation Nucleic Acid-Peptide Coacervates for Broad Agrochemicals Delivery.	Agrochemicals play a pivotal role in the management of pests and diseases and the way agrochemicals are utilized exerts significant impacts on the environment. Ensuring rational application and improving utilization rates of agrochemicals are major demands in developing green delivery systems. Herein, a model of nucleic acid-peptide coacervate (NPC) for agrochemical delivery is presented, which is formed by mixing negatively charged single-stranded DNAs with positively charged poly-L-lysine. The NPC microsystem exhibits broad loading capacities for various types of agrochemicals. Furthermore, the NPCs demonstrate remarkable protection against photodegradation for photosensitive agrochemicals. In the foliar interactions, the NPCs exhibit excellent wetting performances and foliar adhesion on hydrophobic cabbage leaves and wheat leaves infected with powdery mildew to facilitate direct spaying in practical applications. Subsequently, the NPC microsystem is stabilized against coalescence by a charged comb polymer. Then, the NPC loaded with emamectin benzoates (EBs) exhibited significantly higher insecticidal activity compared to free EBs. This enhanced efficacy can be attributed to the higher insect uptake efficiency of the NPC formulation, as evidenced by fluorescent imaging of mosquito larvae. This coacervate model provides a new biocompatible and highly efficient system for future agrochemical delivery that actively contributes to eco-friendly and sustainable agriculture.

40066471	Tracking In Vivo Lipolysis of Lipid Nanocarriers Using NIR-II Polarity-Sensitive Fluorescent Probes.	Elucidating in vivo lipolysis is crucial for clarifying the underlying mechanisms and in vivo fates of lipid-based nanocarriers, which are essential oral drug delivery carriers. Current mainstream methodologies use various in vitro digestion models to predict the in vivo performance of lipid formulations; however, their accuracy is often impeded by the complicated environment of the gastrointestinal tract. Although fluorescence labeling with conventional probes partly reveals the in vivo translocation of lipid nanocarriers, it fails to elucidate the lipolysis process because of poor signal discrimination among nanocarriers, free probes, and mixed micelles (lipolysis end-products). Here, a polarity-sensitive probe (PN-C18) with aggregation-caused quenching properties for labeling lipid nanocarriers is developed and optimized. PN-C18 successfully eliminates interference from both free probes and mixed micelles during lipolysis. In a representative in vitro lipolysis model, PN-C18 labeling shows stronger correlation between fluorescence intensity and lipolysis progression than those of previous methods. In vivo, the translocation and lipolysis of lipid nanoparticles are clearly visualized and effectively monitored, owing to the high tissue-penetrating capability of PN-C18 NIR-II photons. This study provides practical means for elucidating the in vivo fate of lipid-based drug delivery systems and offers valuable insights and reference for further studies in this domain.
40066463	The influence of genetic polymorphisms on cytokine profiles in pediatric COVID-19: a pilot study.	Recent studies have underscored the importance of genetic factors in predicting COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. While cytokine storms are crucial in disease severity, genetic predisposition significantly influences immune responses. Our study examined genes related to SARS-CoV-2 invasion <i>(ACE2 rs2074192</i>) and interferon-induced immunity (<i>IFNAR2 rs2236757, TYK2 rs2304256, OAS1 rs10774671, OAS3 rs10735079</i>). Additionally, we investigated genes linked to Kawasaki disease (<i>CD40 rs4813003, FCGR2A rs1801274, CASP3 rs113420705</i>) that play roles in immunogenesis.
40066457	Ferroptosis and cuproptosis in periodontitis: recent biological insights and therapeutic advances.	Periodontitis is a significant global public health issue associated with the onset and progression of various systemic diseases, thereby requiring additional research and clinical attention. Although ferroptosis and cuproptosis have emerged as significant areas of research in the medical field, their precise roles in the pathogenesis of periodontitis remain unclear. We aim to systematically summarize the current research on ferroptosis and cuproptosis in periodontal disease and investigate the roles of glutathione pathway and autophagy pathway in connecting ferroptosis and cuproptosis during periodontitis. Further, we propose that a homeostatic imbalance of copper and iron, driven by periodontal pathogens, may contribute to elevated periodontal oxidative stress, representing a potential unifying link between ferroptosis and cuproptosis involved in periodontitis. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying ferroptosis and cuproptosis in periodontitis, offering novel theoretical insights into its pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.
40066455	Identification and functional characterization of T-cell exhaustion-associated lncRNA AL031775.1 in osteosarcoma: a novel therapeutic target.	Osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone malignancy predominantly affecting children and adolescents, presents significant therapeutic challenges with a 5-year survival rate below 30% in metastatic cases. T-cell exhaustion, characterized by the overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules, contributes to osteosarcoma progression and immune evasion. Although targeting these inhibitory pathways has shown potential in restoring T-cell activity, the molecular regulators of T-cell depletion in osteosarcoma are poorly understood.
40066451	The role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification during macrophage metabolic reprogramming in human diseases and animal models.	Macrophage metabolic reprogramming refers to the process by which macrophages adjust their physiological pathways to meet survival and functional demands in different immune microenvironments. This involves a range of metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and cholesterol transport. By modulating the expression and activity of key enzymes and molecules within these pathways, macrophages can make the transition between pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes, thereby linking metabolic reprogramming to inflammatory responses and the progression of several diseases, such as atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and acute lung injury (ALI). N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification has emerged as a critical regulatory mechanism during macrophage metabolic reprogramming, broadly affecting RNA stability, translation, and degradation. Therapeutic strategies targeting m<sup>6</sup>A modification can regulate the onset of metabolic diseases by influencing macrophage metabolic changes, for instance, small molecule inhibitors of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) can affect glucose metabolism and inhibit IBD. This review systematically explores recent findings on the role and molecular mechanisms of m<sup>6</sup>A modification during macrophage metabolic reprogramming in human diseases and animal models, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.
40066450	Case Report: MOGAD - a steroid-responsive autoimmune meningoencephalitis mimicking infection.	This case series reports three patients initially managed for presumed infectious meningoencephalitis, who were ultimately diagnosed with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated disease (MOGAD). Their clinical presentations were strikingly similar to those of acute infectious meningoencephalitis, which posed a challenge to the initial diagnostic process. Notably, despite the absence of typical radiological changes associated with MOGAD, such as cerebral cortical encephalitis, these patients exhibited focal neurological and electroencephalographic changes. This series highlights the importance of considering MOG antibody testing in cases of aseptic meningoencephalitis, where early and accurate diagnosis can influence treatment decisions and patient outcomes in this steroid-responsive condition.
40066449	Case report: Efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for high tumour mutational burden malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast as revealed by comprehensive genomic profiling.	High tumour mutational burden (TMB-high), identified through comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP), is a biomarker that predicts the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. CGP testing is recommended for rare cancers with limited effective treatment options. Here, we provide the first report of a malignant phyllodes tumour of the breast demonstrating TMB-high status and effective treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient initially underwent right breast tumour resection and was diagnosed with a malignant phyllodes tumour. Recurrence was observed at the same site with metastases to the pulmonary hilar and right axillary lymph nodes. CGP testing revealed TMB-high status and microsatellite stable. Pembrolizumab was initiated after chemotherapy for the soft tissue sarcoma. After two treatment cycles, imaging revealed a partial response of the pulmonary hilar lymph nodes and necrotic enlargement of the right axillary lymph node. After four cycles, all lymph nodes had reduced in size. Eight months after ten cycles of pembrolizumab treatment, multiple new nodules were observed in both lungs, indicating disease progression. This case highlights the utility of CGP testing in rare cancers, demonstrating the first evidence of TMB-high malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast responding to pembrolizumab and underscoring the value of expanding CGP testing to improve therapeutic strategies for rare cancers.
40066448	BLIMP-1-dependent differentiation of T follicular helper cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory type 1 cells.	T-regulatory-type-1 (TR1) cells are a subset of interleukin-10-producing but Foxp3<sup>-</sup> Treg cells that arise in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. We have shown that systemic delivery of autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NP) triggers the formation of large pools of disease-suppressing Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells from cognate T-follicular helper (TFH) cell precursors. Here we show that, upon treatment withdrawal, these Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells spontaneously differentiate into a novel immunoregulatory Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subset that inherits epigenetic and transcriptional hallmarks of their precursors, including clonotypic T-cell receptors, and is distinct from other Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg subsets. Whereas the transcription factor BLIMP-1 is dispensable for development of conventional Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, it is necessary for development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 cells. In a model of central nervous system autoimmunity, abrogation of BLIMP-1 or IL-10 expression in the Foxp3<sup>-</sup> and/or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subsets inhibits their development or anti-encephalitogenic activity. Thus, the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway results in the generation of two distinct autoimmune disease-suppressing, IL-10-producing TR1 subsets that are distinguished by the expression of Foxp3 and Foxp3 target genes.
40066446	Exercise boost after surgery improves survival in model of metastatic breast cancer.	Despite advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment of the primary tumor, metastatic breast cancer tumors remain largely incurable, and their growth is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. There is therefore a critical need to identify ways to reduce metastatic tumor burden and increase breast cancer patient survival. While surgery and pharmacological treatments are the cornerstones of breast cancer intervention, epidemiological data suggests that physical activity can lower the risk of breast cancer development, improve adjuvant treatment tolerance, reduce the risk of disease recurrence and lower breast cancer-related death.
40066444	The changes of NLRs family members in the brain of AD mouse model and AD patients.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is primarily characterized by progressive neuron loss and memory impairment. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are crucial for immune regulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recently, NLRs have been identified as important contributors to neuroinflammation, thus presenting a potential approach for reducing inflammation and slowing AD progression.
40066442	A comprehensive prognostic and immunological implications of Gremlin 1 in lung adenocarcinoma.	Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a prevalent form of lung cancer globally, known for its high invasiveness, metastatic potential, and notable heterogeneity, particularly in its response to immunotherapy. Gremlin 1 (GREM1) is implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis in multiple cancers. However, GREM1's specific role in LUAD remains unclear. This study systematically examines GREM1 expression in LUAD and its association with tumor progression, immune microenvironment, and prognosis.
40066439	Tissue-resident memory T cells in urinary tract diseases.	Tissue-resident memory T (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells are a specialized subset of memory T cells that permanently reside in non-lymphoid tissues, providing localized and long-lasting immune protection. In the urinary tract, T<sub>RM</sub> cells play critical roles in defending against infections, mediating tumor immunity, and influencing the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic potential is immense, with promising avenues for vaccine development, enhanced cancer immunotherapy, and targeted treatments for chronic inflammation. However, challenges remain in harnessing their protective roles while minimizing their pathological effects, particularly in immunosuppressive or inflammatory microenvironments. This review explores the diverse roles of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in urinary tract diseases, including infections, cancer, and chronic inflammation, and discusses therapeutic strategies and future directions for leveraging T<sub>RM</sub> cells to improve clinical outcomes. By advancing our understanding of T<sub>RM</sub> cell biology, we can develop innovative interventions that balance their immune-protective and regulatory functions.
40066438	Update on tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative review.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, affecting approximately 1% of the adult population. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor, has emerged as an effective treatment for RA. This narrative review provides an update on TCZ's efficacy and safety based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world evidence (RWE). TCZ, available in subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) formulations, has shown significant benefits in RA management. Key clinical trials, including SAMURAI, OPTION, RADIATE, and TOWARD, have demonstrated TCZ's efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), particularly in patients with inadequate responses to methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. Long-term studies, such as STREAM, have highlighted TCZ's sustained efficacy and favorable safety profile over 5 years. The impact of TCZ on cardiovascular health, lipid profiles, and the risk of infections has been a focal point, with findings suggesting no significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk compared to other RA therapies. RWE further highlights the effectiveness of TCZ, identifying predictors of response, such as age, and emphasizes its suitability for biologic-naïve and overweight patients. Special considerations include TCZ use in RA-associated interstitial lung disease and amyloidosis. Overall, TCZ remains a pivotal option in RA treatment, with a well-established safety and efficacy profile supported by extensive clinical and real-world data.

Although systemic therapies have improved considerably over the last decade, up to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma still die due to disease progression. Oncological treatment at the end-of-life phase is challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and type of systemic therapy received by melanoma patients in their end-of-life phase.
40066429	Pterygopalatine Fossa- A Keystone Area in Disease Progression and Management in Rhino-Oculo-Cerebral Mucormycosis.	To analyze the involvement of disease in pterygopalatine fossa (PPF), its relation to regional extension of disease and the treatment outcome in rhino-oculo-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM). A prospective study was done including 50 patients diagnosed with ROCM. All patients were examined and evaluated with high resolution CT and MRI imaging. Intravenous liposomal Amphotericin B was started, and endoscopic debridement was done based on the disease extension. Liposomal Amphotericin B is given until complete response for atleast a total dose of 3-4 g. T. Posaconasole 300 mg is given for 3-4 months in case of orbital or intracranial disease. 58% (29) patients showed involvement of disease in PPF. In MRI T1 contrast images, 21 of these patients showed hypo-intense lesion in the PPF and had necrotic tissue in PPF during surgery. Whereas, hyper-intense lesion that depicts inflammatory tissue was seen in the 8 patients. The tissue from these lesions showed aseptate fungal hyphae elements in histopathology in all these patients. 96% of patients with orbital mucormycosis (25 patients), 92% of patients with palatal mucormycosis (24 patients) and all patients with intracranial (15 patients) involvement had correlating PPF involvement in the disease process. The pterygopalatine fossa is the nidus for spread of disease and an important prognostic factor for extent of spread. Radiological imaging with CT and MRI are useful to assess the involvement of disease in PPF, and it is important to remove this disease during endoscopic debridement.
40066428	Applicability of Paediatric Kerrison's Punch in Endoscopic Transcanal Mastoidectomy-Harnessing a Fresh Perspective.	The science of endoscopic ear surgery is gaining popularity and increasing momentum with reported outcomes comparable to conventional microscopic ear surgery. Endoscopic ear surgery has numerous advantages including access to visualization of occult areas of middle ear like sinus tympani. The endoscopic transcanal mastoidectomy via conventional drilling technique(Inside-out) has also established itself as a successful procedure with excellent post-operative outcomes. However, transcanal drilling is a challenging procedure as it requires extreme coordination, repeated irrigation and suction, injury to vital structures, tympanomeatal flap tear. We here propose a novel technique of doing Endoscopic transcanal mastoidectomy using upcutting and downcutting, straight and angled Paediatric Kerrison's punch to remove the attic and posterosuperior bony canal wall with substantial benefits of significant reduction in chances of injury to vital structures, no repeated suction-irrigation required, less operative time and good visualization. Paediatric Kerrison's punch is an instrument which is essentially available in the armamentarium of all ENT surgeons as it has been used since a long time in dacryocystorhinostomy surgery. In our quest for simplifying transcanal mastoidectomy, we have devised a novel utility of this same punch in the otology surgery. And in our experience, it has proven a pragmatic instrument in the otology surgeries as much as it is in the nasal surgeries.
40066427	Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte Ratio: A Shunned Entity as a Novelty in Diagnosing Peripheral Vestibular Disorders.	Vestibular vertigo is a condition characterized by dizziness or imbalance, often resulting from changes in head position. With an incidence of 1.4% in adults, vertigo is a common symptom in the general population (Oxford Textbook of Vertigo and Imbalance, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2013). To study the potential association of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in patients with peripheral vestibular disorders. A one year cross-sectional observational study with a total of 51 confirmed cases of peripheral vestibular disorders was conducted in the department ENT and HNS. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio(NLR) and DHI scoring was analysed. Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis. 41.18% of patients in the study were male, while 58.82% of the patients were female. In terms of numbers, it was discovered that the mean age of females (50.97) exceeded the mean age of males (48.43). The DHI score indicated a severe handicap in 58.82% of the study subjects with a mean NLR 6.93, while 39.22% participants showed moderate handicap with a mean NLR 7.20. Majority of the study subjects ellicited mild to moderate stress levels with respect to their NLR. Based on our results, we have concluded that neutrophil to lymphocyte plays a major role as a marker of peripheral vestibular diseases. With the majority of patients exhibiting moderate to severe handicap on dizziness handicap inventory scoring and mild to moderate stress levels; neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio should be touted as a marker for peripheral vertigo.
40066425	Global Prevalence of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has increased worldwide in recent years, becoming a significant public health concern. One of the most important complications experienced by individuals with OSA is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). This study aims to investigate the prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, and the Google Scholar search engine were systematically searched for studies investigating the prevalence of EDS in people with OSA up to December 2023. Data analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 2), employing a random effects model. The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I² index. In review of 15 studies with a combined sample size of 42,924 individuals found that the global prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA was 39.9% (95% CI: 34.4-45.7). The regression results indicated that as the sample size increased, the prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, an increase in the years of the studies conducted was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA, although this trend was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.856). Based on the results of this study, the global prevalence of EDS in patients with OSA is significant. Given the increasing prevalence of OSA, it is crucial for health decisionmakers to recognize the importance of this issue, raise public awareness, and address the dangerous effects of EDS on the population.
40066422	The Impact of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Treatment Planning of Attico Antral Disease.	Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a useful method for investigating cholesteatomas since it may be performed without the need for a contrast agent and can prevent unnecessary "second look" operations. This study aims to evaluate the role of DWI-MRI in monitoring residual or recurrent disease and preventing second look procedures when physical examination is difficult or CT is ambiguous. This single centric, cross-sectional study was conducted on 33 patients with suspected cases of attico-antral disease at a tertiary sector, subjected to DWI sequence of MRI for a study period of 1.6 years. The average age of patients was 36 ± 14.40 years with male predominance (66.66%). A right-sided laterality with hearing loss and ear discharge was commonest symptom. MRI findings and surgical presence of cholesteatoma was present in 81.81% cases. Sensitivity, Specificity of MRI in the diagnosis of AAD was 100%. The study concluded that DWI-MRI is an important tool in the diagnosis of suspected cases of AAD with 100% diagnostic test characteristics.
40066416	Assessment of Prevalence and Factors Affecting Trismus in Cases of Oral and Oropharyngeal Malignancies after Complete Treatment.	Trismus, or restricted mouth opening is a very common and often neglected side effect in oral and oropharyngeal malignancies owing to the disease itself as well as its treatment with surgery and/or chemoradiation. This study aims at assessing the prevalence of trismus occurring after complete treatment in diagnosed cases of oral and oropharyngeal malignancy and to assess various risk factors associated with development of trismus in these patients. A prospective, observational study conducted over a 2 years at a tertiary care hospital. All newly diagnosed cases of oral and oropharyngeal malignancy seeking treatment were included. Maximal mouth opening as the interincisoral distance measured using a Vernier Calliper was done so in each patient at presentation before initiation of treatment, before adjuvant therapy, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment and the results were analysed. The primary modality of treatment, type of surgery, reconstruction performed and patient's recovery were monitored. Out of 72 patients included, 60 had oral cancers and the remaining oropharyngeal. The overall prevalence was 61.1%. The following variables were found to be associated with higher prevalence of trismus- Tumour size, advanced primary disease (T3, T4 disease), oral submucous fibrosis and radiation. There is a high prevalence of trismus in treated patients of oral and oropharyngeal malignancies more so in cases of oral cancer undergoing surgery with adjuvant therapy. There is a need to find treatment modalities with better functional outcomes and direct oral rehabilitation strategies towards alleviation of trismus.
40066409	Expression of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in Nasal Polyp: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	Nasal polyp (NP) is a pathological benign mass that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. This lesion is occasionally associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which is named chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) indicates abnormal cell proliferation which may help assess the nasopharyngeal lesions and upper airway cancers. This study aimed to examine the PCNA expression in NP tissue. This study was conducted under the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A thorough search using relevant keywords was performed on the electronic database to identify studies examining the PCNA expression in NP. Meta-analysis on pooled single group proportion and means of PCNA expression was conducted by the metamean and metaprop functions in R software (version 4.4.0). Quality assessment was done according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Ten articles were included in this study. The PCNA expression in NP was higher than in normal nasal mucosa (NNM), while its expression in NP was lower than in inverted papilloma (IP). The mean percentage of PCNA expression in NP was 15.73% (95%-CI[2.87-28.58]) with considerable heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 97%[96-98%],<i>p</i>-value < 0.01). Based on a cutoff staining (> 5%), 64% of NP samples were PCNA-positive (95%-CI[42-81%]) with high heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 76%[47-89%], <i>p</i>-value < 0.01). NP tissue has a relatively high expression of the PCNA oncoprotein based on the immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Although more than half of NP samples were positive for PCNA, still the mean expression of this marker in NP was lower than in IP tissue.

40066401	Epidemiology of Iodine Deficiency Disorders in North-Eastern Part of Karnataka, India.	The north-eastern part of Karnataka lies on the Deccan Plateau of the South Indian Peninsula, characterized by black soil. This region is known for its mineral resources, including a gold ore mine in Hatti (Raichur District), an iron ore mine in Toranagallu (Bellary District), and uranium deposits in Gogi (Yadgir District). However, the soil in this area is deficient in iodine, leading to iodine deficiency disorders such as goiter and hypothyroidism. More than 80,000 cases of these disorders have been reported in the region, along with a few cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease. The younger age group is predominantly affected, with a higher prevalence in females compared to males. As a result, hypothyroidism contributes to pregnancy-related complications and obesity in women. Early detection is possible due to the visible swelling in the neck, prompting patients to seek medical attention. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment can reduce goiter size, restore the body to a euthyroid state, and alleviate symptoms.

A total of 50 patients were selected and were operated for sinonasal diseases. Post operative after nasal pack removal manuka honey was applied. Post- operative healing was assessed and scoring was done. The present study was to evaluate and observe faster healing after application of Manuka honey. The median time to achieve clean cavity, mucosal transition and complete epithelialization was 14.0 (14.0-14.0) days. The present study concluded that application of manuka honey promotes faster healing of nasal cavity and lessens chances of postoperative infections.
40066386	Allergen Immunotherapy in Autoimmune Terrain: A Case Study.	Allergen immunotherapy (AIT), or specific immunotherapy (SIT), is an effective treatment for inducing immune tolerance to specific allergens. It is widely used for allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and Hymenoptera venom allergies, with recent applications to food allergies and atopic dermatitis. Despite its benefits, the use of SIT in patients with autoimmune diseases is controversial due to concerns about its potential to induce or exacerbate autoimmune conditions. This report examines a case of autoimmune hypothyroidism developing during AIT and the management decisions involved. A 26-year-old female with a history of moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis and childhood asthma presented with severe malaise, weakness, and fatigue over the past three months. She had a family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The patient had been on AIT for six months and was using intranasal fluticasone furoate nasal spray daily. Initial laboratory investigations prior to AIT showed normal thyroid function. Three months into AIT, she developed hypothyroidism, confirmed by elevated TSH levels and positive anti-TPO antibodies. A causality assessment suggested a "possible" link between AIT and hypothyroidism. However, a risk-benefit analysis favored the continuation of AIT along with the initiation of L-thyroxine therapy. After six months of thyroid hormone replacement, her TSH levels normalized, and her allergic rhinitis symptoms significantly improved. This case underscores the complexity of managing coexisting allergic and autoimmune conditions. The decision to continue AIT, despite the onset of hypothyroidism, was based on a thorough risk-benefit analysis, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment plans. Understanding the immunological mechanisms, particularly the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, is crucial. Neutrophils play a significant role as both effectors and modulators of immune responses. The clinical pharmacologist's recommendation was informed by these factors and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy. The continuation of AIT was justified by its benefits in managing allergic rhinitis and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone therapy. This case highlights the importance of personalized medicine and continuous monitoring in treatment decisions for patients with coexisting conditions.
40066385	Prevalence of Elevated IgG4 in Patients with Nasopharynx and Laryngopharynx Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Elevated Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels have been implicated in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including those affecting the nasopharynx and laryngopharynx. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated IgG4 and associated risk factors in patients with nasopharynx and laryngopharynx diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was performed from inception until July 2024. Keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms A random-effects model was used to pool prevalence estimates, and heterogeneity was assessed using the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test.From 922 records, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of elevated IgG4 levels was 33.9% (95% CI: 19.1%-52.6%), with significant heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 85.433%, P < 0.001). The highest frequency was reported in a Chinese study (96.9%), and the lowest in a Turkish study (0.2%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results, and no significant bias was detected. The findings illustrated a high level of elevated IgG4 levels among patients with nasopharynx and laryngopharynx diseases, with considerable variability across different populations and settings, highlighting the need for further research to understand the clinical implications and diagnostic utility of IgG4 in ENT diseases.
40066373	Extralobar Pulmonary Sequestration in an Adult Female Patient Mimicking Lung Abscess: A Case Report.	Congenital lung malformations (CLMs) are rare developmental anomalies of the lung, including congenital pulmonary airway malformations, bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), congenital lobar overinflation, bronchogenic cyst, and isolated congenital bronchial atresia. CLMs occur in 4 out of 10,000 live births. BPS can be intralobar or extralobar sequestration. The condition is often misdiagnosed; therefore, more research on the clinical characteristics of pulmonary sequestration should be carried out to improve the preoperative diagnosis rate. The goal of our case report is to increase awareness of this condition, to diagnose and treat it early, so that it is resected before the development of complications appear. We presented a case of a 32-year-old female patient who presented with a lung abscess and was diagnosed with pulmonary sequestration.
40066372	Application of Ultrasound Localization Microscopy in Evaluating the Type 2 Diabetes Progression.	Type 2 diabetes is considered as a chronic inflammatory disease in which the dense microvasculature reorganizes with disease progression and is highly correlated with β cell mass and islet function. In this study, we constructed rat models of type 2 diabetes and used ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) imaging to noninvasively map the pancreatic microvasculature at microscopy resolution in vivo to reflect β cell loss and islet function deterioration, and evaluate the efficacy after anti-cytokine immunotherapy. It was unveiled that ULM morphological and hemodynamic parameters have a strong link with β cell loss and deterioration of pancreatic islet function. This correlation aligns with the observed pathological alterations in the microvessels of islet and demonstrated that ULM can effectively mirror the functionality of β cells during rapid fluctuations in blood glucose levels by observing changes in mean velocity. Furthermore, it was revealed that treatment with anti-cytokine immunotherapy enhances the function and health of β cells by restoring the microvascular environment. Remarkable improvements in vessel morphology (measured by fractal dimension) and hemodynamics (indicated by mean velocity and vessel density) were noted following the anti-cytokine immunotherapy, signifying a significant enhancement at the treatment's conclusion (<i>P</i> < 0.05). These observations suggested that ULM technology holds promise as a visible and efficient tool for monitoring the effectiveness of anti-cytokine immunotherapy in managing type 2 diabetes. Pancreatic microvessel-based ULM may serve as a novel noninvasive method to assess β cells, providing a valuable clinical tool for tracking the progression of type 2 diabetes.
40066360	Selenium-modified hydroxyapatite titanium coating: enhancing osteogenesis and inhibiting cancer in bone invasion by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) frequently invades the jaw, and surgical treatment often leads to bone defects requiring reconstruction with titanium plates. To enhance the anti-tumor and bone regeneration properties of titanium, a selenium-modified hydroxyapatite coating was developed on titanium surfaces.
40066356	Adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation in post-PCI patients: a latent class analysis.	Coronary heart disease seriously jeopardizes human health and has become a principal public health problem of global concern. While percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) repairs narrowed arteries and extends patients' lives, cardiac rehabilitation offers additional benefits post-PCI. Numerous previous studies have shown that cardiac rehabilitation can inhibit the progression of atherosclerotic plaques in patients after coronary intervention, effectively controlling patients' clinical symptoms and improving their quality of life. However, the current status of adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation is poor, and the variation in adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation among post-PCI patients in China are not well understood. This study aimed to identify the heterogeneity of adherence to phase I cardiac rehabilitation and its influencing factors in post-PCI patients through latent class analysis (LCA) to support individualized interventions.
40066353	Modeling thoracic aortic genetic variants in the zebrafish: useful for predicting clinical pathogenicity?	Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) significantly impact cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A large subset of TAAD cases, particularly those with an earlier onset, is linked to heritable genetic defects. Despite progress in characterizing genes associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic heritable TAAD, the causative gene remains unknown in most cases. Another important bottleneck in the correct and timely diagnosis of TAAD is the large proportion of variants of unknown significance (VUS) that are routinely encountered upon medical genetic testing. Reliable functional modeling data is required to accurately identify new causal genes and to determine the pathogenicity of VUS. To address this gap, our collaborative effort-comprising teams from Yale University, University of Kentucky, and Ghent University-explores a novel approach: modeling TAAD in zebrafish. Leveraging the unique advantages of this animal model promises to allow for accelerated variant pathogenicity assessment, ultimately enhancing patient care. In this review, we critically explore the currently available zebrafish-based approaches that can be used for testing pathogenicity of genes and variants related to TAAD, and we offer an outlook on the implementation of these strategies for clinical applications.
40066352	Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of hub genes in ischemic heart failure and atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) frequently coexist and mutually influence each other. The association between AF and the subtype of HF, Ischaemic heart failure (IHF), remains insufficiently described, despite their high prevalence. Hence, comprehending their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic targets are urgently needed.
40066351	Diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence models in detecting congenital heart disease in the second-trimester fetus through prenatal cardiac screening: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a major contributor to morbidity and infant mortality and imposes the highest burden on global healthcare costs. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of CHD contribute to enhanced neonatal outcomes and survival rates; however, there is a shortage of proficient examiners in remote regions. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ultrasound provides a potential solution to improve the diagnostic accuracy of fetal CHD screening.
40066350	Association between estimated glucose disposal rate and incident cardiovascular disease in a population with Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic syndrome stages 0-3: insights from CHARLS.	Estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) is a reliable marker of insulin resistance (IR), which has been proven to be strongly linked to cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, the link between eGDR and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals exhibiting Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic (CKM) syndrome stages 0-3 remains ambiguous.
40066349	Intraprocedural activated clotting time and heparin dosage in pulsed field ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.	Whether the intraprocedural anticoagulation regimen and activated clotting time (ACT) in pulsed field ablation (PFA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) are the same as those for radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is currently unknown.
40066346	Burden of rotavirus and other microorganisms in hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis in Yangon, Myanmar, before the introduction of rotavirus vaccine.	In developing countries, acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years. In Myanmar, no comprehensive study has been done to investigate the microorganisms responsible for AGE among hospitalized children. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the microorganisms responsible for AGE in children hospitalized in Myanmar before the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine.
40066345	Pregnancy and pulmonary artery hypertension: Management challenges.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a term used to describe a complex heterogenous group of conditions defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of more than 20 mmHg at rest on right-heart catheterization. PH in pregnancy is associated with high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality and poor fetal outcomes. Currently, pregnancy in these women is classified as modified WHO class IV (pregnancy contraindicated). More recent data suggest that the prognosis varies with the underlying aetiology as well as with PH severity. Consequently, management during pregnancy must be individualised, with patients cared for in a tertiary unit as part of an experienced multidisciplinary team. In this article, we will discuss the importance of preconception counselling, the impact of the haemodynamic changes induced by pregnancy, the maternal and fetal risks of pregnancy in women with PH, and how these can be minimised by close antenatal, intrapartum and post-partum care and the development of individualised pregnancy plans.
40066344	The root of the matter: Linking oral health to chronic diseases prevention.	Oral health is increasingly recognized as a vital component of general health, influencing various systemic systems. Periodontal diseases, particularly periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the gums and supporting tissues of teeth, have far-reaching implications beyond the oral cavity. Treating periodontitis not only benefits oral health but also plays a crucial role in reducing the burden of these chronic conditions, improving patient outcomes and lowering healthcare costs. Regular screenings for oral health issues, especially in patients with conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, should become standard practice in medical settings. Additionally, oral health professionals must be empowered to identify early signs of systemic diseases, creating a bidirectional flow of referrals between dentists and physicians. Ultimately, prioritizing oral health not only enhances individual well-being but also serves the greater public health good.
40066342	Pulmonary arterial hypertension in Latin America. The age and comorbidity paradox.	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been classically described as a disease in young adults, predominantly females with no comorbidities. However, in recent registries, the epidemiology has changed to older patients with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, systemic hypertension, and coronary heart disease. Nevertheless, there is not enough inclusion of these patients in clinical trials. In contrast, in Latin America, registries have shown that PAH patients are younger and have fewer comorbidities, which raises the question of whether Latin American patients present a different phenotype or if we are lagging behind developed countries and whether we will experience a change in epidemiology in the next couple of years. We analyzed these trends in this review.
40066341	Thromboprophylaxis and adult congenital heart disease: The latest on indications, risk scoring and therapy.	Advances in medical care have significantly extended the lifespan of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), allowing most to survive into adulthood. However, they continue to face significant cardiovascular morbidity, particularly atrial arrhythmias (AA), heart failure, and thromboembolic (TE) events. TE events in adult CHD patients arise from various factors, including AA, intracardiac repairs, cyanotic CHD, Fontan palliation, pregnancy, and mechanical heart valves (MHV). As randomized clinical trials are lacking, most current guidelines rely on observational data and expert opinions, leading to inherent variability. While vitamin K antagonists are the only option for patients with MHV and significant mitral stenosis, direct oral anticoagulants appear to be a reasonable choice for other indications. In the presence of AA, complex conditions alone may justify anticoagulation, whereas thromboembolic and haemorrhagic risks should be evaluated individually for simpler lesions. This review summarizes the available evidence and makes relevant recommendations regarding thromboprophylaxis in ACHD patients, focusing on indications, risk scores, and therapies.
