The association of different sensory inputs enhances brain plasticity in patients after stroke, but no studies have associated Action Observation Training (AOT) delivered in immersive virtual reality (VR) with Focal Vibration (FV) to elicit a kinesthetic illusion coherent with the observed task to improve motor function.
40066693	xDev: a mixed-signal, software-defined neurotechnology interface platform for accelerated system development.	<i>Objective.</i>Advances in electronics and materials science have led to the development of sophisticated components for clinical and research neurotechnology systems. However, instrumentation to easily evaluate how these components function in a complete system does not yet exist. In this work, we set out to design and validate a software-defined mixed-signal routing fabric, 'xDev', that enables neurotechnology system designers to rapidly iterate, evaluate, and deploy advanced multi-component systems.<i>Approach.</i>We developed a set of system requirements for xDev, and implemented a design based on a 16 × 16 analog crosspoint multiplexer. We then tested the impedance and switching characteristics of the design, assessed signal gain and crosstalk attenuation across biological and high-speed digital signaling frequencies, and evaluated the ability of xDev to flexibly reroute microvolt-scale amplitude and high-speed signals. Finally, we conducted an intraoperative<i>in vivo</i>deployment of xDev to rapidly conduct neuromodulation experiments using diverse neurotechnology submodules.<i>Main results.</i>The xDev system impedance matching, crosstalk attenuation, and frequency response characteristics accurately transmitted signals over a broad range of frequencies, encapsulating features typical of biosignals and extending into high-speed digital ranges. Microvolt-scale biosignals and 600 Mbps Ethernet connections were accurately routed through the fabric. These performance characteristics culminated in an<i>in vivo</i>demonstration of the flexibility of the system via implanted spinal electrode arrays in an ovine model.<i>Significance.</i>xDev represents a first-of-its-kind, low-cost, software-defined neurotechnology development accelerator platform. Through the public, open-source distribution of our designs, we lower the obstacles facing the development of future neurotechnology systems.
40066664	Irritable bowel syndrome and structural brain changes - A two-sample Mendelian randomization study of cortical thickness and surface area.	The relationship between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and structural changes in various regional cortical areas remains unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to explore the potential association between IBS and Structural Brain Changes.
40066661	The Glutamate/GABA-Glutamine Cycle: Insights, Updates, and Advances.	Synaptic homeostasis of the principal neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA is tightly regulated by an intricate metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes known as the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle. In this cycle, astrocytes take up glutamate and GABA from the synapse and convert these neurotransmitters into glutamine. Astrocytic glutamine is subsequently transferred to neurons, serving as the principal precursor for neuronal glutamate and GABA synthesis. The glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle integrates multiple cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, uptake, synthesis, and metabolism. All of these processes are deeply interdependent and closely coupled to cellular energy metabolism. Astrocytes display highly active mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and several unique metabolic features, including glycogen storage and pyruvate carboxylation, which are essential to sustain continuous glutamine release. However, new roles of oligodendrocytes and microglia in neurotransmitter recycling are emerging. Malfunction of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle can lead to severe synaptic disruptions and may be implicated in several brain diseases. Here, I review central aspects and recent advances of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle to highlight how the cycle is functionally connected to critical brain functions and metabolism. First, an overview of glutamate, GABA, and glutamine transport is provided in relation to neurotransmitter recycling. Then, central metabolic aspects of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the critical metabolic roles of glial cells. Finally, I discuss how aberrant neurotransmitter recycling is linked to neurodegeneration and disease, focusing on astrocyte metabolic dysfunction and brain lipid homeostasis as emerging pathological mechanisms. Instead of viewing the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle as individual biochemical processes, a more holistic and integrative approach is needed to advance our understanding of how neurotransmitter recycling modulates brain function in both health and disease.
40066614	Superficial Temporal Artery-Middle Cerebral Artery Bypass Treatment Planning for Cerebral Ischaemia Based on Multi-Scale Model.	Superficial temporal artery and middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass surgery is an effective method to enhance cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ischemic patients. However, the effectiveness of various bypass techniques varies with the diversity of Circle of Willis (CoW) structures. This study aims to develop a physiologically realistic hemodynamic model to optimize STA-MCA bypass planning for cerebral ischemia patients with different CoW structures. This study developed a 0D-1D geometric multi-scale haemodynamic model that coupled the stenosis model and the cerebral autoregulation model. Based on this model, nine CoW structural models before and after end-to-side (E-S) and side-to-side (S-S) bypass were constructed, and their haemodynamic properties were calculated to evaluate the efficacy of different bypass methods in different CoW structures. The validity of the model and results was verified by clinical data. For the mRACA1, mRACA1-fRPCA1, and mACoA CoW structures, there was a risk of hyperperfusion (13.96%, 12.81%, and -2.64%) after E-S bypass but not S-S bypass. In the mACoA-mLPCoA structure, both bypass techniques posed hyperperfusion risk (112.41% and 30.57%). Other CoW structures showed that E-S bypass could restore CBF without the risk of hyperperfusion. The model's predictions were within 5% of clinical data. The mRACA1, mRACA1-fRPCA1, and mACoA structures were suitable for S-S bypass; the mACoA-mLPCoA structure was not suitable for bypass, and other CoW structures favored E-S bypass. The developed model can effectively simulate the cerebral hemodynamic environment and predict the risk of hyperperfusion, offering valuable insights for personalized bypass planning in cerebral ischemia patients.
40066536	A Case of Screening Macroprolactinemia Using Polyethylene Glycol Precipitation Method.	Hyperprolactinemia is an endocrine disorder characterized by abnormally elevated levels of prolactin (PRL) in the serum. Macroprolactinemia refers to the condition where more than 60% of the prolactin circulating in the peripheral blood is composed of high molecular weight macroprolactins. These macroprolactins typically have low biological activity but can lead to a false increase in serum prolactin levels.
40066534	Correlations of Prealbumin, Procalcitonin, and Brain Natriuretic Peptide with Acute Respiratory Infection in Children.	We aimed to investigate the correlations of prealbumin (PA), procalcitonin (PCT) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in children.
40066521	The impact of adolescent traumatic brain injury on health risk behaviors.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with disinhibition, impulsivity, and other sequelae which may make adolescent TBI survivors more likely to engage in health risk behaviors though this has not yet been comprehensively investigated. Extant literature on TBI-related health risk behaviors is limited by a dearth of studies on adolescents, reliance on self-report of TBI, lack of an orthopedic injury (OI) control group, and the fact that TBI's effects on various health risk behavior domains are generally examined separately. The current study clarifies the impact of TBI on health risk behaviors among adolescents, specifically those related to 1) unintentional injury and violence (including aggression- and suicide-related behaviors); 2) tobacco use; and 3) alcohol and other drug use in an analytic sample of 74 adolescents (<i>n</i> = 43 for youth with a complicated mild to severe TBI, <i>n</i> = 31 for youth with an OI). Results indicate youth with a TBI exhibited more suicide-related health risk behaviors at 12-month follow-up (<i>F</i> = 6.063; <i>p</i> = .016; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .079), as well as a nonsignificant trend toward greater marijuana use (<i>F</i> = 3.747; <i>p</i> = .057; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .050), compared to youth with an OI while controlling for age. Youth with an OI exhibited greater increases in violence and victimization over the 12-month post-injury period compared to youth with a TBI (<i>F</i> = 4.243; <i>p</i> = .044; η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .067) while controlling for age. Interventions to reduce psychological distress and improve social connectedness, problem-solving, coping, and emotion regulation skills may be most relevant for youth who receive a TBI. Emotion regulation and anger management skills may be relevant for youth who receive an OI.
40066518	LAMP2-FLOT2 interaction enhances autophagosome-lysosome fusion to protect the septic heart in response to ILC2.	Cardiac dysfunction is a serious complication of sepsis-induced multiorgan failure in intensive care units and is characterized by an uncontrolled immune response to overwhelming infection. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), as a part of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in the inflammatory process of heterogeneous cardiac disorders. However, the role of ILC2 in regulating sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that autophagic flux blockage exacerbated inflammatory response and cardiac dysfunction, which was associated with mortality of sepsis. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model, we observed an expansion of ILC2s in the septic heart. Furthermore, IL4 derived from ILC2 mitigated cardiac inflammatory responses and improved cardiac function during sepsis. Additionally, IL4 enhanced LAMP2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2) expression through STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation to stabilize lysosomal homeostasis and rescue the impaired autophagic flux during sepsis. Notably, LAMP2 was preferentially bound to FLOT2 (flotillin 2) after IL4 exposure, and the interaction enhanced autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cardiac endothelial cells. Loss of FLOT2 reversed the regulatory effects of LAMP2 on autophagy mediated by IL4, leading to autophagosome accumulation and suppressed autophagosome clearance. Conclusively, these findings provide novel insights that ILC2 regulates incomplete autophagic flux to protect septic heart and expand our understanding of immunoregulation for sepsis.<b>Abbreviation</b>: ACTB: actin beta; ACTN: actinin, alpha; ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; ANXA5/annexin V: annexin A5; AO: acridine orange; BECN1/Beclin1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CKM: creatine kinase, muscle; CKB: creatine kinase, brain; CLP: cecal ligation and puncture; CO: cardiac output; CQ: chloroquine; CTS: cathepsin; DAPI: 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EC: endothelial cell; EF: ejection fraction; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FLOT: flotillin; FS: fractional shortening; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GATA3: GATA binding protein 3; GLB1/β-Gal: galactosidase, beta 1; HCMEC: human cardiac microvascular endothelial cell; IL: interleukin; ILC: innate lymphoid cell; IL1RL1/ST2: interleukin 1 receptor-like 1; IL4c: IL4 complex; IL7R/CD127: interleukin 7 receptor; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; LAMP: lysosomal-associated membrane protein; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LMP: lysosome membrane permeabilization; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LVEDd: left ventricular end-diastole diameter; LVEDV: left ventricular end-diastole volume; LVESd: left ventricular end-systolic diameter; LVESV: left ventricular end-systole volume; MAN: mannosidase alpha; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MS: mass spectrometry; PECAM1/CD31: platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; PTPRC/CD45: protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C; RORC/RORγt: RAR related orphan receptor gamma; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TBX21/T-bet: T-box 21; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; THY1/CD90.2: thymus cell antigen 1, theta; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-translocating ATPase; VIM: vimentin.
40066510	An In Situ Curing, Shear-Responsive Biomaterial Designed for Durable Embolization of Microvasculature.	Endovascular embolization is a minimally-invasive technique whereby blood vessels supplying pathological structures are selectively occluded with various embolic agents. In many scenarios, it is desirable for the embolic to distally penetrate to the level of the microvasculature, which maximizes devascularization. Existing agents exhibit inconsistent distal penetration and have other limitations including tendency for proximal reflux, patient pain during infusion, lack of fluoroscopic radiopacity, potential for catheter adhesion, susceptibility to recanalization, and other usability challenges. NeoCast is an in situ curing, solvent-free, non-adhesive biomaterial composed of polydimethylsiloxane, bismuth trioxide, and fumed silica that possesses shear-responsive properties enabling manual injectability through commercially-available microcatheters with large and small diameter lumens. Here, embolization performance with and without flow arrest, in both arterial and venous preclinical anatomies is reported. NeoCast reproducibly achieves a rate of distal penetration with microvascular occlusion that is superior to existing agents, exhibits excellent fluoroscopic visibility, and provides durable occlusion. There is mild inflammation when NeoCast is infused into blood vessels and absence of neurotoxicity when implanted directly into brain tissue. The engineered NeoCast material is poised to become a next-generation, liquid embolic agent for applications in which distal microvascular occlusion is desired.
40066507	Sensing Dog Brain Reactions to Smell by AI Speckle Pattern Analysis.	Investigation of a dog's brain activity related to their outstanding olfactory capabilities has been a topic of interest among researchers. For this specific study, we identified three areas of the brain that have been shown in previous studies to be relevant during the process of smell discrimination in dogs: the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and amygdala. We set up a detection structure system based on laser and a camera to capture speckle patterns on the three regions in four dog breeds for smell stimuli: garlic, menthol, alcohol, and marijuana. The results were analyzed using an XGBoost model. Our analysis revealed that the amygdala plays a crucial role in scent differentiation. Our work offers insight into leveraging the features that characterize distinct scents in the canine brain, paving the way for developing a compact device that can interpret and translate a dog's olfactory perceptions for human understanding.
40066456	Influence of gut microbial metabolites on tumor immunotherapy: mechanisms and potential natural products.	In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, individual differences in efficacy have been observed in clinical practice. There is increasing evidence that gut microbial metabolites influence the efficacy of distal tumor immunotherapy via the gut-liver axis, the gut-brain axis and the gut-breast axis, a process that may involve modulating the expression of immune cells and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we systematically explore the relationship between gut microbial metabolites and tumor immunotherapy, and examine the corresponding natural products and their mechanisms of action. The in-depth exploration of this research area will provide new ideas and strategies to enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy and mitigate adverse effects.
40066444	The changes of NLRs family members in the brain of AD mouse model and AD patients.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is primarily characterized by progressive neuron loss and memory impairment. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are crucial for immune regulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recently, NLRs have been identified as important contributors to neuroinflammation, thus presenting a potential approach for reducing inflammation and slowing AD progression.
40066417	Brain Metastasis from Oral Cancer Presenting with Seizures and Cranial Nerve Palsy in Immediate Post Operative Period- A Rare Occurrence.	Metastasis is the hallmark of malignancy but the spread to brain is an exceedingly rare occurrence for oral cancer. Two of our patients who underwent definitive surgery for oral cancer developed manifestations of Central nervous system (CNS) involvement within 7 days of surgery, one with seizures and other with cranial nerve palsies (3rd and 7th ), who were otherwise symptom free for CNS involvement preoperatively. These cases highlight the need for thorough metastasis workup including CNS.
40066370	Vagal heart rate variability during rapid eye movement sleep reduces negative memory bias.	Emotional memories change over time, but the mechanisms supporting this change are not well understood. Sleep has been identified as one mechanism that supports memory consolidation, with sleep selectively benefitting negative emotional consolidation at the expense of neutral memories, with specific oscillatory events linked to this process. In contrast, the consolidation of neutral and positive memories, compared to negative memories, has been associated with increased vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) during wakefulness. However, how HRV during sleep contributes to emotional memory consolidation remains unexplored. We investigated how sleep oscillations (i.e., sleep spindles) and vagal activity during sleep contribute to the consolidation of neutral and negative memories. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject, cross-over design, we examined the impact of pharmacological vagal suppression using zolpidem on overnight emotional memory consolidation. Thirty-three participants encoded neutral and negative pictures in the morning, followed by picture recognition tests before and after a night of sleep. Zolpidem or placebo was administered in the evening before overnight sleep, and participants were monitored with electroencephalography and electrocardiography. In the placebo condition, greater overnight improvement for neutral pictures was associated with higher vagal HRV in both Non-Rapid Eye Movement Slow Wave Sleep (NREM SWS) and REM. Additionally, the emotional memory tradeoff (i.e., difference between consolidation of neutral versus negative memories) was associated with higher vagal HRV during REM, but in this case, neutral memories were remembered better than negative memories, indicating a potential role for REM vagal HRV in promoting a positive memory bias overnight. Zolpidem, on the other hand, reduced vagal HRV during SWS, increased NREM spindle activity, and eliminated the positive memory bias. Lastly, we used stepwise linear mixed effects regression to determine how NREM spindle activity and vagal HRV during REM independently explained the variance in the emotional memory tradeoff effect. We found that the addition of vagal HRV in combination with spindle activity significantly improved the model's fit. Overall, our results suggest that sleep brain oscillations and vagal signals synergistically interact in the overnight consolidation of emotional memories, with REM vagal HRV critically contributing to the positive memory bias.
40066359	Hydrogel and scalp/skin conductivities impact dose from tumor treating fields.	Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are delivered by transducer arrays applied to scalp or body surface for treatment of multiple malignancies. Dermatologic complications are thought to be related to hydrogel situated between the electrodes and scalp or skin to facilitate electric field penetration. High intensity of TTFields on these surfaces may also be a contributing factor. We explored conductivity changes in the hydrogel and skin to improve TTFields coverage and penetration.
40066319	Impact of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Cognitive Outcomes in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by a set of deficits not limited to social communication, which is restricted and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of autism has been seen to be consistently increasing globally. Autism is multifactorial in its etiology, and it involves several physiological systems, including the central nervous system and the gut-brain axis. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for neural development and functionality, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). They both play a crucial role in not only reducing the neuroinflammation associated with autism but also supporting cognitive processing as well. Given the low levels of omega-3 noted in ASD individuals, this systematic review aims to assess the influence of omega-3 supplementation on cognitive outcomes in children with ASD. The systematic review was done following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, where different databases were assessed across PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Scopus. MeSH terms used included keywords "Omega-3", "EPA", "DHA" AND "Autism Spectrum Disorder" OR "ASD". Articles published between 2007 and 2023 that focused on ages 2 to 18 years were screened, and cognitive outcomes relevant to omega-3 supplementation were included. Studies with inadequate access to full text excluded non-human trials and older individuals. After generating 25,312 articles, 211 were selected for further review, with 11 meeting the inclusion criteria. The articles reviewed panned over five different countries that involved omega-3 supplementation lasting up to one year. Results suggested that DHA and EPA supplementation may improve cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and executive functioning in children with ASD. The prefrontal cortex development was associated with DHA supplementation, whereas EPA showed improved emotional regulation and reduced neuroinflammation. However, conclusive results were not reached as there was variability in study designs, different dosages, and assessment methods. The power of the studies conducted was also noted to be limited. While promising, extensive research and trials are required to standardize the dosage of omega-3 and the length of intervention. Future studies should aim to identify the long-term effects of omega-3 supplementation, understand the gut-brain axis, and investigate the combination of omega-3 with other therapies to improve cognitive functioning.
40066316	Cognitive control circuit function predicts antidepressant outcomes: A signal detection approach to actionable clinical decisions.	We previously identified a cognitive biotype of depression characterized by dysfunction of the brain's cognitive control circuit, comprising the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We evaluate these circuit metrics as personalized predictors of antidepressant remission.
40066310	Advances in the detection of biomarkers for ischemic stroke.	Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Prompt intervention is essential for arresting disease progression and minimizing central nervous system damage. Although imaging studies play a significant role in diagnosing ischemic stroke, their high costs and limited sensitivity often result in diagnostic and treatment delays. Blood biomarkers have shown considerable promise in the diagnosis and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Serum markers, closely associated with stroke pathophysiology, aid in diagnosis, subtype identification, prediction of disease progression, early neurological deterioration, and recurrence. Their advantages are particularly pronounced due to their low cost and rapid results. Despite the identification of numerous candidate blood biomarkers, their clinical application requires rigorous research and thorough validation. This review focuses on various blood biomarkers related to ischemic stroke, including coagulation and fibrinolysis-related factors, endothelial dysfunction markers, inflammatory biomarkers, neuronal and axonal injury markers, exosomes with their circular RNAs and other relevant molecules. It also summarizes the latest methods and techniques for stroke biomarker detection, aiming to provide critical references for the clinical application of key stroke biomarkers.

40066307	Clinical characteristics of varicella-zoster virus central nervous system infection in 108 unimmunocompromised patients.	Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) central nervous system infection is typically observed in immunocompromised patients, and there is a lack of studies involving large samples of non-immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 108 non-immunocompromised patients diagnosed with VZV central nervous system infection.
40066306	Potential of transcranial ultrasound- and near-infrared spectroscopy-based acute stroke imaging for decision-making on intravenous thrombolysis treatment.	Mobile Stroke Units (MSU) shorten time to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and improve functional outcome, but they rely on computed tomography (CT) making them highly specialized and costly. Alternative technologies can potentially identify imaging-based IVT contraindications like intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or malignancies (IM), e.g., by transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
40066305	Falls in a single brain rehabilitation center: a 3-year retrospective chart review.	Falls in brain rehabilitation centers can negatively impact patient recovery, increase injury risk, and adversely affect rehabilitation outcomes. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of falls and identify associated risk factors among patients with brain lesions in a tertiary hospital's brain rehabilitation center from June 2021 to May 2024.
40066300	Cortical Activation and Functional Connectivity Response to Different Interactive Modes of Virtual Reality (VR)-Induced Analgesia: A Prospective Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) Study.

40066284	Mechanical countermeasures for spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome during 30-days of head down tilt bed rest: design, implementation, and tolerability.	After longer duration space missions, some astronauts experience structural and functional changes in the eye and structural changes in the brain, termed Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS). Countermeasures against SANS are required to minimize potential operation impacts and negative long-term health consequences. Headward fluid shifts, which appear to promote SANS, provide a target for countermeasures. The SANS countermeasures study, a 30 days strict head down tilt bed rest (HDTBR) study, tested two mechanical countermeasures aimed at reversing cephalad fluid overload. This work presents design and methodology of the study with a focus on countermeasure implementation and tolerability. Following baseline evaluations, participants were randomized to four groups and HDTBR commenced: Daily application of 25 mmHg lower body negative pressure for 6 h, six-hour bilateral venous constrictive thigh cuffs following moderate cycling exercise on 6 days per week, a negative control group without countermeasures, and a positive control group with HDTBR interruption for 6 h per day by sitting upright. The potential of these countermeasures for future space applications was examined in 86 different experiments, which will be reported elsewhere. Comfort ratings ranging from 1 (very uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable) were used to asses tolerability. Overall, 47 participants (20 women) completed the study. Out of 4,032 h scheduled for both countermeasures, 10.5 h were not performed due to medical issues unrelated to the countermeasures. Mean comfort ratings were 3.9 in men and 4.4 in women in the lower body negative pressure group (p = 0.1356) and 4.2 in men and 3.9 in women in the thigh cuff group (p = 0.1604). We conclude that both countermeasures were well tolerated and applied under well controlled conditions, thus, allowing for meaningful analyses of efficacy in attenuating HDTBR effects.
40066258	Implications of draxin in neurological disorders.	Axon guidance proteins not only play a role in the formation of proper neural circuits but also have other important functions, such as cell survival, migration, and proliferation in the brain. Therefore, mutations in the genes encoding these proteins frequently cause various types of neurological disorders, including psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously identified an axon guidance protein, draxin, that is essential for the development of several neural circuits and cell survival in the brain. Recently, the deletion of the <i>draxin</i> gene was identified in an inbred BTBR T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup>/J (BTBR/J) mouse, which is a widely used model of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), suggesting that <i>draxin</i> deletion is a genetic factor for ASD-like characteristics in BTBR/J mice. In this review, I summarize the neuroanatomical abnormalities in <i>draxin</i> knockout mice by comparing them to BTBR/J mice and discuss the possible contributions of draxin to anatomical and behavioral phenotypes in BTBR/J mice.
40066230	Sleep Disorders: Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Interventions.	Sleep disorder significantly disrupts the quality of life for patients. Although it is clinically acknowledged, the fundamental neuropathological mechanisms are still not understood. Recent preclinical research has been directed toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the sleep deprivation and sleep/wake dysregulation. Sleep disorder is linked to changes in the structure and function of the neural basis of cognition. We reviewed the neural circuits related to sleep disorders, along with alterations in connectivity and brain region functions, based on advancements in electrophysiology and optogenetic/chemogenetic techniques. We subsequently outline the cellular and molecular modifications linked to sleep disorders in preclinical studies, primarily involving changes in neuronal metabolism, electrophysiological activity, synaptic plasticity, and glial cells. Correspondingly, on the basis of the crosstalk between the brain and peripheral organs, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the involvement of celiac disease and hepatic disease in the pathogenesis of sleep disorders. In this review, we mainly discussed the pathogenesis at molecular, cellular, and neural circuit levels that contribute to sleep disorder. The review also covered potential strategies for treating sleep disorders and future research avenues.
40066155	Gut microbiome differences in individuals with PTSD compared to trauma-exposed controls: a systematic review.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental health disorder that can occur following exposure to a traumatic event, and is characterized by symptoms including intrusive memories, dissociation, and nightmares. PTSD poses significant suffering on the individual and can reduce quality of life substantially, however, its mechanisms are not fully understood. It has also been associated with gut abnormalities, such as with irritable bowel syndrome, indicating possible involvement of the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis. Whereas previous research has implicated the gut microbiome and microbiome gut-brain axis in various mental health disorders, the relationship between gut microbiome function and PTSD is unclear. Specifically, little is known about whether specific gut microbiome compositions can increase the risk of developing PTSD, or, vice versa, act as a protective factor for the individual. This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature looking at gut microbiome differences between individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed controls (TEC) while exploring potential risk and resilience factors for development of the disorder. Three studies met the inclusion criteria, and results showed that all studies found differences in gut microbial taxa between PTSD and TEC groups yet varied in their taxonomic level and type. One study found a significant difference in diversity between groups, reporting lower diversity in PTSD, and two studies found certain taxa to be correlated with PTSD symptom severity: <i>Mitsuokella</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i>, <i>Catenibacterium</i> and <i>Olsenella</i> genera, and <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Lentisphaerae</i> and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> phyla. This review has important implications for potential novel treatments for PTSD which target the gut microbiome, for example psychobiotic dietary interventions such as prebiotics and probiotics. It also informs our understanding of potential risk and resilience factors for the disorder, such as certain gut microbiome compositions being potentially protective or increasing susceptibility. More research is needed, as currently sample sizes are small and confounding variables (e.g., diet) are not always controlled for. <b>Systematic review registration:</b> The protocol was registered on PROSPERO, registration number: CRD42024530033.
40066139	Adolescents and adults with FOXP1 syndrome show high rates of anxiety and externalizing behaviors but not psychiatric decompensation or skill loss.	FOXP1 syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with complex clinical presentations including global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual disability, speech and language impairment, autism traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a range of behavioral challenges. To date, much of the literature focuses on childhood symptoms and little is known about the FOXP1 syndrome phenotype in adolescence or adulthood.
40066118	Bupropion Showed Neuroprotective Impacts Against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Reducing Oxidative Stress and Inflammation.	Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the most prevalent form of brain stroke, affecting many patients worldwide. It is believed that oxidative stress and inflammation play major roles in the damage that occurs after the initiation of the disease.
40066117	The Application of Machine Learning in Predicting the Permeability of Drugs Across the Blood Brain Barrier.	The inefficiency of some medications to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is often attributed to their poor physicochemical or pharmacokinetic properties. Recent studies have demonstrated promising outcomes using machine learning algorithms to predict drug permeability across the BBB. In light of these findings, our study was conducted to explore the potential of machine learning in predicting the permeability of drugs across the BBB. We utilized the B3DB dataset, a comprehensive BBB permeability molecular database, to build machine learning models. The dataset comprises 7,807 molecules, including information on their permeability, stereochemistry, and physicochemical properties. After preprocessing and cleaning, various machine learning algorithms were implemented using the Python library Pycaret to predict permeability. The extra trees classifier model outperformed others when using Morgan fingerprints and Mordred chemical descriptors (MCDs), achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 and 0.95 on the test dataset. Additionally, we conducted an experiment to train a voting classifier combining the top three performing models. The best-blended model, trained on MCDs, achieved an AUC of 0.96. Furthermore, Shapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was applied to our best-performing single model, the extra trees classifier trained on MCDs, identifying the Lipinski rule of five as the most significant feature in predicting BBB permeability. In conclusion, our combined model trained on MCDs achieved an AUC of 0.96, an F1 Score of 0.91, and an MCC of 0.74. These results are consistent with prior studies on CNS drug permeability, highlighting the potential of machine learning in this domain.
40066110	Dynamic reconfiguration of brain functional networks in world class gymnasts: a resting-state functional MRI study.	Long-term intensive training has enabled world class gymnasts to attain exceptional skill levels, inducing notable neuroplastic changes in their brains. Previous studies have identified optimized brain modularity related to long-term intensive training based on resting-state functional MRI, which is associated with higher efficiency in motor and cognitive functions. However, most studies assumed that functional topological networks remain static during the scans, neglecting the inherent dynamic changes over time. This study applied a multilayer network model to identify the effect of long-term intensive training on dynamic functional network properties in gymnasts. The imaging data were collected from 13 gymnasts and 14 age- and gender-matched non-athlete controls. We first construct dynamic functional connectivity matrices for each subject to capture the temporal information underlying these brain signals. Then, we applied a multilayer community detection approach to analyse how brain regions form modules and how this modularity changes over time. Graph theoretical parameters, including flexibility, promiscuity, cohesion and disjointedness, were estimated to characterize the dynamic properties of functional networks across global, network, and nodal levels in the gymnasts. The gymnasts showed significantly lower flexibility, cohesion and disjointedness at the global level than the controls. Then, we observed lower flexibility and cohesion in the auditory, dorsal attention, sensorimotor, subcortical, cingulo-opercular and default mode networks in the gymnasts than in the controls. Furthermore, these gymnasts showed decreased flexibility and cohesion in several regions associated with motor function. Together, we found brain functional neuroplasticity related to long-term intensive training, primarily characterized by decreased flexibility of brain dynamics in the gymnasts, which provided new insights into brain reorganization in motor skill learning.
40066109	Characterization of a novel zebrafish model of <i>MTMR5</i>-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B3.	Biallelic loss of expression/function variants in <i>MTMR5/SBF1</i> cause the inherited peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. There is an incomplete understanding of the disease pathomechanism(s) underlying Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3, and despite its severe clinical presentation, currently no disease-modifying therapies. A key barrier to the study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3 is the lack of pre-clinical models that recapitulate the clinical and pathologic features of the disease. To address this barrier, we generated a zebrafish Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 mutant line with a full gene deletion of <i>mtmr5.</i> Resulting homozygous deletion zebrafish are born at normal Mendelian ratios and have preserved motor function. However, starting by 10 days post-fertilization, mutant zebrafish develop obvious morphometric changes in head size and brain volume. These changes are accompanied at the pathological level by abnormal axon outgrowths and by the presence of dysmyelination changes reminiscent of the nerve pathology in human Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. Importantly, RNA sequencing from brain-enriched samples identifies novel disease pathways including transcriptional changes in genes responsible for neurogenesis, chromatin remodelling/organization, and synaptic membrane homeostasis. Overall, our <i>mtmr5</i> knockout zebrafish mirror genetic, clinical and pathologic features of human Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. As such, it represents a first pre-clinical model to phenocopy the disease, and an ideal tool for future studies on disease pathomechanism(s) and therapy development.
40066108	Neural tracking of natural speech: an effective marker for post-stroke aphasia.	After a stroke, approximately one-third of patients suffer from aphasia, a language disorder that impairs communication ability. Behavioural tests are the current standard to detect aphasia, but they are time-consuming, have limited ecological validity and require active patient cooperation. To address these limitations, we tested the potential of EEG-based neural envelope tracking of natural speech. The technique investigates the neural response to the temporal envelope of speech, which is critical for speech understanding by encompassing cues for detecting and segmenting linguistic units (e.g. phrases, words and phonemes). We recorded EEG from 26 individuals with aphasia in the chronic phase after stroke (>6 months post-stroke) and 22 healthy controls while they listened to a 25-min story. We quantified neural envelope tracking in a broadband frequency range as well as in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands using mutual information analyses. Besides group differences in neural tracking measures, we also tested its suitability for detecting aphasia at the individual level using a support vector machine classifier. We further investigated the reliability of neural envelope tracking and the required recording length for accurate aphasia detection. Our results showed that individuals with aphasia had decreased encoding of the envelope compared to controls in the broad, delta, theta and gamma bands, which aligns with the assumed role of these bands in auditory and linguistic processing of speech. Neural tracking in these frequency bands effectively captured aphasia at the individual level, with a classification accuracy of 83.33% and an area under the curve of 89.16%. Moreover, we demonstrated that high-accuracy detection of aphasia can be achieved in a time-efficient (5-7 min) and highly reliable manner (split-half reliability correlations between <i>R</i> = 0.61 and <i>R</i> = 0.96 across frequency bands). In this study, we identified specific neural response characteristics to natural speech that are impaired in individuals with aphasia, holding promise as a potential biomarker for the condition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the neural tracking technique can discriminate aphasia from healthy controls at the individual level with high accuracy, and in a reliable and time-efficient manner. Our findings represent a significant advance towards more automated, objective and ecologically valid assessments of language impairments in aphasia.
40066107	Exploring functional connectivity in clinical and data-driven groups of preterm and term adults.	Adults born very preterm (i.e. at <33 weeks' gestation) are more susceptible to long-lasting structural and functional brain alterations and cognitive and socio-emotional difficulties, compared with full-term controls. However, behavioural heterogeneity within very preterm and full-term individuals makes it challenging to find biomarkers of specific outcomes. To address these questions, we parsed brain-behaviour heterogeneity in participants subdivided according to their clinical birth status (very preterm versus full term) and/or data-driven behavioural phenotype (regardless of birth status). Participants were followed-up in adulthood (median age 30 years) as part of a wider longitudinal case-control cohort study. The Network Based Statistic approach was used to identify topological components of resting state functional connectivity differentiating between (i) 116 very preterm and 83 full-term adults (43% and 57% female, respectively) and (ii) data-driven behavioural subgroups identified using consensus clustering (<i>n</i> = 156, 46% female). Age, sex, socio-economic status and in-scanner head motion were used as confounders in all analyses. <i>Post hoc</i> two-way group interactions between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels explored whether functional connectivity differences between very preterm and full-term adults varied according to distinct behavioural outcomes. Very preterm compared with full-term adults had poorer scores in selective measures of cognitive and socio-emotional processing and displayed complex patterns of hyper- and hypo-connectivity in sub-sections of the default mode, visual and ventral attention networks. Stratifying the study participants in terms of their behavioural profiles (irrespective of birth status) identified two data-driven subgroups: an 'At-Risk' subgroup, characterized by increased cognitive, mental health and socio-emotional difficulties, displaying hypo-connectivity anchored in frontal opercular and insular regions, relative to a 'Resilient' subgroup with more favourable outcomes. No significant interaction was noted between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels in terms of functional connectivity. Functional connectivity differentiating between very preterm and full-term adults was dissimilar to functional connectivity differentiating between the data-driven behavioural subgroups. We speculate that functional connectivity alterations observed in very preterm relative to full-term adults may confer both risk and resilience to developing behavioural sequelae associated with very preterm birth, while the localized functional connectivity alterations seen in the 'At-Risk' subgroup relative to the 'Resilient' subgroup may underlie less favourable behavioural outcomes in adulthood, irrespective of birth status.
40066106	Neural correlates of fatigue after traumatic brain injury.	Fatigue is the main cause of disability after traumatic brain injury and has negative impact on social, physical and cognitive functions, participation in daily activities, and ability to work. Since the neural underpinnings are largely unknown, few causal treatments are currently available. This study therefore aimed to investigate the neural correlates of subjective fatigue after traumatic brain injury, controlling for differences in cognitive performance, motor performance and subjective psychological covariates such as depression, anxiety and apathy. Seventeen chronic traumatic brain injury patients (10 with and seven without fatigue) and 11 age, sex, and education-matched healthy controls participated in the study. The dependent variable, overall fatigue, was quantified as the sum of the subscales of the multivariate fatigue inventory. Subjective psychological covariates were extracted from appropriate questionnaires. Brain activation during a two-back task and functional connectivity at rest were reconstructed from high-density EEG. Cortical excitability was quantified from motor evoked potentials induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex. Cognitive performance was assessed with a two-back task as well as with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Motor performance was quantified with Jamar dynamometer. Beside the between-group differences in most fatigue subscales resulting from the group attribution, participants also differed in subjective memory functions, depression, anxiety and apathy. Conversely, objective neuropsychological performance was similar across groups in most domains, except for alertness and divided attention (<i>P</i> ≤ 0.039). At the neural level, we observed no difference in corticospinal excitability, but a significant disruption of global resting-state alpha-band functional connectivity between cortical midline structures and the rest of the brain in patients with fatigue (<i>P</i> = 0.006). Furthermore, individuals with fatigue exhibited reduced signs of overall brain activation compared with healthy controls throughout the cognitive task (<i>P</i> = 0.032) without time-on-task effect. In a multivariate regression model, resting-state functional connectivity (<i>P</i> = 0.013) and subjective psychological questionnaire scores (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) were independent predictors of fatigue. In conclusion, our results suggest that disrupted network interactions are the primary independent neural predictor of fatigue. This may serve as a new target for therapy.
40066089	Association between human leukocyte antigen E expression and outcomes in solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Immunotherapy has gained momentum with the discovery of novel antibodies targeting immunosuppressive proteins. HLA-E, a non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) protein, exhibits immunosuppressive properties, potentially influencing tumor immune evasion mechanisms. The association between Human Leukocyte Antigen E (HLA-E) expression and outcomes in solid tumors remains unclear.
40066039	Development and evaluation of BDNF-loaded PCL/PVA two-layer nerve guidance conduit with enhanced biomechanical and biological properties for peripheral nerve regeneration.	The repair of damaged peripheral nerves and the following restoration of functionality remain significant therapeutic challenges. Hollow nerve conduits currently available do not align with the ideal human model. Successfully mending nerve gaps requires incorporating biomimetic and functional features into neural conduit design. In this research, a new two-layer conduit that combines topographic support and controlled growth factor release was developed. We used a two-layered framework to amplify the mechanical reinforcement and reduce the risk of tissue collapse post-grafting. The hollow nerve conduits were fabricated through three-dimensional printing, employing Polycaprolactone (PCL) and a slowly biodegradable nanofiber for the intraluminal brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF)-loaded polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/PCL core-shell. The contact angle was indicated to show the hydrophilicity properties and degradation rate for biocompatibility. The scanning electron microscope <b>(</b>SEM) images were analyzed to determine the fiber's diameters, structure morphology, and stem cell adhesion. The performance of core-shell conduits was investigated in human dental pulp stem cells <b>(</b>hDPSC) culture and their differentiation into Schwann cells (SCs) <i>invitro</i>. The vitality of samples was assessed using SEM, MTT assay, and differentiation potential with real-time and Immunofluorescence staining techniques. <i>Invitro</i> cumulated BDNF release followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, demonstrating a strong correlation coefficient of 0.981. Real-time analysis showed that after 14 days of induction, the expression of S100 increased 5.89-fold. We concluded that core-shell PCL/PVA nerve guidance conduits can encourage the adhesion and proliferation of hDPSCs and create the ideal environment for increasing cell survival. Also, the sustained release of BDNF within conduit walls promoted differentiation toward SC.
40065971	Lipoid Proteinosis-An Unusual Cause of Hoarseness of Voice in a Child: Case Report.	Lipoid proteinosis is a rare hereditary multisystemic familial disorder characterised by intracellular deposition of hyaline material (Rao and Koppada in Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol, 2015; Shah and Shah in J Oral Maxillofac Pathol 26:236-241, 2022). The hallmark findings are pox like scarred skin lesion, hoarseness of voice and selective brain parenchymal calcification (Rao and Koppada in Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol, 2015). We present a case of biopsy proven lipoid proteinosis with typical radiological findings.
40065918	Perspective: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.	The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is a measure of the minimal clinically relevant change. The MCID represents the smallest difference in score on the measure or domain of interest which patients or clinicians perceive as beneficial or as meaningful decline. The MCID is not an alternative clinical trial outcome; it does not apply to group measures and is used as a means of determining whether an individual patient has reached a threshold of change. MCIDs have been derived for symptomatic treatments and for disease targeted therapies. MCIDs have been derived for nearly all clinical trial instruments used in AD therapeutic research. Application of the MCID to patients on disease-targeted therapies requires awareness of the expected increasing treatment-no treatment difference exhibited by these agents. The MCID complements other strategies for assessing the meaningfulness of interventions including effect size, number needed to treat, responder analyses, time saved, quality of life, and quality-adjusted life years. MCID is not a required measure for regulatory approval of a therapeutic since it is applicable to individual patients and not to group outcomes or mean differences used to determine treatment benefit in clinical trials.
40065917	Broad repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus in Alzheimer's disease: A rationale and study design.	Brain network dysfunction, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), is an increasingly apparent contributor to the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can target key DMN hubs, maintain signaling function, and delay or improve clinical outcomes in AD. Here, we present the rationale and design of a study using off-the-shelf equipment and the latest clinical evidence to expand on prior rTMS work and reduce participant burden in the process.
40065912	Self-reported history of head injury is associated with cognitive impulsivity on a delay discounting task.	Head injuries are a major health care concern that can produce many long lasting cognitive, mental, and physical problems. An emerging literature indicates increased impulsivity in patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). In a recent study, Veterans with clinically-assessed history of mild TBI had increased cognitive, but not motor, impulsivity. Cognitive impulsivity refers to a preference for smaller immediate rewards (<i>i.e.</i>, less willing to wait for larger rewards) while motor impulsivity refers to difficulty inhibiting a motor response. This study extended this work to investigating cognitive and motor impulsivity in a non-clinical sample of putatively healthy undergraduates self-reporting a history of head injury.
40065911	Intrinsic retinoic acid synthesis is required for oligodendrocyte progenitor expansion during CNS remyelination.	Myelin regeneration (remyelination) in the CNS depends on the recruitment, proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at demyelinated lesions. However, despite the presence of OPCs, very few oligodendrocytes and myelin are regenerated in chronic multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions for reasons that remain poorly understood. Here, using a spontaneous remyelination model in mice, we found that retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2), a rate-limiting enzyme for retinoic acid (RA) synthesis, is upregulated in OPCs and in a subpopulation of microglia/macrophages during remyelination. Tamoxifen induced deletion of Raldh2 globally, or conditionally in OPCs, resulted in significantly fewer proliferating OPCs in lesions, leading to decreased oligodendrocyte numbers and myelin density. Moreover, induced deletion of Raldh2 globally also resulted in increased microglia/macrophage density in lesions. Further, exogenous RA delivery into lesions significantly increased oligodendrocyte lineage cells, while also decreasing proinflammatory microglia/macrophages, with no significant effect on anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages. Postmortem MS brain sections revealed Raldh2 was absent in the majority of OPCs in chronic inactive lesions compared to the other lesion types. These results suggest that Raldh2 upregulation in lesions is critical for OPC proliferation during remyelination, and reveal that the failure to regenerate sufficient oligodendrocytes and myelin in chronic MS lesions may arise from impaired OPC expansion due to the failure to intrinsically synthesize RA.

40065827	A Posteriori Error Analysis for a Coupled Stokes-Poroelastic System with Multiple Compartments.	The computational effort entailed in the discretization of fluid-poromechanics systems is typically highly demanding. This is particularly true for models of multiphysics flows in the brain, due to the geometrical complexity of the cerebral anatomy-requiring a very fine computational mesh for finite element discretization-and to the high number of variables involved. Indeed, this kind of problems can be modeled by a coupled system encompassing the Stokes equations for the cerebrospinal fluid in the brain ventricles and Multiple-network Poro-Elasticity (MPE) equations describing the brain tissue, the interstitial fluid, and the blood vascular networks at different space scales. The present work aims to rigorously derive a posteriori error estimates for the coupled Stokes-MPE problem, as a first step towards the design of adaptive refinement strategies or reduced order models to decrease the computational demand of the problem. Through numerical experiments, we verify the reliability and optimal efficiency of the proposed a posteriori estimator and identify the role of the different solution variables in its composition.

40065653	Coproducing an Ecological Momentary Assessment Measurement Burst Mental Health Study With Young People: The MHIM Coproduction Protocol.	There is now widespread recognition within adolescence mental health research of the ethical imperative and benefits of coproduction. This has led to the development of best practice guidelines and the routine reporting of coproduction methods. However, there are unique considerations associated with involving young people in research with varying designs, e.g., longitudinal. Ideally, these decisions are made in consultation with young people themselves. Thus, the objective and novel contribution of this paper is (1) the involvement of young people in the development of the MHIM protocol, including an evaluative framework, and (2) a study protcol that utilises coproduction in the context of a longitudinal mental health project.

40065628	Heart rate variability impairment during sleep in Veterans with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder: an early potential window into autonomic dysfunction?	Individuals with comorbid rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and neurotrauma (NT; defined by traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder) have an earlier age of RBD symptom onset, increased RBD-related symptom severity and more neurological features indicative of prodromal synucleinopathy compared to RBD only. An early sign of neurodegenerative condition is autonomic dysfunction, which we sought to evaluate by examining heart rate variability during sleep. Participants with overnight polysomnography were recruited from the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System. Veterans without NT or RBD (controls, n = 19), with RBD only (RBD, n = 14), and with RBD and NT (RBD+NT, n = 19) were evaluated. Eligible 5-min non-REM (NREM) and REM epochs without apneas/hypopneas, microarousals, and ectopic beats were analysed for frequency and time domain (e.g., low-frequency [LF] power; high-frequency [HF] power; root mean square of successive R-R intervals [RMSSD]; percentage of R-R intervals that vary ≥50 ms [pNN50]) heart rate variability outcomes. Heart rate did not significantly differ between groups in any sleep stage. Time domain and frequency domain variables (e.g., LF power, HF power, RMSSD, and pNN50) were significantly reduced in the RBD+NT group compared to the controls and RBD-only group during NREM sleep. There were no group differences detected during REM sleep. These data suggest significant reductions in heart rate variability during NREM sleep in RBD+NT participants, suggesting greater autonomic dysfunction compared to controls or RBD alone. Heart rate variability during sleep may be an early, promising biomarker, yielding mechanistic insight for diagnosis and prognosis of early neurodegeneration in this vulnerable population.
40065622	[Research progress on the mechanisms of Tau phosphorylation and its kinases in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage].	Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is one of the main causes of disability in middle-aged and elderly people, as well as high mortality rates and long-term physical impairments in newborns. The pathological manifestations of HIBD include neuronal damage and loss of myelin sheaths. Tau protein is an important microtubule-associated protein in brain, exists in neurons and oligodendrocytes, and regulates various cellular activities such as cell differentiation and maturation, axonal transport, and maintenance of cellular cytoskeleton structure. Phosphorylation is a common chemical modification of Tau. In physiological condition, it maintains normal cell cytoskeleton and biological functions by regulating Tau structure and function. In pathological conditions, it leads to abnormal Tau phosphorylation and influences its structure and functions, resulting in Tauopathies. Studies have shown that brain hypoxia-ischemia could cause abnormal alteration in Tau phosphorylation, then participating in the pathological process of HIBD. Meanwhile, brain hypoxia-ischemia can induce oxidative stress and inflammation, and multiple Tau protein kinases are activated and involved in Tau abnormal phosphorylation. Therefore, exploring specific molecular mechanisms by which HIBD activates Tau protein kinases, and elucidating their relationship with abnormal Tau phosphorylation are crucial for future researches on HIBD related treatments. This review aims to focus on the mechanisms of the role of Tau phosphorylation in HIBD, and the potential relationships between Tau protein kinases and Tau phosphorylation, providing a basis for intervention and treatment of HIBD.
40065617	[Research progress of nucleus tractus solitarius involved in central regulation of hypertension].	The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) is the primary brain region for receiving and integrating cardiovascular afferent signals. It plays a crucial role in maintaining balance of autonomic nervous system and regulating blood pressure through cardiovascular reflexes. Neurons within the NTS form complex synaptic connections and interact reciprocally with other brain regions. The NTS regulates autonomic nervous system activity and arterial blood pressure through modulating baroreflex, sympathetic nerve activity, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and oxidative stress. Dysfunctions in NTS activity may contribute to hypertension. Understanding the NTS' role in centrally regulating blood pressure and alterations of neurotransmission or signaling pathways in the NTS may provide rationale for new therapeutic strategies of prevention and treatment. This review summarizes the research findings on autonomic nervous system regulation and arterial blood pressure control by NTS, as well as unresolved questions, in order to provide reference for future investigation.
40065611	[The role of microglia activated by the deletion of immune checkpoint receptor CD200R1 gene in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease].	The study aimed to investigate the effect of the CD200R1 gene deletion on microglia activation and nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss in the Parkinson's disease (PD) process. The CRISPR-Cas9 technology was applied to construct the CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The primary microglia cells of wild-type and CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were cultured and treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia phagocytosis level was assessed by a fluorescent microsphere phagocytosis assay. PD mouse model was prepared by nigral stereotaxic injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector carrying human α-synuclein (α-syn). The changes in the motor behavior of the mice with both genotypes were evaluated by cylinder test, open field test, and rotarod test. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess the loss of dopamine neurons in substantia nigra. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression level of CD68 (a key molecule involved in phagocytosis) in microglia. The results showed that CD200R1 deletion markedly enhanced LPS-induced phagocytosis <i>in vitro</i> by the microglial cells. In the mouse model of PD, CD200R1 deletion exacerbated motor behavior impairment and dopamine neuron loss in substantia nigra. Fluorescence intensity analysis results revealed a significant increase in CD68 expression in microglia located in the substantia nigra of CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The above results suggest that CD200R1 deletion may further activates microglia by promoting microglial phagocytosis, leading to increased loss of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in the PD model mice. Therefore, targeting CD200R1 could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of early-stage PD.
40065582	Buprenorphine's Effect on the Human Immune System and Inflammation.	Opioid use disorder is a persistent epidemic despite several FDA-approved medications for its treatment. While the pathogenesis of opioid use disorder has been classically attributed to dopamine pathways in the brain, there is emerging evidence and interest surrounding the role of inflammation and inflammatory signaling in its development and treatment. Buprenorphine has become the most prescribed medication for opioid use disorder, largely due to its ease of access and tolerability. This review aimed to better characterize contemporary knowledge of how buprenorphine modulates the human immune system and inflammatory functions in this population. A comprehensive review was conducted using 11 key databases, including Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. This review captured 8177 records, and 14 studies were ultimately selected for inclusion and discussion in this review. Notably, all 14 clinical studies evaluated buprenorphine's effect on the peripheral immune system, and the majority of the studies supported the notion that initiation and maintenance of buprenorphine restore immune suppression caused by opioid use disorder. In addition, we discuss how recent and ongoing work utilizing advanced imaging and cellular technologies is advancing the understanding of how buprenorphine affects the immune and inflammatory signaling in the brain.

40065552	Implications for soluble iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and glial glutamate release in motor neuron death associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Oxidative stress in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been evidenced by accumulation of oxidatively modified products of nucleic acids, lipids, sugars, and proteins in the motor neuron system of brains and spinal cords obtained at autopsy from the patients. We recently demonstrated soluble iron accumulation in activated microglia of sporadic ALS spinal cords. This finding could indicate that iron-mediated Fenton reaction is most likely to be responsible for oxidative stress associated with this disease. The excitatory amino acid neurotoxicity hypothesis for sporadic ALS has been proposed based on increased glutamate and aspartate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid from the patients. Initially, the increase in extracellular excitatory amino acid levels was considered to reflect excessive release from the axon terminal of upper motor neurons. However, it is a question of whether the damaged upper motor neurons continue releasing glutamate even in advanced stage of this disease. To address this issue, we hypothesized that glial cells might be a glutamate release source. Our immunohistochemical analysis on autopsied human spinal cords revealed that ferritin, hepcidin, ferroportin, aconitase 1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE), and glutaminase-C (GAC) were expressed mainly in microglia and that cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) was expressed mainly in astrocytes. We next performed cell culture experiments. Cultured microglia treated with soluble iron over-released glutamate and TNF-α via aconitase 1 and TACE, respectively. Cultured microglia treated with TNF-α over-released glutamate via GAC. Cultured microglia treated with hepcidin, of which expression is known to be upregulated by TNF-α, showed downregulated expression of ferroportin. Cultured astrocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide over-released glutamate via xCT. These observations provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that microglia and astrocytes are glutamate suppliers in response to soluble iron overload and oxidative stress, respectively, in sporadic ALS.
40065551	Kisspeptin fiber and receptor distribution analysis suggests its potential role in central sensorial processing and behavioral state control.	Kisspeptin (KP) signaling in the brain is defined by the anatomical distribution of KP-producing neurons, their fibers, receptors, and connectivity. Technological advances have prompted a re-evaluation of these chemoanatomical aspects, originally studied in the early years after the discovery of KP and its receptor Kiss1r. Previously, we characterized (Hernández et al. bioRxiv 2024) seven KP neuronal populations in the mouse brain at the mRNA level, including two novel populations, and examined their response to gonadectomy. In this study, we mapped KP fiber distribution in rats and mice using immunohistochemistry under intact as well as short- and long-term post-gonadectomy conditions. Kiss1r mRNA expression was examined via RNAscope, in relation to vesicular GABA transporter (Slc32a1) in whole mouse brain, and to KP and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Slc17a6), Kiss1, and Slc32a1 in hypothalamic RP3V and arcuate regions. We identified KP fibers in 118 brain regions, primarily in extra-hypothalamic areas associated with sensorial processing and behavioral state control. KP-immunoreactive fiber density and distribution were largely unchanged by gonadectomy. Kiss1r was expressed prominently in sensorial and state control regions such as the septal nuclei, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, locus coeruleus, hippocampal layers, thalamic nuclei, and cerebellar structures. Co-expression of Kiss1r and Kiss1 was observed in hypothalamic neurons, suggesting both autocrine and paracrine KP signaling mechanisms. These findings enhance our understanding of KP signaling beyond reproductive functions, particularly in sensorial processing and behavioral state regulation. This study opens new avenues for investigating KP's role in controlling complex physiological processes, including those unrelated to reproduction.

40065522	Dispositional Awe Predicts Mental Health Through Interpretation Bias During COVID-19 Transmission: A Longitudinal Study.	During a public health emergency, such as the widespread transmission of COVID-19 following loosened COVID-19 policies in China, people's mental health is impacted along with their physical well-being. In order to investigate ways to mitigate these negative effects, this study examined how dispositional awe can predict mental health outcomes during such emergencies using a three-wave longitudinal design. Five hundred twenty seven participants (mean age = 21.18, SD = 3.39; 368 males) took part in the study within the first 2 months after the implementation of loosened COVID-19 policies, with one-month intervals between waves. Cross-lagged analysis revealed that dispositional awe in Wave 1 significantly predicted higher positive and lower negative interpretation bias in Wave 2, which in turn promoted positive mental functioning in Wave 3. Furthermore, negative interpretation bias in Wave 2 acted as a mediator for the predictive role of dispositional awe in Wave 1 on psychosomatic symptoms in Wave 3. These findings suggest that dispositional awe can act as a protective factor for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic by influencing people's interpretation orientation.

However, concerns have arisen over the safety of APAP exposure during gestation. In particular, it's been speculated that the hepatotoxic metabolite of APAP, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), forms in the brain after maternal use of therapeutic APAP doses and leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, APAP metabolism in the brain is understudied. Here, we tested the hypothesis that NAPQI can be generated in the brain by overdosing BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (common model of the NDD autism) and C57Bl/6J mice with APAP and measuring glutathione loss and APAP-protein adducts as two of the best markers of NAPQI available. Despite glutathione depletion and adducts in the liver, we saw none in the brain. We conclude NAPQI is unlikely to contribute to the pathophysiology of NDDs. IMPACT STATEMENT: It has been hypothesized that NAPQI formation in the brain provides biological plausibility for the purported link between APAP and NDDs. Our results cast doubt on that hypothesis.
40065475	Aseptic meningitis in the setting of giant cell arteritis (GCA): a case report.	Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis primarily affecting medium- and large-sized arteries. The diagnosis may be challenging and lead to delays in treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis is an uncommon association but may occur due to central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis or pachymeningitis. We describe a case fulfilling the criteria for diagnosing GCA, associated with CSF pleocytosis and normal neuroimaging.

40065427	A review of cerebrospinal fluid circulation with respect to Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia in brachycephalic dogs.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis by facilitating the clearance of metabolic waste and regulating intracranial pressure. Dysregulation of CSF flow can lead to conditions like syringomyelia, and hydrocephalus. This review details the anatomy of CSF flow, examining its contribution to waste clearance within the brain and spinal cord. The review integrates data from human, canine, and other mammalian studies, with a particular focus on brachycephalic dogs. Certain dog breeds exhibit a high prevalence of CSF-related conditions due to artificial selection for neotenous traits, making them valuable models for studying analogous human conditions, such as Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia associated with craniosynostosis. This review discusses the anatomical features specific to some brachycephalic breeds and the impact of skull and cranial cervical conformation on CSF flow patterns, providing insights into the pathophysiology and potential modelling approaches for these conditions.
40065421	Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and inhibitory control training for excess weight treatment: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (InhibE).	The prevalence of excess weight has increased globally. Despite interventions include targeted goals on essential aspects such as physical activity and diet, their long-term effectiveness remains limited. Research highlights that eating behaviour is influenced by impulsive processes, especially in the context of a food-rich environment. Inhibitory control has been identified as a key factor in regulating eating behaviour. Neuroscience approaches, including inhibitory control training and non-invasive neuromodulation of brain regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, show promise in improving eating behaviour when used in addition to conventional intervention for weight management. This parallel group, randomized, controlled trial aims to study the efficacy of neuromodulation with iTBS as an add-on to the weight loss treatment as usual (TAU: diet and exercise), alone and in combination with inhibitory control training, for excess weight treatment.
40065395	Dopamine D1 receptor agonist alleviates post-weaning isolation-induced neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors in female mice.	Major depressive disorder is a significant global cause of disability, particularly among adolescents. The dopamine system and nearby neuroinflammation, crucial for regulating mood and processing rewards, are central to the frontostriatal circuit, which is linked to depression. This study aimed to investigate the effect of post-weaning isolation (PWI) on depression in adolescent mice, with a focus on exploring the involvement of microglia and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) in the frontostriatal circuit due to their known links with mood disorders.
40065353	Identification of enterotype for patients with Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and chronic neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, characterized by behavioral and dysexecutive deficits. Its pathogenesis is closely associated with the intestinal flora. This study aimed to explore the enterotypes in AD by identifying key bacteria through machine learning and species co-occurrence network analysis.
40065333	Alleviating the emotional burden on families during organ donation requests in neurologic patients declared with brain death: the role of timing and circumstances of death.	Organ donation requests to families often occur during moments of profound grief and create an emotional burden that is compounded by the varying emotional responses to circumstances surrounding death. These responses, in turn, interact with the timing of the request to influence authorization decisions. Understanding the interplay between timing and circumstances of death is crucial for improving authorization rates and addressing the organ donor shortage. The Organ Retrieval and Collection of Health Information for Donation database was used to identify 3,289 potential donors with neurologic mechanisms of brain death. Multivariate logistic regression with interaction between timing and circumstance was used to estimate authorization rates. Results show no significant differences in authorization for requests made within 12 h of death, regardless of circumstance. However, significant differences in authorization were observed between requests made at the time of brain death and those made 12 or more hours later for natural causes, as well as those at 24 or more hours for homicide, motor vehicle accidents, and non-motor vehicle accidents. These findings indicate that the optimal timing for organ donation requests may depend on the emotional intensity of the situation. While quicker requests may be more effective in less emotionally charged cases, extending the time for families to grieve in highly distressing circumstances does not appear to negatively impact authorization rates. Tailoring the timing of donation requests to the circumstances of death, balancing sensitivity with the need for prompt decision-making, could reduce families' emotional burden, ease pressure in decision-making, and help address the shortage of organ donors.
40065324	Lysosomal acidification impairment in astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation.	Astrocytes are a major cell type in the central nervous system (CNS) that play a key role in regulating homeostatic functions, responding to injuries, and maintaining the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes also regulate neuronal functions and survival by modulating myelination and degradation of pathological toxic protein aggregates. Astrocytes have recently been proposed to possess both autophagic activity and active phagocytic capability which largely depend on sufficiently acidified lysosomes for complete degradation of cellular cargos. Defective lysosomal acidification in astrocytes impairs their autophagic and phagocytic functions, resulting in the accumulation of cellular debris, excessive myelin and lipids, and toxic protein aggregates, which ultimately contributes to the propagation of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative pathology. Restoration of lysosomal acidification in impaired astrocytes represent new neuroprotective strategy and therapeutic direction. In this review, we summarize pathogenic factors, including neuroinflammatory signaling, metabolic stressors, myelin and lipid mediated toxicity, and toxic protein aggregates, that contribute to lysosomal acidification impairment and associated autophagic and phagocytic dysfunction in astrocytes. We discuss the role of lysosomal acidification dysfunction in astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation primarily in the context of neurodegenerative diseases along with other brain injuries. We then highlight re-acidification of impaired lysosomes as a therapeutic strategy to restore autophagic and phagocytic functions as well as lysosomal degradative capacity in astrocytes. We conclude by providing future perspectives on the role of astrocytes as phagocytes and their crosstalk with other CNS cells to impart neurodegenerative or neuroprotective effects.
40065291	Violence against healthcare workers in Kenya: a cross-sectional sub-analysis of the global vishwas study.	Global concern exists for workplace violence against healthcare workers (HCWs), especially in low and middle-income nations.

We conducted a study in Kenya to address this issue.
40065288	Efficacy and safety of medroxyprogesterone acetate on noninvasive ventilation -treated exacerbated COPD patients: a double-blind randomized clinical trial.	In acute exacerbation periods of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), patients may experience hypoxemia or hypercapnia. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and respiratory stimulant drugs are used to treat this condition. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause breathing stimulation and hyperventilation. This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of MPA in hypercapnic exacerbated COPD patients and the possibility of faster weaning of patients from NIV.
40065283	A genome-wide association study of methamphetamine use among people with HIV.	Amphetamine-like stimulants are the most used psychostimulants in the world; methamphetamine use is the most prevalent in people with HIV. Prolonged methamphetamine use can cause lasting damage to the heart, gut, and brain, as well as auditory hallucinations and paranoid thinking. However, relatively little is known about methamphetamine use and its genetic contributors.
40065266	Offset analgesia as a marker of dysfunctional pain modulation in episodic and chronic migraine.	The offset analgesia phenomenon refers to the disproportionately large decrease in the perceived pain following a slight decrease in intensity of a noxious heat stimulus. It is considered an expression of the activation of the endogenous pain-modulation system. The main aim of this study was to examine pain processing using the offset analgesia paradigm in subjects with interictal episodic migraine compared to those with non-ictal chronic migraine. Additionally, as secondary outcome measures, we aimed to: (1) explore fluctuations in the endogenous pain modulation system throughout the migraine cycle by including small subgroups of episodic migraine patients in different migraine phases, and (2) compare different subgroups of non-ictal chronic migraine patients with or without medication overuse headache (MOH).

40065246	Epigallocatechin -3- gallate mitigates diazinon neurotoxicity via suppression of pro-inflammatory genes and upregulation of antioxidant pathways.	Diazinon is a commonly used organophosphate (OP) insecticide especially in developing countries for the control of insect pests, however, exposure to its toxic impact especially in humans and other non-target species remains an important public health concern. The study aimed to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin -3- gallate (EGCG), abundant in green tea plants on neurobehavioural, biochemical, and pathological changes in the brain of male Wistar rats following exposure to diazinon toxicity. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were acclimatized for seven days and subsequently randomly assigned into six treatment groups as follows: Group I: Control group (0.2 mL distilled water); Group II: Diazinon at 3 mg/kg (1% LD50); Group III: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (50 mg/kg, ~ 2% of LD50); Group IV: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (100 mg/kg, ~ 5% of LD50); Group V: EGCG (50 mg/kg) and Group VI: EGCG (100 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally once daily for 14 days. Neurobehavioural studies, biomarkers of oxidative stress, histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) were performed. Diazinon alone impaired recognition memory, increased oxidative stress markers and altered antioxidant defense in the brain. It upregulated TNF-α and IL-6 genes and repressed GPx 4 gene expressions. It was also associated with increased GFAP, Tau, and α-SN immunoreactivity. Microscopic examination revealed loss of Purkinje and hippocampal cells in brain. Co-treatment with EGCG however improved cognition, lowered oxidative stress markers, improved antioxidant status and suppressed TNF-α and IL-6. In conclusion, findings from this study demonstrated that EGCG offered protection against diazinon-induced neurotoxicity. Hence, natural sources of epigallocatechin -3- gallate such as fruits and vegetables could offer immense benefits by protecting against oxidative stress and inflammation in neurodegenerative disease conditions.Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Globally, Tuberculosis(TB) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly serious, especially the emergence of rifampicin-susceptible and isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis (Hr-TB), which increases the difficulty of treatment and the burden of disease. Therefore, this single-center retrospective cohort study analyzed risk factors of Hr-TB in adult patients with T2DM and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Nanjing to guide clinical practice and improve the long-term prognosis of patients.
40065213	The efficacy and safety of zavegepant nasal inhalation versus oral calcitonin-gene related peptide receptor antagonists in the acute treatment of migraine: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of the literature.	The latest randomized controlled trial (RCT) revealed that zavegepant, a new nasal inhalation calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, has a clear efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine. However, whether the efficacy of this new nasal inhalation drug is better than other oral CGRP receptor antagonists remained to be confirmed. Therefore, we designed this network meta-analysis (NMA) to provide a reference for the clinical application of zavegepant.

We identify critical barriers and roadblocks that impede effective identification, utilisation, and integration of research findings to inform decision making in research translation. We examine practices at each stage of the research lifecycle, including study design, conduct, and publishing, that can be optimised to facilitate the conduct of timely, accurate, and comprehensive evidence synthesis. These practices are anchored in open science and engaging with the broader research community to ensure evidence is accessible and useful to all stakeholders. We underscore the need for collective action from researchers, synthesis specialists, institutions, publishers and journals, funders, infrastructure providers, and policymakers, who all play a key role in fostering an open, robust and synthesis-ready research environment, for an accelerated trajectory towards integrated biomedical research and translation.
40065189	Dopamine in the tail of the striatum facilitates avoidance in threat-reward conflicts.	Responding appropriately to potential threats before they materialize is critical to avoiding disastrous outcomes. Here we examine how threat-coping behavior is regulated by the tail of the striatum (TS) and its dopamine input. Mice were presented with a potential threat (a moving object) while pursuing rewards. Initially, the mice failed to obtain rewards but gradually improved in later trials. We found that dopamine in TS promoted avoidance of the threat, even at the expense of reward acquisition. Furthermore, the activity of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons promoted threat avoidance and prediction. In contrast, D2 neurons suppressed threat avoidance and facilitated overcoming the potential threat. Dopamine axon activation in TS not only potentiated the responses of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons to novel sensory stimuli but also boosted them acutely. These results demonstrate that an opponent interaction of D1 and D2 neurons in the TS, modulated by dopamine, dynamically regulates avoidance and overcoming potential threats.

40065182	miR-708-5p is elevated in bipolar patients and can induce mood disorder-associated behavior in mice.	Mood disorders (MDs) are caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental (GxE) risk factors. However, molecular pathways engaged by GxE risk factors are poorly understood. Using small-RNA sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we show that the bipolar disorder (BD)-associated microRNA miR-708-5p is upregulated in healthy human subjects with a high genetic or environmental predisposition for MDs. miR-708-5p is further upregulated in the hippocampus of rats which underwent juvenile social isolation, a model of early life stress. Hippocampal overexpression of miR-708-5p in adult male mice is sufficient to elicit MD-associated behavioral endophenotypes. We further show that miR-708-5p directly targets Neuronatin (Nnat), an endoplasmic reticulum protein. Restoring Nnat expression in the hippocampus of miR-708-5p-overexpressing mice rescues miR-708-5p-dependent behavioral phenotypes. Finally, miR-708-5p is upregulated in PBMCs from patients diagnosed with MD. Peripheral miR-708-5p expression allows to differentiate male BD patients from patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). In summary, we describe a potential functional role for the miR-708-5p/Nnat pathway in MD etiology and identify miR-708-5p as a potential biomarker for the differential diagnosis of MDs.

40065171	Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy with laromestrocel in mild Alzheimer's disease: a randomized controlled phase 2a trial.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, severe brain atrophy and neuroinflammation. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline of brain volume and potentially cognitive function. Larger-scale clinical trials of laromestrocel in AD are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05233774 .

40065137	Human neural dynamics of real-world and imagined navigation.	The ability to form episodic memories and later imagine them is integral to the human experience, influencing our recollection of the past and envisioning of the future. While rodent studies suggest the medial temporal lobe, especially the hippocampus, is involved in these functions, its role in human imagination remains uncertain. In human participants, imaginations can be explicitly instructed and reported. Here we investigate hippocampal theta oscillations during real-world and imagined navigation using motion capture and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from individuals with chronically implanted medial temporal lobe electrodes. Our results revealed intermittent theta dynamics, particularly within the hippocampus, encoding spatial information and partitioning navigational routes into linear segments during real-world navigation. During imagined navigation, theta dynamics exhibited similar patterns despite the absence of external cues. A statistical model successfully reconstructed real-world and imagined positions, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human navigation and imagination, with implications for understanding memory in real-world settings.

40065102	A functional single-cell metabolic survey identifies Elovl1 as a target to enhance CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell fitness in solid tumours.	Reprogramming T cell metabolism can improve intratumoural fitness. By performing a CRISPR/Cas9 metabolic survey in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we identified 83 targets and we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to disclose transcriptome changes associated with each metabolic perturbation in the context of pancreatic cancer. This revealed elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 1 (Elovl1) as a metabolic target to sustain effector functions and memory phenotypes in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Accordingly, Elovl1 inactivation in adoptively transferred T cells combined with anti-PD-1 showed therapeutic efficacy in resistant pancreatic and melanoma tumours. The accumulation of saturated long-chain fatty acids in Elovl1-deficient T cells destabilized INSIG1, leading to SREBP2 activation, increased plasma membrane cholesterol and stronger T cell receptor signalling. Elovl1-deficient T cells increased mitochondrial fitness and fatty acid oxidation, thus withstanding the metabolic stress imposed by the tumour microenvironment. Finally, ELOVL1 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with anti-PD-1 response in patients with melanoma. Altogether, Elovl1 targeting synergizes with anti-PD-1 to promote effective T cell responses.

40065072	Subcellular proteomics and iPSC modeling uncover reversible mechanisms of axonal pathology in Alzheimer's disease.	Dystrophic neurites (also termed axonal spheroids) are found around amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where they impair axonal electrical conduction, disrupt neural circuits and correlate with AD severity. Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying spheroid formation remain incompletely understood. To address this, we developed a proximity labeling approach to uncover the proteome of spheroids in human postmortem and mouse brains. Additionally, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AD model enabling mechanistic investigation and optical electrophysiology. These complementary approaches revealed the subcellular molecular architecture of spheroids and identified abnormalities in key biological processes, including protein turnover, cytoskeleton dynamics and lipid transport. Notably, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates these processes, was activated in spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylated mTOR levels in spheroids correlated with AD severity in humans. Notably, mTOR inhibition in iPSC-derived neurons and mice ameliorated spheroid pathology. Altogether, our study provides a multidisciplinary toolkit for investigating mechanisms and therapeutic targets for axonal pathology in neurodegeneration.
40065034	A study on the causes of viewers' non-continuous following intention in tourism live streaming.	With the advancement of digital technologies, tourism live streaming (TLS) has rapidly gained global popularity due to its real-time and interactive features, showcasing significant marketing potential. However, viewer retention remains a major challenge and a bottleneck for TLS development. This study first defined the concept and dimensions of alternative attractiveness in TLS through qualitative interviews. It then constructs an analytical framework based on the Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) theory. It empirically tests how psychological contract breach, viewer-live streamer social distance, and alternative attractiveness influence viewers' non-continuous following intention (NCFI) in TLS. The findings reveal that these factors significantly impact NCFI. Customer complaining behavior mediates the relationship between psychological contract breach and NCFI, and perceived controllability positively moderates this relationship. This study provides a new theoretical perspective on understanding viewer attrition mechanisms and offers practical suggestions for TLS platforms and streamers to enhance viewer retention.
40065030	Music tempo modulates emotional states as revealed through EEG insights.	Music can effectively influence human emotions, with different melodies and rhythms eliciting varying emotional responses. Among these, tempo is one of the most important parameters affecting emotions. This study explores the impact of music tempo on emotional states and the associated brain functional networks. A total of 26 participants without any history of neurological or psychiatric disorders and music training took part in the experiment, using classical piano music clips at different tempi (56, 106, 156 bpm) as stimuli. The study was conducted using emotional scales and electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis. The results showed that the valence level of emotions significantly increased with music tempo, while the arousal level exhibited a "V" shape relationship. EEG analysis revealed significant changes in brainwave signals across different frequency bands under different tempi. For instance, slow tempo induced higher Theta and Alpha power in the frontal region, while fast tempo increased Beta and Gamma band power. Moreover, fast tempo enhanced the average connectivity strength in the frontal, temporal, and occipital regions, and increased phase synchrony value (PLV) between the frontal and parietal regions. However, slow tempo improves PLV between the occipital and parietal regions. The findings of this study elucidate the effects of music tempo on the brain functional networks related to emotion regulation, providing a theoretical basis for music-assisted diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders. Furthermore, these results suggest potential applications in emotion robotics, emotion-based human-computer interaction, and emotion-based intelligent control.
40065021	The effect of MIND diet on sleep status, mental health, and serum level of BDNF in overweight/obese diabetic women with insomnia: a randomized controlled trial.	Insomnia is common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and affects mental health and quality of life. The present study aimed to examine the efficacy of MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet on the anthropometric measurements, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and serum levels of cortisol and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in type 2 diabetic women with insomnia. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 44 type 2 diabetic women with insomnia, aged 30 to 65 years, who were randomly assigned to be under the MIND low-calorie diet (n = 22) or a low-calorie diet (LCD) as the control group (n = 22) for 12 weeks. The above-mentioned variables were assessed at the beginning and the end of intervention. Following the MIND diet for 12 weeks accompanied by the significant decrease of waist circumference and significant improvement of sleep quality, depression, and anxiety compared to the control group. In addition, the MIND diet vs. LCD group exhibited a significant reduction in the cortisol levels and a significant increase in BDNF. This study provides promising evidence of the effectiveness of the MIND diet in improving the sleep quality, mental health, and some related biochemical parameters in diabetic women with insomnia.Trial registration: IRCT20181111041611N8.
40065017	Egg intake in relation to metabolic health status, serum brain derived neurotrophic factor, and adropin levels in Iranian adults.	There is conflicting information about the association between egg intake and metabolic health status and no previous information on this association was found in Middle Eastern populations. This research aimed to investigate the relationship between egg consumption and metabolic health status in Iranian adults, focusing on the potential involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and adropin. This cross-sectional study was done on a sample of 527 individuals (45.7% female) aged between 20 and 65 years. Participants were selected using a multistage cluster random-sampling method. Dietary intakes of participants were evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Blood samples were collected while the individuals were fasting to assess biochemical markers. Metabolic health status of individuals was assessed based on the criteria established by Wildman. Collecting data on covariates was done using pre-tested procedures. Multivariable-adjusted model revealed a statistically significant association between egg consumption and a decreased odds of metabolically unhealthy (MU) status (OR<sub>T3 vs. T1</sub> = 0.47; 95%CI 0.24-0.92). Also, each tertile increase in egg consumption was significantly associated with decreased odds of MU status (OR = 0.68; 95%CI 0.49-0.96). This association was especially significant among males rather than females. Elevated high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were substantially reduced among individuals with the highest consumption of egg compared to the lowest intake. Additionally, there was a slight inverse association between egg consumption and high blood pressure. There were no relationships between egg intake and having low BDNF, and adropin levels. Increased consumption of egg was associated with a decreased chance of being metabolically unhealthy in Iranian adults, especially in male participants.
40064997	A novel approach for the detection of brain tumor and its classification via independent component analysis.	A brain tumor is regarded as one of the deadliest types of cancer due to its intricate nature.This is why it is important that patients get the best possible diagnosis and treatment options. With the help of machine vision, neurologists can now perform a more accurate and faster diagnosis. There are currently no suitable methods that can be used to perform brain segmentation using image processing recently neural network model is used that it can perform better than other methods. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the model, performing accurate brain segmentation in real images is not feasible. The main objective is to develop a novel method that can be used to analyze brain tumors using a component analysis. The proposed model consists of a deep neural network and an image processing framework. It is divided into various phases, such as the mapping stage, the data augmentation stage, and the tumor discovery stage. The data augmentation stage involves training a CNN to identify the regions of the image that are overlapping with the tumor space marker. The DCNN's predicted performance is compared with the test result. The third stage is focused on training a deep neural system and a SVM. This model was able to achieve a 99% accuracy rate and a sensitivity of 0.973%. It is primarily utilized for identifying brain tumors.
40064964	Exploring a patient-specific in vitro pipeline for stratification and drug response prediction of microglia-based therapeutics.	The scarcity of effective biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for predicting disease onset and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major challenge. Conventional drug discovery approaches have been unsuccessful in providing efficient interventions due to their 'one-size-fits-all' nature. As an alternative, personalised drug development holds promise to pre-select responders and identifying suitable indicators of drug efficacy. In this exploratory study, we have established a pipeline with the potential to guide patient stratification studies before clinical trials. This pipeline uses 2D and 3D in vitro models of monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (MDMi) from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and matched healthy control (HC) individuals. By profiling cytokine responses in these models using multidimensional analyses, we have observed that the 3D model offers a more defined separation of profiles between individuals based on disease status. While this pilot study focuses on AD and MCI, future investigations incorporating other neurodegenerative disorders will be necessary to validate the pipeline's findings and demonstrate its broader applicability.

40064934	Neural correlates of reading aloud on the autism spectrum.	Individuals with autism can show intact decoding (i.e., ability to recognize and pronounce written words accurately). However, reading comprehension (i.e., ability to infer meaning from written text) in autistic individuals is often lower than expected based on age or grade level. Having intact decoding skills despite potentially atypical reading comprehension suggests altered reading pathways in autism, particularly when processing semantics (i.e., word meaning). To test for neural differences in word processing between autistic and non-autistic younger adults, we examined behavioral and neural responses to reading aloud words and pronounceable nonsense words (pseudowords). Additionally, we manipulated word imageability, word frequency, and word and pseudoword spelling-sound consistency as probes for different components (i.e., orthography, phonology and semantics) of the reading system. Behaviorally, the autistic group had a greater reduction in reaction time as word imageability increased. Neurally, pseudoword consistency effects, a probe of spelling-sound mappings without semantics, were only observed in the autistic group, where increased consistency was associated with decreased activity in bilateral intraparietal sulcus. Also compared to the non-autistic group, the autistic group showed greater effects of word consistency, where increasing word consistency was associated with increasing activation in the bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus and ventral occipitotemporal cortex. Finally, the autistic group showed stronger effects of pseudoword consistency than the non-autistic group, that is increasing pseudoword consistency was associated with decreasing activation in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex. Together, these results point to differences in how neural resources are used for reading, with more bilateral areas recruited during spelling-sound decoding in autistics to achieve comparable performance to non-autistics.
