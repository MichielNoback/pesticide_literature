40066676	Arid4a Suppresses Breast Tumor Metastasis by Enhancing MTSS1 Expression via mRNA Stability.	Tumor metastasis is one of the main causes of death in cancer patients; however, the mechanism controlling metastasis is unclear. The posttranscriptional regulation of metastasis-related genes mediated by AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 4A (Arid4a), an RNA-binding protein (RBP), has not been elucidated.
40066621	Lyophilized monkeypox mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines with long-term stability and robust immune responses in mice.	The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared another global health emergency due to the rapidly spreading monkeypox (Mpox) outbreak in numerous African countries. To address the unmet need to contain the outbreak using the existing vaccines, this study developed a lyophilization process for an effective, scalable and affordable Mpox mRNA-LNP vaccine candidate to address the global health crisis. A comprehensive evaluation and optimization of the vaccine formulation (the type/concentration of cryoprotectants, the type/concentration of buffer system, as well as the mRNA concentration and reconstitution solvent) and the freeze-drying process parameters (freezing method, temperature, cooling rate and primary/secondary drying conditions) were conducted. The freeze-dried product exhibits a uniform appearance and a moisture content of less than 1%. Reconstitution of the lyophilized mRNA-LNP resulted in equivalent particle size/polydispersity index, encapsulation efficiency and mRNA integrity compared to that of freshly prepared mRNA-LNP. Furthermore, the lyophilization process can be scaled up 100-fold to 2000 vials/batch. Notably, the lyophilized mRNA-LNP demonstrated a storage stability of at least 12 months at 4°C, and at ambient temperature for a minimum of 8 h post-reconstitution, exhibiting minimal deterioration in product quality. The in vitro biological activity and in vivo immunogenicity of the lyophilized mRNA-LNP was comparable to that of the freshly prepared mRNA-LNP. These results provide a compelling rationale for the utilization of lyophilization technology in enhancing the accessibility of the Mpox mRNA vaccine in developing countries, a strategy that is crucial for containing the global epidemic of Mpox infection.
40066567	Combined Loss of Obsc and Obsl1 in Murine Hearts Results in Diastolic Dysfunction, Altered Metabolism, and Deregulated Mitophagy.	Muscle proteins of the obscurin protein family play important roles in sarcomere organization and sarcoplasmic reticulum and T-tubule architecture and function. However, their precise molecular functions and redundancies between protein family members as well as their involvement in cardiac diseases remain to be fully understood.
40066518	LAMP2-FLOT2 interaction enhances autophagosome-lysosome fusion to protect the septic heart in response to ILC2.	Cardiac dysfunction is a serious complication of sepsis-induced multiorgan failure in intensive care units and is characterized by an uncontrolled immune response to overwhelming infection. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), as a part of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in the inflammatory process of heterogeneous cardiac disorders. However, the role of ILC2 in regulating sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that autophagic flux blockage exacerbated inflammatory response and cardiac dysfunction, which was associated with mortality of sepsis. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model, we observed an expansion of ILC2s in the septic heart. Furthermore, IL4 derived from ILC2 mitigated cardiac inflammatory responses and improved cardiac function during sepsis. Additionally, IL4 enhanced LAMP2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2) expression through STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation to stabilize lysosomal homeostasis and rescue the impaired autophagic flux during sepsis. Notably, LAMP2 was preferentially bound to FLOT2 (flotillin 2) after IL4 exposure, and the interaction enhanced autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cardiac endothelial cells. Loss of FLOT2 reversed the regulatory effects of LAMP2 on autophagy mediated by IL4, leading to autophagosome accumulation and suppressed autophagosome clearance. Conclusively, these findings provide novel insights that ILC2 regulates incomplete autophagic flux to protect septic heart and expand our understanding of immunoregulation for sepsis.<b>Abbreviation</b>: ACTB: actin beta; ACTN: actinin, alpha; ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; ANXA5/annexin V: annexin A5; AO: acridine orange; BECN1/Beclin1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CKM: creatine kinase, muscle; CKB: creatine kinase, brain; CLP: cecal ligation and puncture; CO: cardiac output; CQ: chloroquine; CTS: cathepsin; DAPI: 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EC: endothelial cell; EF: ejection fraction; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FLOT: flotillin; FS: fractional shortening; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GATA3: GATA binding protein 3; GLB1/β-Gal: galactosidase, beta 1; HCMEC: human cardiac microvascular endothelial cell; IL: interleukin; ILC: innate lymphoid cell; IL1RL1/ST2: interleukin 1 receptor-like 1; IL4c: IL4 complex; IL7R/CD127: interleukin 7 receptor; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; LAMP: lysosomal-associated membrane protein; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LMP: lysosome membrane permeabilization; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LVEDd: left ventricular end-diastole diameter; LVEDV: left ventricular end-diastole volume; LVESd: left ventricular end-systolic diameter; LVESV: left ventricular end-systole volume; MAN: mannosidase alpha; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MS: mass spectrometry; PECAM1/CD31: platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; PTPRC/CD45: protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C; RORC/RORγt: RAR related orphan receptor gamma; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TBX21/T-bet: T-box 21; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; THY1/CD90.2: thymus cell antigen 1, theta; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-translocating ATPase; VIM: vimentin.
40066516	Quantitative Detection of Orthotopic Liver Cancer in Mice Using Indocyanine Green and Dynamic Diffuse Fluorescence Tomography Imaging.	Orthotopic tumor model has become an essential tool for studying drug biodistribution and tumor progression over time owing to the rapid development of in vivo imaging and immunological science. Dynamic diffuse fluorescence tomography (DFT) is a promising imaging modality that can map the three-dimensional distribution of a fluorophore within the object and capture the metabolic parameters of fluorophores in vivo. It has been widely applied in tumor detection, drug development, and efficacy evaluation. To detect orthotopic liver tumors, we combined indocyanine green (ICG) and a DFT system to perform fluorescence imaging and quantitative analysis for orthotopic liver tumors in mice. The orthotopic liver models were first established, and the liver fluorescence yields were detected in pre- and post-cancerous liver using the DFT system. The results showed that there was higher liver uptake and prolonged retention in orthotopic tumor liver compared to normal liver. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic parameters suggested the uptake coefficient of tumor liver was above twice that of normal liver, while the excretion rates were similar. Additionally, to intuitively assess tumor occurrence, we propose using normalized fluorescence ratios of 5 and maximum fluorescence values of 0.01 mm<sup>-1</sup> as evaluation criteria. The study demonstrates DFT imaging is a promising tool in orthotopic tumor model detection and drug or agent metabolic evaluation.
40066501	FLOT1 Is a Novel Serum Biomarker of Ovarian Cancer Targeted by N6-methyladenosine Modification Inhibition.	Ovarian cancer (OC) is a deadly disease and lacks a precise marker for diagnosis worldwide. Our previous work has shown the overexpression of flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in OC tissue. To improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, we evaluated the serum level of FLOT1 in OC patients and found that the serum concentration of FLOT1 as well as CA125 was significantly increased in patients with OC compared with healthy control (p < 0.01) and those with benign tumors (p < 0.05). The detection rate (above the upper limit of a cut-off value) of FLOT1 and CA125 was 77.78% and 72.22%, respectively, in patients with OC, which was increased to 88.89% in combination. The elevation of FLOT1 was confirmed in the serum of nude mice after the implantation of human OC cells. A high level of FLOT1 protein in the serum was positively correlated with the overexpression of FLOT1 protein in OC tissues. Furthermore, the level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of FLOT1 mRNA was significantly high in OC cells compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells, leading to an increase in FLOT1 mRNA expression. Application of a methylation inhibitor, 3-deazaadenosine, decreased FLOT1 mRNA expression in OC cells and suppressed tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that FLOT1 is a novel serum biomarker of OC and can be targeted by m<sup>6</sup>A modification inhibition. These data highlight the potential application of FLOT1 as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for patients with OC.
40066484	Co-Delivery of Morphologically Switchable Au Nanowire and Hemoglobin-Resveratrol Nanoparticles in the Microneedle for Diabetic Wound Healing Therapy.	Diabetic wounds are a common complication of diabetes and pose a significant threat to human health. High glucose concentration in the wound remains a major obstacle, necessitating effective strategies to achieve sustained glucose consumption for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In this study, an Au-based nanomaterial is developed that can adjust its morphology in different therapeutic processes. The prepared Au nanowire (ANW) can be converted into Au nanospheres (AS) under ultrasonic conditions by adjusting the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on its surface for convenient delivery. Intriguingly, AS is depolymerized into ANW again in the wound area, prolonging the retention time, and ensuring continuous consumption of glucose. After constructing the morphologically switchable Au nanowire, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is applied it to microneedle and co-delivered it with hemoglobin (Hb)-resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model, the microneedle degraded gradually, and the Hb-RES nanoparticles synergistically ameliorated hypoxia, scavenged ROS, and inhibited macrophage differentiation into pro-inflammatory M1 phenotypes. During this process, ANW continuously catalyzed glucose through its inherent glucose oxidase activity. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the long-term management of glucose concentration during synergistic diabetic wound healing.
40066481	3D Soft Liquid Metal Electrodes for High-Resolution and Long-Term Electromyography in Muscle Trauma Assessment.	Electromyography (EMG) is a widely used diagnostic technique for evaluating the electrical activity of muscles and their controlling nerves. However, conventional surface electrodes with planar structures often suffer from low spatial resolution and suboptimal signal quality. Here, 3D-shaped, substrate-free, soft, and biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) are presented as a wearable interface for neuromuscular signal recording. These electrodes enable the acquisition of high-quality EMG signals while their intrinsic mechanical softness supports long-term use in clinical settings. In a human pilot study, continuous, high-spatial-resolution EMG monitoring of musculoskeletal activity over 25 days is achieved. Furthermore, in vivo EMG monitoring in mouse models of ischemia and volumetric muscle loss demonstrated the therapeutic effects of extracellular muscle-rehabilitative drugs. This work highlights the potential of LMe for advanced drug screening and long-term clinical diagnostics.
40066448	BLIMP-1-dependent differentiation of T follicular helper cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory type 1 cells.	T-regulatory-type-1 (TR1) cells are a subset of interleukin-10-producing but Foxp3<sup>-</sup> Treg cells that arise in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. We have shown that systemic delivery of autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NP) triggers the formation of large pools of disease-suppressing Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells from cognate T-follicular helper (TFH) cell precursors. Here we show that, upon treatment withdrawal, these Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells spontaneously differentiate into a novel immunoregulatory Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subset that inherits epigenetic and transcriptional hallmarks of their precursors, including clonotypic T-cell receptors, and is distinct from other Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg subsets. Whereas the transcription factor BLIMP-1 is dispensable for development of conventional Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, it is necessary for development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 cells. In a model of central nervous system autoimmunity, abrogation of BLIMP-1 or IL-10 expression in the Foxp3<sup>-</sup> and/or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subsets inhibits their development or anti-encephalitogenic activity. Thus, the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway results in the generation of two distinct autoimmune disease-suppressing, IL-10-producing TR1 subsets that are distinguished by the expression of Foxp3 and Foxp3 target genes.
40066446	Exercise boost after surgery improves survival in model of metastatic breast cancer.	Despite advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment of the primary tumor, metastatic breast cancer tumors remain largely incurable, and their growth is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. There is therefore a critical need to identify ways to reduce metastatic tumor burden and increase breast cancer patient survival. While surgery and pharmacological treatments are the cornerstones of breast cancer intervention, epidemiological data suggests that physical activity can lower the risk of breast cancer development, improve adjuvant treatment tolerance, reduce the risk of disease recurrence and lower breast cancer-related death.
40066444	The changes of NLRs family members in the brain of AD mouse model and AD patients.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is primarily characterized by progressive neuron loss and memory impairment. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are crucial for immune regulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recently, NLRs have been identified as important contributors to neuroinflammation, thus presenting a potential approach for reducing inflammation and slowing AD progression.
40066371	Robotic animals as new tools in rodent neuroscience research: proposed applications of zooinspired robots for mouse behavioral testing.	Bioinspired robots are machines which reproduce structural or functional features of a living organism. In particular, the bioinspired robots which reproduce features of animals can be more specifically defined as zooinspired robots. Currently, the applications of animal robots are various and range across different fields, such as, for instance, nature conservation, search and rescue of humans after natural or man-made disasters, exploration of extraterrestrial environments and robotic pets for elderly people under care for dementia. Several animal species have been imitated up to now, from lizards to butterflies, and from fish to dogs. Animal robots used to investigate the social behavior of an animal species through animal-robot interactions are called ethorobots. Intriguingly, ethorobots are able to reproduce in the laboratory behaviors that are generally produced spontaneously in nature and are difficult or impossible to evoke and modulate in captive animals, which makes these animal robots particularly useful tools for experimental ethology and ethological neuroscience. Rodents, primarily mice and rats, are the most common animal model in biomedical research. Coherently with the importance of these species for scientific research, robotic mice and rats have been attracting increasing efforts in bioinspired robotics over the course of the past five decades. The technological advancement of animal robots will make their employment for scientific research increasingly useful. However, clear experimental applications of animal robots should be identified in order to challenge engineers to design robots that can serve these experimental scopes. In the present work, we will describe possible practical applications of robotic animals for mouse behavioral testing across six different behavioral domains, namely courtship, parental care, antipredatory behavior, helping behavior, predation and territory defense-related aggression. In particular, we will outline how robotic animals could be employed to interact with living mice in a series of specific tests of social behavior. Finally, in the conclusion we will consider the ethical and epistemological advantages of the use of robotic animals in behavioral neuroscience. Indeed, robotic animals can benefit scientific research on social behaviors both in terms of optimized animal welfare of the tested subjects and of extended opportunities of experimental designing due to an unprecedented control over the independent variables.
40066333	Cepharanthine hydrochloride: a novel ferroptosis-inducing agent for prostate cancer treatment.	Ferroptosis is an intracellular iron-dependent cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Increasing evidence indicated that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in suppressing tumors, thus providing new opportunities for cancer therapy. The drug cepharanthine, commonly used to treat leukopenia, has been discovered to function as an anticancer agent to multiple types of cancer via diverse mechanisms. However, the effect of cepharanthine on prostate cancer remains unclear.
40066331	Ginsenoside Ro ameliorates cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice via the IBA1/GFAP-MAPK signaling pathway.	Ginseng, known as the "king of herbs," has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine due to its beneficial properties, including anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. Ginsenosides, the active compounds in ginseng, have shown promise in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Ginsenoside Ro and its underlying mechanisms in AD treatment.
40066325	Optimizing Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Therapy via Ultrasound-Enhanced Piezocatalysis for Targeted Chemodrug Release.	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is known for its high malignancy, limited clinical treatment options, and poor chemotherapy outcomes. Although some advancements have been made using nanotechnology-based chemotherapy for TNBC treatment, the controlled and on-demand release of chemotherapeutic drugs at the tumor site remains a challenge.
40066322	Biomimetic Self-Oxygenated Immunoliposome for Cancer-Targeted Photodynamic Immunotherapy.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy with significant clinical application potential for tumor treatment. However, the tumor hypoxia and limited efficacy against tumor metastasis present significant limitations in the clinical application of PDT. To alleviate tumor hypoxia for PDT against tumor growth and metastasis, we developed a self-oxygenated immunoliposome by encapsulating the catalase (CAT) within the liposome cavity and loading the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and immunoadjuvant MPLA in the lipid bilayer of the immunoliposome (CAT@LP-Ce6-A). Subsequently, we fused it with the cancer cell membrane (CCM) to create the hybrid immunoliposome (CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A). The in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A-based photodynamic immunotherapy (PDIT) was evaluated.
40066318	Nedd4L signaling contributes to carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in female mice and is associated with enteric dysbacteriosis.	Liver fibrosis is characterized by hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and collagen overproduction, but its pathogenesis remains largely unknown. This study aimed to uncover the role of neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (Nedd4L) signaling in liver fibrosis and its relationship with gut microbiota.
40066291	Asiaticoside-nitric oxide synergistically accelerate diabetic wound healing by regulating key metabolites and SRC/STAT3 signaling.	Diabetic wounds pose significant clinical challenges due to impaired healing processes, often resulting in chronic, nonhealing ulcers. Asiaticoside (AC), a natural triterpene derivative from <i>Centella asiatica</i>, has demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. However, the synergistic effects of nitric oxide (NO)-a recognized promoter of wound healing-combined with AC in treating diabetic wounds remain inadequately explored.
40066286	Connexin hemichannels and early atrophic signaling in muscle during sepsis.	Sepsis pathogenesis is complex, and effective treatments are limited, leading to high mortality rates between 20% and 55%. Early identification of factors contributing to sepsis-related muscle dysfunction is critical for risk stratification and potential therapeutic development. The immune response during sepsis affects skeletal muscles, contributing to organ dysfunction and worsening prognosis. In this study, we explore the role of connexin hemichannels (Cx HCs) in the early changes in muscle homeostasis during sepsis. Using a cecal ligature and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis model, we assessed IL-6 levels, weight loss, myofiber cross-sectional area, resting membrane potential, and connexin expression in control and Cx43/Cx45-deficient mice. CLP induced IL-6 elevation, sarcolemma permeabilization, reduced membrane potential, and activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in control mice, while Cx43/45-deficient mice exhibited reduced all CLP-induced muscle alterations. These findings suggest that Cx43 and Cx45 are involved in the early development of muscle alterations during sepsis.
40066268	Development of a colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip for rapid detection of <i>Areca palm velarivirus 1</i>.	<i>Areca palm velarivirus 1</i> (APV1), the causal agent of betel palm yellow leaf disease (YLD), has caused significant yield losses and decreased product quality of betel nuts, posing a serious economic threat to local farmers. There is an urgent need for a convenient and reliable method for the rapid detection and surveillance of APV1.
40066267	<i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> regulates gut microbiota and increases the effective metabolite luteolin to inhibit MAPK/STAT3 signaling pathway to alleviate allergic rhinitis.	The global prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) remains high, posing challenges due to its chronic nature and propensity for recurrence. Gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to immune dysregulation, impacting AR pathogenesis. <i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> (<i>L. reuteri</i>) has great potential in regulating immune function to alleviate AR symptoms. However, the specific active components and mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects in AR remain incompletely clarified. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms of <i>L. reuteri</i> and its metabolites in alleviating AR. The AR mouse model was constructed using ovalbumin (OVA). The analysis of hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE staining) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) suggested that <i>L. reuteri</i> alleviated nasal inflammation, suppressed aberrant Th2 immune responses, and modulated the balance of Treg and Th17 cytokines. The 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolic analysis revealed that <i>L. reuteri</i> restored gut microbiota composition and significantly increased the abundance of <i>Ligilactobacillus</i> and the metabolite luteolin (LO). Through ELISA and Western blotting analysis, LO treatment restored the Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 cytokine balance and suppressed the MAPK/STAT3 signaling pathway in AR mice. The study highlights LO as a key metabolite contributing to the anti-inflammatory effects of <i>L. reuteri</i>, suggesting potential avenues for future therapeutic strategies in AR management.
40066261	Comprehensive investigation of proteoglycan gene expression in breast cancer: Discovery of a unique proteoglycan gene signature linked to the malignant phenotype.	Solid tumors present a formidable challenge in oncology, necessitating innovative approaches to improve therapeutic outcomes. Proteoglycans, multifaceted molecules within the tumor microenvironment, have garnered attention due to their diverse roles in cancer progression. Their unique ability to interact with specific membrane receptors, growth factors, and cytokines provides a promising avenue for the development of recombinant proteoglycan-based therapies that could enhance the precision and efficacy of cancer treatment. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the proteoglycan gene landscape in human breast carcinomas. Leveraging the available wealth of genomic and clinical data regarding gene expression in breast carcinoma and using a machine learning model, we identified a unique gene expression signature composed of five proteoglycans differentially modulated in the tumor tissue: Syndecan-1 and asporin (upregulated) and decorin, PRELP and podocan (downregulated). Additional query of the breast carcinoma data revealed that serglycin, previously shown to be increased in breast carcinoma patients and mouse models and to correlate with a poor prognosis, was indeed decreased in the vast majority of breast cancer patients and its levels inversely correlated with tumor progression and invasion. This proteoglycan gene signature could provide novel diagnostic capabilities in breast cancer biology and highlights the need for further utilization of publicly available datasets for the clinical validation of preclinical experimental results.
40066258	Implications of draxin in neurological disorders.	Axon guidance proteins not only play a role in the formation of proper neural circuits but also have other important functions, such as cell survival, migration, and proliferation in the brain. Therefore, mutations in the genes encoding these proteins frequently cause various types of neurological disorders, including psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously identified an axon guidance protein, draxin, that is essential for the development of several neural circuits and cell survival in the brain. Recently, the deletion of the <i>draxin</i> gene was identified in an inbred BTBR T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup>/J (BTBR/J) mouse, which is a widely used model of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), suggesting that <i>draxin</i> deletion is a genetic factor for ASD-like characteristics in BTBR/J mice. In this review, I summarize the neuroanatomical abnormalities in <i>draxin</i> knockout mice by comparing them to BTBR/J mice and discuss the possible contributions of draxin to anatomical and behavioral phenotypes in BTBR/J mice.
40066228	<i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> Promotes the Growth and Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer by Activating E-Cadherin/Krüppel-Like Factor 4/Integrin α5 Signaling in a Calcium-Dependent Manner.	Gut microbiota and integrins are known to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether they interact has been unclear. Here, we provided evidence that <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> upregulated integrin α5 (ITGA5) in CRC in both human patients and murine models. Knocking down <i>ITGA5</i> in CRC cells weakened the ability of <i>F. nucleatum</i> to stimulate their malignant characteristics. <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which in turn promoted interaction between E-cadherin and Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), resulting in KLF4 phosphorylation and translocation in the nucleus, where it induced <i>ITGA5</i> transcription and activated the downstream signaling. Knocking down E-cadherin or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> with BAPTA-AM antagonized the impact of <i>F. nucleatum</i> on KLF4, whereas knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> antagonized the bacteria's oncogenic role. Knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or <i>ITGA5</i> attenuated <i>F. nucleatum-</i>induced growth of patient-derived organoids, subcutaneous xenografts, and orthotopic tumors, as well as liver metastasis in nude mice. Integrin α5 antibody antagonized the oncogenic role of <i>F. nucleatum</i> in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that <i>F. nucleatum</i> promotes the growth and metastasis of CRC by activating E-cadherin/KLF4/integrin α5 signaling in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner.
40066227	Carabrone Attenuates Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis by Targeting STAT3 in Mice.	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has become one of the most common progressive liver diseases worldwide, but effective treatment options are severely unmet. Carabrone, a sesquiterpene lactone from the traditional Chinese herb <i>Carpesium abrotanoides </i>L., shows various pharmacological properties, whereas its effect on the improvement of MASH and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been reported. In this work, we revealed for the first time the beneficial effect of carabrone on MASH, including reducing liver lipid accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and fibrosis in multiple diet-induced mice. Carabrone also alleviated lipid accumulation and inflammation in palmitic acid/oleic acid-stimulated hepatocytes. Mechanically, we identified signal transducers and transcriptional activator 3 (STAT3) as a key target of carabrone for treating MASH through quantitative chemical proteomic analysis, as well as the verification by the overexpression of STAT3 in vivo and in vitro. Further studies demonstrated that carabrone blocks MASH progression by inhibiting the activation of STAT3. More importantly, a new carabrone derivative <b>CA-21</b> with stronger anti-MASH activity and affinity for STAT3 was discovered through rational structural modification. Taken together, our findings suggest that carabrone and <b>CA-21</b> could be developed as promising drug candidates for MASH treatment.
40066226	Depletion of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 Facilitates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer Cells by Activating the MAPK/ERK Pathway.	Hyperactivation of fatty acid biosynthesis holds promise as a targeted therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer (PCa). However, inhibiting these enzymes could potentially promote metastatic progression in various other cancers. Herein, we found that depletion of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (encoded by ACACA), the enzyme responsible for the first and rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of PCa cells. This finding was validated in vitro through cell migration assays and in vivo using a metastatic model established by tail vein injection of ACACA-depleted cells into BALB/c nude mice. Additionally, depletion of ACACA activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway. Inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway reduced EMT and migration in ACACA-depleted cells. Our study is the first to indicate targeting ACACA induces an "unexpected" escape program through activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in PCa, ultimately leading to EMT and metastasis. Therefore, we strongly recommend that the potential adverse effects of targeting ACACA or its derived therapeutic agents must be given extreme attention, especially in MAPK-related cancers.
40066092	Engineered exosomes restore miR-508-5p expression in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and reduce tumor progression and metastasis by targeting DLL3.	Endometrial cancer (EC) is a growing global health concern. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving EC is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the roles of DLL3 and miR-508-5p in EC progression and explores a therapeutic approach using engineered exosomes to modulate their expression.
40066086	Vaccarin Ameliorates Renal Fibrosis by Inhibiting Ferroptosis via Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 Signaling Pathway.	Vaccarin is a natural flavonoid glycoside with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and nephroprotective effects. However, the effects of vaccarin on renal fibrosis (RF) and its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vaccarin on RF and its molecular mechanisms.
40066080	Specnuezhenide Alleviates Senile Osteoporosis by Activating TGR5/FXR Signaling in Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells and RANKL-Induced Osteoclasts.	Specnuezhenide (SPN) is an iridoid glycoside isolated from <i>Fructus Ligustri Lucidi</i>, an herb prescribed for the treatment of senile osteoporosis. However, the direct role of SPN on bone metabolism remains unclear. In this study, the effects of SPN on d-galactose (d-gal)-induced mice, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and nuclear factor-κB ligand-induced osteoclasts were examined.
40066066	Differential effects of high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota.	Microorganisms contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity, while more studies focus on gut microbiome. However, the relationship between oral microbiota and obesity has yet to be elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the similarities and differences in the effects of a high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota through mouse experiments, exploring the hypothesis that oral microbial mechanisms may contribute to obesity.
40066053	Chestnut (<i>Castanea crenata</i> S. et Z.) inner shell-A by-product promotes anti-obesity by regulating adipogenesis and lipogenesis-related genes and the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.	A by-product is a secondary substance unintentionally produced during manufacturing and can be repurposed through recycling. In particular, by-products generated from the processing of natural materials are valuable because of their bioactive compound content, such as polyphenols and anthocyanins. Obesity is a global health issue, and medicines for obesity have side effects, such as insomnia and headaches. The demand for safe anti-obesity treatments based on natural products has increased. In this study, the anti-obesity efficacy of chestnut inner skin powder (CIS), a by-product, was investigated in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model. CIS (100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) was administered orally for 7 weeks, and 200 mg/kg garcinia was used as the positive control. Body weight (BW) and food intake were monitored weekly. Our results showed that CIS intake reduced BW, liver weight, white adipose tissue (WAT) weight (epididymal, retroperitoneal, and perirenal tissues), leptin levels, LDL-c levels, and expression of adipogenesis- and lipogenesis-related genes, similar to the positive control group. Additionally, CIS activated the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway in the liver and reduced adipocyte size in the WAT H&E stain. In conclusion, these findings suggest that CIS may prevent and treat obesity by regulating adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipid metabolism.
40066047	A novel single-domain antibody obtained from immune Bactrian camels against botulinum toxin type A using SPR-based screening method.	Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a highly lethal toxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which leads to nerve paralysis following poisoning. At present, there is no specific drug officially approved. Antibodies, particularly single-domain antibodies, represent safe and effective candidates for specific drugs against BoNT. In this study, the receptor-binding domain of botulinum toxin (BoNT/AHC<sub>C</sub>) was utilized to immunize Bactrian camels, resulting in the generation of a nanobody phage library. From this library, a high-affinity binding antibody, designated A1, and a neutralizing antibody, named HM, were successfully obtained through SPR-based screening. The affinity constant of HM for botulinum toxin is 1.08E-11 M. Results from computer simulations indicate that HM binds at the same site as SV2C. Furthermore, experimental findings demonstrate that HM exhibits significant blocking activity at both the <i>in vitro</i> binding level and the cellular level. In mouse toxicity experiments, HM has been shown to offer protection against a 20 LD<sub>50</sub> dose of BoNT/A. Consequently, HM mitigates botulinum toxin poisoning in mice by obstructing the binding of AHC<sub>C</sub> to SV2C.
40065911	Intrinsic retinoic acid synthesis is required for oligodendrocyte progenitor expansion during CNS remyelination.	Myelin regeneration (remyelination) in the CNS depends on the recruitment, proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at demyelinated lesions. However, despite the presence of OPCs, very few oligodendrocytes and myelin are regenerated in chronic multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions for reasons that remain poorly understood. Here, using a spontaneous remyelination model in mice, we found that retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2), a rate-limiting enzyme for retinoic acid (RA) synthesis, is upregulated in OPCs and in a subpopulation of microglia/macrophages during remyelination. Tamoxifen induced deletion of Raldh2 globally, or conditionally in OPCs, resulted in significantly fewer proliferating OPCs in lesions, leading to decreased oligodendrocyte numbers and myelin density. Moreover, induced deletion of Raldh2 globally also resulted in increased microglia/macrophage density in lesions. Further, exogenous RA delivery into lesions significantly increased oligodendrocyte lineage cells, while also decreasing proinflammatory microglia/macrophages, with no significant effect on anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages. Postmortem MS brain sections revealed Raldh2 was absent in the majority of OPCs in chronic inactive lesions compared to the other lesion types. These results suggest that Raldh2 upregulation in lesions is critical for OPC proliferation during remyelination, and reveal that the failure to regenerate sufficient oligodendrocytes and myelin in chronic MS lesions may arise from impaired OPC expansion due to the failure to intrinsically synthesize RA.
40065910	The Effect of Acupuncture on the Morphology and Neural Coding Damage of the Central Amygdala in Mice with Chronic Inflammatory Pain and Depression.	Observing the effects and roles of acupuncture on the morphology and neural coding damage of central amygdala (CeA) neurons in chronic inflammatory pain with depression (CIPD) mice and exploring the central nervous mechanism of acupuncture intervention in CIPD.
40065909	Adenosine A2A Receptor Activation Alleviated Disease of Mice with Systemic <i>Candida albicans</i> Infection by Regulating Macrophage Function.	The incidence of candidemia, mediated by systemic <i>Candida albicans</i> (<i>C. albicans</i>) infection, was increasing. It is an urgent need to understand the underlying disease mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets. This study aimed to investigate the roles of adenosine-adenosine receptor signal in systemic <i>C. albicans</i> infection.
40065841	Novel idebenone derivatives attenuated oxidative stress injury and myocardial damage.	Oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was the primary causative factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the existing therapy drugs for oxidative stress were much less investigated, which underlined the necessity for new drug discovery and development. Herein, we aimed to synthesize several novel idebenone (IDE) derivatives and investigate the protective effect and mechanism of these derivatives against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress injury in H9C2 cells by determining cell proliferation rate, detecting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and the expression of related proteins. Additionally, the study also investigated the protective effect of IDE-1 pretreatment on Balb/c mice after hypoxia-reoxygenation. <i>In vivo</i> experiments, the damage to cardiomyocytes was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The results showed that IDE-1 possessed the highest antioxidant damage activity among all IDE derivatives, which could notably decrease the levels of intracellular ROS. Furthermore, the antioxidant mechanism was confirmed to be potentially linked to the expression levels of the oxidation-related pathway heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the apoptosis-related pathway Bcl-2/Bax and caspase-3. Our results demonstrated that IDE derivatives could be a new research direction for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases associated with oxidative stress.
40065807	Comparison of naturalization mouse model setups uncover distinct effects on intestinal mucosa depending on microbial experience.	Concerns regarding the translational value of preclinical mouse models have been addressed by introducing various approaches of 'naturalizing' research mice, which provide them with more diverse microbiomes and physiological immune responses. We have previously shown that 'feralized' mice, that is, inbred laboratory mice raised in a farmyard-like, microbe-rich environment exhibit a shifted gut microbiota, matured immunophenotype, and reduced severity of colorectal cancer. Similar studies occasionally involve co-housing with wild or pet-store-raised mice as microbial donors integrating species-specific commensals and pathogens. To what extent these different practices of microbial exposure are crucial for the resulting mouse phenotype remains unclear.
40065806	Obesity drives dysregulation in DC responses to viral infection.	Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, with over 1 billion people worldwide living with obesity. It is associated with an increased risk of over 200 chronic co-morbidities, including an increased susceptibility to infection. Numerous studies have highlighted the dysfunction caused by obesity on a wide range of immune cell subsets, including dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are innate immune sentinels that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems. DCs provide critical signals that instruct and shape the immune response. Our group has previously reported that DCs from people with obesity display defective cytokine production; however, the mechanisms underpinning these defects are unclear.
40065768	Development of a novel anti-erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor B6 monoclonal antibody Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 for flow cytometry.	Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor B6 (EphB6) is a member of the largest Eph subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. EphB6 is widely expressed in various tissues and regulates cellular homeostasis by interacting with its membrane-bound ephrin ligands and other receptors. EphB6 is involved in cancer pathology despite lacking kinase activity. Developing sensitive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for EphB6 has been desired for treatment, diagnosis, and further analysis of EphB6. This study established a novel specific and sensitive anti-human EphB6 mAb clone Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 (mouse IgG<sub>1</sub>, kappa) by the Cell-Based Immunization and Screening (CBIS) method. In flow cytometry, Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 demonstrated reactivity with EphB6-overexpressed Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (CHO/EphB6) and endogenously EphB6-expressing DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells. Cross-reactivity of Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 was not observed. Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 demonstrated a moderate binding affinity (dissociation constant; <i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>) for CHO/EphB6 (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>: 2.6 ± 1.0 × 10<sup>-8</sup> M) and a high binding affinity for DLD-1 (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>: 3.4 ± 1.3 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M). Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3 can detect EphB6 protein in CHO/EphB6 lysate in Western blot. Eb<sub>6</sub>Mab-3, established by the CBIS method, could be valuable for analyzing the EphB6-associated cellular functions and has potential applications in diagnosis and treatment with specificity and high affinity for cancer cells.
40065760	<sup>64</sup>Cu-chelated InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs as PET/fluorescence dual-modal probe for tumor imaging.	Positron emission tomography (PET)/fluorescence dual-modal imaging combines deep penetration and high resolution, making it a promising approach for tumor diagnostics. Semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant attention for fluorescence imaging owing to their tunable emission wavelength, high quantum yield, and excellent photostability. Among these QDs, heavy metal-free InP-based QDs have emerged as a promising candidate, addressing concerns regarding heavy metal-related toxicity. However, to the best of our knowledge, PET/fluorescence dual-modal imaging of InP QDs has yet to be explored. Here, we developed a novel PET/fluorescence imaging probe based on radioisotope (RI) -chelated InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs for tumor imaging. The surface of the InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs was functionalized with polyethylene glycol terminated with either a methoxy group or a 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelator group. Subsequently, the RI <sup>64</sup>Cu was chelated with DOTA on the surface of the InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs, integrating their bright fluorescence with radioactivity. Using the obtained <sup>64</sup>Cu-chelated InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs, PET/fluorescence dual-modal imaging of tumor-bearing mice was conducted, demonstrating successful multi-scale imaging from the whole body to the subcellular level. This novel PET/fluorescence dual-modal probe is expected to contribute to more precise tumor diagnosis.
40065746	Compound screening in human airway basal cells identifies Wnt pathway activators as potential pro-regenerative therapies.	Regeneration of the airway epithelium restores barrier function and mucociliary clearance following lung injury and infection. The mechanisms regulating the proliferation and differentiation of tissue-resident airway basal stem cells remain incompletely understood. To identify compounds that promote human airway basal cell proliferation, we performed phenotype-based compound screening of 1,429 compounds (from the ENZO and Prestwick Chemical libraries) in 384-well format using primary cells transduced with lentiviral luciferase. 17 pro-proliferative compounds were validated in independent donor cell cultures, including the antiretroviral therapy abacavir and several Wnt signalling pathway activating compounds. The effects of compounds on proliferation were further explored in colony formation and 3D organoid assays. Structurally and functionally-related compounds that more potently induced Wnt pathway activation were investigated. One such compound, 1-azakenpaullone, induced Wnt target gene activation and basal cell proliferation in mice. Our results demonstrate the pro-proliferative effect of small-molecule Wnt pathway activators on airway basal cells. These findings contribute to the rationale to develop novel approaches to modulate Wnt signalling during airway epithelial repair.
40065724	Bacteroides fragilis Toxin Suppresses METTL3-Mediated m6A Modification in Macrophage to Promote Inflammatory Bowel Disease.	Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT), produced by enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF), is crucial for ETBF-induced colitis. This study aims to investigate the impact of BFT-host interactions on N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of host mRNA and its underlying mechanisms.
40065721	HDAC11 in ovarian granulosa cells coordinates LH in the maturation of oocytes in Tan sheep.	Oocyte maturation plays an important role in supporting mammalian reproduction. Histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11), the only member of the class IV histone deacetylase family and the smallest histone deacetylases (HDACs), has been shown to regulate oocyte maturation in mice and pigs. However, the epigenetic effects of HDACs in follicular granulosa cells in response to LH induction remain elusive in sheep. In this study, the effects of follicular somatic cell-derived HDAC11 on oocyte maturation in Tan sheep are evaluated. The expression changes of HDAC11 and related proteins are detected by means of immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results indicate that the level of HDAC11 in follicular granulosa cells as well as oocytes in Tan sheep increases with the growth and maturation of the follicles. Specific inhibition of HDAC11 by SIS17 remarkably reduces the oocyte maturation rate under LH supplementation <i>in vitro</i>. Accordingly, the acetylation level of H3K9 in granulosa cells is increased, while the EGF-like growth factor AREG is remarkably decreased. Furthermore, inhibition of HDAC11 markedly decreases the level of YAP1, which is a negative regulator of AREG in granulosa cells. Conclusively, HDAC11 in the granulosa cells of Tan sheep contributes to the LH induced production of AREG during oocyte <i>in vitro</i> maturation by decreasing the level of H3K9 acetylation and increasing the level of YAP1.
40065719	Endogenous ERMAP Affects T-Cell Function in EAE Mice.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease (AID) mediated by myelin-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of human MS. Erythrocyte membrane-associated protein (ERMAP) is a novel erythrocyte-specific adhesion/receptor molecule associated with erythrocyte adhesion. We have previously characterised it as a novel inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule and demonstrated that recombinant ERMAP proteins ameliorate EAE; however, the specific mechanism of action of ERMAP and the effects of endogenous ERMAP on T-cell function are largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of endogenous ERMAP in T-cell and macrophage homeostasis and EAE development. We show here that erythrocyte membrane-associated protein (ERMAP) gene knockout (ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup>) mice have increased numbers of T cells and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and enhanced T-cell activation, as compared to wild-type (ERMAP<sup>+/+</sup>) mice. When induced to develop EAE, ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice have more severe EAE symptoms and pathology, which are related to increased numbers of T cells (especially Th1 and Th17 T cells) and M1 macrophages, enhanced activation of T cells, and increased generation of inflammatory cytokines, but decreased proportion of Th2 T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Global gene analysis by RNA-seq shows that signalling molecules in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway are decreased in ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results suggest that endogenous ERMAP plays an important role in T-cell and macrophage homeostasis and EAE development.
40065718	Deficiency of H3K27 histone demethylase UTX in T cells blunts allergic sensitization and anaphylaxis to peanut.	Whether epigenetic factor UTX, a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, is critical for type 2 immunity, including allergic sensitization and antigen-driven anaphylaxis, is unclear. We used UTXfl/fl x Lck-Cre mice with UTX-deficient T cells (UTX-TCD) to determine whether T cell-specific UTX expression regulates antigen-specific IgE production after airway sensitization to peanut and anaphylaxis following intraperitoneal (i.p.) peanut challenge. UTX-TCD mice sensitized via the airway with peanut and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial component and environmental adjuvant found in house dust, made 2-fold less peanut-IgE and 3.5-fold less peanut-IgG1 than comparably sensitized UTXfl/fl mice, despite higher total IgE and total IgG1 serum antibody levels pre-sensitization. Peanut-induced anaphylaxis was blunted in UTX-TCD mice, with maximum drop in core body temperature after i.p. peanut challenge two-fold lower than in UTXfl/fl mice. Compared to UTXfl/fl controls, UTX-TCD mice had reduced frequencies of CD4+ T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells and germinal center B cells, but higher frequencies of IL-4+ T-helper (Th)2, Tfh2, and IL-13+ Tfh13 cells in airway-draining mediastinal lymph nodes. UTX-TCD mice also skewed toward type 2 antibody and T-helper immune responses independent of allergic sensitization, with fewer IL-10-producing splenic Treg and T-follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells. Our results suggest that UTX expression in T cells impact the production of antigen-specific antibody responses required for allergic sensitization and antigen-specific allergic reactions, suggesting a role for H3K27 histone demethylase UTX in regulating type 2 immunity.
40065703	PINCH-1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Abnormal expression of PINCH-1 has been observed in various types of human cancers. However, the clinical importance and mechanism underlying its role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is yet to be fully elucidated.
40065613	[The regulation and mechanism of apolipoprotein A5 on myocardial lipid deposition].	The current study aimed to clarify the roles of apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5) and milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (Mfge8) in regulating myocardial lipid deposition and the regulatory relationship between them. The serum levels of ApoA5 and Mfge8 in obese and healthy people were compared, and the obesity mouse model induced by the high-fat diet (HFD) was established. In addition, primary cardiomyocytes were purified and identified from the hearts of suckling mice. The 0.8 mmol/L sodium palmitate treatment was used to establish the lipid deposition cardiomyocyte model <i>in vitro</i>. ApoA5-overexpressing adenovirus was used to observe its effects on cardiac function and lipids. The expressions of the fatty acid uptake-related molecules and Mfge8 on transcription or translation levels were detected. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to verify the interaction between ApoA5 and Mfge8 proteins. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the co-localization of Mfge8 protein with ApoA5 or lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). Recombinant rMfge8 was added to cardiomyocytes to investigate the regulatory mechanism of ApoA5 on Mfge8. The results showed that participants in the simple obesity group had a significant decrease in serum ApoA5 levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and a significant increase in Mfge8 levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in comparison with the healthy control group. The adenovirus treatment successfully overexpressed ApoA5 in HFD-fed obese mice and palmitic acid-induced lipid deposition cardiomyocytes, respectively. ApoA5 reduced the weight of HFD-fed obese mice (<i>P</i> < 0.05), shortened left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and significantly reduced plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol (CHOL) (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In myocardial tissue and cardiomyocytes, the overexpression of ApoA5 significantly reduced the deposition of TG (<i>P</i> < 0.05), transcription of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) (<i>P</i> < 0.05), fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and fatty acid transport protein (FATP) (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and protein expression of Mfge8 (<i>P</i> < 0.05), while the transcription levels of Mfge8 were not significantly altered (<i>P</i> > 0.05). <i>In vitro</i>, the Mfge8 protein was captured using ApoA5 as bait protein, indicating a direct interaction between them. Overexpression of ApoA5 led to an increase in co-localization of Mfge8 with ApoA5 or LAMP2 in cardiomyocytes under lipid deposition status. On this basis, exogenous added recombinant rMfge8 counteracted the improvement of lipid deposition in cardiomyocytes by ApoA5. The above results indicate that the overexpression of ApoA5 can reduce fatty acid uptake in myocardial cells under lipid deposition status by regulating the content and cellular localization of Mfge8 protein, thereby significantly reducing myocardial lipid deposition and improving cardiac diastolic and systolic function.
40065611	[The role of microglia activated by the deletion of immune checkpoint receptor CD200R1 gene in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease].	The study aimed to investigate the effect of the CD200R1 gene deletion on microglia activation and nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss in the Parkinson's disease (PD) process. The CRISPR-Cas9 technology was applied to construct the CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The primary microglia cells of wild-type and CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were cultured and treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia phagocytosis level was assessed by a fluorescent microsphere phagocytosis assay. PD mouse model was prepared by nigral stereotaxic injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector carrying human α-synuclein (α-syn). The changes in the motor behavior of the mice with both genotypes were evaluated by cylinder test, open field test, and rotarod test. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess the loss of dopamine neurons in substantia nigra. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression level of CD68 (a key molecule involved in phagocytosis) in microglia. The results showed that CD200R1 deletion markedly enhanced LPS-induced phagocytosis <i>in vitro</i> by the microglial cells. In the mouse model of PD, CD200R1 deletion exacerbated motor behavior impairment and dopamine neuron loss in substantia nigra. Fluorescence intensity analysis results revealed a significant increase in CD68 expression in microglia located in the substantia nigra of CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The above results suggest that CD200R1 deletion may further activates microglia by promoting microglial phagocytosis, leading to increased loss of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in the PD model mice. Therefore, targeting CD200R1 could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of early-stage PD.
40065575	Identification of active ingredients from Lamiophlomis rotata that increase wound repair in mouse skin.	We previously showed that the iridoid glycoside extract of Lamiophlomis rotata (IGLR) induces M2 macrophage polarisation to accelerate wound healing. The potentially active compounds (quality markers) in IGLR that accelerate wound healing have not been elucidated; we here identified quality markers that accelerate wound healing.
40065551	Kisspeptin fiber and receptor distribution analysis suggests its potential role in central sensorial processing and behavioral state control.	Kisspeptin (KP) signaling in the brain is defined by the anatomical distribution of KP-producing neurons, their fibers, receptors, and connectivity. Technological advances have prompted a re-evaluation of these chemoanatomical aspects, originally studied in the early years after the discovery of KP and its receptor Kiss1r. Previously, we characterized (Hernández et al. bioRxiv 2024) seven KP neuronal populations in the mouse brain at the mRNA level, including two novel populations, and examined their response to gonadectomy. In this study, we mapped KP fiber distribution in rats and mice using immunohistochemistry under intact as well as short- and long-term post-gonadectomy conditions. Kiss1r mRNA expression was examined via RNAscope, in relation to vesicular GABA transporter (Slc32a1) in whole mouse brain, and to KP and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Slc17a6), Kiss1, and Slc32a1 in hypothalamic RP3V and arcuate regions. We identified KP fibers in 118 brain regions, primarily in extra-hypothalamic areas associated with sensorial processing and behavioral state control. KP-immunoreactive fiber density and distribution were largely unchanged by gonadectomy. Kiss1r was expressed prominently in sensorial and state control regions such as the septal nuclei, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, locus coeruleus, hippocampal layers, thalamic nuclei, and cerebellar structures. Co-expression of Kiss1r and Kiss1 was observed in hypothalamic neurons, suggesting both autocrine and paracrine KP signaling mechanisms. These findings enhance our understanding of KP signaling beyond reproductive functions, particularly in sensorial processing and behavioral state regulation. This study opens new avenues for investigating KP's role in controlling complex physiological processes, including those unrelated to reproduction.
40065514	NAPQI is absent in the mouse brain after Sub-hepatotoxic and hepatotoxic doses of acetaminophen.	Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most-used over-the-counter analgesic among pregnant women. However, concerns have arisen over the safety of APAP exposure during gestation. In particular, it's been speculated that the hepatotoxic metabolite of APAP, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), forms in the brain after maternal use of therapeutic APAP doses and leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, APAP metabolism in the brain is understudied. Here, we tested the hypothesis that NAPQI can be generated in the brain by overdosing BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (common model of the NDD autism) and C57Bl/6J mice with APAP and measuring glutathione loss and APAP-protein adducts as two of the best markers of NAPQI available. Despite glutathione depletion and adducts in the liver, we saw none in the brain. We conclude NAPQI is unlikely to contribute to the pathophysiology of NDDs. IMPACT STATEMENT: It has been hypothesized that NAPQI formation in the brain provides biological plausibility for the purported link between APAP and NDDs. Our results cast doubt on that hypothesis.
40065480	GHSR gene knockout alleviates the liver pathological response in Echinococcus granulosus infection by reducing parasite survival.	Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, and the immunosuppressive microenvironment exacerbates disease progression. Ghrelin, a peptide hormone, plays a role in modulating immune inflammation and may influence the progression of E. granulosus infection through its receptor, GHSR (growth hormone secretagogue receptor). However, whether GHSR downregulation can inhibit E. granulosus infection remains unclear. In this study, we extracted liver tissues from E. granulosus-infected mice and those treated with the GHSR antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6. Proteomic analysis revealed 341 differentially expressed proteins, of which 185 were upregulated and 156 were downregulated. Metabolomic sequencing revealed 101 differentially expressed metabolites, including 62 upregulated and 39 downregulated metabolites. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of both proteomic and metabolomic data revealed seven key signalling pathways, 11 key proteins, and 26 key metabolites that interact through metabolic and organic system networks. Next, we examined the disease progression of E. granulosus infection in GHSR-knockout mice. Compared with the E. granulosus (Eg) group, the GHSR-KO group presented a significant reduction in the number of liver infection foci. The serum and liver ghrelin levels were significantly greater in the E. granulosus group than in the control group, along with increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ) and decreased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). In contrast, the GHSR-KO group presented significantly lower ghrelin levels in both the serum and liver, with reduced proinflammatory cytokine secretion and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, similar to those of the control group. Furthermore, ghrelin and inflammation-related factors, including MyD88, NF-κB p65, iNOS, and Arg-1, exhibited coordinated expression changes in liver lesions and surrounding areas. These findings suggest that GHSR gene knockout can ameliorate the progression of liver E. granulosus infection and associated liver inflammation.
40065407	N-terminal domain of CTRP9 promotes cardiac fibroblast activation in myocardial infarction via Rap1/Mek/Erk pathway.	In developed nations, myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality, resulting in a significant economic burden and becoming a global public health problem. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 9 (CTRP9) is a secreted protein comprising a variable domain, a collagenous region, and a C-terminal trimerizing globular C1q (gC1q) domain. In vivo, the full-length CTRP9 (fCTRP9) can be cleaved into the globular domain of CTRP9 (gCTRP9). Here, we tested the cardio-protective impacts of fCTRP9, gCTRP9, and N-terminal domain, including the variable and collagenous domain, of CTRP9 (nCTRP9) in the context of MI.
40065395	Dopamine D1 receptor agonist alleviates post-weaning isolation-induced neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors in female mice.	Major depressive disorder is a significant global cause of disability, particularly among adolescents. The dopamine system and nearby neuroinflammation, crucial for regulating mood and processing rewards, are central to the frontostriatal circuit, which is linked to depression. This study aimed to investigate the effect of post-weaning isolation (PWI) on depression in adolescent mice, with a focus on exploring the involvement of microglia and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) in the frontostriatal circuit due to their known links with mood disorders.
40065372	Engineered extracellular vesicles promote the repair of acute kidney injury by modulating regulatory T cells and the immune microenvironment.	Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical condition. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKI have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatment options remain limited. Studies have shown that immune cells play a critical role in AKI, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) being one of the most important immunosuppressive lymphocytes. Tregs proliferation can attenuate AKI, whereas depletion exacerbates kidney injury. Given that endothelial cells (ECs) are the initial cells that interact with immune cells when they invade the tissue parenchyma, ECs are closely associated with immune reactions.
40065336	Modulation of the Epithelial-mesenchymal transition process by Forkhead Box C2 in the repair of airway epithelium after injury.	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regarded as a key process in repair of airway epithelium after injury. Forkhead Box C2 (FOXC2) is a transcription factor involved in EMT process, whether it is involved in repair of bronchial epithelium remains unknown.
40065328	Extraction of a stromal metastatic gene signature in breast cancer via spatial profiling.	The identification of molecular features characterizing metastatic disease is a critical area of oncology research, as metastatic foci often exhibit distinct biological behaviors compared to primary tumors. While the focus has largely been on the neoplastic cells themselves, the characterization of the associated stroma remains largely underexplored, with significant implications for understanding metastasis.
40065319	Ginseng exosomes modulate M1/M2 polarisation by activating autophagy and target IKK/IкB/NF-кB to alleviate inflammatory bowel disease.	Exosomes are involved in intercellular communication and regulation of the inflammatory microenvironment. In a previous study, we demonstrated that fresh ginseng exosomes (GEs) alleviated inflammatory bowel disease. However, the precise mechanism by which GEs activate the immune system and subsequently inhibit the formation of intestinal inflammatory microenvironment remains unknown.
40065301	SLC25A35 enhances fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis to promote the carcinogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by upregulating PGC-1α.	Mitochondria dysfunction has been closely linked to a wide spectrum of human cancers, whereas the molecular basis has yet to be fully understood. SLC25A35 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins. However, the role of SLC25A35 in mitochondrial metabolism reprogramming, development and progression in human cancers remains unclear. Here, we found that SLC25A35 markedly reprogramed mitochondrial metabolism, characterized by increased oxygen consumption rate and ATP production and decreased ROS level, via enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Meanwhile, SLC25A35 also enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis characterized by increased mitochondrial mass and DNA content. Mechanistic studies revealed that SLC25A35 facilitated FAO and mitochondrial biogenesis through upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) via increasing acetyl-CoA-mediated acetylation of PGC-1α. Clinically, SLC25A35 was highly expressed in HCC and correlated with adverse patients' survival. Functionally, SLC25A35 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the carcinogenesis in a DEN-induced HCC mice model. Moreover, we found that SLC25A35 upregulation is caused, at least in part, by decreased miR-663a in HCC cells. Together, our results suggest a crucial oncogenic role of SLC25A35 in HCC by reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism and suggest SLC25A35 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
40065221	Using gut microbiota and non-targeted metabolomics techniques to study the effect of xylitol on alleviating DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease in mice.	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a global healthcare issue, with its incidence continuing to rise, but currently there is no complete cure. Xylitol is a widely used sweetener in various foods and beverages, but there is limited research on the effects of xylitol on IBD symptoms.
40065216	Immunization induces inflammation in the mouse heart during spaceflight.	Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA's Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight.
40065210	Imbalance of bladder neurohomeostasis by Myosin 5a aggravates diabetic cystopathy.	Diabetic cystopathy (DCP) is linked to bladder nerve conduction disorders, with diabetes-induced neuropathy impairing nerve signal transmission and causing bladder dysfunction. Myosin 5a, vital for neuronal transport, has been linked to neurological disorders, though its role in DCP remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate whether Myosin 5a plays a potential regulatory role in Diabetic Cystopathy.
40065189	Dopamine in the tail of the striatum facilitates avoidance in threat-reward conflicts.	Responding appropriately to potential threats before they materialize is critical to avoiding disastrous outcomes. Here we examine how threat-coping behavior is regulated by the tail of the striatum (TS) and its dopamine input. Mice were presented with a potential threat (a moving object) while pursuing rewards. Initially, the mice failed to obtain rewards but gradually improved in later trials. We found that dopamine in TS promoted avoidance of the threat, even at the expense of reward acquisition. Furthermore, the activity of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons promoted threat avoidance and prediction. In contrast, D2 neurons suppressed threat avoidance and facilitated overcoming the potential threat. Dopamine axon activation in TS not only potentiated the responses of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons to novel sensory stimuli but also boosted them acutely. These results demonstrate that an opponent interaction of D1 and D2 neurons in the TS, modulated by dopamine, dynamically regulates avoidance and overcoming potential threats.
40065183	SH3KBP1 promotes skeletal myofiber formation and functionality through ER/SR architecture integrity.	Dynamic changes in the arrangement of myonuclei and the organization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum are important determinants of myofiber formation and muscle function. To find factors associated with muscle integrity, we perform an siRNA screen and identify SH3KBP1 as a new factor controlling myoblast fusion, myonuclear positioning, and myotube elongation. We find that the N-terminus of SH3KBP1 binds to dynamin-2 while the C-terminus associates with the endoplasmic reticulum through calnexin, which in turn control myonuclei dynamics and ER integrity, respectively. Additionally, in mature muscle fibers, SH3KBP1 contributes to the formation of triads and modulates the Excitation-Contraction Coupling process efficiency. In Dnm2<sup>R465W/+</sup> mice, a model for centronuclear myopathy (CNM), depletion of Sh3kbp1 expression aggravates CNM-related atrophic phenotypes and impaired autophagic flux in mutant skeletal muscle fiber. Altogether, our results identify SH3KBP1 as a new regulator of myofiber integrity and function.
40065182	miR-708-5p is elevated in bipolar patients and can induce mood disorder-associated behavior in mice.	Mood disorders (MDs) are caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental (GxE) risk factors. However, molecular pathways engaged by GxE risk factors are poorly understood. Using small-RNA sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we show that the bipolar disorder (BD)-associated microRNA miR-708-5p is upregulated in healthy human subjects with a high genetic or environmental predisposition for MDs. miR-708-5p is further upregulated in the hippocampus of rats which underwent juvenile social isolation, a model of early life stress. Hippocampal overexpression of miR-708-5p in adult male mice is sufficient to elicit MD-associated behavioral endophenotypes. We further show that miR-708-5p directly targets Neuronatin (Nnat), an endoplasmic reticulum protein. Restoring Nnat expression in the hippocampus of miR-708-5p-overexpressing mice rescues miR-708-5p-dependent behavioral phenotypes. Finally, miR-708-5p is upregulated in PBMCs from patients diagnosed with MD. Peripheral miR-708-5p expression allows to differentiate male BD patients from patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). In summary, we describe a potential functional role for the miR-708-5p/Nnat pathway in MD etiology and identify miR-708-5p as a potential biomarker for the differential diagnosis of MDs.
40065153	Integrating model systems and genomic insights to decipher mechanisms of cancer metastasis.	Deciphering metastatic processes is crucial for understanding cancer progression and potential treatment options. Genetic studies of model systems engineered to mimic metastatic disease, including organoids, genetically engineered mice and human cell lines, have had an important role in shaping our understanding of the metastatic cascade and how it can be manipulated. More recently, advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled human metastases to be studied at single-cell and single-nucleotide resolution, providing insights into metastatic evolution and phenotypes of both cancer cells and immune cells. However, human tissue studies are often correlative and descriptive, whereas experimental models are reductionistic by nature, meaning that individual results should be interpreted with caution. Crucially, these seemingly disparate branches of metastasis research can and should complement each other to strengthen and validate findings. Here we explore the synergies between model systems and sequencing studies and outline key areas that must be explored to improve our understanding of the metastatic process.
40065145	PRDM16 deficiency promotes podocyte injury by impairing insulin receptor signaling.	Impaired glucose uptake regulated by suppressed insulin receptor signaling is a key driving force of podocytopathies. The identification of potential therapeutic targets that mediate podocyte insulin receptor signaling holds significant clinical importance. Here, we observed a substantial reduction in PR domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) expression within damaged podocytes in both humans and mice. Podocyte-specific Prdm16 deletion aggravated podocyte injury, albuminuria, and glomerulosclerosis in diabetic nephropathy (DN) mice. Conversely, exogenous PRDM16 delivered by lentivirus mitigated these pathological changes in DN mice and adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that loss of PRDM16 blocked glucose uptake of podocytes by inhibiting insulin receptor signaling. Mechanistically, PRDM16 deficiency downregulated the transcription of NEDD4L, subsequently enhancing the stability of IKKβ protein. The accumulation of IKKβ caused by the loss of PRDM16 led to the phosphorylation of serine residues on insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), thereby promoting IRS-1 degradation. Exogenous NEDD4L mitigated podocyte injury induced by PRDM16 knockdown in vitro and attenuated ADR nephropathy in vivo. Our study clarified the role and mechanism of PRDM16 in insulin receptor signaling and podocyte injury, providing a potential therapeutic target for podocytopathies.
40065144	N,N-dimethylacetamide blocks inflammation-induced preterm birth and remediates maternal systemic immune responses.	The common excipient, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), prevents imminent endotoxin-induced preterm birth in mice. The present study hypothesized that DMA forestalls preterm birth to term (defined as day 18.5 or later) by attenuating bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal systemic inflammatory responses and cervix remodeling. Accordingly, LPS (i.p.) on day 15 postbreeding stimulated preterm delivery within 24 h while mice treated with DMA 2 h preceding and 9 h following LPS administration remained pregnant, comparable to saline and DMA controls, to deliver viable pups at term. Irrespective of LPS or DMA + LPS treatment, maternal plasma pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines on day 15.5 (12 h post-LPS) increased tenfold compared to baseline concentrations in controls. On day 16 of pregnancy, plasma concentrations of G-CSF and TNFα were statistically significantly reduced in the prepartum LPS + DMA group compared to those in postpartum mice given LPS. By day 18 of pregnancy, all cytokines returned to baseline-equivalent to low systemic levels throughout the study in saline and DMA controls that gave birth at term. In addition, maternal plasma progesterone declined within 12 h in prepartum LPS-treated mice to postpartum concentrations on day 16. Although a similar transient decrease occurred by 12 h in DMA + LPS mice, plasma progesterone returned to baseline concentrations in controls. Contemporaneously, the progression of prepartum cervix remodeling leading to preterm delivery was acutely forestalled by DMA without impeding birth at term. These findings support the hypothesis that DMA not only prevents inflammation-driven preterm birth, but rescues pregnancy for birth to occur at term. The results raise the possibility that maternal signals can forecast risk of preterm birth while selective suppression of systemic inflammation can mitigate adverse pregnancy outcomes.
40065134	Bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria accelerate injury-induced mucosal healing in the colon.	Host-microbiome communication is frequently perturbed in gut pathologies due to microbiome dysbiosis, leading to altered production of bacterial metabolites. Among these, 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids are notably diminished in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Herein, we investigated whether restoration of 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids levels by Clostridium scindens, a human-derived 7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, can reestablish intestinal epithelium homeostasis following colon injury. Gnotobiotic and conventional mice were subjected to chemically-induced experimental colitis following administration of Clostridium scindens. Colonization enhanced the production of 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids and conferred prophylactic and therapeutic protection against colon injury through epithelial regeneration and specification. Computational analysis of human datasets confirmed defects in intestinal cell renewal and differentiation in ulcerative colitis patients while expression of genes involved in those pathways showed a robust positive correlation with 7α-dehydroxylated bile acid levels. Clostridium scindens administration could therefore be a promising biotherapeutic strategy to foster mucosal healing following colon injury by restoring bile acid homeostasis.
40065100	Synthesis and antitumor evaluation of amino acid conjugates of monocarbonyl curcumin in hepatocellular carcinoma cell.	Curcumin possesses a variety of pharmacological properties, particularly anticancer activity. However, its clinical utility is limited by its poor water solubility and low bioavailability. To alleviate the problems, our previous research demonstrated that mono-carbonyl curcumin easters can be employed for the development of novel anticancer agents. In this study, further structural optimization was performed and a series of novel amino acid conjugates of mono-carbonyl curcumin H1-H6 were designed, synthesized, and evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies. Compound H1 was found as the most potent derivative (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.66 µM) compared to curcumin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 36.19 µM) by anti-proliferation assay. Subsequently, wound healing, transwell, JC-1 staining, the HepG2 cell xenograft model and H&E staining experiments were performed, and it was found that compound H1 was more effective than curcumin in inhibiting tumor growth. The results of transcriptome sequence, bioinformatics analysis, molecular docking, and western blotting suggested that compound H1 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through the AKT/FOXO1 pathway. Hence, H1 is a promising lead compound with the potential to be developed as a chemotherapy agent for hepatocellular carcinoma.
40065084	Protein disulfide isomerase is essential for osteoblast differentiation in mice.	Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an oxidoreductase responsible for the formation, reduction and isomerization of disulfide bonds of nascent proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). So far, the role of PDI in bone biology has never been characterized using genetically-modified animal models. In this study we generated osteoblast- specific PDI-deficient mice by crossing PDI-floxed (PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice with Osx-Cre mice. Compared with their littermate control PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, homozygous osteoblast-knockout mice (Osx-Cre/PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup>) were embryonically lethal, but heterozygous knockout mice (Osx-Cre/PDI<sup>fl/wt</sup>) displayed significantly pronounced growth retardation and reduced bone length. Besides, the decreases in bone density, osteoblast and osteoclast numbers, collagen fiber content and bone formation rate were observed in Osx-Cre/PDI<sup>fl/wt</sup> mice. Osteoblast precursors isolated from PDI<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were infected with Cre recombinant adenovirus to produce PDI-deficient osteoblasts, followed by induction of differentiation. Osteoblasts deficient of PDI had decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralizing capacity, and differentiation. Quantitative protein mass spectrometry analysis and immunoblotting showed that PDI deficiency markedly decreased the expression of the α-subunits of collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (C-P4H), including P4HA1, P4HA2 and P4HA3. These results demonstrate that PDI plays an essential role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation and is required for the expression of the α-subunit of C-P4H in osteoblasts.
40065073	Single cell transcriptomic analysis of SGLT2 expression supports an indirect or off-target role for the cardioprotective benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure.	Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), such as empagliflozin, have shown remarkable benefits in reducing cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with heart failure irrespective of diabetes. Because of the magnitude of the benefits and broad application in both heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction, there have been concerted efforts to identify a mechanism for the observed benefits. One hypothesis is that SGLT2i act directly on the heart. Given empagliflozin's high specificity to SGLT2, we reasoned that SGLT2 expression would be a requirement for cells to respond to treatment via the expected drug target. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of SLC5A2, which encodes SGLT2 at the single cell level in multiple datasets from healthy and HF donors, confirming its expression in a subset of kidney epithelial cells but minimal expression in other cell types. This was true irrespective of developmental stage, disease state, sequencing method or depth, and species. Therefore, it is likely that the cardioprotective benefits of SGLT2i cannot be explained by "canonical" interactions with SGLT2.
40065072	Subcellular proteomics and iPSC modeling uncover reversible mechanisms of axonal pathology in Alzheimer's disease.	Dystrophic neurites (also termed axonal spheroids) are found around amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where they impair axonal electrical conduction, disrupt neural circuits and correlate with AD severity. Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying spheroid formation remain incompletely understood. To address this, we developed a proximity labeling approach to uncover the proteome of spheroids in human postmortem and mouse brains. Additionally, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AD model enabling mechanistic investigation and optical electrophysiology. These complementary approaches revealed the subcellular molecular architecture of spheroids and identified abnormalities in key biological processes, including protein turnover, cytoskeleton dynamics and lipid transport. Notably, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates these processes, was activated in spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylated mTOR levels in spheroids correlated with AD severity in humans. Notably, mTOR inhibition in iPSC-derived neurons and mice ameliorated spheroid pathology. Altogether, our study provides a multidisciplinary toolkit for investigating mechanisms and therapeutic targets for axonal pathology in neurodegeneration.
40065065	The m6A reader IGF2BP3 promotes HCC progression by enhancing MCM10 stability.	Abnormal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications were associated with the occurrence, development, and metastasis of cancer. However, the functions and mechanisms of m6A regulators in cancer remained largely elusive and should be explored. Here, we identified that insulin like growth Factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) was specifically overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, IGF2BP3 promoted HCC cells progression in an m6A-dependent manner, IGF2BP3 silencing significantly inhibited proliferation and migratory ability of tumor cells in vitro and in in vivo. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 interacted with minichromosomal maintenance complex component (MCM10) mRNAs to prolong stability of m6A-modified RNA. Therefore, our findings indicated that m6A reader IGF2BP3 contributed to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis, providing a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.
40065061	Activation of endogenous retroviruses characterizes the maternal-fetal interface in the BTBR mouse model of autism spectrum disorder.	Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic elements derived from a process of germline infection by exogenous retroviruses. Some ERVs have been co-opted for physiological functions, and their activation has been associated with complex diseases, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have already demonstrated an abnormal expression of ERVs in the BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD during intrauterine life till adulthood. Thus, starting from the assumptions that ERVs may contribute to the derailment of neurodevelopment and that ASD has fetal origins as a consequence of adverse intrauterine conditions, the present study aims to characterize the transcriptional activity of selected ERVs (MusD, IAP, Syn-A, Syn-B, ARC and GLN), LINE-1, inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-10, IL-11 CXCL-1) at the maternal-fetal interface and in dissected embryos from BTBR mice. Our results highlight the deregulation of ERVs and inflammatory mediators at the maternal-fetal interface, and in cephalic and non-cephalic embryonic tissues from BTBR compared to C57BL/6 J. Several correlations among ERV expression levels emerged in different tissues from C57BL/6 J mice while, in BTBR mice, no correlations were found, suggesting that in this model, the acquisition of autistic-like traits might be linked to the dysregulation of ERV activity occurring during intra-uterine life.
40065057	CIRP contributes to multiple organ damage in acute pancreatitis by increasing endothelial permeability.	Acute pancreatitis can lead to systemic inflammation and multiple organ damage. Increased endothelial permeability is a hallmark of systemic inflammation. Several studies have demonstrated that cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) functions as a proinflammatory factor in various diseases. However, its role in endothelial barrier dysfunction during acute pancreatitis remains unknown. To study this, acute pancreatitis was induced by two hourly intraperitoneal injections of 4.0 g/kg L-arginine in wild-type (WT) or CIRP knockout mice. Our results showed that CIRP levels in the pancreas, small intestine, lung, and liver were upregulated at 72 h after the induction of acute pancreatitis in WT mice. CIRP deficiency significantly attenuated tissue injury, edema, and extravasation of Evans blue in the pancreas, small intestine, lung, and liver at 72 h after L-arginine injection. Administration of C23, a specific antagonist of CIRP, at 2 h after the last injection of L-arginine also produced similar protective effects as CIRP knockout in mice. In vitro studies showed that recombinant CIRP caused a significant reduction in transcellular electric resistance in HUVEC monolayers. Immunocytochemical analysis of endothelial cells exposed to CIRP revealed an increased formation of actin stress fibers. VE-cadherin and β-catenin staining showed intercellular gaps were formed in CIRP-stimulated cells. Western blot analysis showed that CIRP induced SRC phosphorylation at TYR416. Exposure to the SRC inhibitor PP2 reduced CIRP-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in HUVEC monolayers. In conclusion, blocking CIRP mitigates acute pancreatitis-induced multiple organ damage by alleviating endothelial hyperpermeability. Targeting CIRP may be a potential therapeutic option for acute pancreatitis.
40065050	Anticancer activity of Weizmannia coagulans MZY531on H22 tumor-bearing mice by regulating inflammation, autophagy-dependent apoptosis, and gut microbiota.	Increasing studies have shown that the efficacy of Weizmannia coagulans in treating various cancers. We recently identified W. coagulans MZY531 with potent cell anti-proliferation and exhibiting apoptosis induction activities against the mouse H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line.However, the anti-cancer effect of W. coagulans MZY531 against liver cancer in vivo has not been verified. The objective of this study was to assess the anti-hepatoma effect of W. coagulans MZY531 on H22 tumor-bearing mice and the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that W. coagulans MZY531 reduced the weight and size of the tumor in comparison to the model group. The levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-2 and TNF-α were suppressed by W. coagulans MZY531 administration. Immunofluorescence and TUNEL analyses demonstrated that W. coagulans MZY531 significantly increased the number of cleaved caspase-3 cells and induced apoptosis in tumor tissues. Importantly, W. coagulans MZY531 activated the AMPK/mTOR autophagy-dependent apoptosis pathway, and regulated the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF-6/NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 inflammatory signaling pathways through mechanisms. Additionally, Fecal analysis demonstrated the capacity of W. coagulans MZY531 to remodel the gut microbiota of hepatocellular carcinoma-infected mice. Collectively, this experimental finding suggested that W. coagulans MZY531 exhibited prominent anticancer activities in vivo at least partly via reducing inflammation, inducing autophagy-dependent apoptosis, and regulating gut microbiota in H22 tumor-bearing mice.
40065004	Poly-γ-glutamic acid alleviates slow transit constipation by regulating aquaporin and gut microbes.	Slow transit constipation (STC) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder caused by colon dysfunction. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), an anionic polymer known for its moisture retention, degradability, and food safety, was studied for its effects on loperamide-induced STC in mice. Treatment with γ-PGA for one week significantly increased both defecation frequency and fecal water content, with the high-dose group (10 g/kg/d) restoring fecal water content to 34.23%, outperforming the low- (16.16%) and medium-dose (27.08%) groups and exceeding the positive control, PEG, by 1.35 times. γ-PGA enhanced intestinal peristalsis and reduced the expression of inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, caspase-1, TLR2) and water-electrolyte transport genes (AQP3, AQP4, ENaC-β), while improving the expression of tight junction proteins (Claudin-1, Occludin, ZO-1) damaged by loperamide. Histopathological analyses confirmed γ-PGA's capacity to repair intestinal damage. Additionally, Western Blot analysis indicated reduced AQP3/4 levels in the colon, and molecular docking showed good binding affinity between γ-PGA and AQPs. γ-PGA also positively altered gut microbiota composition. Overall, γ-PGA shows promise in treating STC by modulating aquaporins and gut microbiota.
40064965	Kallikrein-8 mediates furin-independent Activin-A precursor processing to stimulate tumor growth in melanoma.	Receptor binding of TGF-β and related ligands such as Activin-A requires cleavage of a furin site in their dimeric precursor proteins. Melanoma cells cleave one Activin-A subunit independently of furin and related proprotein convertases, raising questions of how this half-processed intermediate is generated and whether it influences tumor growth. Here, an siRNA library screen for proteases mediating this furin-independent "hemicleavage" identifies kallikrein (Klk)-8. While a KLK8 cleavage site in proActivin-A overlaps with the furin recognition sequence, its exposure is limited and requires prior transient acidification. Therefore, only furin efficiently converts proActivin-A to fully mature form both in tumor cells and in cell-free cleavage assays. Moreover, knockdown of Klk8 in syngeneic melanoma grafts suppresses Activin-A induced tumor growth, demonstrating that cleavage by only furin is not sufficient. Besides elucidating how Activin-A processing is regulated, our findings show that KLK8 holds promise as a target to mitigate Activin-A induced tumor growth.
40064935	Diversity of ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer stem cells attained using selective culture techniques.	Breast cancer stem cells are a promising therapeutic target in cancer. We explored breast cancer stem cell diversity and establish a methodology for selectively culturing breast cancer stem cells. We collected breast cancer tissues from surgical samples of treatment-naïve patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Following isolation, cells were subjected to spheroid culture on non-adherent plates. Of the 57 cases, successful culture was achieved in 48 cases, among which the average ratio of CD44+/CD24- breast cancer cells increased from 13.8% in primary tumors to 61.6% in spheroids. A modest number of spheroid cells successfully engrafted in mice and subsequently re-differentiated within the murine environment, confirming their stemness. ER expression in spheroid cells exhibited negative conversion in 52.1% of cases. The proportion of Twist-, Snail-, and Vimentin-positive cells increased from 43.8%, 12.9%, and 7.7-75.0%, 58.1%, and 37.7%, respectively. ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer stem cells were classified into two groups using DNA microarrays. Gene Ontology analysis unveiled higher expression of immune response-related genes in one group and protein binding-associated genes in the other. We demonstrated stable and selective culture of breast cancer stem cells from patient-derived breast cancer tissue using spheroid cultures.
40064932	Enzyme-activating B-cell receptors boost antigen presentation to pathogenic T cells in gluten-sensitive autoimmunity.	Autoantibodies against the enzyme transglutaminase 3 (TG3) are characteristic to the gluten-sensitive skin disorder dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), which is an extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease. We here demonstrate that TG3-specific B cells can activate gluten-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated internalization of TG3-gluten enzyme-substrate complexes. Stereotypic anti-TG3 antibodies using IGHV2-5/IGKV4-1 gene segments enhance the catalytic activity of TG3, and this effect translates into increased gluten presentation to T cells when such antibodies are expressed as BCRs. The crystal structure of TG3 bound to an IGHV2-5/IGKV4-1 Fab shows that antibody binding to a β-sheet in the catalytic core domain causes the enzyme to adopt the active conformation. This mechanism explains the production of stereotypic anti-TG3 autoantibodies in DH and highlights a role for TG3-specific B cells as antigen-presenting cells for gluten-specific T cells. Similar boosting effects of autoreactive BCRs could be relevant for other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.
40064919	Competitive antagonism of KAT7 crotonylation against acetylation affects procentriole formation and colorectal tumorigenesis.	Accurate procentriole formation is critical for centriole duplication. However, the holistic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we show that KAT7 crotonylation, facilitated by the crotonyltransferase hMOF, competes against its acetylation regulated by the deacetylase HDAC2 at the K432 residue upon DNA damage stimulation. This competition diminishes its histone acetyltransferase activity, leading to the inhibition of procentriole formation in colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, the reduction of KAT7 histone acetyltransferase activity by the antagonistic effect of KAT7 crotonylation against its acetylation decreases the gene expression associated with procentriole formation by modulating the enrichment of H3K14ac at their promoters and plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Furthermore, KAT7 crotonylation and acetylation are associated with the prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unidentified role of KAT7 in the regulation of procentriole formation and colorectal tumorigenesis via competitive antagonism of its crotonylation against acetylation.
40064918	Interleukin-16 enhances anti-tumor immune responses by establishing a Th1 cell-macrophage crosstalk through reprogramming glutamine metabolism in mice.	Overcoming immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for developing novel cancer immunotherapies. Here, we report that IL-16 administration enhances the polarization of T helper 1 (Th1) cells by inhibiting glutamine catabolism through the downregulation of glutaminase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and increases the production of Th1 effector cytokine IFN-γ, thus improving anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, we find that establishing an IL-16-dependent, Th1-dominant TME relies on mast cell-produced histamine and results in the increased expression of the CXCR3 ligands in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), thereby improving the therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Cancer patients exhibit impaired production of IL-16, which correlates with poorer prognosis. Additionally, low IL-16 production is associated with unresponsiveness to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Collectively, our findings provided new insights into the biological function of IL-16, emphasizing its potential clinical significance as a therapeutic approach to augment anti-tumor immunity and sensitize ICB-based cancer immunotherapy.
40064917	The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice.	Fear can be induced either directly through self-experience of aversive events or vicariously by observing conspecifics experiencing such events. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NA) system is crucial in fear responses and cognitive processes. We investigated whether the LC-NA system differentially processes these two types of fear, direct and vicarious in male mice. The results highlighted that the right hemisphere LC→anterior cingulate cortex pathway is uniquely crucial for vicarious fear, while the two inputs to the LC-from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA)-differentially contribute to fear processing. The BNST plays a more targeted role in vicarious fear, and the CeA has a broader influence on fear in general. This underscores the complexity and specialization within the LC-NA system for fear-processing.
40064915	Comprehensive immunophenotyping reveals distinct tumor microenvironment alterations in anti-PD-1 sensitive and resistant syngeneic mouse model.	The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has revolutionized cancer treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. However, resistance remains a critical challenge. This study aimed to comparatively elucidate immunophenotypic changes in syngeneic mouse models sensitive (MC-38) or resistant (LLC1) to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. In the sensitive MC-38 model, anti-PD-1 therapy increased dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, while decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I/II) and costimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86) was observed on tumor-associated DCs and macrophages. Tumor-infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup>T, CD8<sup>+</sup>T, regulatory T, NK, and NKT cells also significantly increased. Importantly, treatment boosted lymphocyte cytotoxic potential, with perforin identified as a key marker of efficacy. Notably, perforin expression in CD4<sup>+</sup>T and NKT cells strongly negatively correlated with tumor volume. In contrast, the resistant LLC1 model exhibited minimal immunophenotypic changes upon treatment. These findings highlight critical immune modifications induced by anti-PD-1 therapy, particularly the role of perforin, and the DC/MDSC ratio in predicting therapeutic outcomes. This research offers valuable insights into potential predictive biomarkers and informs strategies to overcome resistance, emphasizing the complex interplay between anti-PD-1 treatment and the tumor microenvironment, ultimately aiming to improve immunotherapy response rates.
40064895	Magnetically triggered thermoelectric heterojunctions with an efficient magnetic-thermo-electric energy cascade conversion for synergistic cancer therapy.	Thermoelectric therapy has been emerging as a promising and versatile strategy for targeting malignant tumors treatment. However, the lack of effective time-space controlled triggering of thermoelectric effect in vivo limits the application of thermoelectric therapy. Here a magnetically triggered thermoelectric heterojunction (CuFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, CFO/STO) for synergistic thermoelectric/chemodynamic/immuno-therapy is developed. The efficient magnetothermal nanoagent (CFO) is synthesized using the hydrothermal method, and thermoelectric nanomaterials (STO) are grown on its surface to create the heterojunction. To enhance oral delivery efficiency, a fusion membrane (M) of Staphylococcus aureus and macrophage cell membranes are coated the CFO/STO heterojunction, enabling effective targeting of orthotopic colorectal cancer. Once the CFO/STO@M reaches the tumor region, in vitro alternating magnetic field (AMF) stimulation activates the catalytic treatment through a magnetic-thermo-electric energy cascade conversion effect. Additionally, the immunogenic death of tumor cells, down-regulating vascular endothelial growth factor and heat shock protein HSP70, increasing expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1/VCAM-1), and M1 polarization of macrophages contribute to tumor immunotherapy. Overall, the magnetically triggered thermoelectric heterojunction based on CFO/STO@M shows remarkable antitumor capability in female mice, offering a promising approach to broaden both the scope of application and the effectiveness of catalytic therapy.
40064891	Suppression of stress granule formation is a vulnerability imposed by mutant p53.	Missense mutations in the TP53 (p53) gene have been linked to malignant progression. However, our in-silico analyses reveal that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with mutant p53 (mutp53) have better overall survival compared to those with p53-null (p53<sup>null</sup>) HCC, unlike other cancer types. Given the historical use of sorafenib (SOR) monotherapy for advanced HCC, we hypothesize that mutp53 increases sensitivity to SOR, a multikinase inhibitor that induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here we show that mutp53 inhibits stress granule (SG) formation by binding to an ER stress sensor, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and a key SG component, GAP SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), contributing to increased sensitivity of SG-competent cells and xenografts to ER stress inducers including SOR. Our study identifies a unique vulnerability imposed by mutp53, suggesting mutp53 as a biomarker for ER stress-inducing agents and highlighting the importance of SG inhibition for cancer treatment.
40064887	TET2 deficiency increases the competitive advantage of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells through upregulation of thrombopoietin receptor signaling.	Ten-Eleven Translocation-2 (TET2) mutations drive the expansion of mutant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). However, the precise mechanisms by which TET2 mutations confer a competitive advantage to HSCs remain unclear. Here, through an epigenetic drug screen, we discover that inhibition of disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L), a H3K79 methyltransferase, selectively reduces the fitness of Tet2 knockout (Tet2<sup>KO</sup>) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Mechanistically, we find that TET2 deficiency increases H3K79 dimethylation and expression of Mpl, which encodes the thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R). Correspondingly, TET2 deficiency is associated with a higher proportion of primitive Mpl-expressing (Mpl<sup>+</sup>) cells in the HSC compartment. Importantly, inhibition of Mpl expression or the signaling downstream of TPO-R is sufficient to reduce the competitive advantage of murine and human TET2-deficient HSPCs. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for aberrant TPO-R signaling in TET2 mutation-driven CH and uncover potential therapeutic strategies against this condition.
40064881	In vivo prime editing rescues photoreceptor degeneration in nonsense mutant retinitis pigmentosa.	The next-generation gene editing tool, prime editing (PE), is adept at correcting point mutations precisely with high editing efficiency and rare off-target events and shows promising therapeutic value in treating hereditary diseases. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common type of inherited retinal dystrophy and is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptors and, consequently, visual decline. To date, effective treatments for RP are lacking. Herein, a PE system is designed to target the PDE6B Y347X mutation in the rd1 mouse strain, a preclinical RP model. We screen and develop the PE system with epegRNA and RT<sup>ΔRnH</sup>, which is delivered via dual-AAV in vivo with an editing efficiency of 26.47 ± 13.35%, with negligible off-target effects confirmed by AID-Seq and PE-tag. Treatment with the PE system in vivo greatly restores PDE6B protein expression and protects rod cells from degeneration. Mouse behavioural experiments also show that compared with no treatment, prime editing inhibits vision deterioration in littermate rd1 mice. This study provides a therapeutic opportunity for the use of PE to correct mutated RPs at the genomic level.
40064877	Activation of endogenous full-length utrophin by MyoAAV-UA as a therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.	Activation of endogenous full-length utrophin, a dystrophin homolog, presents an attractive therapeutic strategy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), regardless of mutation types and loci. However, current dCas9-based activators are too large for efficient adeno-associated virus delivery, and the feasibility and durability of such treatments remain unclear. Here, we develop a muscle-targeted utrophin activation system using the compact dCasMINI-VPR system, termed MyoAAV-UA. Systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA in male mdx mice leads to substantial upregulation of utrophin at the sarcolemma, resulting in significant improvements in skeletal muscle function and a slowing of heart function deterioration. These benefits remain observable at six months post-treatment. In male nonhuman primates, systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA increases utrophin expression by twofold in skeletal muscle, with no significant side effects observed. Furthermore, MyoAAV-UA upregulates utrophin and utrophin-glycoprotein complexes in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myotubes from DMD patients. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the potential of MyoAAV-UA as a therapeutic approach for DMD.
40064874	Berberine-inspired ionizable lipid for self-structure stabilization and brain targeting delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics.	Lipid nanoparticles have shown success in targeting major organs such as the liver, spleen, and lungs, but crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major challenge. Effective brain-targeted delivery systems are essential for advancing gene therapy for neurological diseases but remain limited by low transport efficiency and poor nucleic acid stability. Here, we report a library of ionizable lipids based on the tetrahydroisoquinoline structure of protoberberine alkaloids, designed to improve BBB penetration via dopamine D3 receptor-mediated endocytosis. These nanoparticles offer three key advantages: enhanced brain uptake, improved nucleic acid stability through poly(A) self-assembly, and minimal immunogenicity with inherent neuroprotective properties. In murine models, they demonstrate therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease, glioma, and cryptococcal meningitis. This berberine-inspired delivery system integrates precise receptor targeting with nucleic acid stabilization, offering a promising platform for brain-targeted therapeutics.
40064869	In-depth and high-throughput spatial proteomics for whole-tissue slice profiling by deep learning-facilitated sparse sampling strategy.	Mammalian organs and tissues are composed of heterogeneously distributed cells, which interact with each other and the extracellular matrix surrounding them in a spatially defined way. Therefore, spatially resolved gene expression profiling is crucial for determining the function and phenotypes of these cells. While genome mutations and transcriptome alterations act as drivers of diseases, the proteins that they encode regulate essentially all biological functions and constitute the majority of biomarkers and drug targets for disease diagnostics and treatment. However, unlike transcriptomics, which has a recent explosion in high-throughput spatial technologies with deep coverage, spatial proteomics capable of reaching bulk tissue-level coverage is still rare in the field, due to the non-amplifiable nature of proteins and sensitivity limitation of mass spectrometry (MS). More importantly, due to the limited multiplexing capability of the current proteomics methods, whole-tissue slice mapping with high spatial resolution requires a formidable amount of MS matching time. To achieve spatially resolved, deeply covered proteome mapping for centimeter-sized samples, we developed a sparse sampling strategy for spatial proteomics (S4P) using computationally assisted image reconstruction methods, which is potentially capable of reducing the number of samples by tens to thousands of times depending on the spatial resolution. In this way, we generated the largest spatial proteome to date, mapping more than 9000 proteins in the mouse brain, and discovered potential new regional or cell type markers. Considering its advantage in sensitivity and throughput, we expect that the S4P strategy will be applicable to a wide range of tissues in future studies.
40064861	Impact of liver fibrosis on AAV-mediated gene transfer to mouse hepatocytes.	Liver fibrosis, characterized by scar tissue accumulation due to liver injury, poses significant barriers to liver-targeted gene therapy. Current clinical trials exclude patients with fibrosis, as intact liver architecture is considered essential for efficient and safe adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)-mediated gene delivery. Here, we show that liver fibrosis reduces the efficiency of hepatocyte transduction by AAV8 vectors across three mouse models with diverse fibrotic patterns. This inefficiency stems primarily from decreased vector uptake by the liver rather than loss of vector genomes due to hepatocyte turnover. Additionally, fibrosis alters blood vector clearance and redistributes AAV particles to extra-hepatic organs, such as spleen, lung, and kidney. At the cellular level, fibrosis decreases AAV genome content in hepatocytes while increasing it in non-parenchymal liver cells and splenic immune cells. Importantly, the capsid variant AAV-KP1 retains transduction efficiency in fibrotic livers, highlighting its potential for expanding gene therapy applications to fibrotic diseases.
40064848	Liver fibrosis negatively impacts in vivo gene transfer to murine hepatocytes.	Liver fibrosis occurs in several genetic and acquired disease conditions, leading to alterations of the tissue and metabolism, which may adversely affect viral vector-mediated gene therapy. Here, we assessed the impact of liver fibrosis on in vivo gene transfer to hepatocytes mediated by lentiviral vectors or adeno-associated viral vectors. We exploited two chemically induced fibrosis mouse models characterized by tissue damage in different areas of the liver lobule. Moreover, we used Abcb11<sup>-/-</sup> and Agl<sup>-/</sup><sup>-</sup> mice, recapitulating features of inherited cholestasis and glycogen storage disease, as representative models of genetic disorders characterized by liver fibrosis. We report a general negative influence of liver fibrosis on hepatocyte transduction and alteration of the vector distribution within the liver lobule, with different outcomes according to the viral vector used and the state of the liver at the time of vector administration. This study bears implications for future developments and applications of in vivo liver-directed gene therapy.
40064846	Mitochondria are positioned at dendritic branch induction sites, a process requiring rhotekin2 and syndapin I.	Proper neuronal development, function and survival critically rely on mitochondrial functions. Yet, how developing neurons ensure spatiotemporal distribution of mitochondria during expansion of their dendritic arbor remained unclear. We demonstrate the existence of effective mitochondrial positioning and tethering mechanisms during dendritic arborization. We identify rhotekin2 as outer mitochondrial membrane-associated protein that tethers mitochondria to dendritic branch induction sites. Rhotekin2-deficient neurons failed to correctly position mitochondria at these sites and also lacked the reduction in mitochondrial dynamics observed at wild-type nascent dendritic branch sites. Rhotekin2 hereby serves as important anchor for the plasma membrane-binding and membrane curvature-inducing F-BAR protein syndapin I (PACSIN1). Consistently, syndapin I loss-of-function phenocopied the rhotekin2 loss-of-function phenotype in mitochondrial positioning at dendritic branch induction sites. The finding that rhotekin2 deficiency impaired dendritic branch induction and that a syndapin binding-deficient rhotekin2 mutant failed to rescue this phenotype highlighted the physiological importance of rhotekin2 functions for neuronal network formation.
40064845	Discrete and conserved inflammatory signatures drive thrombosis in different organs after Salmonella infection.	Inflammation-induced thrombosis is a common consequence of bacterial infections, such as those caused by Salmonella Typhimurium (STm). The presentation of multi-organ thrombosis post-infection that develops and resolves with organ-specific kinetics raises significant challenges for its therapeutic control. Here, we identify specific inflammatory events driving thrombosis in the spleens and livers of STm-infected mice. IFN-γ or platelet expression of C-type lectin-like receptor CLEC-2, key drivers of thrombosis in liver, are dispensable for thrombosis in the spleen. Platelets, monocytes, and neutrophils are identified as core constituents of thrombi in both organs. Depleting either neutrophils or monocytic cells abrogates thrombus formation. Neutrophils and monocytes secrete TNF and blocking TNF diminishes both thrombosis and inflammation, which correlates with reduced endothelial expression of E-selectin and leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, inhibiting tissue factor and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 pathways impairs thrombosis in both spleen and liver. Therefore, we identify organ-specific, and shared mechanisms driving thrombosis within a single infection. This may inform on tailoring treatments towards infection-induced inflammation, and single- or multi-organ thrombosis, based on the clinical need.
40064834	Olaparib increases chemosensitivity by upregulating miR-125a-3p in ovarian cancer cells.	Ovarian cancer is associated with the highest mortality rate among all malignant gynecological tumors. PolyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor maintenance therapy is the standard treatment strategy for this type of cancer, and olaparib is a widely used oral PARP inhibitor for tumors with BRCA mutations. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of olaparib in non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer and the potential mechanisms involved.
40064791	Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived exosomes promote skin wound healing through activating FGF2-mediated p38 pathway.	The acute and large area skin healing has been an intractable problem for both clinician and patient. Exosomes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-Exos) have been a novel promising cell-free treatment on skin damage repair. In this study, in vivo skin trauma model of full-layer skin damage on mouse back and in vitro skin-like trauma model of human keratinocytes (HaCaT) scratches were established to investigate the effects of hiPSC-Exos on the acute wound healing, and its potential regulation mechanism would be tried to explore. Our in vivo results showed that hiPSC-Exos labeled with PKH26 could be well taken up by cells in the wound area, and could effectively accelerate acute skin wound healing by inhibiting the mRNA expressions of inflammation factors and chemokines such as Il-1β, Ccl2, Cxcl5, Ccl7 as well as promoting PCNA positive cell ratio. The in vitro data showed that hiPCS-Exos could markedly increase the numbers of EdU positive keratinocytes and expedite keratinocyte migration, which could be reversed by fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) antagonist AZD4547 and p38 inhibitor SB203580. In addition, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) was existent in hiPSC-Exos, and hiPSC-Exos could upregulate the p-p38/p38 level, which could be significantly reversed by AZD4547, but not affect the p-ERK/ERK and p-JNK/JNK levels in wound model tissues and cells. In conclusion, hiPSC-Exos may have the potential to promote wound healing by inhibiting cell inflammation as well as promoting cell proliferation and migration based on inherent FGF-2 targeting to FGFR3 to activate p38 pathway, which may serve as a promising candidate for skin healing.
40064789	Study on the Effect of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CCFM1066 on Exercise Performance, Gut Microbiota, and Its Metabolites in Mice.	Prolonged high-intensity exercise consumes significant energy, leading to fatigue and decreased performance. This study explores the effects of Bifidobacterium adolescentis CCFM1066 on exercise performance, gut microbiota, and its metabolites in mice. The results of the mouse experiments showed the mice which were intervened by Bifidobacterium adolescentis CCFM1066 have a significant increase in exercise performance, including forceful swimming time, fatigue baton turning time, and forelimb grip strength. Through metagenomic sequencing and differential metabolites, analysis indicated that the intervention of CCFM1066 increased Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Parabacteroides goldsteinii, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis and altered the key metabolic pathways including protein digestion and absorption and biosynthesis of amino acids. Supplementation with CCFM1066 modulates the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and fatty acid amides (FAAs) by gut microbiota, decreasing levels of lactic acid (LA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) while increasing muscle and hepatic glycogen content, thus reducing central nervous system fatigue and thereby improving exercise endurance and performance. These findings provide new insights into nutritional interventions for sports performance.
40064788	The Mickey Mouse's hand sign in brain MRI points out multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumors in mesial temporal lobe structures.	Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT) is a rarely diagnosed neoplastic lesion often associated with adult-onset focal seizures. In some situations, atypical MRI features of MVNT may mimic other long-term epilepsy associated tumors (LEATs) or diffuse low-grade gliomas. In such a context, the identification of distinct clinical markers is recommended.
