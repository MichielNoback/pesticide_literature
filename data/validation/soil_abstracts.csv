40066462	Exploring the plant growth promoting attributes of pteridophyte-associated microbiome for agricultural sustainability.	Pteridophytes, encompassing ferns and fern allies, are integral components of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. These vascular plants characterized by their spore-based reproduction, fulfil various ecological roles such as influencing biodiversity, soil stability, nutrient dynamics, and ecological succession. Similar to higher plants, pteridophytes too are known to have close symbiotic associations with a diverse array of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. Exploring the microbial diversity in pteridophytes has prospects both in pure and applied research. Research on pteridophyte microbial communities have revealed their role in plant growth promotion, nutrient acquisition and tolerance against stresses. Besides, it would be interesting to unravel the microbial diversity associated with pteridophytes, which are the first vascular plants. Further, study of pteridophytes-associated microbes would also help in conservation programmes of these rare and endangered group of plants. In spite of the immense potential of pteridophyte microbiome, only few studies have been undertaken in this area, thereby creating a huge research gap. Hence, this review compiles pteridophyte microbiome research, and explores its prospects in agricultural sustainability. Our literature survey sheds light on the tremendous potential of pteridophyte-associated microbes as plant growth promoters and biocontrol agents for sustainable agriculture, which is highly relevant in the era of climate change.
40066401	Epidemiology of Iodine Deficiency Disorders in North-Eastern Part of Karnataka, India.	The north-eastern part of Karnataka lies on the Deccan Plateau of the South Indian Peninsula, characterized by black soil. This region is known for its mineral resources, including a gold ore mine in Hatti (Raichur District), an iron ore mine in Toranagallu (Bellary District), and uranium deposits in Gogi (Yadgir District). However, the soil in this area is deficient in iodine, leading to iodine deficiency disorders such as goiter and hypothyroidism. More than 80,000 cases of these disorders have been reported in the region, along with a few cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease. The younger age group is predominantly affected, with a higher prevalence in females compared to males. As a result, hypothyroidism contributes to pregnancy-related complications and obesity in women. Early detection is possible due to the visible swelling in the neck, prompting patients to seek medical attention. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment can reduce goiter size, restore the body to a euthyroid state, and alleviate symptoms.
40066266	Long-term straw return with moderate nitrogen levels reshapes soil <i>bacterial</i> communities in a vertisol.	Incorporating straw into the soil is a sustainable practice that can mitigate some of the adverse effects of excessive N fertilization on soil structure degradation and microbial diversity reduction.
40066151	Warming stimulates cellulose decomposition by recruiting phylogenetically diverse but functionally similar microorganisms.	Cellulose is the most abundant component of plant litter, which is critical for terrestrial carbon cycling. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how global warming affects cellulose-decomposing microorganisms. Here, we carried out a 3-year litterbag experiment to examine cellulose decomposition undergoing +3°C warming in a tallgrass prairie. Most cellulose-associated bacteria and fungi in litterbags were also detected in bulk soil, and bacteria in litterbags had higher community-level <i>rrn</i> copy numbers, larger genome sizes, and higher genome guanine-cytosine (GC) contents than those in bulk soil, implying higher growth rates. Warming stimulated soil respiration by 32.3% and accelerated mass loss of cellulose, concurring with the increase in relative abundances of most functional genes associated with carbon decomposition in litterbags. Incorporating cellulose-decomposing genes into an ecosystem model reduced model parameter uncertainty and showed that warming stimulated microbial biomass, activity, and soil carbon decomposition. Collectively, our study supports a trait-centric view since cellulose-decomposing genes or genomic traits are amenable for ecosystem modeling. By characterizing the phylogenetically diverse yet functionally similar cellulose-associated microorganisms and their responses to warming, we take a step toward more precise predictions of soil carbon dynamics under future climate scenarios.
40066041	Extent of natural soil cadmium, its bioavailability, and pollution treat analysis in the agroforestry systems of the Gedeo Zone of southern Ethiopia.	The research objectives were to determine extent of soil cadmium (Cd) in the major soil types of the Gedeo Zone of Ethiopia thereby assessing the pollution risk on the environmental health. Four profile pits representing Luvisols, Nitisols, Cambisols, and Leptosols, were excavated and soil samples were collected. Total and available Cd, Cu, Zn, and Mn, including other major soil physicochemical properties, were analyzed in the lab. The permutational multivariate analysis of variance results indicated that the significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) level of heterogeneity between soil types is confined to subsurface horizons. The nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination plots also show a marked difference between the physicochemical properties of the subsurface horizons of the Luvisol and the remaining soil types. The mean total Cd levels were high for all soil types and horizons in the range of 5.82-8.48 ppm, however, the mean available Cd contents were low (0.69-0.90 ppm). One-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis test results revealed a significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) soil type effect on total and available Cd contents between the corresponding soil horizons. Based on the single pollution and the Nemerow comprehensive pollution indices, the pollution risk decreases in the order of Cd > Mn > Zn > Cu pollution. According to Pearson's correlation results, no correlation exists between total and available Cd, whereas very strong and significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) correlations are present between total Cd and total nitrogen (<i>r</i> = 0.90), electrical conductivity (<i>r</i> = 0.83), and organic matter (<i>r</i> = 0.77). Our results indicate that Cd contamination is of geogenic origin, further aggravated by organic matter amendments. More research are needed, among other things, to know the Cd status of the major crops grown in the area so as to design appropriate Cd management strategies.
40065790	Provenance differences and factors influencing transpiration of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> in a common garden experiment.	Tree transpiration is a key component of forest evapotranspiration, and sap flow monitoring is the primary way to study tree canopy transpiration and water consumption. However, provenance differences in transpiration and the unique responses to environmental factors are not well understood. We measured the sap flow and calculated the canopy evapotranspiration (Ec) of 15 Chinese fir provenances from five provinces in a common garden and monitored soil moisture and meteorological variables between September 2020 and September 2022. Mean daily Ec of the provenances from Guangxi (GX), Sichuan (SC), Anhui (AH), Yunan (YN), and Zhejiang (ZJ) were 1.31 ± 0.99 g·d<sup>-1</sup>, 1.59 ± 1.18 g·d<sup>-1</sup>, 1.62 ± 1.43 g·d<sup>-1</sup>, 1.41 ± 1.01 g·d<sup>-1</sup>, and 1.48 ± 1.13 g·d<sup>-1</sup> during the study period, respectively. The mean daily Ec of Guangxi, Sichuan, Anhui, Yunan, and Zhejiang provenances exhibited significant differences (<i>p</i> <0.01). Overall, the Ec of these provenances was high from June to August. Soil moisture had different effects on the Ec of the provenances. The provenances from Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Anhui showed higher Ec values when REW <0.4 than REW≥0.4 conditions, but the Ec of Guangxi and Yunnan provenances showed no significant differences under the two conditions. When the soil was relatively moist, Ec of the provenances was mainly influenced by Rs and VPD. When the soil was relatively dry, the main influencing factors were the Ta and VPD. Overall, our findings revealed different provenance-specific responses of Ec to biophysical factors, providing valuable insights for the selection of superior provenances of Chinese fir from the perspective of water use in the context of a changing climate.
40065787	Assessment of metal residues in soil and evaluate the plant accumulation in copper mine tailings of Dongchuan, Southwest China.	This study aimed to identify suitable plants for remediating metal pollution in copper tailing soil and supporting ecological reclamation in Dongchuan, Yunnan, focusing on three major mining regions: Tangdan, Yinmin, and Lanniping.
40065576	Size Matters: Influence of Available Soil Volume on the Root Architecture and Plant Response at Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Levels in Barley.	Pot size is a critical factor in plant growth experiments, influencing root architecture, nutrient uptake, and overall plant development as well as sensing of stress. In controlled environments, variation in pot size can impact phenotypic and molecular outcomes and may bias experimental results. Here, we investigated how pot size affects the root system architecture and molecular responses of two barley genotypes, the landrace BERE and the modern elite CONCERTO, through assessment of shoot and root traits and by using X-ray computed tomography complemented by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. The two genotypes showed distinctly different adaptations to changes in pot size. The landrace showed greater stability and adaptability with consistent root traits and enhanced accumulation of osmoprotectant metabolites across different pot sizes with respect to CONCERTO. Conversely, the elite line was more sensitive to pot size variations, particularly showing altered root architecture and transcriptomic responses. Overall, this study highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate pot size for plant growth experiments, particularly when focused on root traits, and highlights the importance of considering the physiological and molecular changes due to growth environment choice in experimental design in barley.
40065571	Plant-soil feedbacks contribute to coexistence when considering multispecies assemblages over a soil depth gradient.	Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) may determine plant-species coexistence. They may stabilize coexistence, but frequently destabilize it by increasing fitness differences between species. Most studies focus on pairwise models in greenhouses. Thus, whether PSFs favor or deter coexistence is still unclear, especially in multispecies field contexts. We analyzed pairwise and multispecies coexistence over a hydric gradient in a semiarid grassland. Using PSF strength estimates between 17 species, we measured stability and fitness differences between all species pairs, and built all possible multispecies communities to test computationally whether they were stabilized by PSFs. We analyzed whether coexistence probability diminishes with species richness, as previously hypothesized. Because PSFs change with environmental conditions, we investigated their contribution to overall diversity maintenance over the hydric gradient. Strong PSF increased fitness differences, hindering pairwise coexistence. As expected, the probability that an assemblage was stable diminished with its richness, with the largest stable community containing 12 of the 17 species. However, all species coexisted with others in at least one assemblage, highlighting the importance of multispecies analyses. Positive PSFs promoted coexistence in pairwise analyses, but were associated with species-poor communities. Contrastingly, negative PSFs predominated in species-rich associations, perhaps due to indirect positive interactions (an "enemy of my enemy is my friend" scenario) that are known to maintain diversity in this grassland. Changes in the density of different species over the hydric gradient predicted from PSF-stabilized communities matched observations in nature. This seems to promote species turnover and thus coexistence along the gradient. As such, the interplay between environmental conditions and PSFs may be an important driver of diversity. Our results emphasize the need to move beyond pairwise coexistence models. In multispecies systems, crucial indirect interactions may arise. The interplay between environment and PSF under field conditions may provide important insights into coexistence in nature.
40065489	Soil pH-dependent nitrogen stimulation of plant biomass: magnesium and calcium as key constraints.	Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition can alleviate N limitation and stimulate plant growth in many terrestrial ecosystems. While theoretical models often emphasize phosphorus limitations as a constraint on this positive N effect, the impact of N-induced magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) deficits due to soil acidification has been largely overlooked. Here, we synthesized data from 243 experiments across diverse terrestrial ecosystems to investigate the role of Mg and Ca in plant biomass responses to N addition. We found that the effect of N addition on aboveground biomass (AGB) shifted from neutral in low pH (≤ 4.5) to positive in medium (4.5-7.5) and high pH (> 7.5) soils. By contrast, belowground biomass (BGB) responses to N addition were independent of soil pH, leading to asymmetric increases in AGB and BGB. These variations in biomass accumulation across pH levels were primarily explained by changes in foliar Mg and Ca concentrations, which were negatively affected by N addition in low-pH soils but remained stable in medium and high-pH soils. Our findings underscore the critical role of Mg and Ca in modulating plant responses to N fertilization, providing new insights for improving Earth system models and better predicting climate-biosphere feedback.
40065484	The pH influence on ectomycorrhizal nitrogen acquisition and decomposition.	In theory, ectomycorrhizal (EM) and saprotrophic fungi compete for nitrogen (N) found in soil organic matter. However, both positive and negative effects of EM fungi on decomposition have been observed across systems, with opposing implications for soil carbon (C) storage. The conditions driving the context dependency of fungal guild interactions remain poorly understood, which has limited our ability to predict the effects of EM fungi on biogeochemical cycling at regional and global spatial scales. To address this knowledge gap, we used a publicly available dataset of soil fungal communities to examine global patterns of relative EM and saprotrophic abundance and their influence on soil carbon and nutrient cycling. We demonstrate that EM fungal dominance and its effects on C and N cycling are predictable across the globe using only soil C : N stoichiometry, host tree functional group, and soil pH as predictors. We argue that because soil pH influences the availability and enzymatic catabolism of organic N, it determines the dominant N acquisition strategy of EM fungi, which in turn governs the directional effect of EM-saprotroph interactions on rates of organic matter decomposition in forests.
40065141	Characteristics stochastic analysis of long and narrow deep excavations under soil spatial variability.	The mechanical properties of soil, resulting from the weathering of rocks through physical and chemical processes, exhibit spatial variability. This variability introduces uncertainties in the design and characteristics of excavation projects. To address these uncertainties caused by soil spatial variability, safety factors are commonly used in excavation design. However, using the same safety factor for different indicators of soil spatial variability is illogical. Therefore, specialized research on the characteristics of deep excavations in the context of soil spatial variability is necessary, as it provides the theoretical basis for rational excavation design. In this study, we assumed that soil parameters follow a lognormal distribution, while spatial correlation adheres to a Gaussian function. We developed a random finite element algorithm for deep excavations, which incorporated Python programming and the ABAQUS computational platform. This algorithm was created within the framework of random field theory and Monte Carlo simulation. The results of our study indicate that, influenced by soil spatial variability, the lateral wall movements and ground surface settlements exhibit discrete distributions near the deterministic results. The maximum deformation of the excavation follows a normal distribution, while the pattern of ground surface settlements demonstrates diversity and chaotic characteristics. The extent to which soil spatial variability affects deep excavations is correlated with indicators of this variability. As the coefficient of soil spatial variability increases, the diversity and chaotic characteristics of ground surface settlements become more prominent. The locations of maximum ground surface settlement and maximum deformation becomes more scattered. Consequently, the probability of excavation failure increases, and the reliability index of the excavation decreases. In summary, soil spatial variability significantly impacts deformation prediction and safety control during the design and construction stages of deep excavations. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the influence of soil spatial variability when designing deep excavations, based on the variability indicators.
40065118	Experimental study on gas permeability and radon control performance of red clay covering layer on uranium mill tailings pond.	The decommissioning of uranium mill tailings pond generally employs covering layer to diminish radon exhalation, with soil permeability, thickness, and moisture content being essential considerations in assessing the efficacy of radon reduction. This research uses a proprietary multi-field coupled seepage testing apparatus and a simulated covering layer radon exhalation device to evaluate samples' permeability and radon control effectiveness across different covering layer thicknesses, pressure gradients, and moisture content levels. The findings demonstrate that gas permeability diminishes with increasing covering layer thickness, exhibiting a more pronounced decline at pressures below 0.35 MPa. Moreover, both moisture content and covering layer thickness significantly influence the radon exhalation rate, which decreases nonlinearly with the rise of both variables. A positive link exists between the radon exhalation rate and permeability, aligning with a natural exponential function model.
40065116	Biofertilizers containing plant growth promoting rhizobacteria enhance nutrient uptake and improve the growth and yield of chickpea plants in an arid environment.	Integrated nutrient management is anticipated as an environmentally friendly method toward sustainable agricultural development and optimum crop production with reduced environmental impacts. In the present study, the pastel sulfur (SPA), powdered sulfur (SPO), sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB), phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), and potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB) were applied. The experimental treatments included (1) SPA, (2) SPO, (3) SOB, (4) SPA + SOB, (5) SPO + SOB, (6) SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (7) SPO + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (8) SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (9) NFB + PSB + KSB, and (10) control. The result demonstrated that the application of biofertilizers increased soil bacterial population, photosynthetic pigment content, and grain yield. The highest photosynthetic pigments were observed in NFB + PSB + KSB. The greatest nitrogen fixation nodules and active nodules percentage were recorded in SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB. The biofertilizers enhanced the grain, plant, and soil N, P, and K contents compared with the control. The maximum number of pods per plant, biological yield, grain yield, and 100-grain weight were obtained from SPO + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB and SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB. Overall, biofertilizers could be a key strategy to maintain soil quality toward agricultural sustainability.
40065001	Constraints of weathering intensity in different climate zones on coal accumulation environment.	There are currently multiple hypotheses regarding coal accumulation models, each with certain limitations in applicability. This article investigates the relationship between modern sedimentation, soil and climate to analyze the distribution of coal across different geological periods, aiming to explain the coal accumulation environment within a unified theoretical framework. The research concludes that the intensity of weathering in various climate zones is a determining factor influencing coal formation, which also affects the distribution of two other climate-sensitive sedimentary deposits - evaporite and bauxite. These three types of sedimentary minerals can be considered as paleoclimatic indicators: cold and humid, warm and dry, and hot and humid. Furthermore, the impact of temperature on the mineralization of organic matter is significantly greater than that of redox conditions; in general, the mineralization of organic matter in high-temperature environments at mid-to-low latitudes exceeds productivity, resulting in low carbon sequestration rates. The conclusion drawn is that the optimal environment for peat or coal enrichment exists in a cold-humid climate zone characterized by low primary productivity, rather than in a tropical zone with high primary productivity. Additionally, the latitudinal shifts of cold temperate climate-controlled coal distribution, and the sediment types in these three climate zones sufficiently constrain coal-forming environments.
40064960	Impact of drainage on peatland soil environments and greenhouse gas emissions in Northeast China.	Peatlands are vital for global carbon storage, but drainage significantly disrupts their natural carbon cycling. Drainage alters peatland soil environments in complex ways, affecting factors such as water table, soil temperature, organic carbon (SOC), pH, and microbial communities. However, how these factors interact to influence GHG emissions remains unclear. In this study, we compared water table, soil temperature, soil properties, microbial community structure, and GHG emissions across three zones of a peatland in Northeast China undergoing drainage: drained, transition, and natural areas. The average water table in the drained area was significantly lower than in the natural area (from 11.45 cm to -13.47 cm), shifting from waterlogged to unsaturated conditions. Deep soil temperatures in the drained area decreased by 1 ~ 3 °C. The pH of the upper soil layer was higher in the drained area (5.05 ~ 5.29 vs. 4.64 ~ 4.71), while SOC was lower (197.31 ~ 374.75 g/kg vs. 437.05 ~ 512.71 g/kg). Aerobic bacteria (mainly Solibacter) were more abundant in the drained area, while methanogens (mainly hydrogenotrophic) declined significantly. Fungal diversity increased from the natural to drained area with increased negative interactions and enhanced network modularity. Drainage reduced CH<sub>4</sub> emissions but increased CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, resulting in a significant rise in net GHG emissions (8.86 ~ 10.65 vs. 22.27 ~ 24.26 t CO<sub>2</sub>-eq·ha⁻¹·season⁻¹), primarily driven by increased CO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were positively correlated with soil temperature, aerobic bacteria, facultatively anaerobic bacteria and pH, but negatively correlated with water table, anaerobic bacteria, soil moisture and C/N ratio. CH<sub>4</sub> flux was positively correlated with methanogens and water table, but negatively correlated with pH. The effects of drainage were more pronounced near drainage ditches, particularly for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, highlighting the localized impacts of drainage on peatland GHG fluxes.
40064954	Precision soil sampling strategy for the delineation of management zones in olive cultivation using unsupervised machine learning methods.	Climate change and environmental degradation pose a significant threat to the global community. Soil management is one of the critical factors for achieving climate neutrality, as plants and soils together currently absorb approximately 30% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by human activities each year. This study focused on delineating soil management zones in olive groves to maintain soil health in complex environmental conditions and minimize adverse effects on the biological systems supported. The results of this study are crucial because they showed the potential of unsupervised machine learning techniques in this setting and important soil characteristics for defining management zones. They might significantly affect applying precision farming techniques and methods in olive groves, providing a possible remedy for the problems caused by climate change. A total of 222 soil samples at a depth of 0-30 cm were collected from three areas in the Region of Western Greece, at a density of 21 × 21 m in each area, and analyzed for physicochemical properties. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to identify the critical soil properties for delineating the management zones. The soil samples were clustered using unsupervised machine learning methods, K-means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. PCA is a method that can help in the selection of critical parameters for the delineation of management zones. Sand (S), Clay (C), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), and total carbonates (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) can delineate management zones in olive cultivation. The management zones and how each field is separated vary depending on the clustering method.
40064926	Assessment of organophosphate pesticides in soils and vegetables from agricultural areas of Delta Central District, Nigeria.	The application of agrochemicals such as organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) has several benefits in agriculture but also poses great risks to the environment and human well-being. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the concentrations, distribution pattern, relationships, potential risks and sources of OPPs in agricultural soils and vegetables from Delta Central District (DCD) of Nigeria to provide useful information for pollution history, establishment of pollution control measures and risk management. Fourteen OPPs were determined in the soil and vegetables using a gas chromatograph-mass selective detector (GC-MSD). The ∑14 OPPs concentrations varied from 5.29 to 419 ng g<sup>-1</sup> for soil and 0.69 to 130 ng g<sup>-1</sup> for vegetables. On average, pirimiphos methyl (23.8 ng g<sup>-1</sup>) and diazinone (4.74 ng g<sup>-1</sup>) were the dominant OPPs in soils and vegetables respectively. The cumulative ecological risk assessed using the toxicity-exposure-ratio (TER) and risk quotient (RQ) approaches revealed that there was a high risk of OPPs to soil organisms. The increasing order of OPPs toxicity to the soil organisms was chlorpyriphos < fenitrothion < diazinone < pirimiphos methyl while the cumulative human health risk suggested there was adverse non-carcinogenic risk for children but not for adults exposed to OPPs in these agricultural soils and vegetables.
40064907	GLEAM4: global land evaporation and soil moisture dataset at 0.1 resolution from 1980 to near present.	Terrestrial evaporation plays a crucial role in modulating climate and water resources. Here, we present a continuous, daily dataset covering 1980-2023 with a 0.1°spatial resolution, produced using the fourth generation of the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). GLEAM4 embraces developments in hybrid modelling, learning evaporative stress from eddy-covariance and sapflow data. It features improved representation of key factors such as interception, atmospheric water demand, soil moisture, and plant access to groundwater. Estimates are inter-compared with existing global evaporation products and validated against in situ measurements, including data from 473 eddy-covariance sites, showing a median correlation of 0.73, root-mean-square error of 0.95 mm d<sup>-1</sup>, and Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.49. Global land evaporation is estimated at 68.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, with 62% attributed to transpiration. Beyond actual evaporation and its components (transpiration, interception loss, soil evaporation, etc.), the dataset also provides soil moisture, potential evaporation, sensible heat flux, and evaporative stress, facilitating a wide range of hydrological, climatic, and ecological studies.
40064902	Methane emissions from thermokarst lakes must emphasize the ice-melting impact on the Tibetan Plateau.	Thermokarst lakes, serving as significant sources of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), play a crucial role in affecting the feedback of permafrost carbon cycle to global warming. However, accurately assessing CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from these lakes remains challenging due to limited observations during lake ice melting periods. In this study, by integrating field surveys with machine learning modeling, we offer a comprehensive assessment of present and future CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from thermokarst lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results reveal that the previously underestimated CH<sub>4</sub> release from lake ice bubble and water storage during ice melting periods is 11.2 ± 1.6 Gg C of CH<sub>4</sub>, accounting for 17 ± 4% of the annual total release from lakes. Despite thermokarst lakes cover only 0.2% of the permafrost area, they annually emit 65.5 ± 10.0 Gg C of CH<sub>4</sub>, which offsets 6.4% of the net carbon sink in alpine grasslands on the plateau. Considering the loss of lake ice, the expansion of thermokarst lakes is projected to lead to 1.1-1.2 folds increase in CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by 2100. Our study allows foreseeing future CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from the rapid expanding thermokarst lakes and sheds new lights on processes controlling the carbon-climate feedback in alpine permafrost ecosystems.
40064896	Soil Radon Time Series from the Italian Radon Monitoring Network (IRON).	We share long term, continuous measurements of soil radon emanations in Italy acquired from 2009 to 2021 by the Italian Radon mOnitoring Network (IRON). The radon concentrations were measured at 62 stations and consist of 621 720 single measurements. Employed detectors are both in-house prototypes (LUCAS) and commercial devices (AER by Algade©), suitably calibrated at INGV radionuclide laboratory. In addiction to radon concentration, most stations acquire internal temperature, while a subset of them also record relative humidity. When available, all these data series are provided along with radon time series and consist of 1 320 710 local temperature and humidity data. The presented dataset allows monitoring variations in radon emissions on multiple time scales, using different analysis techniques. Potential investigations include the effect of environmental parameters/conditions on radon emissions, the study of the impact on such emissions of transient signals like those associated with seismic and volcanic preparation processes and fluid migration dynamics as well as analyses of risk for human health, related to prolonged exposure to radon gas accumulated in confined spaces.
40064743	Heavy metal and bacteria contamination of selected wetland ecosystems on the eastern slope of Mount Cameroon: implications for human and ecosystem health.	The wetland ecosystems on Mount Cameroon's eastern slope, known for their agroecological significance and biodiversity, are facing potential threats such as heavy metal and bacterial contamination due to poor waste management systems and anthropogenic activities. A study was conducted to quantify the heavy metals and bacterial loads in Solanum scabrum Mill., Amaranthus cruentus L., and Talinum fruticosum (L.) Juss., three major vegetables grown in the area. Soil and water samples were collected and analysed for the concentrations of 24 elements, including heavy metals, using the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) approach. The bacteria in the samples were isolated and cultured in lactose broth, and the total coliform count was estimated using the maximum probable number (MPN) technique. The heavy metals in both soil and plant samples occurred in the order Mn > Zn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Co > Pb > Fe > Al. The contamination indices of Mn > 5807.3 and Cr > 4698.3 indicated varied sources of these metal contaminants. The bioaccumulation coefficient (BAC) was > 1 for most of the metals, with T. fruticosum having the highest BAC value (3.60) for the leaves. The mean bacteria count indicated high contamination with Enterobacteria (600 coliform forming units (CFU)) and E. coli (500 CFU) in vegetables across all sampling sites. The high concentration of bacterial contaminants in the soil, water, and plants across the study sites indicates a high health risk, making the ecosystem not pristine and thus impossible for these wetlands to improve food security. Consequently, this study provides crucial information for policymakers and stakeholders to develop effective strategies for the conservation and sustainable management of these wetlands.
40064739	Metagenomic insights of microbial functions under conventional and conservation agriculture.	Agricultural practices such as conventional (CN) and conservation agriculture (CA) influence the composition and structure of soil microorganisms. We used short reads and genome-resolved metagenomic-based dual sequencing approaches to create a profile of bacterial and archaeal communities in hyperthermic Typic Haplustepts soil after seven years of CA and CN. The most differences in the physico-chemical and biological properties of soil were higher pH, organics carbon, available nitrogen and microbial biomass contents, activities of dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, and arylsulfatase, found in CA soil. The dominant bacterial taxa under both management types were Pseudomonadota (46-48%), Acidobacteriota (12-13%), Planctomycetota (8-10%), Bacteroidota (7-8%), and Actinomycetota (6-7%). Nitrososphaerota (1.1-1.5%) was the predominant archaeal phyla in CA and CN soils. The alpha diversity was 1.5 times higher in CA compared to CN soils. Fourteen high-quality (HQ) metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from both groups. Four HQ metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Pseudomonadota phylum were exclusively recovered from the CA soil. The dominance of this phylum in the CA soil might be correlated with its nutrient richness, as certain classes of Pseudomonadota, such as Alpha, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltaproteobacteria, are known to be copiotrophic. Copiotrophic organisms thrive in nutrient-rich environments, which could explain their prevalence in the CA soil. CAZyme gene analysis showed that Glycoside Hydrolases (GH) and GlycosylTransferases (GT) classes are dominant in the CA group, possibly due to higher substrate availability from the application of crop residues, which provide a rich source of complex carbohydrates. Several biogeochemical gene families related to C1 compounds, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur metabolism were enriched in CA soils, suggesting these practices may contribute to a soil environment with increased organic matter content, microbial diversity, and nutrient availability. Overall, CA practices seemed to improve soil health by supporting soil microbial communities abundance.
40064729	Integrative metabolo-genomics suggests a biosynthetic pathway for tetrangulol in Streptomyces sp. KL110A.	Natural products (NPs) of microbial origin are highly valued for their diverse bioactive properties. Among bacteria, Streptomyces stands out as a prolific source of NPs with applications in medicine and agriculture. Recent advances in metabolomics, and bioinformatics as well as the abundance of genomic data have revolutionized the study of NPs, enabling the rapid connection of biosynthetic pathways and metabolites. However, discovering novel compounds from large pools of genomes and strains is cumbersome. Metabolo-genomics approaches are promising strategies that can save time and resources at initial stages of the natural product discovery pipeline by rapidly linking molecules and their biosynthetic genes. Here, we present genomic characterization and metabolomic profiling of Streptomyces sp. KL110A, a strain isolated from the rainforest soils of Calakmul, Campeche in Mexico. Using genome mining tools and LC-MS/MS metabolomics, we identified and characterized known biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and proposed a biosynthetic mechanism for the biosynthesis of the benz(a)anthraquinone tetrangulol. Our findings underscore the relevance of integrating genomic and metabolomic approaches in elucidating novel biosynthetic pathways, positively contributing to the field of natural product research.
40064681	Assessment of L-cysteine Reductase Activity as an Indicator of Soil Health in Different Climatic Zones After Pollution by Oil.	The sulfur cycle in the soil regulates many vital processes in plants since it enters the composition of amino acids, vitamins, phytochelatins, and other substances. Soils of different climatic zones have different physicochemical properties and sulfur reserves, which, therefore, stipulates various activities of soil enzymes. The aim of the study was the assessment of L-cysteine reductase activity as an indicator of soil health in different climatic zones after oil pollution: semi-desert types, steppe types and forest types of soils. A model experiment was based on the pollution of 12 types of soil by oil (1%, 5%, and 10%) followed by the determination of the L-cysteine reductase activity in the soils after 30 days from the start of the experiment. The highest activity of L-cysteine ​​reductase in soils contaminated with oil was found in semi-desert (Haplic Solonchaks Aridic, Haplic Kastanozems Chromic) and forest (Luvic Phaeozems Albic and Luvic Stagnosols Dystric (Illuvial-Ferrugenous)) soils. The greatest sensitivity and informative content by oil pollution, assessed by the activity of L-cysteine reductase, were found in Haplic Kastanozems Chromic (semi-desert types of soils), Voronic Chernozems Pachic (ordinary) and Luvic Phaeozems Albic (steppe types of soils) and Luvic Stagnosols Dystric and Luvic Stagnosols Dystric (Illuvial-Ferrugenous) (forest types of soil). The results obtained can be used in diagnosing and assessing the ecological state and health of soils contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons.
40064671	Effects of Low Concentrations of Hypochloric Acid on the Agricultural Soil Properties.	The oxidant (e.g., hypochlorous acid, HClO) has been widely used to remediate contaminated sites. However, the effects of HClO on soil health in agricultural fields have been rarely explored. Based on the laboratory and field experiments, we found that low concentrations of HClO changed soil bioavailable elements, enzyme activities, and the structure of microbial communities. Specifically, the application of 5‰ HClO increased DOC content by 13.9-19.9% compared with CK. The bioavailable Fe and Mn contents also increased by 15.0% and 48.7%-61.8%, respectively. Correspondingly, in field experiments, 5‰ HClO enhanced the DOC contents by 12.0%. Besides, the application of HClO also elevated enzyme activities and improved the structure of the microbial community of soil. These findings might provide new strategies for improving the fertility and quality of agricultural soil.
40064553	Study on Differential Metabolite Active Ingredients in Maize Roots Based on Network Pharmacology and Metabolomics Analysis.	Maize is a globally important crop. Roots are the main part of maize and are mainly used for soil improvement and for maintaining crop growth as agricultural waste. Their application scope is relatively small. It is very important to analyze the components in maize roots in order to increase their resource utilization and reduce the burden of waste disposal. Metabolomics shows that maize roots contain various bioactive components, such as alkaloids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, etc. Therefore, this study explores the potential pharmacological effects of maize root metabolites under drought stress from the perspective of metabolomics combined with network pharmacology. The crude extraction of betaine, a metabolite in maize roots under drought stress, was conducted, and the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of the crude extract were evaluated. The experimental results of DPPH, Fenton, etc. indicate that the crude extract of betaine from maize roots has certain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which provides a basis for its potential applications in the fields of medicine and food. The research on extracting medicinal active substances such as betaine from maize roots as agricultural waste not only has economic and environmental advantages but also has important significance in promoting technological progress and public health.
40064531	Role of Chlorella fusca in Promoting Plant Health Through Microbiota Regulation in Strawberry.	Chlorella is a microalgae species known to have plant growth-promoting (PGP) and disease-suppressing effects in crops. However, the mechanism of Chlorella's efficacy on crops remains unclear.
40064517	Microdroplet-Mediated Enzyme Activity Enhancement for Potentiometric Sensing of Peroxidase in Soil.	On-site measurements of enzyme activity in complex solid matrices such as soil and sediment could offer invaluable insights for the soil health evaluation and sustainable management. As such, sensors for on-site measurements of soil enzyme activity are highly required but remain unachieved to date. Herein, a potentiometric sensor for rapid, direct, and in-field analysis of soil enzyme activity is proposed, in which soil particle separation and soil enzyme extraction can be achieved within a single device. More importantly, the enzyme activity mediated by microdroplets can be greatly enhanced for potentiometric measurements. By using a classic soil redox enzyme-peroxidase and an anti-interference substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as a model, the potentiometric sensor enables directly measuring peroxidase activity in the field with a detection limit that can reach as low as 10<sup>-7</sup> U mL<sup>-1</sup> within 5 min. Moreover, the potentiometric sensor was deployed for on-site analysis of the peroxidase activity of <i>Suaeda salsa</i> (L.) Pall. rhizosphere soil under salinity stress, showing excellent sensitivity and anti-interference capability, and retaining promising potential for evaluating the mechanisms and feedback in response to environment stresses.
40064405	Molecular and Genomic Investigation Unveils Pseudomonas putida as an Emerging Multidrug-Resistant Pathogen Linked to Bovine Clinical Mastitis.	Pseudomonas putida is one of the emerging pathogens responsible causing mastitis in lactating animals. This study investigated the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), genetic diversity and virulence factor genes (VFGs) to highlight the pathogenic potentials of P. putida strains isolated from milk, feces and farm soil of bovine clinical mastitis (CM). A total of 110 samples were collected and analyzed, revealing an overall prevalence of P. putida in dairy farms at 40.90%, with specific prevalence rates of 42.22% in milk, 26.67% in feces, and 31.11% in farm soil. In vitro antimicrobial assays demonstrated that 76.0% P. putida isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR, resistance to ≥ 3 antibiotics), particularly showing high resistance to oxacillin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and aztreonam. Conversely, P. putida isolates showed the highest susceptibility against imipenem. The genome analysis of three MDR P. putida strains 11CM-M1 (milk), 11CM-F1 (feces) and 11CM-S1 (farm soil), showed a close evolutionary relationship with different strains of Pseudomonas spp. isolated from bovine mastitis milk and feces samples, human stool, and the hospital environment. The assembled genomes of three P. putida strains encoded nine antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), 36 VFGs, and 367 metabolic subsystems, highlighting a complex functional profile and potential for pathogenicity. The detailed analysis of these ARGs and VFGs demonstrated that P. putida strains employ distinct mechanisms of resistance (e.g., efflux pumps), biofilm formation, and virulence factors, including adhesins, secreted toxins, and lipopolysaccharides, which contribute to their pathogenic potential. Given the lack of reports linking P. putida strains to bovine mastitis in Bangladesh, the increasing trend of AMR, along with the presence of significant ARGs and VFGs in the studied strains, underscores the need for more intensive research, including animal model experiment, to better elucidate the pathogenesis and inform treatment decisions for mastitis in dairy animals.
40064377	The stability and elimination of mammalian enveloped and non-enveloped respiratory viruses in indoor air: Testing using a room-sized aerobiology chamber.	We assessed the viability of aerosolized human betacoronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43; ATCC VR-1558), human rhinovirus-14 (RV-14; ATCC VR-284) and feline calicivirus (FCV; ATCC VR-782) as representative enveloped and non-enveloped respiratory viruses of mammals in indoor air under ambient conditions (relative humidity 50±10% and air temperature 22±2°C) using a room-sized (25 m<sup>3</sup>; 900 ft<sup>3</sup>) aerobiology chamber. All virus suspensions contained a soil load to simulate the presence of body fluids and they were separately aerosolized into the chamber using a six-jet Collison nebulizer. A muffin fan was used to uniformly mix the air inside the chamber and to keep the aerosols airborne. A slit sampler with Petri plates containing 3% (wt./vol) gelatin was used to collect the air samples. The gelatin was liquefied in an incubator and assayed for infectious virus as plaque-forming units (PFU). The rates of biological decay of HCoV-OC43, RV-14 and FCV were 0.0052±0.00026, 0.0034±0.0027 and 0.0081±0.0031 (as log<sub>10</sub> PFU/m<sup>3</sup>/min), respectively. We also assessed a HEPA filter-based stand-alone air purifier against the experimentally aerosolized viruses and the device could demonstrate >3-log<sub>10</sub> reductions in the viability of the three viruses in 46, 62 and 41minutes, respectively. Therefore, we can now investigate the stability of mammalian viruses in indoor air as well as air decontamination technologies against them under field-relevant conditions.
40064349	Distribution and Accumulation Dynamics of Fungicide Azoxystrobin in the Soil-Plant System.	Azoxystrobin is a widely used fungicide belonging to the strobilurin group, primarily employed to control a range of fungal diseases in crops, including pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). As a systemic pesticide, it effectively inhibits mitochondrial respiration in fungi, thereby preventing their growth and spread. However, concerns have emerged regarding its environmental persistence and potential bioaccumulation in soil-plant systems. This study conducted a field study and utilized HPLC-MS/MS for sample analysis, investigating the distribution and accumulation dynamics of azoxystrobin in the soil-plant system, with a focus on its behavior in different soil depths and plant tissues. The results show that pesticide concentration in the shoots remained consistently low throughout the observation period. In contrast, the concentration in roots gradually increased over time, with a peak observed in the top soil around the 10th day (16.56 mg/kg), followed by a rapid decrease to 1.44 mg/kg by the 14th day after application. The pesticide concentration in the subsurface soil remained relatively stable, reaching 0.91 mg/kg by the 35th day. The percentage distribution of pesticides in different parts of the system was as follows: top soil > subsurface soil > roots > shoots. The biological concentration factor (BCF) was greater than 1 during the early and middle-late growth stages, and both the biological accumulation coefficient (BAC) and translocation factor (TF) remained consistently below 1. This study highlights the role of the top soil as a primary pesticide reservoir and suggests limited translocation efficiency from roots to shoots. This pattern of accumulation could have significant implications for environmental health by indicating potential risks of pesticide persistence in the soil, emphasizing the need for further research on optimizing agricultural practices to mitigate pesticide accumulation in the environment.
40064348	Carbon Quantum Dots from Fallen Leaves of Lonicera caerulea L.: An Innovative Plant Growth Promoter and Fruit Quality Enhancer.	With increasing environmental pollution and resource wastage, utilizing waste for high-value applications has become crucial. This study explores the preparation of carbon dots (CDs) from blue honeysuckle leaves and their potential in enhancing plant photosynthesis. CDs derived from these leaves have a particle size of ∼2.6 nm and emit blue fluorescence under 365 nm UV light, making them suitable for foliar spraying. When applied, CDs enter leaf cells and impact chloroplasts, significantly improving photosystem II (PSII) performance and Rubisco enzyme activity. At an optimal concentration of 1000 mg/L, PSII electron transfer efficiency and Rubisco activity increased by 29.84% and 208.12%, respectively, boosting net photosynthetic rate by 60.4%. This treatment also enhanced blue honeysuckle yield and fruit quality, with higher levels of soluble solids, ascorbic acid, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and total phenolics. These improvements were linked to increased sucrose synthesis (up 25.99%) and leaf assimilative capacity (up 25%). Additionally, CDs enhanced post-harvest soil enzyme activity and microbial abundance, promoting nutrient cycling and soil utilization. This study demonstrates that preparing CDs from waste blue honeysuckle leaves not only mitigates environmental pollution but also offers a sustainable, high value use for plant resources. The findings highlight the potential of nanomaterials in improving agricultural productivity and provide a novel pathway for waste reuse.
40064347	Spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors of heavy metals of topsoil in Pearl River Basin, China.	This study investigates the spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors of topsoil heavy metals in the Pearl River Basin by utilizing data from the 2000s to the 2010s obtained from China Geochemical Baselines project (CGB1: 2008-2012; CGB2: 2015-2019), alongside geostatistics methods and a modified absolute principal component scores-multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) model. The results indicate that the median concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Hg exhibited a decreasing trend from the CGB1 to CGB2. Notably, As concentrations decreased the most, with a reduction percentage of 24.7%. Mining and smelting activities predominantly influenced the concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu, which decreased respectively from 16.34 mg/kg to 12.31 mg/kg, 365.11 μg/g to 287.38 μg/g, 41.31 mg/kg to 34.20 mg/kg, 96.41 mg/kg to 84.00 mg/kg, and 28.63 mg/kg to 25.72 mg/kg. The contribution rates of these activities ranged from 49.7% to 95.2%. In contrast, natural factors such as parent materials, weathering processes, and soil properties predominantly governed the concentrations of Cr and Ni, which decreased respectively from 62.03 to 55.92 mg/kg and 23.74 to 22.98 mg/kg, with contribution rates of 42.8% and 71.2%, respectively. Geochemical processes controlled the concentrations of Hg, which decreased from 115.75 to 112.85 μg/g, contributing 62.9%. Given the diverse geology and economic development of the Pearl River Basin, investigations into the spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors of heavy metals in topsoil not only provide a scientific basis for partitioned studies on pollution dynamics and health assessments within the basin, but also establish a foundation for analyzing environmental changes and developing policies in other regions.
40064344	Enhancement of the phytoremediation performance in heavy metal-contaminated soil using a multifunctional EPS-producing bacterium Kosakonia sp. W18.	The use of exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacteria for the phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil is emerging as a promising approach. This study explores the potential of Kosakonia sp. W18, an EPS-producing bacterium isolated from Suaeda japonica habitat, in the phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils. Strain W18 exhibited the highest tolerance to Pb (EC<sub>50</sub> of 231.1 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>), Cu, and Cr (EC<sub>50</sub> of 24.9 and 26.7 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>), and displayed plant growth-promoting traits. The EPS extracted from W18 (107.3 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>) showed 58% emulsification against chloroform, remarkable 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (38%) and hydroxyl radical (83%) scavenging activities. Extracted EPS also exhibited a Pb-removal efficiency exceeding 79%, with an adsorption capacity for Pb of 499.2 ± 7.7 mg·g-EPS<sup>-1</sup>. In the contaminated soils with Pb (500 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>) and Cr (100 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>), W18 inoculation significantly enhanced pakchoi shoot length and biomass by 1.1 to 1.3 times after 20 days. The presence of pakchoi decreased bioavailable Pb and Cr concentrations in soil by 46%, which elevated to 76% for Pb and 72% for Cr post-inoculation with W18. Furthermore, W18 enhanced Pb uptake in pakchoi roots, increasing the bioconcentration factor by over 1.5 times and large macroaggregates (>2 mm) formation exceeded 75%. Overall, this study highlights Kosakonia sp. W18's multifunctional abilities to promote pakchoi growth and improve its effectiveness in phytoremediation of heavy metals in contaminated soils.
40064342	The primary role of phosphate-metal- natural organic matter (humic) ternary complexes as drivers of long-term phosphorus plant nutrition in acidic soils.	Several studies have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) can form stable complexes in soil and soil solution, with some fractions of natural organic matter (NOM), mainly humic substances, through metal bridges. However, the role of these types of complexes in plant phosphorus (P) nutrition remains unclear. On the other hand, Pi in acidic soils is rapidly absorbed and fixed, becoming unavailable for plants. In this framework, this study aims to unveil the role of Pi-metal-NOM (humic) complexes in plant P nutrition in acidic soils. To this end, we have selected nine acidic soils from Spain with different soil properties and nutrient availability. On these soils, we cultivated wheat (Triticum aestirum L., cv Fiel) for successive harvests until no new sprouts appeared. Pi fractions were characterized using two complementary Pi sequencing analyses adapted to acidic soils. The results showed that Pi-metal-NOM (humic) complexes are mainly extracted by oxalate-pH3 after extracting the more labile forms of Pi. Likewise, correlation and principal component analysis studies showed that the Pi extracted with water plus resin is linked to short-term wheat P-nutrition. On the contrary, the Pi extracted with oxalate (pH 3) (after extracting the more labile fraction of Pi) that contains the main fraction of Pi-metal-NOM (humic) complexes is mainly linked to long-term wheat P-nutrition. This fact indicates that the addition of humified organic matter to acidic soils can significantly improve the fraction of potentially available P for crops.
40064231	Community structure and metabolic potentials of keystone taxa and their associated bacteriophages within rice root endophytic microbiome in response to metal(loid)s contamination.	Heavy metal (HM) contamination of agricultural products is of global environmental concern as it directly threatened the food safety. Plant-associated microbiome, particularly endophytic microbiome, hold the potential for mitigating HM stress as well as promoting plant growth. The metabolic potentials of the endophytes, especially those under the HM stresses, have not been well addressed. Rice, a major staple food worldwide, is more vulnerable to HM contamination compared to other crops and therefore requires special attentions. Therefore, this study selected rice as the target plants. Geochemical analysis and amplicon sequencing were combined to characterize the rice root endophytic bacterial communities and identify keystone taxa in two HM-contaminated rice fields. Metagenomic analysis was employed to investigate the metabolic potentials of these keystone taxa. Burkholderiales and Rhizobiales were identified as predominant keystone taxa. The metagenome-assembled genome (MAG)s associated with these keystone populations suggested that they possessed diverse genetic potentials related to metal resistance and transformation (e.g., As resistance and cycling, V reduction, Cr efflux and reduction), and plant growth promotion (nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, oxidative stress resistance, indole-3-acetic acid, and siderophore production). Moreover, bacteriophages encoding auxiliary metabolism genes (AMGs) associated with the HM resistance as well as nitrogen and phosphate acquisition were identified, suggesting that these phages may contribute to these crucial biogeochemical processes within rice roots. The current findings revealed the beneficial roles of rice endophytic keystone taxa and their associated bacteriophages within HM-contaminated rice root endophytic microbiome, which may provide valuable insights on future applications of employing root microbiome for safety management of agriculture productions.
40064090	Green synthesized MgO combined with dielectric barrier discharge plasma enhanced phosphorus (P) recovery from livestock wastewater: A dual approach for management of wastewater and P resources.	Phosphorus (P) recovery from wastewater using integrated techniques i.e., adsorption combined with advanced oxidation technologies is a novel approach for cleaning wastewater and preventing eutrophication. This approach, however, has not been extensively studied, particularly in the context of real wastewater applications. In this study, a green biomass-based sol-gel method was developed using potato starch (PS) and MgCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O to synthesize MgO (PS-MgO). The unique synthesis method resulted in PS-MgO composed predominantly of spherical particles with an average size of about 103 nm and exhibited superior P adsorption performance compared to commercial MgO materials (GH-MgO and AD-MgO). The Langmuir maximum P adsorption capacity (mg/g) of the PS-MgO was 429.4, while that of the commercial GH-MgO and AD-MgO was 341.3 and 421.7, respectively, at the solution pH 7.0. The kinetic model fitting demonstrated that the adsorption rate of PS-MgO was faster than the two commercial MgOs. Importantly, PS-MgO can maintain a high P adsorption capacity across a wide pH range (425 mg/g at pH 5.0 and 369 mg/g at pH 11.0), whereas the P adsorption capacities of GH-MgO (153 at pH 5.0 and 297 at pH 11.0) and AD-MgO (422 at pH 5.0 and 200 at pH 11.0) were more pH-dependent. In addition, PS-MgO exhibits high selectivity for P capture in solutions containing coexisting ions, and the P-loaded PS-MgO can efficiently release P through acid or base treatment, highlighting its potential for reuse as a fertilizer. To enhance P recovery from real livestock wastewater, the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma technology was combined with MgO adsorption. The P recovery capacity of MgOs from livestock wastewater increased 1.4-1.7 times after DBD plasma treatment, attributed to the degradation of aromatic proteins and microbial metabolites. These findings provide new insights into the design of efficient and environmentally friendly materials for P recovery, while also demonstrating the potential of integrating advanced oxidation technologies with adsorption processes.
40064088	Grapevines and trees: A biodiversity study of microbiomes in an established temperate agroforestry system.	Biodiversity is threatened particularly in perennial crop cultivation such as fruit trees or grapevines. If established, agroforestry has the potential to increase biodiversity by providing a higher habitat heterogeneity at the example of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Riesling) cultivated together with oak or poplar trees for 12 years. Together with the rhizosphere microbiome, the root metabolome was quantified as an indicator of root exudation. Since the root metabolome does not fully align with the exudate metabolome, we are using the root metabolome as a proxy for the exudate metabolome. The results reveal that co-cultivation of grapevine with trees reduces the nutrient availability in the soil and changes the root metabolome of both, grapevine and trees with a more distinct effect of trees on grapevine than vice versa, particularly for oak. Apparently, root-to-root signalling takes place between trees and grapevine. Co-cultivation of grapevine and oak trees also enhanced the alpha diversity of the microbiome. Correlation analysis revealed strong positive correlations between distinct microbial families and metabolites enriched in the roots of Riesling. Thus, microbiome analyses support the view that root-to-root interaction in mixed cultivation of grapevine with trees is mediated by root exudation.
40064086	Enriched anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation for mitigating methane emissions in rainfed systems and climate-neutral rice production.	This study demonstrated the effectiveness of enriched anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation in reducing methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from rice cultivation while improving soil fertility and rice productivity. The enriched consortium from cattle farm effluent, dominated by Acinetobacter (65.5%) and containing both types I (Methylosarcina, Methylomagnum, and Methyloversatilis) and II (Methylocystis) methanotrophs, exhibited high methane oxidation rates (V<sub>max</sub> 45.70 ± 13.71 μmol-CH<sub>4</sub>⋅g<sup>-1</sup>⋅h<sup>-1</sup> and K<sub>m</sub> 16.50 ± 4.95 μM). The optimal inoculum size for soil application was 0.2 L⋅m<sup>-2</sup> (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5), resulting in a CH<sub>4</sub> reduction efficiency of 74.30 ± 3.56%. In rice pot experiments, the anoxic methanotrophic consortium with an inoculum size of 0.2 L⋅m<sup>-2</sup> reduced methane emissions by 79.32 ± 3.96% without fertilizer and 29.22 ± 1.45% and 46.81 ± 1.87% when combined with organic and chemical fertilizers, respectively. The field-scale evaluation revealed that combined soil and irrigation water application with anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation was the most effective, reducing seasonal methane emissions from 32.8 ± 4.2 to 9.3 ± 1.5 g-CH<sub>4</sub>·m<sup>-2</sup> and methane flux from 15.2 ± 2.1 to 4.3 ± 0.8 mg-CH<sub>4</sub>·m<sup>-2</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>, representing a 71.7 ± 0.4% reduction. This method also increased plant height (6.5%) and tiller number (26.4%). The combined application method also resulted in the highest soil nutrient levels (96.1 mg-N·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil, 21.8 mg-P·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil, and 133.4 mg-K·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil) and increased rice yield by 14.7% (975 g⋅m<sup>-2</sup>). These findings demonstrate that anoxic methanotrophic consortium augmentation is a sustainable approach to mitigate methane emissions and improve rice productivity, emphasizing the importance of integrating this strategy into rice cultivation practices in rainfed lowland areas.
40064085	Forest fire susceptibility mapping using multi-criteria decision making and machine learning models in the Western Ghats of India.	Forest fires have significantly increased over the last decade due to shifts in rainfall patterns, warmer summers, and long spells of dry weather events in the coastal regions. Assessment of susceptibility to forest fires has become an important management tool for damage control before the occurrence of fires, which often spread very rapidly. In this context, the current study was undertaken with the aim to map forest areas susceptible to fire in the state of Goa (India) using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system () derived variables through an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and machine learning techniques namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Nine variables viz. Elevation (m), slope (%), aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), forest cover types, average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to road (m), distance to settlement (m), and land surface temperature (LST, °C) were used to map susceptible areas in five different classes. The map classified forest areas into different susceptibility levels, with significant variations observed across different models. The study emphasized the importance of machine learning techniques for forest management and fire risk assessment. Validation of the susceptibility map showed excellent performance of the models, with the random forest model exhibiting the best performance. The forest fire susceptibility map generated using RF indicated that a large area (44.15%) of forest cover in Goa is very highly susceptible to fire followed by highly susceptible (21.35%) and a moderately susceptible area of 15.62%. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis using RF identified forest type, distance from settlement, slope and NDVI as important variables affecting forest fire susceptibility. In the study area, an extended dry period with no post-monsoon rainfall makes the forest highly susceptible to fire. In view of the large area potentially susceptible to forest fire, there is an urgent need to implement preventive measures for fire control in the identified zones.
40064082	Transformational fixation of Cr(VI) during microwave-enhanced reduction of soil iron minerals by tea polyphenols.	Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] presents substantial environmental and health hazards due to its pronounced toxicity and mobility in soils. Traditional chemical reduction methods for Cr(VI) are often inadequate for treating chromium-contaminated soils, as they may fail to fully reduce Cr(VI), leading to incomplete remediation. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop more efficient and environmentally sustainable methods for the treatment of hexavalent chromium. This study explores an innovative approach using microwave-enhanced reduction of soil iron minerals facilitated by tea polyphenols to achieve transformational fixation of Cr(VI). The microwave-assisted treatment (0.5 wt% TP combined with MW at 700 W for 10 min) significantly reduced Cr(VI) concentrations in iron-rich soil from 363.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 0.3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, achieving a removal rate of 99.9%, compared to TP treatment alone (0.5 wt%). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that the enhanced removal efficiency of Cr(VI) by microwave-assisted tea polyphenols is attributable to the accelerated reduction of soil iron minerals by the polyphenols. Furthermore, microwave enhancement facilitated the transformation of Cr into more stable forms, such as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Additionally, the Cr(VI) content in the treated soil remained below 3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> after 360 days of atmospheric exposure, indicating sustained immobilization. This study demonstrates that the integration of tea polyphenols with microwave irradiation constitutes a promising strategy for the remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated soils.
40064078	Environmental determinants of spatial-temporal variability in ammonia oxidizing microorganisms across diverse Chinese agricultural soils.	Numerous studies investigated the variation of soil ammonia oxidizing microorganisms along the geographic distance, but few highlighted the associated influence of agricultural practices on ammonia oxidizing communities and functions. To make up this gap, we determined the variation of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacteria (AOB), and soil nitrification within eight typical agricultural plots across China. The current study revealed significant variations in soil potential nitrification rates (PNRs) and the diversity and composition of AOA and AOB communities across various plots. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant link between soil PNRs and alpha diversity, specific AOA and AOB taxa, but no significant correlation was found with amoA gene abundance. Structural equation modeling and canonical correspondence analysis showed that factors like MAT, clay content, CEC, and soil carbon and nitrogen levels significantly influenced the diversity and composition of AOA. In contrast, AOB were more significantly impacted by soil pH and carbon- and nitrogen-related nutrients, but less associated with MAP and soil clay content. Notably, soil PNRs were found to be closely linked to AOB diversity, soil pH, and ammonium nitrogen (NH4N) levels. This research highlights the contributing role of AOB group in soil nitrification and the related driving factors from agricultural practices.
40064076	Effective microbial formulations using sustainable carriers for the remediation of plastic-affected soils.	The increasing use of mulching films in intensive agriculture, together with their inefficient end-of-life disposal, has led to a significant plastic accumulation in soils, which contributes to disrupting ecosystems. The aim of this work was to determine the ability of different sustainable carriers to harbor and introduce plastic-degrading microorganisms into contaminated soils to provide a biotechnological tool that potentially enhances plastic decontamination, ameliorating the harmful effect of this type of pollutant in soil. To this end, pure cultures and co-cultures of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas alloputida (specialized plastic-degrading strains) were added to three sustainable carriers (vermicompost, biochar, and calcium alginate beads) for the preparation of microbial formulations. After a storage period, the maintenance of cell viability and enzymatic activities related to the bioremediation potential of plastic materials of the inocula tested in the different microbial formulations (carrier + inoculant) were evaluated. The effectiveness of the formulations for plastic mineralization was tested by measuring CO2 emissions after two months. The results showed that biochar, followed by vermicompost, favored greater microbial survival (107 CFU g-1), while alginate formulations showed variable cell viability results, from 107 to 104 CFU g-1. Biochar also excelled in maintaining enzymatic activities related to plastic degradation, achieving the expression of 100% of the tested enzymes. Additionally, biochar-based formulations applied to soils contaminated with LLDPE plastic showed the highest mineralization rates, with statistically significant differences compared to the plastic-free control. These results lay the foundation for the development of new plastic decontamination technologies paving the way for the sustainable treatment of polluting and recalcitrant materials such as plastic.
40064053	Microplastics in agricultural soils following sewage sludge applications: Evidence from a 25-year study.	Sewage sludges applied to agricultural soils are sources of microplastic pollution, however, little is known about the accumulation, persistence, or degradation of these microplastics over time. This is the first study to provide long-term, high temporal resolution quantitative evidence of microplastics in agricultural soils following sewage sludge application. The abundance and degradation of microplastics was assessed in soils sampled biennially from an experimental field over a 25-year period managed under an improved grassland regime following the application of five different sewage sludges. The sludges contained different microplastic compositions reflecting the different sources of the sludges. Microplastic abundance increased by 723-1445% following sewage sludge applications (p < 0.05) and remained constant over time (22 years and possibly beyond) (p > 0.05). All sludges predominantly added white/transparent microfibres to soil. Microfilms, microfibres, and fragments were most susceptible to degradation, potentially creating micro(nano)plastics. Of note was the discoloration of coloured microfibres, which may be environmentally hazardous due to the toxicity of textile dyes in soil ecosystems. We also found that plastic composition could be used to trace its source. This evidence is useful in informing regulation on sewage sludge use and management, and in assessing the fate and impact of microplastics in soil.
40063867	Impact of mass drug administration with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole for lymphatic filariasis on hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis infections in Papua New Guinea.	Persons with lymphatic filariasis (LF) are often co-infected with soil-transmitted helminths. A single co-administered dose of ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (IDA) is recommended by WHO for mass drug administration (MDA) for LF instead of diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (DA) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). We compared the effectiveness of a single round of MDA with IDA or DA on hookworm and strongyloidiasis in PNG.
40063820	A global estimate of multiecosystem photosynthesis losses under microplastic pollution.	Understanding how ecosystems respond to ubiquitous microplastic (MP) pollution is crucial for ensuring global food security. Here, we conduct a multiecosystem meta-analysis of 3,286 data points and reveal that MP exposure leads to a global reduction in photosynthesis of 7.05 to 12.12% in terrestrial plants, marine algae, and freshwater algae. These reductions align with those estimated by a constructed machine learning model using current MP pollution levels, showing that MP exposure reduces the chlorophyll content of photoautotrophs by 10.96 to 12.84%. Model estimates based on the identified MP-photosynthesis nexus indicate annual global losses of 4.11 to 13.52% (109.73 to 360.87 MT·y<sup>-1</sup>) for main crops and 0.31 to 7.24% (147.52 to 3415.11 MT C·y<sup>-1</sup>) for global aquatic net primary productivity induced by MPs. Under scenarios of efficient plastic mitigation, e.g., a ~13% global reduction in environmental MP levels, the MP-induced photosynthesis losses are estimated to decrease by ~30%, avoiding a global loss of 22.15 to 115.73 MT·y<sup>-1</sup> in main crop production and 0.32 to 7.39 MT·y<sup>-1</sup> in seafood production. These findings underscore the urgency of integrating plastic mitigation into global hunger and sustainability initiatives.
40063678	Environmental and Biological Drivers of Root Exudation.	Root exudation is the process by which plants release organic and inorganic metabolites from their roots into the surrounding soil. Root exudation is a dynamic process and shapes plant-environment interactions at the root-soil interface. Little is known about the biological and environmental factors that shape the exuded metabolome, hereafter referred to as the exudome, despite its importance in structuring soil processes. Here, we emphasize plant physiological and morphological traits that modulate the exudome in a species- and developmental stage-specific manner. We further discuss how environmental factors drive exudation processes. We highlight evidence of a potential circadian exudation rhythm and further illustrate how the physical (temperature, structure), chemical (moisture, pH, nutrients, pollutants), and biological (micro- and macrofauna) properties of soil alter the root exudome composition and release patterns. Exploring the factors that directly or indirectly modulate exudation will enhance our understanding of how this dynamic process mediates plant-environment interactions.
40063669	<i>Novosphingobium rhizovicinum</i> sp. nov. and <i>Novosphingobium kalidii</i> sp. nov., two novel species isolated from rhizosphere soil and a root of halophyte <i>Kalidium cuspidatum</i>.	Two bacteria, designated strain M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup>, were isolated from rhizosphere soil and a root of <i>Kalidium cuspidatum</i> in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strains M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup> were tightly clustered and both shared the highest 16S rRNA gene similarities (98.6 and 98.5 %) to <i>Novosphingobium fluoreni</i> ACCC 19180<sup>T</sup> and less than 97.8% similarities with all other current type strains. Values of the digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), the average nucleotide identity based on the blast method (ANIb) and the average amino acid identity (AAI) of the two strains and their closely related species were 32.2, 79.0, and 84.5%, which were lower than the threshold values (70% for dDDH, 95% for ANIb and 95% for AAI). The major fatty acids of strains M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup> were C<sub>18 : 1</sub> <i> ω7</i>c and summed feature 3 (C<sub>16 : 1</sub> <i> ω6</i>c and/or C<sub>16 : 1</sub> <i> ω7</i>c). The only quinone was ubiquinone-10. Spermidine was the predominant polyamine. The genomic DNA G+C contents for strain M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup> were 62.4 and 62.7%. The phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic results supported that strains M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> and RD2P27<sup>T</sup> could be identified as two novel species within the genus <i>Novosphingobium</i>, for which the name <i>Novosphingobium rhizovicinum</i> sp. nov. and <i>Novosphingobium kalidii</i> sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains are <i>N. rhizovicinum</i> M1R2S20<sup>T</sup> (=CGMCC 1.62060<sup>T</sup>=KCTC 8106<sup>T</sup>) and <i>N. kalidii</i> RD2P27<sup>T</sup> (=CGMCC 1.62131<sup>T</sup>=KCTC 8107<sup>T</sup>).
40063668	<i>Rhodococcus parequi</i> sp. nov., a new species isolated from equine farm soil closely related to the pathogen <i>Rhodococcus equi</i>.	We present the description of the new species, <i>Rhodococcus parequi</i>, found during phylogenomic investigations of a global collection of strains identified as <i>Rhodococcus</i> (<i>Prescottella</i>) <i>equi</i>. Strain PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> was isolated from horse-breeding farm soil in Normandy, France, and was indistinguishable from <i>R. equi</i> based on the usual identification tests. Whole-genome phylogenetic analyses located PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> in the same <i>Rhodococcus</i> sublineage as <i>R. equi</i>, together with <i>Rhodococcus agglutinans</i>, <i>Rhodococcus defluvii</i>, <i>Rhodococcus soli</i>, <i>Rhodococcus subtropicus</i>, <i>Rhodococcus spongiicola</i> and <i>Rhodococcus xishaensis</i>. PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> is most closely related to, but sufficiently distinct from, <i>R. equi</i> DSM 20307 <sup>T</sup> to be considered a separate species. The average nt identity (ANI) and average aa identity (AAI) values are 88.60% and 92.35, respectively, well below the species cutoff. The PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> draft genome is ~5.3 Mb in size with 68.98% G+C mol content. PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> is strictly aerobic and non-motile and produces smooth, creamy to buff-coloured colonies very similar to those of <i>R. equi</i>. It phenotypically differs from the latter by the ability to grow at 5 °C, a strongly positive urease test at 24 h and specificities in the carbon and nitrogen source utilization profile as determined by phenotype microarray screens. Our data indicate that PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> belongs to a novel species, for which the name <i>Rhodococcus parequi</i> sp. nov. is proposed. <i>R. parequi</i> was avirulent in macrophage infection assays and is assumed to be non-pathogenic. The type strain is PAM 2766<sup>T</sup> (=CETC 30995<sup>T</sup>=NCTC 14987<sup>T</sup>).
40063666	<i>Microbacterium candidum</i> sp. nov. and <i>Microbacterium capsulatum</i> sp. nov., isolated from waste landfill.	Two Gram-stain-positive, oxidase-negative, non-motile and rod-shaped strains (ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup>) were isolated from a waste landfill in Shanghai, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains are associated with members of the genus <i>Microbacterium</i>. Strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> were most closely related to <i>Microbacterium rhizosphaerae</i> JCM 31396<sup>T</sup> and <i>Microbacterium bovistercoris</i> CCTCC AA 2018025<sup>T</sup> with 98.5 and 98.0% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, respectively. The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> were 69.5 and 70.5 mol %, respectively. Strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> exhibited the highest average nucleotide identity values of 81.7 and 85.3% against their closest relatives <i>Microbacterium xylanilyticum</i> JCM 13591<sup>T</sup> and <i>M. rhizosphaerae</i> JCM 31396<sup>T</sup>, respectively. Corresponding digital DNA-DNA hybridization values were 25.1 and 30.9%, respectively. Strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> grew optimally at pH 7.0 and 28 °C on Reasoner's 2A. Strain ASV81<sup>T</sup> produced capsules, but ASV49<sup>T</sup> did not. Both isolates shared the following chemotaxonomic characteristics in common: the major fatty acids of anteiso-C<sub>15 : 0</sub>, iso-C<sub>16 : 0</sub> and anteiso-C<sub>17 : 0</sub>; the respiratory quinones of MK-11, MK-12, MK-13 and MK-10; the polar lipids of diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol; and the cell wall amino acids of ornithine, alanine, glycine and glutamic acid. Based on the genomic, phenotypic and chemical characteristics, strains ASV49<sup>T</sup> and ASV81<sup>T</sup> represent two novel species of the genus <i>Microbacterium</i>, for which the names <i>Microbacterium candidum</i> sp. nov. and <i>Microbacterium capsulatum</i> sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains are ASV49<sup>T</sup> (=GDMCC 1.4109<sup>T</sup>=JCM 36480<sup>T</sup>) and ASV81<sup>T</sup> (=GDMCC 1.4110<sup>T</sup>=JCM 36481<sup>T</sup>), respectively.
40063625	Numerical simulation analysis of pile-soil interaction under earthquake action.	Pile foundation is a commonly recognized form of foundation, and earthquakes are a common seismic damage phenomenon. Accidents resulting from reduction in pile bearing capacity due to earthquakes pose a great threat to people's lives and safety. This article investigates the interaction between soil and piles under earthquake action. Utilizing the MIDAS GTS NX finite element software, the vertical bearing characteristics of piles under earthquake action are studied. Obtained acceleration of piles, pile settlement, pile axial force, pile top horizontal displacement, soil pore water pressure, and pore pressure ratio under different earthquake magnitudes. The research results indicate that as the depth increases, the acceleration at the pile top is significantly greater than that at the pile bottom, with an average increase of 20% in acceleration at three different earthquake magnitudes; Both the beginning of the pore pressure ratio growth and the ultimate reaching of its stable pore pressure ratio coincide with a rise in earthquake magnitude. Additionally, the axial force of the pile body also increases with the magnitude of the earthquake, and the maximum axial force of the pile body can increase by 40% at the same time. Simultaneously, the magnitude of the earthquake influences both the displacement of the pile body and the settling of the pile top. This article can provide reference for pile foundation design and engineering construction in liquefaction sites.
40063319	Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in Saudi Arabia: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) pose a significant public health challenge in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), where epidemiological data remain scarce. These diseases disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, leading to chronic morbidity and economic burdens. Understanding their distribution and burden is crucial for effective public health interventions. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the prevalence, distribution, and etiological patterns of NTDs in KSA, identifying key research gaps and informing future policy directions. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on peer-reviewed studies published between 1950 and 2024 that investigated NTDs in humans in KSA. Ninety-four articles met the inclusion criteria. The majority (69.15%, n = 65) were published after 2010, with most studies concentrated in the western (n = 35, 37.23%) and southwestern (n = 15, 15.96%) regions, areas known for environmental and socioeconomic factors that may contribute to disease transmission. Protozoal NTDs were the most frequently reported (n = 28, 29.78%), followed by viral (n = 26, 27.66%), helminthic (n = 18, 19.15%), and ectoparasitic (n = 9, 9.57%) infections. Bacterial (n = 5, 5.32%), fungal (n = 4, 4.26%), and venom-related (n = 4, 4.26%) NTDs were less commonly reported. Meta-analysis yielded pooled prevalence estimates of leishmaniasis at 0.59 (95% CI: 0.38-0.77, I² = 94.2%) and dengue at 0.20 (95% CI: 0.05-0.53, I² = 98.8%), highlighting a substantial disease burden and high heterogeneity among studies. The findings emphasize the urgent need for strengthened national surveillance, improved diagnostic capacity, and region-specific interventions to control NTDs in KSA. Future research should focus on underrepresented regions, expand community-based epidemiological studies, and integrate cross-border surveillance strategies to mitigate disease importation risks. By addressing these gaps, KSA can enhance its preparedness and contribute to global NTD elimination efforts.
40063245	Genome-wide association mapping for the identification of stripe rust resistance loci in US hard winter wheat.	The GWAS and testing with Yr gene linked markers identified 109 loci including 40 novel loci for all-stage and adult plant stage resistance to stripe rust in 459 US contemporary hard winter wheat genotypes. Stripe rust is a destructive wheat disease, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). To identify sources of stripe rust resistance in US contemporary hard winter wheat, a panel of 459 Great Plains wheat genotypes was evaluated at the seedling stage against five US Pst races and at the adult plant stage in field environments in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Washington. The results showed that 7-14% of the genotypes were resistant to Pst races at the seedling stage, whereas 32-78% of genotypes were resistant at the adult plant stage across field environments, indicating the presence of adult plant resistance. Sixteen genotypes displayed a broad spectrum of resistance to all five Pst races and across all field environments. The panel was further genotyped using 9858 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated from multiplex restriction amplicon sequencing (MRASeq) and the functional DNA markers linked to the known stripe rust resistance (Yr) genes Yr5, Yr15, Yr17, Yr18, Yr29, Yr36, Yr40, Yr46, and QYr.tamu-2B. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using genotypic and phenotypic data, which identified 110 SNPs and the functional markers linked to Yr15 and Yr17 to be significantly associated with stripe rust response. In addition, Yr5, Yr15, Yr17, Yr18, Yr29, and QYr.tamu-2B were detected by their functional DNA markers in the panel. This study identified 40 novel loci associated with stripe rust resistance in genomic regions not previously characterized by known Yr genes. These findings offer significant opportunities to diversify and enhance stripe rust resistance in hard winter wheat.
40063217	Methodological optimization for ecotoxicological community tests with Enchytraeids-extraction procedures and sampling effort.	Enchytraeids play important roles in ecosystems, contributing to the decomposition of organic matter, given the feeding activity in the litter and the interaction with soil microorganisms, affecting the regulation, flow, and cycling of carbon and nutrients in ecosystems. Despite their ecological relevance, enchytraeids are commonly neglected in soil biodiversity assessments. To develop a methodology to assess the effects of pollutants on natural communities of enchytraeids, some methodologies require optimization. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the two extraction methods of the enchytraeid community to access their structural diversity, determine the sampling effort for each extraction method, and evaluate the survival of the specimens subjected in a post-extraction survival test. The samplings were collected in two municipalities in the South region of Brazil. In each area, two transects were established (one for the wet-hot extraction method and one for the wet-cold extraction method); each transect contained nine sampling points, and nine cores were collected. The nine cores were collected in a grid of 3 × 3 subpoints, spaced 0.3 m. The enchytraeids were identified until genus and morphospecies level. The extraction method did not influence the diversity accessed in the field. The sampling effort was positively related to the genus and morphospecies richness, with the cold extraction method requiring more samples to achieve a given fraction of species richness. Additionally, both extraction methods had similar effects on the survival of enchytraeids after extraction. These results contribute to the development of a methodology to assess the effects of pollutants on enchytraeids communities and help to fulfill the gap of knowledge about this important biological indicator.
40063119	Morphological spore-based characterisation and molecular approaches reveal comparable patterns in glomeromycotan communities.	Traditionally, characterisation and comparison of AMF communities has been carried out by morphological identification of asexual spores in soil. In recent decades, molecular methods such as soil metabarcoding have become more popular than morphological identification of spores, but direct comparisons of the efficiency of both approaches have been rare. In this study, we compared AMF communities in soil samples from vegetable farms using both morphological and molecular methods (internal transcribed spacer, ITS, markers). In addition, we performed a systematic literature search and retrieved nine studies that analysed AMF communities using both approaches in the same soil samples, mostly in agroecosystems. Our results show that AMF communities determined by morphological spore-based identification are different than those determined by molecular genetic markers, but not as often claimed. In some cases, the morphological spore-based characterisation of spores revealed more diverse glomeromycotan communities. Moreover, in several cases the spore-based methods recovered taxa that the molecular methods did not, while in other cases the opposite was observed. The field and literature-based results of this study indicate that for a comprehensive and exhaustive characterisation of AMF communities it is necessary to combine both approaches. However, if the aim is to compare communities under different environmental conditions, both approaches provide comparable patterns.
40063098	Towards quality-assured measurements of microplastics in soil using fluorescence microscopy.	Fluorescence microscopy is increasingly seen as a fast, user-friendly, and high-throughput method for detecting microplastics (MPs) in soil; however, its effectiveness across diverse MP types and soil properties remains underexplored. This study tested a fluorescence microscopy-Nile red (NR) staining approach on eight MP types, covering both biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastics, in three size ranges (≤ 150 µm, 100-250 µm, 500-1000 µm) across loamy, clayey, and sandy soils. Each sample, processed in triplicate, underwent a relatively quick and straightforward extraction procedure involving density separation, organic digestion, and NR staining, followed by fluorescence and bright-field microscopy. A new digital image analysis pipeline using Image J was developed to expedite and (semi)automate MP quantification. Recoveries ranged from 80% to 90% for MPs with a Feret diameter of 500-1000 µm, regardless of soil type. In contrast, the recovery of smaller MPs (Feret dia. ≤ 250 µm) varied depending on the soils and plastic types: recoveries for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) reached 85% in sandy soil and 90% in loamy soil, whereas those for biodegradable polybutylene adipate terephthalate/polylactic acid (PBAT/PLA) were only 60% and 10%, respectively. The lowest recovery rate was observed in clayey soil and for biodegradable plastics. The method was tested on non-agricultural soil samples, yielding a MP mean number concentration of 20.7 ± 9.0 MPs/g for MPs sized from dia. ≥ 25 µm, comparable to Fourier transform infrared (FPA-µ-FTIR) results of 13.1 ± 7.3 MPs/g (p > 0.05). We conclude that fluorescence microscopy with NR staining and automated particle quantification offers a time-efficient, reproducible, and accurate method for MP detection in light-textured soils, whereas limitations remain for reliable MP analysis in clay-dominated soils.
40062896	Evaluating the survival and removal of <i>Escherichia coli</i> from surfaces made with traditional and sustainable cement-based materials in field-relevant conditions.	Soil household floors are common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and can serve as reservoirs of enteric pathogens. Cement-based floors may interrupt pathogen transmission, but little is known about pathogen survival or removal from cement-based surfaces. This study investigated the survival of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, an indicator of fecal contamination, on cement-based surfaces and evaluated its reduction through common household activities (mopping, sweeping, and walking). We compared <i>E. coli</i> fate on three mixes: (i) ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete (used in the United States), (ii) OPC mortar (used in Bangladesh), and (iii) OPC mortar with fly ash (a sustainable alternative to the Bangladesh mix). Additionally, we compared outcomes on cement-based surfaces with and without soil and at two temperatures representing the dry and wet seasons in Bangladesh. After 4 hours on the cement-based surfaces, <i>E. coli</i> decayed more than 1.1 log<sub>10</sub>(<i>C</i>/<i>C<sub>o</sub></i>) under all conditions tested, which is significantly faster than in bulk soils. The higher temperature increased the decay rate constant (<i>P</i> = 5.56 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) while soil presence decreased it (<i>P</i> = 2.80 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Sweeping and mopping resulted in high levels of removal for all mixes, with a mean removal of 71% and 78%, respectively, versus 22% for walking. The concrete and mortar mix designs did not impact <i>E. coli</i> survival or removal (<i>P</i> > 0.20). Cement-based floors made with a fly ash mix performed similarly to traditional cement-based floors, supporting their potential use as a more sustainable intervention to reduce fecal contamination in rural LMIC household settings.
40062895	No-tillage systems promote bacterial photosynthetic gene expression in low carbon, semi-arid surface soils.	Managing soils in semi-arid agricultural croplands generally focuses on reducing wind erosion, increasing fertility, and storing carbon. Thus, converting conventionally tilled systems to no-tillage and cover-cropped systems are often the first steps towards a conservation management approach across the growing area of semi-arid croplands. From a soil biological perspective, introducing cover crops to semi-arid soils has been shown to alter microbial community structure, which may lead to changes in the biogeochemical pathways expressed in these soils. In this study, we examined the impact of single-species wheat cover cropping and no-tillage on microbial gene expression after 4 and 5 years of implementation. We sequenced the metatranscriptomes of three production systems with varying levels of conservation management: conventional tillage winter fallow, no-tillage winter fallow, and no-tillage with a winter wheat cover crop. Removing tillage was the biggest factor altering microbial gene expression in this study, specifically resulting in upregulation of several photosystem-associated functions. These functions were taxonomically linked to organisms that make up the early stages of biological soil crusts, which may introduce additional benefits to these semi-arid agricultural systems beyond a reduction in wind erosion. Implementing a cover crop did not clearly alter gene expression beyond the effect of tillage removal; however, it did indicate a potential to reduce fungal disease incidence in 1 year of the study. These alterations of microbial activities and selection for potentially beneficial functions should be considered and further studied to aid in maintaining sustainable croplands for our changing climate.IMPORTANCEEliminating tillage from semi-arid agricultural soils has the potential to significantly alter the activities of the soil bacterial community compared with conventionally tilled soils. A major driver of this change was the activities of biological soil crust forming organisms that can provide several environmental benefits to the soil ecosystem beyond the typically associated benefits of conservation management. Furthermore, this study revealed that the implementation of a cover crop regime on no-tillage soils does not confer a major change in the function of the organisms present. Overall, the study reported here reveals that soil management practices aimed at reducing wind erosion and improving sustainability will positively impact the function of the microbial community and suggests that future investigations into the consequences of these functional changes may provide valuable services to these agricultural ecosystems.
40062894	A <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> strain with a substantially smaller genome retains the core metabolic versatility of its genus.	<i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> are a group of phototrophic microbes with a marked metabolic versatility and flexibility that underpins their potential use in the production of value-added products, bioremediation, and plant growth promotion. Members of this group have an average genome size of about 5.5 Mb, but two closely related strains have genome sizes of about 4.0 Mb. To identify the types of genes missing in a reduced genome strain, we compared strain DSM127 with other <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> isolates at the genomic and phenotypic levels. We found that DSM127 can grow as well as other members of the <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> genus and retains most of their metabolic versatility, but it has many fewer genes associated with high-affinity transport of nutrients, iron uptake, nitrogen metabolism, and biodegradation of aromatic compounds. This analysis indicates genes that can be deleted in genome reduction campaigns and suggests that DSM127 could be a favorable choice for biotechnology applications using <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> or as a strain that can be engineered further to reside in a specialized natural environment.IMPORTANCE<i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> are a cohort of phototrophic bacteria with broad metabolic versatility. Members of this group are present in diverse soil and water environments, and some strains are found associated with plants and have plant growth-promoting activity. Motivated by the idea that it may be possible to design bacteria with reduced genomes that can survive well only in a specific environment or that may be more metabolically efficient, we compared <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> strains with typical genome sizes of about 5.5 Mb to a strain with a reduced genome size of 4.0 Mb. From this, we concluded that metabolic versatility is part of the identity of the <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i> group, but high-affinity transport genes and genes of apparent redundant function can be dispensed with.
40062709	Enhancing Bacterial Phenotype Classification Through the Integration of Autogating and Automated Machine Learning in Flow Cytometric Analysis.	Although flow cytometry produces reliable results, the data processing from gating to fingerprinting is prone to subjective bias. Here, we integrated autogating with Automated Machine Learning in flow cytometry to enhance the classification of bacterial phenotypes. We analyzed six bacterial strains prevalent in the soil and groundwater-Bacillus subtilis, Burkholderia thailandensis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas stutzeri. Using the H2O-AutoML framework, we applied gradient-boosting machine (GBM) models to classify bacteria across different metabolic phases. Our results demonstrated an overall classification accuracy of 82.34% for GBM. Notably, accuracy varied across metabolic phases, with the highest observed during the late log (88.06%), lag (88.43%), and early log phases (89.37%), whereas the stationary phase showed a slightly lower accuracy of 80.73%. P. stutzeri exhibited consistently high sensitivity and specificity across all the phases, which indicated that it was the most distinctly identifiable strain. In contrast, E. coli showed low sensitivity, particularly in the stationary phase, which indicated challenges in its classification. Overall, this study with incorporating autogating and the AutoML framework, substantially reduces subjective biases and enhances the reproducibility and accuracy of microbial classification. Our methodology offers a robust framework for microbial classification in flow cytometric analysis, paving the way for more precise and comprehensive analyses of microbial ecology.
40062550	The Response of Carbon Uptake to Soil Moisture Stress: Adaptation to Climatic Aridity.	The coupling between carbon uptake and water loss through stomata implies that gross primary production (GPP) can be limited by soil water availability through reduced leaf area and/or stomatal conductance. Ecosystem and land-surface models commonly assume that GPP is highest under well-watered conditions and apply a stress function to reduce GPP as soil moisture declines. Optimality considerations, however, suggest that the stress function should depend on climatic aridity: ecosystems adapted to more arid climates should use water more conservatively when soil moisture is high, but maintain unchanged GPP down to a lower critical soil-moisture threshold. We use eddy-covariance flux data to test this hypothesis. We investigate how the light-use efficiency (LUE) of GPP depends on soil moisture across ecosystems representing a wide range of climatic aridity. 'Well-watered' GPP is estimated using the sub-daily P model, a first-principles LUE model driven by atmospheric data and remotely sensed vegetation cover. Breakpoint regression is used to relate daily β(θ) (the ratio of flux data-derived GPP to modelled well-watered GPP) to soil moisture estimated via a generic water balance model. The resulting piecewise function describing β(θ) varies with aridity, as hypothesised. Unstressed LUE, even when soil moisture is high, declines with increasing aridity index (AI). So does the critical soil-moisture threshold. Moreover, for any AI value, there exists a soil moisture level at which β(θ) is maximised. This level declines as AI increases. This behaviour is captured by universal non-linear functions relating both unstressed LUE and the critical soil-moisture threshold to AI. Applying these aridity-based functions to predict the site-level response of LUE to soil moisture substantially improves GPP simulation under both water-stressed and unstressed conditions, suggesting a route towards a robust, universal model representation of the effects of low soil moisture on leaf-level photosynthesis.
40062422	<i>Rhodotorula tropicalis</i> sp. nov., a novel red yeast of the order Sporidiobolales isolated from Thailand, Indonesia and Japan.	Six yeast strains, representing a novel anamorphic species of the genus <i>Rhodotorula</i>, were investigated in this study. Among them, three strains, SU21, SU16 and SU14, were obtained from three different fruiting bodies of wild mushrooms in Thailand. One strain (ISM36-1) was isolated from soil in Japan, and two strains were isolated from soil (14Y315) and leaf litter (Y15Kr055) collected in Indonesia. Analysis of the sequences of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions showed that the six strains were identical or differed by only one nt substitution in both the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene and the ITS regions. <i>Rhodotorula paludigena</i> CBS 6566<sup>T</sup> was the most closely related species but with 23-24 nt substitutions in the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene and 38-39 nt substitutions in the ITS regions. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated sequences of the ITS regions and D1/D2 domain showed that these strains represent a single species of the <i>Rhodotorula</i> clade that is distinct from other recognized species of the genus. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characteristics, these six strains were assigned to a novel species of the genus <i>Rhodotorula</i>, although sexual reproduction was not observed. The name, <i>Rhodotorula tropicalis</i> sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate the six strains. The holotype is TBRC 14874<sup>T</sup> and the ex-type culture is PYCC 8913 (=SU21). The MycoBank number of the novel species is MB 856795.
40062368	Building Climate-Resilient Crops: Genetic, Environmental, and Technological Strategies for Heat and Drought Stress Tolerance.	Global crop production faces increasing threats from the rise in frequency, duration, and intensity of drought and heat stress events due to climate change. Most staple food crops, including wheat, rice, soybean, and corn that provide over half of the world's caloric intake, are not well-adapted to withstand heat or drought. Efforts to breed or engineer stress-tolerant crops have had limited success due to the complexity of tolerance mechanisms and the variability of agricultural environments. Effective solutions require a shift towards fundamental research that incorporates realistic agricultural settings and focuses on practical outcomes for farmers.

40062339	Faecal sludge pyrolysis as a circular economic approach to waste management and nutrient recovery.	The disposal of faecal sludge from non-networked sanitation amenities leads to contamination of the surrounding environment and increasing public health problems across developing countries. Permanent solutions to deal with faecal sludge are required to solve the sanitation crisis and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030. Full-scale pyrolysis of faecal sludge in developing countries is fast becoming a safe and long-term option. Pyrolysis not only eliminates pathogens within the sludge but produces biochar as an end product which has the potential as a soil amendment to increase crop yield. In general, faecal sludge biochars have high pH values, high ash contents, and high macro-and micronutrient concentrations. Compared to biochar from lignocellulosic materials, faecal sludge biochar contains less carbon and exhibits lower porosities, and lower surface areas. However, evaluating the properties of faecal sludge biochar is difficult due to the different technologies used in collection, storage, and transportation of the feedstock. Differences in faecal sludge characteristics based on location, climate, age of the sludge, type of sanitation technology and seasonality are also factors in determining the properties of faecal sludge biochars. These factors contribute to the difficulty in describing faecal sludge biochar properties in general terms, and there is an argument to be made that characteristics of large-scale faecal sludge biochar should be determined on a case-by-case basis. The conclusion of this review is that future research should concentrate on short-term and long-term field studies of faecal sludge biochar application to different soil types.
40062284	Improving the accuracy of soil texture determination using pH and electro conductivity values with ultrasound penetration-based digital soil texture analyzer.	Soil texture analysis is critical for advancing agricultural productivity, ensuring environmental sustainability, and maintaining ecosystem balance. Traditional sedimentation-based methods, such as the hydrometer technique, are fast and practical but prone to inaccuracies due to the effects of water-soluble substances. This study focuses on the practical framework of integrating pH (potential of hydrogen) and EC (electrical conductivity), as indicators of dissolved substances that influence soil texture estimation. Using the Ultrasound Penetration-based Digital Soil Texture Analyzer (USTA), this research combined ultrasound time series data with pH and EC measurements to predict sand, silt, and clay ratios through machine learning methods-support vector regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). Simulations showed that RF yielded the best results, improving R<sup>2</sup> values to 0.52, 0.33, and 0.31 for sand, silt, and clay, respectively. The enhanced model performance demonstrates the viability of integrating pH and EC with advanced machine learning techniques to improve soil texture analysis accuracy. These findings suggest that automated systems like USTA, with modular pH and EC sensors, can provide cost-effective, efficient alternatives to traditional methods, offering practical implications for soil management and agricultural optimization.
40062238	The technique of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) based on the triangular q-rung fuzzy numbers (TR-q-ROFNS) with applications in best African coffee brand selection.	The African coffee market offers a rich and diverse range of coffee profiles. The coffee producers of Africa face numerous challenges like climate change, market fluctuations, diseases, soil degradation and limited access to finance. These challenges badly affect their productivity, quality and livelihood. There are different factors like social and cultural, which can affect the coffee production. This study aims to develop multi criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and their applications in coffee market specifically in identifying factors influencing consumers' coffee brand preferences in South Africa, which is known for its vibrant coffee culture. For this purpose, first we developed the technique of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in the environment of triangular q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers. The triangular q-rung fuzzy numbers can effectively handle the uncertainity. The AHP technique has widely been used in decision making due to its flexibility in assigning weights and dealing with vagueness. The weights of critera plays a very important role in an MCDM problem. The development of AHP technique in triangular q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment can improve the decision making (DM) by handling vagueness in data and by using the most appropriate weights. Furthermore this new proposed method improves accuracy and minimize the information loss. The newly peoposed method is applied to different MCDM problems and comparative analysis is conducted to check the validity of results.
40061920	Nanoparticles for treatment of cadmium-contaminated cocoa-growing soils and beans: Performance on metal immobilization and removal.	Some areas of tropical soils where cocoa grows contain high cadmium (Cd) concentrations. The cocoa plant's need for nutrition causes the reticular system to uptake the toxic metal, translocate it, and accumulate it in roots, stems, and other edible parts such as cocoa beans and shells, threatening the health of cocoa consumers. To cope with this difficulty, different treatments have been applied to cadmium-contaminated soils, but they showed limited success. In this study, we prepared multicomponent nanoparticles (MCNPs) to treat cocoa soils in fixed-bed columns and field tests. Also, MCNPs were mixed with two varieties of cocoa beans, CNN51 and Fino de Aromain, during the fermentation, aiming to capture the cadmium. Our field investigations began by collecting soil samples from three Ecuadorian cocoa-producing farms to determine their physicochemical properties, cadmium, and iron contents. A few weeks later, a home-built prototype was installed in a cocoa plantation to fabricate the nanomaterials using commercial-grade chemicals and rainwater. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images showed MCNPs with an average size of 65.21 nm and the formation of chain-like aggregates. In contrast, MCNPs size was 76.6 nm, measured with Dispersed Light Scattering (DLS). The chemical composition of MCNPs was 90.7 % Fe0 and 1.81 % sulfur (S), analyzed by energy dispersal X-ray (EDX) and confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer measurements. Regarding the treatments, for the fixed-bed column tests, 0.28-1.08 L/kg was dosed into the soil, while for field treatments, 250, 500, and 835 mL/min MCNPs were injected in soil areas of 5 m<sup>2</sup> surrounding each cocoa tree (0.5-4.5 mg MCNPs/kg soil) at depths between 0 and 5 cm. Test results revealed that the procedure applied in the field did not reproduce the metal's immobilization (∼22 %) as in the fixed-bed columns (∼80 %). Moreover, cadmium removal was ∼20 % and ∼75 % after treating CCN51 and Fino de Aroma cocoa beans with 0.112 kg MCNPs/kg in the fermentation on-site and 0.034 kg MCNPs/kg in the laboratory. In this study, the size and chain-like aggregates of MCNPs notably influenced the field treatments as they precluded the filtration of MCNPs downwards. However, immobilizing cadmium could be more effective in soils with higher concentrations of the metal and multicomponent nanoparticles of smaller size, expanding our research scope and offering a practical solution to pollution issues in cocoa-growing regions.

40061858	Preliminary transcriptomic analyses reveal <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in planta</i> overexpression of various bacteriocins in <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>.	<i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> is a phytopathogenic bacterium of worldwide importance causing detrimental diseases in several crops. Recent reports from European and Mediterranean countries raised great concerns and have given impetus to new studies investigating both the pathogenicity of the newly emerged strains and the susceptibility and vulnerability of Mediterranean agroecosystems, with the outbreak in olive trees in southern Italy being the most investigated new pathosystem. The complexity of this pathogen makes difficult to understand its interaction mechanisms with host plants and plant microbial communities.
40061654	Principles and Therapeutics of <i>Yajna</i>.	Health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing, not merely the absence of diseases or infirmity. <i>Yajna</i> means selfless sacrifices performed along with sacred sounds, the mantras. The procedure includes offering selected herbal and sacred materials to the fire to obtain an array of benefits such as air purification and release of therapeutic compounds (antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antidepression, and anticonvulsant) in the form of aerosol that enriches the atmosphere and soil. Microbial intrusions into the human system such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have proved their ability to hack the elements such as air, water, and earth to coerce humans' physical and mental status. Panic during COVID (coronavirus disease) pandemic did not decline despite advanced therapeutic approaches. Vaccinating the human and animals of the entire globe within a specific time may not be a practically viable approach; adopting an alternative strategy that holistically represses the viral outbreak at various levels will support the medical and government authorities. Pandemic-combatted ancestors developed traditional remedies with secret medicinal portions prescribed to perform as rituals. One of those rituals is <i>Yajna</i>. <i>Yajna</i> procedure controls microbial load at both the environmental and zoonotic levels. The purpose of this literature review is to examine the advantages of scientifically establishing a correlation between <i>Yajna</i> and its potential contribution to prevent pandemics like COVID. An online search explored the phytotherapeutics of <i>Yajna</i> and correlated with the noninvasive drug delivery.
40061155	﻿A new remarkable representative of Uropodina mites from Seychelles (Acari, Mesostigmata, Trematuridae).	A new genus, <i>Trematirunella</i> <b>gen. nov.</b> (Mesostigmata: Uropodina: Trematuridae), with <i>Trematirunellaseychellia</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> as its type species, is described, based on a female, males, and deutonymphs collected in soil samples from the Seychelle Islands. The new genus belongs to the family Trematuridae based on the shape of the corniculi, gnathosomal setae, tritosternum and chelicerae. Members of the new genus bear a preanal suture on the ventral shield, two pairs or more pairs of wide, robust and sword-like setae on the caudal part of the dorsal shield, very dense setation on the caudal area of the marginal shield and an incision on the anterior part of the dorsal shield. These characters are missing in the other genera of Trematuridae. Two previously described species (<i>Trichouropodalagunae</i> Hirmatsu & Hirschmann, 1988 and <i>Trichouropodapalawanensis</i> Hirschmann & Hirmatsu, 1990) from the Philippines are transferred to the new genus, as <i>Trematirunellalagunae</i> (Hirmatsu & Hirschmann, 1988), <b>comb. nov.</b> and <i>Trematirunellapalawanensis</i> (Hirschmann & Hirmatsu, 1990), <b>comb. nov.</b> The new species differs from its congeners in the sculptural pattern of the female genital shield and in the shape of the robust and sword-like setae on the caudal area of the dorsal shield.
40061124	Rapid development of naked malting barley germplasm through targeted mutagenesis.	Covered barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) has historically been preferred for malting, as the husk in this plant protects the embryo during harvest and acts as a filter during brewing. Naked barley, which is typically used as food, has the potential to be used in brewing due to recent technical advances, but the grains contain higher levels of β-glucan and polyphenols, which are undesirable in brewing. Introducing the naked trait into brewing cultivars through crossing is time-consuming due to the need to eliminate these undesirable traits. In this study, we rapidly developed naked barley that is potentially suitable for malting by introducing targeted mutations into <i>Nudum</i> (<i>NUD</i>) using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis. The doubled haploid line 'DH120366', which was used as the parental line, was derived from a cross between two covered malting barley cultivars. We generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenized barley harboring mutations in <i>NUD</i> via <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated transformation and confirmed the presence of mosaic mutations in one individual from among 16 T<sub>0</sub> transformants. We sowed T<sub>1</sub> grains exhibiting the naked trait and sequenced the <i>NUD</i> gene in these T<sub>1</sub> seedlings, identifying two types of mutations. Shotgun high-throughput whole-genome sequencing confirmed the absence of the transgene in at least one <i>nud</i> mutant line following <i>k</i>-mer-based analysis. Cultivation in a closed growth chamber revealed no significant differences in agronomic traits between the <i>nud</i> mutants and the wild type. This study demonstrates the feasibility of rapidly developing naked barley with potential use for malting and brewing by targeting only <i>NUD</i> via targeted mutagenesis.
40061033	Soil properties and rhizosphere interactions affecting nitrous oxide emissions with mitigation by nitrification inhibitors in rice growth stages.	Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions from paddy soils, particularly from the rice rhizosphere, significantly contribute to agricultural greenhouse gas outputs. This study explores N<sub>2</sub>O emission dynamics in rhizosphere (R) and non-rhizosphere (NR) soils from two distinct paddy types (JR and YC) during the primary rice growth stages (tillering, jointing, heading, and grain-filling). Cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were measured at 688.56, 762.90, 831.20, and 1072.32 µg N kg<sup>-1</sup> for JR-NR, JR-R, YC-NR, and YC-R, respectively. Notably, JR-R and YC-R exhibited increases in cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by up to 20.04% and 28.23%, respectively, compared to their NR counterparts at different growth stages. These enhanced emissions were primarily associated with microbial genera <i>Nitrosospira</i> and <i>Nitrosospirae</i>, and influenced by factors such as electrical conductivity (EC) and available potassium (AK). The soil organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C/N) was a key determinant influencing <i>Nitrosospira</i> abundance. Additionally, nitrification inhibitors (NIs) demonstrated a substantial reduction in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, with a decrease of 92.37% in JR-R and 91.93% in YC-R at selected growth stages, showing more pronounced effects compared to NR soils. These findings highlight the efficacy of NIs in significantly mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, particularly in rhizosphere soils. Variations in the efficiency of NIs across different soil types and growth stages suggest that optimizing application timing and developing tailored soil-specific strategies could further enhance the effectiveness of NIs in mitigating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from paddy fields. This research provides essential insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies to reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in rice cultivation and contributes to sustainable agricultural practices.
40060881	Removal of Antibiotics from Swine Wastewater Using an Environmentally Friendly Biochar: Performance and Mechanisms.	Antibiotics used in the swine industry to treat diseases and improve animal growth are poorly absorbed by swine and have been classified as micropollutants due to their occurrence in surface water, wastewater, and soil. This study investigated the capacity of biochar produced from eastern red cedar to remove target antibiotics that have been extensively used in the swine industry. Biochar was produced by pyrolysis from eastern red cedar at 450 °C. The sorption tests were performed by mixing biochar and a solution (1:10 ratio) containing each antibiotic in 100, 300, 600, and 900 μg L<sup>-1</sup> concentrations. The results indicate that red cedar biochar was able to effectively remove up to 99.93% tetracycline, 96.23% oxytetracycline, 98.28% chlortetracycline, 76.4% sulfadiazine, and 78.6% sulfamethazine at the lowest concentrations. The removal efficiencies at higher concentrations declined up to 83.52, 47.23, 64.16, 69.8, and 58.4% for tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethazine, respectively. The biochar exhibited stronger adsorption capacity for chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine compared to the other antibiotics. The likely adsorption mechanisms driving the removal of tetracyclines and sulfonamides are hydrogen-bonding and π-π electron-donor-acceptor, supported by FTIR analyses of the biochar itself. Overall, the results highlighted the potential utilization of eastern red cedar biochar for practical applications, mitigating antibiotic residues from swine wastewater in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner due to its relatively low pyrolysis temperature (450 °C) and sustainable repurposing of an invasive tree species.
40060868	Risk Assessment of Mercury in Soil, Water, and Sediments Collected in a Region Impacted by Gold Mining.	This work reports the determination of mercury and the assessment of health risks in water, river sediments, and soil samples collected in the city of <i>Jacobina</i>, Brazil, located in a region impacted by gold mining. The mercury determinations were performed using the direct method analyzer (DMA) method, which was carefully validated according to the IUPAC recommendations. Total mercury contents ranged from 0.10 to 1.77 μg L<sup>-1</sup> in water samples, from 0.005 to 0.278 μg g<sup>-1</sup> in soil samples, and from 0.014 to 0.317 μg g<sup>-1</sup> in river sediment samples. The contamination factor (CF) and the ecological risk index were applied to the data obtained from soil and sediment analyses. Only one of the twenty-one soil samples had CF > 1 (1.11), denoting moderate contamination for this sampled site. All 20 other samples had CF < 1 (0.02 to 0.69), showing low mercury contamination in the soils collected throughout <i>Jacobina</i>. The results of the ecological risk index perfectly corroborated the results found by the CF, denoting that only one sample had a moderate potential ecological risk. Among the 13 sediment samples, two had CF > 1 and Er in the range of 40 to 80, denoting moderate contamination and moderate ecological risk in these two sampled locations. All 11 other samples had CF < 1 and Er less than 40, demonstrating that the sediments analyzed have low contamination and low potential for ecological risk due to mercury. All mercury levels found in water samples are below the maximum limit (2 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) established by the CONAMA, the Brazilian Government, for class 3 freshwater. The assessment of daily mercury exposure was also performed using the routes of exposure through dermal contact (ADIder), inhalation (ADIinh), ingestion (ADIing) in the soil samples, and dermal contact and ingestion in the water samples employing the health risk indices established by the USEPA. The results obtained did not indicate noncarcinogenic risks for adults and children.
40060856	Highly Selective Pyrene-Anchored Halloysite Nanotube for Fluorometric Determination of 2,4,6-Trinitrophenol in Environmental and Food Samples.	2,4,6-Trinitrophenol (TNP) is explosive, toxic, ecological, and a human health hazard and is resistant to degradation. It can cause symptoms such as headache, loss of appetite, dizziness, fever, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting when inhaled. In this study, we aimed to develop a new halloysite nanotube anchored with pyrene moieties (<b>HNT@Py</b>) for the sensitive determination of TNP in soil, wastewater, and food samples using fully aqueous media. The <b>HNT@Py</b> was characterized structurally, morphologically, and thermally by using FTIR, UV-vis, XRD, TGA, fluorescence, SEM, and TEM analyses. The detection conditions for the assay were investigated and optimized, including competitive species, incubation time, sensor concentration, photostability, and selectivity. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for TNP were found to be 14.00 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> and 42.00 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> in the linear response of 0.04 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.60 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.9962), respectively. Validation of the current method was performed using the spike/recovery test and HPLC analyses, and it was subsequently utilized to successfully detect TNP with fluorescence in soil, food, and water samples. According to the obtained results, the suggested assay is dependent on the "turn-off" emission of <b>HNT@Py</b> with the PET mechanism between electron-deficient NACs and the electron-rich pyrene moieties. The sensor was found to be easy to use, extremely sensitive, and reliable in rapidly identifying TNP in real samples, displaying excellent flexibility and resilience. Additionally, detection membranes with regular morphology were obtained by the electrospinning method using <b>HNT@Py</b> nanostructures dispersed in the PCL matrix, and RGB changes were determined via a smartphone application.
40060822	Pyrolysis Behavior, Kinetic Analysis, and Biochar Production from Waste Flowers.	Waste flowers constitute a significant portion of organic waste, offering the potential for sustainable waste management through pyrolysis. This study explores the pyrolysis behavior, kinetic parameters, and biochar production from waste flowers. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to examine thermal degradation characteristics under varying heating rates (10, 20, and 50 °C min<sup>-1</sup>). Kinetic analysis was performed using model-free methods such as the Friedman method (FM), Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Starink method (STM), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and Criado model to determine the pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Further, the biochar was produced in a semibatch reactor at 450 °C with a 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup> heating rate and 100 mL min<sup>-1</sup> nitrogen flow rate. The characterization of the biochar included proximate and elemental analysis, calorific value, bulk density, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pH, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and water-holding capacity. The decomposition results were confirmed in three stages: moisture removal, active pyrolysis, and residue formation. Kinetic results revealed a multistep reaction mechanism, with average activation energies of 236.35, 232.29, 234.74, and 221.50 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> derived from KAS, OFW, STM, and FM, respectively. Pyrolysis of marigold flowers (MG) yielded 36.64 wt % biochar at 450 and 10 °C min<sup>-1</sup> heating rate. Further, the biochar exhibited a 57.10% carbon content, 33.57 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup> higher heating value (HHV), 9.96 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> BET surface area, and 29.14 mV zeta potential, demonstrating its potential for soil amendment, carbon sequestration, and pollutant adsorption. This study emphasizes the value of MG as a feedstock for biochar production, contributing to circular economy initiatives.
40060723	Temporal Variation in Bacterial Community Characteristics Shaped by Habitat in a Reservoir Buffer Strip in China.	Habitat and temporal variation can both influence microbial community dynamics, although their relative importance in reservoir buffer zones with complex hydrology regimes and dramatically altered environments remains controversial. To elucidate this, we investigated spatiotemporal variation in soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes from the flooding period to the dry period (April and June, respectively) using high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing in three habitats (abandoned cropland, grassland, and woodland) within the Chushandian Reservoir's buffer strip, China. The results showed that habitat was more important than temporal variation in shaping soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes in the reservoir buffer zone. Bacterial communities responded to temporal variation both in terms of species composition and function; temporal variation affected bacterial communities mostly by altering the abundance of shared species and by causing the resurgence or extinction of specific taxa within the same habitat. The main driver of these changes was the resilience capacity of habitats to the changing moisture environment. The magnitude and underlying mechanisms of the changes in bacterial community diversity and ecological processes differed markedly between the three habitats, owing mostly to the characteristics of their vegetation, thus the allocation ratios of different habitat vegetation types and landscape diversity should pay attention for the reservoir buffer zone management, improving the integrated ecological benefits of the reservoir ecosystem from a multiscale.
40060720	The Effects of Climate Change and Greening of Vegetation on Spatiotemporal Variation of Evapotranspiration in the Haihe River Basin, China.	Highly accurate evapotranspiration (ET) estimation and understanding the impacts of climatic and land use change on ET are essential for water resources management in the Haihe River Basin (HRB). This study estimated spatial and temporal changes of ET and its drivers over the period 2000-2020, using the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model. Validation performed with the observations of 11 eddy covariance sites showed that the PT-JPL model can simulate ET with high accuracy (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.64, RMSE = 1.32 mm/day, NSE = 0.57). During the 21-year study period, the mean annual ET in HRB was 583 mm/year and showed an insignificant increasing trend (0.45 mm/year). Canopy transpiration (ET<sub>c</sub>, 2.96 mm/year) and interception evaporation (ET<sub>i</sub>, 0.74 mm/year) significantly increased whereas soil evaporation (ET<sub>s</sub>, -3.25 mm/year) significantly decreased. The mean annual net radiation (Rn), relative humidity (Rh), and wind speed (Ws) showed insignificant decreasing trends. In contrast, mean annual air temperature (Tm), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and precipitation showed insignificant increasing trends. The significantly increased leaf area index (LAI) demonstrated that vegetation in the HRB is greening. We explored the relationship between ET and its components to climate and vegetation parameters. The results showed that net radiation was the most important parameter for ET variations. Vegetation and temperature had large impacts on ET<sub>c</sub>. Vegetation greening in HRB dominates the increasing trend in ET<sub>c</sub>. Net radiation and relative humidity showed an important role in changes in ET<sub>s</sub>. Temperature and vegetation were key impact parameters for ET<sub>i</sub>. The increase in ET<sub>i</sub> is mainly located in the region of forests, which is due to the forest protection and afforestation projects in HRB. This study highlights the importance of isolating the contributions of vegetation and climate changes to the changes in ET and its components, which is useful for water resources management in HRB and other regions of the world.
40060716	The Ecological Restoration Strategies in Terrestrial Ecosystems Were Reviewed: A New Trend Based on Soil Microbiomics.	Soil microorganisms play a pivotal role in the biogeochemical cycle and serve as crucial indicators of ecological restoration in terrestrial ecosystems. The soil microbial community is regarded as a pivotal participant in environmental processes, offering both positive and negative feedback to diverse media within the ecosystem. This community can serve as a potential indicator in ecological monitoring and restoration processes. Consequently, an increasing number of scholars are directing their research towards the field of soil microbial ecology in diverse ecosystems and fragile areas, with the aim of elucidating the intricate interactions between microbes and vegetation. However, the implementation of soil microbiome in ecological restoration remains in the experimental stage due to the interference of extreme events and the complexity of governance measures. Consequently, a comprehensive evaluation of existing research is imperative. This review aims to address the ecological crises currently experienced by diverse terrestrial ecosystems and to provide a comprehensive overview of the specific practices of soil microorganisms in the context of ecological restoration. We also incorporate them into fragile habitats and identify urgent issues that need to be addressed in the ecological restoration process of fragile areas.
40060627	Metagenomic selections reveal diverse antiphage defenses in human and environmental microbiomes.	To prevent phage infection, bacteria have developed an arsenal of antiphage defense systems. Using functional metagenomic selections, we identified new examples of these systems from human fecal, human oral, and grassland soil microbiomes. Our antiphage selections in <i>Escherichia coli</i> revealed over 200 putative defenses from 14 diverse bacterial phyla, highlighting the broad phylogenetic interoperability of these systems. Many defense systems were unrecognizable based on sequence or predicted structure, so could only be identified via functional assays. In mechanistic studies, we show that some defense systems encode nucleases that only degrade covalently modified phage DNA, but which accommodate diverse chemical modifications. We also identify outer membrane proteins that prevent phage adsorption and a set of previously unknown defense systems with diverse antiphage profiles and modalities. Most defenses acted against at least two phages, indicating that broadly acting systems are widely distributed among non-model bacteria.
40060394	Detection of inertial effects in capillary flows in open and closed channels.	The Lucas-Washburn-Rideal law is commonly applied to describe capillary flow dynamics in closed or open channels, microporous media, such as paper pads and fiber threads or even granulous soil. It assumes a viscous flow regime where capillary forces are counteracted by friction with the solid structure, a valid assumption given the small flow velocities and device dimensions. However, scenarios exist outside the viscous regime, where inertial effects become significant, meaning capillary and friction forces do not fully balance. One well-documented case is the transient inertial regime at the onset of capillary motion. With the advancement of capillary devices, other configurations also raise the possibility of inertia influencing flow behavior. This study introduces a criterion to identify inertial contributions in capillary-driven flows in spatially varying geometries within open or closed channels and demonstrates how the Bosanquet equation can account for inertial effects in rectangular open-channel configurations.
40060292	Integration of physio-biochemical, biological and molecular approaches to improve heavy metal tolerance in plants.	Heavy metal toxicity hinders plant growth and development by inducing oxidative stress, decreasing biomass, impairing photosynthesis, and potentially leading to plant death. The inherent defense mechanisms employed by plants, including metal sequestration into vacuoles, phytochelation, cell wall metal adsorption and an enhanced antioxidant system can be improved via various approaches to mitigate heavy metal toxicity. This review primarily outlines plants direct and indirect responses to HM stress and the tolerance mechanisms by which plants combat the toxic effects of metals and metalloids to understand the effective management of HMs and metalloids in the soil system. Furthermore, this review highlights measures to mitigate metal and metalloid toxicity and improve metal tolerance through various physio-biochemical, biological, and molecular approaches. This review also provides a comprehensive account of all the mitigative approaches by comparing physio-biochemical, biological and molecular approaches. Finally, we compared all the mitigative approaches used in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous to increase their metal tolerance. Although many studies have compared monocot and dicot plants based on metal toxicity and tolerance effects, comparisons of these mitigative approaches have not been explored.
40060187	<i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 biocontrol against potato common scab involves significant changes in the soil microbiome and metabolome.	Potato common scab (CS) is a worldwide disease, caused by <i>Streptomyces</i> spp., and its presence reduces the market value of potatoes. A nontoxic and potentially effective approach in many control strategies is the use of antagonistic microbes as biocontrol agents. In this study, <i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 was isolated and assessed for its ability to protect against CS. Through integrated metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, changes in the soil microbial community structure and soil properties were analyzed to understand the effects of <i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 on CS. These studies revealed that DX-9 inoculation could significantly decrease CS disease rate, disease index, and the number of CS pathogens, along with an increase in soil N and P content. Our metagenomic assays identified 102 phyla and 1154 genera, and DX-9 inoculation increased the relative abundances of the phyla Pseudomonadota, Chloroflexota and Gemmatimonadota. Additionally, an increase in the relative abundance of genera, such as <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, <i>Agrobacterium</i>, and <i>Nitrobacter</i>, were significantly and positively correlated with soil N and P. Metabolomic analysis revealed that DX-9 inoculation significantly increased the soil levels of phytolaccoside A, 7,8-dihydropteroic acid, novobiocin, and azafrin. These compounds were enriched in microbe pathway metabolites, including xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. In summary, the use of <i>Bacillus atrophaeus</i> DX-9 against potato CS offers an alternative biocontrol method that can improve both soil microbial community and properties. This study provides insight into the potential mechanisms by which microbial inoculants can control CS disease.
40060112	Metagenomics-based study of rhizospheric microorganisms of <i>Poa alpigena L.</i> in Qinghai Lake, Ganzi River Plateau.	<i>Poa alpigena</i> Lindm., a dominant forage grass on the Tibetan Plateau, plays a critical role in livestock production and grassland restoration. This study investigates the rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric soil microorganisms of <i>Poa alpigena L.</i> in the Ganzi River area of the Qinghai Lake basin using metagenomic sequencing to understand their diversity and potential ecological functions.
40059837	Understanding zoonotic pathogens and risk factors from wildlife in Southeast Asia: a systematic literature review.	The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the significance of the human-animal interface in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, with wildlife serving as an important source of infection. A better understanding of the specific pathogens and mechanisms involved is vital to prepare against future outbreaks, especially in Southeast Asia, a hotspot for zoonotic diseases. This paper reviews the published literature on wildlife zoonoses in this region from 2012 to 2022. The results show a diverse range of potential zoonotic pathogens and the widespread occurrence of zoonotic diseases from wildlife. Drivers of zoonotic pathogen spillover include (i) environmental factors (e.g. animal habitat disruption, environmental conditions, exposure to contaminated water/food/soil), (ii) animal factors (e.g. movement patterns, age-related susceptibility), (iii) human factors (e.g. lack of awareness, poor hygiene practices, age, gender and income) and (iv) human-animal-environmental interface factors (e.g. close contact between humans and animals, exposure through visiting animals and presence of vectors). The diverse drivers of zoonoses in Southeast Asia put its communities at risk for infection. To mitigate these risks, global health efforts should consider adopting a One Health approach to foster collaboration across human, animal, and wildlife health sectors. This could involve educating communities on safe animal interactions and improving disease surveillance.
40059719	Improved Modeling of Vegetation Phenology Using Soil Enthalpy.	Many vegetation phenological models predominantly rely on temperature, overlooking the critical roles of water availability and soil characteristics. This limitation significantly impacts the accuracy of phenological projections, particularly in water-limited ecosystems. We proposed a new approach incorporating soil enthalpy-a comprehensive metric integrating soil moisture, temperature, and texture-to improve phenological modeling. Using an extensive dataset combining FLUXNET observations, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), and meteorological data across the Northern Hemisphere (NH), we analyzed the relationship between soil enthalpy and vegetation phenology from 2001 to 2020. Our analysis revealed significant temporal trends in soil enthalpy that corresponded with changes in leaf onset date (LOD) and leaf senescence date (LSD). We developed and validated a new soil enthalpy-based model with optimized parameters. The soil enthalpy-based model showed particularly strong performance in autumn phenology, improving LSD simulation accuracy by at least 15% across all vegetation types. For shrub and grassland ecosystems, LOD projections improved by more than 12% compared to the temperature-based model. Future scenario analysis using CMIP6 data (2020-2054) revealed that the temperature-based model consistently projects earlier LOD and later LSD compared to the soil enthalpy-based model, suggesting potential overestimation of growing season length in previous studies. This study establishes soil enthalpy as a valuable metric for phenological modeling and highlights the importance of incorporating both water availability and soil characteristics for more accurate predictions of vegetation phenology under changing climatic conditions.
40059570	Investigation of the Effects of Applying Bio-Magnesium Oxide Nanoparticle Fertilizer to Moringa Oleifera Plants on the Chemical and Vegetative Properties of the Plants' leaves.	Magnesium (Mg) is necessary for plants as a structural element or an enzyme cofactor. It also plays a significant role in the light and dark responses of photosynthesis. Moringa plants are considered one of the most important medicinal plants that humans need for nutrition. The aim of the study is to provide Mg to plants in an easy and simple way. Therefore, it is widely available in human food due to its nutritional importance. In this experiment, the treatment was done on the Moringa plant as, one of the medicinal plants that is increasingly used in fresh form. The experiment was conducted at the research farm of the National Research Center. Magnesium oxide has been extracted and prepared in a natural way that is safe for humans, plants, and soil. Trichoderma viride filtrate was used as a chelating agent in an environmentally friendly process to create magnesium oxide nanoparticle (MgO-NPs). FTIR, TEM, and SEM-EDX were utilized to analyze and characterize the synthesized. Plants were treated with different doses to determine the optimal concentration for the plant. The effect of treatment on plants was to improve vegetation such, as a number of leaves (232.15), leaf area (273.97 cm<sup>2</sup>), and fresh weight (3693.17 g). It also increased dry matter in the plant (171.8 g), chemical properties, and elements.
40059346	Copper and Nitrogen Codoped CDs for Alleviating the Damage of Reactive Oxygen Species for Cucumber Seedlings under Salt Stress.	Dramatic changes in climate and soil environments have made growing conditions for crops more challenging. These crops are subject to a range of abiotic stresses in different environments, which can lead to significant yield losses, resulting in economic and environmental damages. Herein, we report a straightforward one-pot hydrothermal method for creating carbon dots codoped with copper and nitrogen (Cu,N-CDs). Under salt stress conditions, Cu,N-CDs demonstrate the ability to alleviate oxidative damage in cucumber seedlings by modulating antioxidant defense mechanisms and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cucumber seedling biomass accumulation is greatly enhanced by Cu,N-CDs treatment in the presence of a ROS burst, leading to a notable rise in the dry weight, plant height, and fresh weight. Cu,N-CDs mitigate oxidative damage in cucumber seedlings by activating antioxidant defense systems, specifically enhancing the activities of superoxide dismutase (+34.08%), catalase (+28.11%), peroxidase (+17.54%), and ascorbate peroxidase (+31.54%) to scavenge ROS. Furthermore, Cu,N-CDs can enhance the levels of nonenzymatic elements within the antioxidant system, such as polyphenols (+23.60%), flavonoids (+15.43%), and carotenoid content (+51.73%), which strengthen the scavenging ability of cucumber seedlings against ROS. Meanwhile, Cu,N-CDs can induce a significant increase of soluble sugar and soluble protein content by 27.27 and 32.58%, respectively, which improves the osmotic pressure as well as stress tolerance of plants. Additionally, the accumulation of biomass was aided by the increase in the photosynthetic pigment content that Cu,N-CDs treatment can produce.
40059228	Transcriptional reprogramming and microbiome dynamics in garden pea exposed to high pH stress during vegetative stage.	High soil pH induces the upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress and nutrient transport, while the enrichment of beneficial microbes (Variovorax, Chaetomium, and Pseudomonas) highlights their potential role in promoting stress adaptation. High soil pH severely impacts plant growth and productivity, yet the transcriptomic changes and microbial dynamics underlying stress adaptation in garden pea (Pisum sativum ssp. hortense) remain unclear. This study demonstrates that high soil pH leads to stunted growth, reduced biomass, impaired photosynthesis, and nutrient status in garden pea. Further, disruption in key nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium indicum, R. leguminosarum, and R. redzepovicii), along with the downregulation of NifA and NifD genes and upregulation of NifH in nodules highlights the critical role of micronutrient balance in legume-microbe symbiosis and a compensatory response to maintain nitrogen status. RNA seq analysis revealed extensive transcriptional reprogramming in roots, characterized by the upregulation of oxidative stress response genes (e.g., oxidoreductase and glutathione transferase activities, metal ion transporters) and the downregulation of genes related to ammonia-lyase activity and ion binding, reflecting broader disruptions in nutrient homeostasis. KEGG pathway analysis identified enrichment of MAPK signaling pathway, likely interacting with other pathways associated with stress tolerance, metabolic adjustment, and structural reorganization as part of adaptive responses to high pH. Root microbiome analysis showed significant enrichment of Variovorax, Shinella, and Chaetomium, suggesting host-driven recruitment under high pH stress. Stable genera, such as Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, Mycobacterium, Herbaspirillum, and Paecilomyces, displayed resilience to stress conditions, potentially forming core microbiome components for adaptation to high pH. In a targeted study, inoculation of plants with an enriched microbiome, particularly C. globosum, under high pH conditions improved growth parameters and increased the abundance of Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas in the roots. It suggests that these bacterial genera may act as helper microbes to C. globosum, collectively promoting stress resilience in pea plants suffering from high pH. These findings provide a foundation for microbiome-aided breeding programs and the development of microbial consortia to enhance the adaptation of pea plants to high pH conditions.
40059155	Altitudinal impacts on phytochemical composition and mycorrhizal diversity of Reinwardtia indica Dumort, a medicinally valuable herb.	Reinwardtia indica, a highly valued ethnomedicinal plant, has been traditionally used to treat various ailments due to its rich phytochemical composition. However, the impact of environmental factors, particularly altitude, on its medicinal properties remains unexplored. This study investigates the effects of altitudinal variation on phytochemicals, mycorrhizal diversity, and soil physico-chemical parameters of R. indica.
40059154	Allele and transcriptome mining in Gossypium hirsutum reveals variation in candidate genes at genetic loci affecting cotton fiber quality and textile flammability.	Breeding valuable traits in crop plants requires identifying diverse alleles in the germplasm that are likely to affect desirable characteristics. The genetic diversity of historic cultivars of cotton is a reservoir of potentially important genes for crop improvement and genetic research. Diversity in the characteristics of harvested cotton fibers affects their suitability for end-use applications. Candidate loci and genes have been identified that affect the length, strength, and maturity of cotton fibers which affect the quality and value of the yarn, thread and textile. Natural genetic mechanisms in the plant may also affect the flammability of the produced textiles.
40059115	Evaluation of soybean germplasms for resistance to stay-green syndrome.	Stay-green syndrome (SGS) resistant germplasms serve as the cornerstone for soybean improvement. A comprehensive assessment was conducted on a panel of 1553 germplasms to evaluate their resistance to SGS through natural inoculation. Over a three-year period, one landrace, ZaoShuHeiDou, emerged as resilient to SGS, displaying a significantly reduced risk of SGS (p < 0.05) compared to its counterparts. The broad-sense heritability of SGS resistance was 0.86. Notably, landraces demonstrated a substantially lower incidence of SGS compared to improved cultivars. Furthermore, the severity of SGS correlated with several key traits pertinent to soybean improvement efforts. In field trials, the application of insecticides effectively mitigated SGS severity, whereas the use of organic fertilizers and soil sterilization had no discernible impact. A total of 83 DNA samples were successfully amplified from SGS-afflicted plants using specific primers for soybean stay-green associated virus (SoSGV), and a SoSGV LCU-1 strain was isolated. The qPCR analysis confirmed a positive correlation between SGS severity and the relative SoSGV copy number in afflicted plants. The findings of this study lay a solid foundation for the development of SGS-resistant cultivars and the exploration of underlying resistance mechanisms.

40058661	Integrated modelling of anaerobic digestion process chain for scenario assessment.	Anaerobic digestion (AD) expansion as a renewable energy source offers environmental benefits, such as reducing mineral fertilizer use and preserving soil organic matter. However, poor AD performance can cause greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient loss, impacting efficiency. To address this, an innovative AD process chain (ADPC) model was developed to dynamically simulate biogas production, organic matter bioaccessibility, digestate phase separation, storage, and soil application, focusing on carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Evaluated against 5 lab-scale experiments and C/N soil dynamics without specific calibration, the model accurately reproduced trends (bias: 11% for biogas, r<sup>2</sup>: 0.78 for soil N dynamics), despite discrepancies in digestate carbon speciation and soil C dynamics, emphasizing the importance of calibrating feedstock biodegradability and hydrolysis parameters to enhance accuracy. Additionally, feedstock seasonality scenarios demonstrated the importance of dynamic modeling in predicting agronomic digestate fate positioning ADPC as a valuable tool for scenario testing considering both energy and agronomic valorization.
40058575	Characterization of a novel virulent mycobacteriophage Kashi-SSH1 (KSSH1) depicting genus-specific broad-spectrum anti-mycobacterial activity.	Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious disease causing mortality in the world and the rise of drug resistance; multi-drug resistance (MDR) and extensive-drug resistance (XDR) has added to extra complicacy of the disease. In this scenario, phage therapy has emerged as a potential treatment option against drug-sensitive/-resistant strains.
40058549	Effects of nitrogen fertilization on antibiotic resistance gene spread from soil to floodwater in paddy fields.	The environmental risks associated with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have drawn increasing attention. Here, we investigated the spread of ARGs from soil to floodwater in paddy fields by conducting 5-year field experiments having four treatments: control, reduced N fertilization, conventional N fertilization (CN) and plant-based organic N fertilization (ON). In comparison to the control treatment, CN and ON treatments significantly increased the total N content by 26.8%-36.6% in soil and 42.7%-67.4% in floodwater, respectively. Additionally, ON treatments increased the concentrations of free-floating and particle-attached mobile gene elements in floodwater by 78.6% and 32.7%, respectively. Redundancy and linear regression analyses indicated that total N and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in soil and mobile gene elements in floodwater were closely connected with the levels of ARGs in floodwater. Correspondingly, CN and ON treatments increased total abundances of ARGs in floodwater to 1.26 and 1.46 times, respectively. The network analysis further revealed that ARGs, such as MexW, tetAB and optrA, could be carried by the hosts of ARGs (such as Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae) and spread from soil to particle-attached floodwater fractions through suspended solids. Moreover, structure equation models indicated that the evolution of ARGs in free-floating fractions could dominate the propagation of ARGs in floodwater. These findings provide valuable insights into the propagation of ARGs in paddy fields and highlight nutrient management in paddy field floodwater as a potentially effective strategy to mitigate the spread of ARGs.
40058542	Iron at the helm: steering arsenic speciation through redox processes in soils.	The toxicity and bioavailability of arsenic (As) in soils are largely determined by its speciation. Iron (Fe) is widely present in soils with a strong affinity for As, and therefore the environmental behaviors of As and Fe oxides (including oxides, hydrates and hydrated oxides) are closely correlated with each other. The redox fluctuations of Fe driven by changes in the environment can significantly affect As speciation and its fate in soils. The interaction between Fe and As has garnered widespread attention, and the adsorption mechanisms of As by Fe oxides have also been well-documented. However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of how Fe redox dynamics affects As speciation depending on the soil environmental conditions. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms for As speciation transformation and redistribution, as well as the role of environmental factors in the main Fe redox processes in soils. These processes include the biotic Fe oxidation mediated by Fe-oxidizing bacteria, abiotic Fe oxidation by oxygen or manganese oxides, dissimilatory Fe reduction mediated by Fe-reducing bacteria, and Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of Fe oxides. This review contributes to a deeper understanding of the environmental behaviors of Fe and As in soils, and provides theoretical guidance for the development of remediation strategies for As-contaminated soils.
40058441	TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber incorporating hydrophobic TA-HBPSi nanoparticles aerogels for efficient adsorption of fungicides in water.	Fungicide contamination is a critical environmental issue, and the effective removal of fungicide residues from aquatic environments has attracted significant attention from researchers. In this study, the synthesized hyperbranched polysiloxane (TA-HBPSi) was grafted onto TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNF) to fabricate a novel aerogel material (TA-HBPSi@TOCNF) with the aim of enhancing the sorption efficiency of fungicide. The equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity of TA-HBPSi@TOCNF for imazalil (8.04 mg/g) was significantly higher compared to other fungicides, including prochloraz (6.43 mg/g), thiophanate-methyl (4.12 mg/g), carbendazim (0.16 mg/g), and thiabendazole (0.04 mg/g). In the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, the equilibrium adsorption capacity for imazalil increased from 8.04 mg/g to 9.61 mg/g, while the adsorption capacity for Cd<sup>2+</sup> increased from 0.26 mg/g to 0.88 mg/g. Quantum chemical calculations were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level. The energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ΔE(<sub>HOMO-LUMO</sub>)) for various adsorption mechanisms indicated that electrostatic interactions were the dominant driving force for adsorption, followed by π-π electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions and hydrophobic interactions. The developed aerogel demonstrated effective multi-component separation capabilities without inducing secondary environmental pollution, highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for practical water purification applications.
40058417	Isolation, identification and bioprospecting potential of Bacillus subtilis, endophytic bacterium from Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. ex Savigny.	Mangroves are crucial for supporting coastal communities, benefiting both humans and animals. Their intricate root systems grasp the soil, mitigating erosion and dampening wave impact. As a result, they shield and fortify shorelines that would otherwise erode. This study focuses on the isolation of endophytic bacteria from the stem of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. Molecular analysis using 16S rDNA gene sequencing identified the isolate as Bacillus subtilis (BG1). Its hydrolytic enzyme production capabilities were assessed, revealing its ability to produce cellulase, amylase, protease and L-asparaginase. The isolate also demonstrated various plant growth promoting traits including ammonia production, indole 3- acetic (IAA) production, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production, phosphate solubilization, and ACC deaminase activity. IAA and organic acid production were quantified using Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with B. subtilis producing 86.32 ± 0.64 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> of IAA, peaking at a retention time of 6.8 minutes. The endophyte also produced two different organic acids during phosphate solubilization with malic acid been the most abundant (398.79 ± 2.58 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, B. subtilis was able to form biofilm and exhibited drug resistance towards Cefixime (5 μg). Biofilm was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Invitro antagonist studies demonstrated the significant effectiveness of B. subtilis against two pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. This is the first study to successfully isolate and identify endophytic bacteria from B. gymnorrhiza, highlighting its plant growth promoting traits, biofilm forming potential, and antibacterial capabilities.
40058331	Radiocesium dynamics from canopy to forest floor by main depositional processes in Fukushima forests at quasi-equilibrium state.	Accurate measurement of the amounts of radiocesium (<sup>137</sup>Cs) that transfer from the canopy to the forest floor at the recent quasi-equilibrium state is crucial for improving the accuracy of long-term predictions of <sup>137</sup>Cs distribution in forests. This study is the first to detail the <sup>137</sup>Cs flux via throughfall, stemflow, and litterfall processes in two Japanese cedar forests (KU1-S and KU2-S) and one deciduous broad-leaved forest (KU1-Q) in the Fukushima Prefecture during the quasi-equilibrium state. From 2020 to 2023, the annual transfer of <sup>137</sup>Cs from the canopy to the forest floor, relative to the initial deposition, varied among the study plots but never exceeded 2% (0.433-0.564% in KU1-S, 1.06-1.62% in KU2-S, and 0.421-0.461% in KU1-Q). Since the transfer of <sup>137</sup>Cs from trees to soil is balanced with the transfer from soil to trees at the quasi-equilibrium state, these percentages can be interpreted as the root uptake of <sup>137</sup>Cs from the soil, which is difficult to observe directly. Analysis of the contributions of litterfall, throughfall, and stemflow to the total transfer of <sup>137</sup>Cs revealed that litterfall accounted for more than 50% in both Japanese cedar and deciduous broad-leaved forests. We also found that the proportion of <sup>137</sup>Cs flux via litterfall was higher in Japanese cedar forests compared to the deciduous broad-leaved forest (KU1-S:91-92%; KU2-S:74-77%; KU1-Q:57-60%). These findings regarding the <sup>137</sup>Cs fluxes at the quasi-equilibrium state will enhance our understanding of the future dynamics of <sup>137</sup>Cs within forest ecosystems and improve the accuracy of long-term predictions of <sup>137</sup>Cs activity concentration in forests.
40058304	Nationwide prediction of pesticide residual levels in soil: Implications on the resulting risk and prioritization framework.	Pesticides are widely accumulated in agricultural soils in China under successive applications, causing negative impacts on non-target species and environmental qualities. However, a nationwide overview of the residual levels of pesticides in soil, and the ecological risks to non-target soil species are lacking. In this study, we calculated geographically gridded concentrations of 107 pesticide active ingredients (AIs) in soils in China based on the Computational Pesticide Input (CPI) model and further assessed the ecological risks to soil biota. In the end, we proposed an integrated usage-impact model to identify prioritize control pesticides based on the usage, risk and persistence of pesticides. Pesticide concentrations were calculated in a range from 0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to over 185 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Glyphosate is the most prevalent pesticide that exists in most locations. The ecological risks were mostly assessed as medium risk, with extreme high- and high risk found in 1 % and 21 % of soils. Supervision and management of azoxystrbin, boscalid, butachlor and chlorpyrifos need to be prioritized. The results of this study provide guidance to local governments for the designation more accurate risk mitigation strategies across regions.
40058252	Biodegradable and antibacterial edible films based on egg yolk granules/gelatin/CMC with e-poly-l-lysine: Application in fresh chicken meat preservation.	Novel biodegradable and antibacterial edible films were fabricated by incorporating E-poly-l-lysine (EPL) into egg yolk granules, gelatin, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose matrices. With increasing EPL concentration (0.3-0.9 %), water vapor permeability decreased to 0.215 ± 0.005 g.mm/m<sup>2</sup>.h.Kpa, while the water contact angle increased to 79.8°, enhancing transparency. X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy revealed the uniform dispersion of the EPL in the matrix, likely due to enhanced intermolecular interaction. The 0.9 %-EPL film exhibited strong antimicrobial activity and biodegraded in soil within seven days. Additionally, chicken meat packaged with films was stored at 4 °C for 8 days. Results showed that the 0.9 %-EPL film significantly reduced the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, pH, and total viable count, thereby extending its shelf life. In summary, the EPL-enhanced egg yolk granules/gelatin/CMC edible film exhibits significant potential as an eco-friendly antimicrobial packaging material.
40058239	Phenotypic plasticity of Eurohypnum leptothallum in degraded karst ecosystems: Adaptative mechanisms and ecological functions driven by warming temperatures.	Phenotypic plasticity is a critical mechanism for plants to adapt to rapid climate change and other global change drivers. Eurohypnum leptothallum is widely distributed in fragile subtropical karst ecosystems, exhibiting strong drought tolerance, water retention, and soil stabilization capabilities, playing a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling and ecological restoration. Our study investigated the specific manifestations of phenotypic plasticity in epilithic E. leptothallum within degraded karst ecosystems. Results showed that E. leptothallum exhibited high phenotypic plasticity in the heterogeneous environments of degraded karst ecosystems. In the temperature range of 21.5 °C-59.5 °C, E. leptothallum developed a set of adaptive mechanisms in response to warming temperatures through the trade-offs and combinations in most morphological traits (increasing in shoot height, stem cortical ratio and leaf middle cell lumen area, decreasing in stem diameter and stem central strand ratio, making leaf shape, cell shape and lumen shape tend to ellipse) and physiological traits (increasing in C, Ca, C:N, C:P, N:P, Fv/Fm and Y(NO), decreasing in qP). Furthermore, these phenotypic variations may confer certain ecological benefits to the degraded karst ecosystems and are expected to contribute to the maintenance and sustainable development of structural stability and species diversity in degraded karst ecosystems and even global ecosystems in the early stages of global warming. The findings provide a new perspective for exploring the response of bryophytes to environmental changes, a theoretical basis for predicting the adaptive strategies of E. leptothallum and its potential ecological functions to degraded karst ecosystems under global warming.
40058208	Effects of microplastics on black soil health: A global meta-analysis.	Microplastics (MPs) have garnered widespread attention as an emerging global contaminant. However, the impacts of MPs on black soil health remain unclear. A meta-analysis of 337 cases from 33 studies was conducted to elucidate the effects of MPs on black soil health. The analysis incorporated 35 indicators, including soil properties, soil enzymes, plant growth, soil animal health, and soil microbial diversity. We investigated the effects of MPs properties, such as particle type, size, concentration, and exposure duration, on soil health. Results showed that MPs led to notable increases in SOM, DOC, available nitrogen by 31.84 %, 14.35 %, and 12.45 %, respectively, while decreasing nitrate nitrogen by 12.89 %. In addition, MPs exposure enhanced soil urease activity by 11.24 % but reduced phosphatase activity by 6.62 %. MPs also diminished microbial alpha-diversity, caused oxidative damage in earthworms, and suppressed plant germination rates. Notably, smaller MPs, higher concentrations, longer exposure periods, and conventional MPs have more detrimental effects on soil health. By applying the entropy weight method combined with the analytical hierarchy process, we quantified the overall impact of MPs on black soil health as a 12.09 % decrease. Our findings underscore the risks of persistent MPs pollution to black soil health.
40058202	Anthropogenic impacts on regional leaching risks posed by trace metal(loid)s in the soil of an industrial city.	The leaching risks associated with trace metal(loid)s (s) in regional soil are complex due to the intricate interplay between pollution levels and soil properties. A K<sub>d</sub>-based regional leaching risk assessment method was developed to assess the leaching risks posed by soil TMs. The random forest model was used to identify the effects of the soil environment on the soil K<sub>d</sub> and the leaching risks. The reliability of the established method was successfully validated by field monitoring data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84). The mean total soil groundwater risk was 1.59, the high mobility of Cd contributed the most to total risks. High-risk areas were mainly located in the farmland and forestland around a smelter and areas with severe soil acidification. The high mobility and moderate contamination of TMs resulted in the highest leaching risks. Furthermore, soil acidification and the conversion of farmland to forestland would increase the leaching risk by 33.5 % and 46.4 %, respectively, while urban expansion would reduce the leaching risk by 60.3 %. The K<sub>d</sub>-based leaching risk assessment method provided a critical framework for decision-makers to efficiently identify high-risk areas on a regional scale, facilitating a deeper understanding of how anthropogenic activities influenced the leaching risks of TMs in soil.
40058201	Quantification of microplastics in agricultural soils by total organic carbon -solid sample combustion analysis.	Accurate quantification of microplastics (MPs) in soils is a significant challenge due to the complex nature of the organo-mineral matrix. Fine mineral particles and organic matter often interfere with the efficiency of extraction, identification and quantification of MPs from soils. Here, an optimized MP extraction and quantification method is proposed, using total organic carbon analyser-solid sample combustion unit (TOC-SSM) analysis. The approach entails a field survey, digestion of organic matter by Piranha solution, density separation, and quantification. This method achieves a high total recovery rate of 97.39 ± 14.25 (SE) % for particles sized between 300 and 600 µm, and 94.80 ± 13.48 (SE) % for particles less than 300 µm with spiked soil as samples. The optimised method is then applied to strawberry farm soils that use plastic mulch films to quantify MP contamination levels. Our results indicate MP concentrations of 12.24 ± 3.65 (SE) mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (for particles of 300-2000 µm in size) and 2.62 ± 0.66 (SE) mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (for particles smaller than 300 µm). With improved simplicity and the ability to provide the actual weight of plastics for the extraction and quantification of MPs, this work offers a potential approach for assessing low-density plastics in the northeastern Australian agricultural soils with a dominant MP contamination, specifically polyethylene (PE).
40058058	Preparation and bioactivities of chitosan nicotinamide derivatives and their application in the preservation of cherry tomatoes.	Three pyridine-3-formyl chitosan derivatives were successfully prepared, and the preservation performance of the derivatives was examined. According to the results, the derivatives exhibited better antifungal and antioxidant properties than that of chitosan. At a supply concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, 2-ANACS could scavenge DPPH radicals at a rate of (92.82 ± 0.38)%. Additionally, all three derivatives exhibited less cytotoxicity and higher biocompatibility. In the freshness preservation studies of cherry tomatoes, the three derivatives considerably decreased the weight loss rate and postponed the drop in V<sub>C</sub> and titratable acid content. After 32 days of 2.0 g/L VPPCS treatment, the weight loss of cherry tomatoes was (4.0 ± 0.52) % among them. Still, the weight loss of cherry tomato in the chitosan treatment and blank control was (5.5 ± 1.33) % and (5.94 ± 1.02) %, respectively, which was considerably decreased by VPPCS therapy. These findings demonstrated that adding niacin improved chitosan's antifungal and antioxidant properties, extended the shelf life of cherry tomatoes, and increased the potential uses of chitosan and its derivatives in fruit preservation.
40058055	Effects of organic material addition on carbon cycling and soil fertility in paddy soil.	Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role in plant nutrient supply and soil physical, chemical, and biological function regulation. Factors such as climate change, human activities, and farm management practices can adversely affect SOC. Here, paddy soil in the double-cropping rice area of Hunan Province of China was cultured with eight kinds of organic materials, and the effects of organic fertilization on SOC content, humus content, and soil carbon sequestration efficiency were analyzed. The addition of straw, green fertilizer, and organic fertilizer had a positive influence on active SOC content. Straw addition had the most prolonged impact on soil microbial biomass carbon content, and green manure had the most rapid influence on soil dissolved organic carbon content. All organic materials enhanced the soil humus content; furthermore, the addition of organic fertilizers significantly improved the carbon sequestration efficiency among all treatments. The results of controlled culture experiments in paddy soils established that applying organic materials can increase SOC content, active carbon components, soil humus content, and the carbon fixation rate, thereby improving soil fertility. This study provides a theoretical basis for the optimal fertilization of paddy soil with organic material addition in China.
40058053	Anaerobic fermentation integrated with pyrolysis for carbon resource recovery from food waste and biogas sludge: Effects of inoculation ratio and pyrolysis temperature.	In view of the food waste (FW) as well as its digestate are both the organic sources of municipal solid waste, this study explored the anaerobic fermentation (AF) and following pyrolysis carbonization to co-disposal the two wastes for carbon resource recovery, including short chain organic acid (SCOAs), pyrolysis gas and biochar. Results indicated that both the rate and yield of SCOAs production both increase with the rising ratio of biogas sludge (BS) to FW, enhancing the soluble carbon recovery. The highest SCOAs production of 474.33 mg/g-VS was achieved at the ratio of 2:1 in 72 h. To further utilize the carbon source, the solids from the fermented residue (FR) was pyrolyzed at 400, 600 and 800 °C, respectively. Findings showed that the carbon content in biochar decreases with the increasing pyrolysis temperature, while the carbon in pyrolysis gas exhibits the opposite trend. Integrating the AF and pyrolysis contributed to a carbon recovery about 56.39% when the FW and BS were co-fermented at a 2:1 ratio, followed by its FR was pyrolyzed at 600 °C. Additionally, the biochar prepared under these conditions displayed a specific surface area (SSA) of 313.10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, along with abundant pore structures and functional groups, indicating its potential applications as pollutant adsorbents and soil amendments. This research offers a new perspective on efficiently recovering high-value carbon sources through the co-treatment of FW and its digestate via AF integrated with pyrolysis.
40058049	Study on the effect of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 coupled with the low molecular weight organic acid on the dissimilation reduction of Cd-containing goethite.	Microbial dissimilated iron reduction is one of the important driving forces of the biological and geochemical cycles of iron in nature. Plant root exudates dominated by organic acids are important electron donors of the rhizosphere dissimilar iron reduction microorganisms under flooded conditions. In this paper, we investigated the effects of different kinds and concentrations of organic acids on the dissimilation reduction process of goethite by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and explored the effect of phase transformation of iron minerals on its adsorption of Cd. The results showed that the low molecular weight organic acid promoted the dissolution of Fe(Ⅲ) in goethite, and ternary carboxylic acids had more obvious effect than binary carboxylic acids. The concentration of the solution of Fe(Ⅱ) increased by 63.95%-342.3%, the Fe(Ⅲ) concentration increased by 2.95%-260.6%. In addition, in the process of dissimilated iron reduction, the concentration of Cd released during the dissolution of iron ore is low due to the complexation of the low molecular organic acid, which will reduce the negative impact of high concentration Cd on Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and further reduce the inhibitory effect of Cd on dissimilated iron reduction. It is noteworthy that we found that Cd released by soil iron minerals will be adsorbed and fixed again, that is, heavy metals loaded on trivalent iron minerals will be released and redistributed in the process of dissimilated iron reduction, which is one of the migration and transformation ways of heavy metals in the environments.
40058046	Enhanced sulfamethoxazole degradation by electrode material modification in microbial electrochemical system.	Electrode modification was recognized as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of microbial electrochemical systems. In this study, the cathode material was modified by introducing conductive polymer (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene, PEDOT)-modified carbon fiber (CF) and MnO<sub>2</sub>-modified granular activated carbon (GAC) electrodes to improve the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) from water and to explore the mechanisms underlying microbial electrochemical action that facilitated SMX degradation. The results showed that, compared to the control group, the specific capacitance of the PEDOT/CF group and the MnO<sub>2</sub>/GAC group was increased by 100.2 F·g-1 and 197.4 F·g-1, respectively. Additionally, internal resistance was reduced by 335 Ω and 684 Ω, while the average current was increased by 56.8% and 57.4%, respectively. As a result, SMX removal efficiencies were enhanced by 11.8% and 12.9%, respectively. Microbial community analysis revealed that the cathode surfaces were enriched with electroactive and degradation-dominant microorganisms. Combined with an analysis of SMX degradation products, these findings demonstrated that the modified electrodes exhibited enhanced electron transfer capabilities, promoting redox reactions and ultimately facilitating the degradation of SMX.
40058043	Does the land-use impact the risk of inducing antibiotic tolerance by heavy metal pollution?	The rise of antibiotic-resistant soil microbial communities is a critical global issue. Evidence suggests that heavy metals can select or co-select for tolerance to metals and antibiotics in soil bacteria, but it is unclear if this tolerance varies with land use. We tested the potential of bacterial communities to develop resistance to copper (Cu) or tetracycline (Tet) after amending soils from pristine forests, contaminated forests, and agricultural lands with 3000 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Cu and 6000 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> tetracycline, separately. Results showed that bacterial communities of unamended contaminated forest soils had the highest initial tolerance to Cu, while unamended agricultural soils exhibited the highest initial tolerance to tetracycline. The inducibility of bacterial resistance to antibiotics after Cu amendment varied by land use. In pristine forests, Cu amendment significantly increased microbial tetracycline resistance, as indicated by bacterial community tolerance, likely due to higher biodiversity. In contaminated forests, Cu amendment did not induce tetracycline-resistance, as indicated by unchanged bacterial community tolerance, possibly because of existing metal pollution and compromised bacterial communities by metal pollution. In agricultural soils, microbial tetracycline resistance as indicated by bacterial community tolerance developed slowly, becoming evident only after 42 days. These findings reveal significant differences in environmental risks related to soil metal pollution across different land uses, highlighting the need for systematic studies on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in metal-contaminated soils due to their human health implications.
40058038	The interactive application and impacts of iron/nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in distributed ponds for non-point source pollution control in a watershed.	The linkages of distributed ponds are utilized in conjunction with one another to remediate non-point source (NPS) pollution in a water-scarce basin. This study provides an overview of a state-of-the-art thorough evaluation of ponds, which offers insight into the majority of topics covered by the ongoing scientific studies, including their various functions and factors affecting their functioning on the hydrological, physicochemical, and biological processes, such as environmental climate factors and basin-specific landscape configuration parameters, as well as process parameters for design, operation and management aspects. The linkages of ponds provide a variety of sustainable services (6R functions), such as resources, restoration, reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery. The significance of regional environmental geochemical substrates in the ponds, such as red soil, as a hotspot for microbial reaction is emphasized to demonstrate the significant contribution of the migration and transformation of Fe/N cycles to the pollution removal process. In this review, 178 original research publications were thoroughly analyzed to improve our knowledge of the iron-nitrogen cycle in wetlands. From a molecular biology standpoint, the identification of functional microbe species and genes linked to microbially driven iron-nitrogen cycle activities is delved. Reliable data and homogeneous datasets from 42 studies were collected. The correlation analysis results demonstrated Feammox rates contributed to the N loss amount (r = 0.871; p < 0.01), and they had a positive correlation with Fe(III) concentration (r = 0.965; p < 0.01). The proposal for the treatment of NPS pollution by large-scale linkages of ponds in a basin involves optimizing Fe/N microbial processes to promote iron crystallization and efficient circulation of Fe(II) and Fe(III). The co-benefits of geochemistry, biotechnology, and environmental science should be considered when managing contamination in engineering applications. The linkages framework for integrated ponds, which incorporates macro (watershed management) and micro (biogeochemical cycle mechanism) investigations, provides a systematic approach to the application of integrated ponds and sustainable water management for NPS pollution control.
40057975	Ecological and evolutionary responses of earthworm holobionts to environmental changes.	Global environmental change substantially affects soil detritivores, including earthworms, impacting host-microbiota interactions and altering key soil biogeochemical processes such as litter decomposition. As microbial communities are inherently capable of rapid evolution, responses of earthworms and associated microbiota (i.e., earthworm holobionts) to global environmental change may likely involve the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes and feedbacks. Although species-level responses of earthworms to global environmental change are well-studied, the potential ecological and evolutionary responses of earthworm holobionts to environmental change remain unexplored. Here, we provide a conceptual framework to elaborate on the complex network of earthworm host-microbiota interactions that modify their traits in response to global environmental change, jointly shaping their ecology and evolution. Based on literature, we synthesize evidence of global environmental change impacts on earthworm host-microbiota and discuss evidence of their ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change. Lastly, we highlight the agro- and eco-system level consequences of environmental change-mediated shift in earthworm host-microbiota functions. Soil legacies of environmental change have cascading detrimental impacts on the abundance, diversity, and functional dynamics of earthworm host-microbiota interactions in agriculture and ecosystems. The primary mechanisms driving such responses of earthworm hosts and associated microbial communities to environmental change include altered litter quality and host dietary preferences, competitive interactions and exclusion, habitat homogenization, and a shift in soil physicochemical and biological processes. Therefore, advancing knowledge of the intricate animal-microorganism interactions is crucial for belowground biodiversity management in a changing global environment.
40057914	Bacillus Genotypes Exhibit Antagonistic Effects on Lettuce-Based Enterobacter Pathotypes.	Globally, among ready-to-eat (RTE) vegetables, lettuce is well-known as a potential host for Enterobacteriaceae, which theatens public health. However, in addition to E. coli, pathogenic Enterobacter species associated with RTE lettuce is poorly investigated, as well as their genetic relationship with sources of contamination has not been determined. This study investigated the evolutionary relationship between Enterobacter species and their antibiotic resistance attributes in RTE lettuce, irrigation water, and the soil of lettuce farms. Enterobacter species had the highest occurrence in the irrigation water (38%), followed by both the RTE lettuce (31%) and the soil of the lettuce farm (31%). The 16S rRNA-identified the bacteria isolates as Enterobacter species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Enterobacter species from RTE lettuce and irrigation water maintained a strong evolutionary relationship in comparison with those from the soil of the lettuce farm. In addition, irrespective of the source of contamination, the isolates demonstrated resistance to 67% of the 12 antibiotics tested. To overcome these challenges, efforts have been made to identify novel antimicrobial agents, especially from eco-friendly soil bacteria. Among the 76 soil bacterial isolates that were assessed via the antagonist‒pathogen agar plug method, only two (IBT42 and VFK47) exhibited outstanding (P = 0.05) antagonism against > 50% of the Enterobacter pathotypes in comparison with the control. The potency of IBT42 and VFK47 were validated via agar well diffusion, the minimum inhibitory concentration, and the minimum bactericidal concentration. The 16S rRNA and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the identities of IBT42 and VFK47 were Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus cereus, respectively.
40057750	In vitro efficacy of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CETAB)-modified nano-montmorillonite against aflatoxin B1 associated toxicity and methanogenesis.	Modified nano-montmorillonite is gaining attention as a feed additive for its benefits on ruminal fermentation. Chemical and mechanical methods were used to modify montmorillonite. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CETAB) was utilized for chemical modification, while grounding was carried out to achieve the desired nanoscale particle size, resulting in the formation of the nanoscale powder known as MNM<sub>CETAB</sub>. Impacts of MNM<sub>CETAB</sub> supplementation on a basal diet, either contaminated with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) or not at a level of 20 ppb were tested. Treatments included control (no supplements), a diet with 5 g per kilogram of dry matter (DM) of natural montmorillonite (NM), and diets with MNM<sub>CETAB</sub> at two doses, 0.5 (low) and 1 (high) grams per kilogram DM.
40057572	Influence of Tithonia diversifolia biochar on selected soil physicochemical properties, leaf nutrient concentrations and broccoli growth.	A screen house experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of Tithonia diversifolia biochar on selected soil physicochemical properties. The study included five treatments with Tithonia diversifolia biochar applied at rates of 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 t ha<sup>- 1</sup>, arranged in a completely randomised design with three replicates. Surface soil (0-15 cm depth) from the Iwo soil series (sandy loam) was collected from the Teaching and Research Farm of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria. Each 10 kg soil sample was thoroughly mixed with the respective biochar rate and maintained at field moisture capacity for four weeks in the screen house before sowing broccoli seeds. Soil samples were analyzed for particle size distribution, bulk density, porosity, moisture content, pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Agronomic parameters measured included broccoli height, number of leaves, leaf area, stem girth, and fresh weight of broccoli biomass. Leaf nutrient concentrations of broccoli were also determined. Data were subjected to analysis of variance, and significant means were separated using Duncan's multiple range test at p = 0.05. Results indicated that biochar-amended plots significantly improved soil physicochemical properties compared to the control. Biochar application also significantly increased broccoli height, number of leaves, leaf area, stem girth, leaf nutrient concentrations, and fresh weight of broccoli biomass. The application of tithonia biochar at rates of 10, 20, 30, and 40 t ha<sup>- 1</sup> increased the fresh weight of broccoli biomass by 13%, 38%, 26%, and 23%, respectively, compared to the control. The application rate of 20 t ha<sup>- 1</sup> was found to be the most beneficial, enhancing leaf nutrient concentrations and growth parameters. This study recommends the use of Tithonia diversifolia biochar as a soil amendment to improve soil quality of sandy loam and enhance broccoli productivity and quality.
40057549	A case study on thermal conductivity characteristics and prediction of rock and soil mass at a proposed ground source heat pump (GSHP) site.	Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) has a wide range of applications in the field of building cooling and heating. Ground source heat pump (GSHP) system is a technology to extract SGE. The design of borehole heat exchanger (BHE) has a great impact on heat transfer performance and investment cost, so it is important to accurately measure the thermal conductivity of rock and soil. Therefore, this study conducted field in-situ thermal response test (TRT) and laboratory sample test based on distributed optical fiber temperature sensor (DOFTS) in LY research area of Changchun, Northeast China. After comparing the differences and analyzing the reasons, an in-situ thermal conductivity prediction model was established based on artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm to predict in-situ thermal conductivity based on basic physical property parameters of laboratory tests. This model is used to supplement the layered thermal conductivity lacking in the CY study area. The results show that the distributed thermal conductivity can be obtained and the layered thermal conductivity can be calculated by improved combined thermal response test (ICTRT). The average layer thermal conductivity of laboratory test is about 12.2% lower than that of field test, but the thermal conductivity of the two test methods has the same variation trend along the depth. The thermal conductivity of rock mass is positively correlated with water content, negatively correlated with porosity and positively correlated with density. The result error of the in-situ thermal conductivity prediction model established by calculation is mainly within ± 5%, which is reliable and accurate. This model is used to supplement the layered thermal conductivity of the CY01 test hole. The research results can provide a new way to determine the thermal conductivity in SGE exploration.
40057547	Effects of heavy metals on variation in bacterial communities in farmland soil of tailing dam collapse area.	Heavy metals are commonly present in polluted soil in mining areas. In this study, we investigated 10 sites of farmland soil in the heavy metal tailing dam collapse area (TDCA) with the dominant phyla Acidobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. The heavy metal dam collapse area is a composite contamination area of multiple heavy metals, with Cd, Pb and Zn being the most severely contaminated, and the levels of Hg and Cu exceeding the screening values at some of the sites. The Shannon, Chao1 and ACE indices revealed high microbial diversity but low relative abundance of microorganisms at the severely polluted TDCA1 and TDCA3 sites. The results of redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that Hg (Max = 4.31 mg/kg) and Cu (Max = 100 mg/kg) were important factors affecting soil microbial community in the TDCA compared to other heavy metals. Correlation analysis of heavy metals with microbial communities showed that RB41 (Acidobacteria) was more resistant to high concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn pollution. The genera of UTCFX1 (Chloroflxi) and norank_TRA3-20 had strong tolerance to the heavy metal Hg. Cu was significantly negatively correlated with norank_WD2101_soil_group (P < 0.05). Therefore these can be used as indicators for monitoring potential heavy metal contamination. The results can be used to predict the changes in the ecosystem of the mining area to maintain its ecological balance and health.
40057543	Mapping 1-km soybean yield across China from 2001 to 2020 based on ensemble learning.	Soybean is a critical agricultural product in China, with domestic production unable to satisfy the substantial demand, leading to a huge reliance on imports. To support the scientific formulation of agricultural policies and the optimization of domestic planting structures, we developed a high-resolution annual soybean yield dataset for China (2001-2020), ChinaSoyYield1km. This dataset was generated by applying ensemble learning algorithms and spatial decomposition to a comprehensive set of multi-source data, including climate variables, remote sensing imagery, soil properties, agricultural management practices, and official yield records. The integration of these diverse datasets allows for a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing soybean yield at a 1-km resolution. The resulting dataset captures over 50% of the yield variability at the county scale, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to publicly available datasets with reductions in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ranging from 0.18 to 0.60 t/ha. It is anticipated that our dataset will enhance agricultural studies, planning, and policy-making related to soybean cultivation, providing a valuable resource for both the scientific community and government.
40057539	Competition and interdependence define interactions of Nostoc sp. and Agrobacterium sp. under inorganic carbon limitation.	Cyanobacteria of the Nostoc genus are capable of forming symbiotic relationships with plants but also serve as a hub for heterotrophic bacteria. By comparing the axenic strain Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 and the xenic strains Nostoc sp. KVJ2 and KVJ3, we were able to demonstrate an almost obligate dependence of the cyanobacteria on the heterotrophic partners under carbon-limiting conditions. A detailed analysis of the intimate relationship between N. punctiforme and the isolate Agrobacterium tumefaciens Het4 using shotgun proteomics and microscopy uncovered a complex partnership characterized by competition for iron and facilitation for carbon. The prevalent extracarboxysomal localization of the carbon-fixing enzyme RubisCO suggests that a weak carbon-concentrating mechanism in N. punctiforme enforces a dependence on heterotrophic bacteria. Our study indicates a limited autonomy of symbiotic Nostoc strains, which may also explain its preference for symbiotic interactions.
40057505	Differential roles of deterministic and stochastic processes in structuring soil bacterial ecotypes across terrestrial ecosystems.	Soil bacteria are vital to ecosystem resilience and resistance, yet ecological attributes and the drivers governing their composition and distribution, especially for taxa varying in ecological traits and inhabiting different ecosystems, are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed a large-scale bacterial community and environmental dataset of 622 soil samples systematically collected by us from six major terrestrial ecosystems across the United States. We show that soil bacterial diversity and composition significantly differ among ecotypes and ecosystems, partially determined by a few universal abiotic factors (e.g., soil pH, calcium, and aluminum) and several ecotype- or ecosystem-specific ecological drivers. Co-occurrence network analysis suggests that rare taxa have stronger ecological relevance to the community than abundant taxa. Ecological models revealed that deterministic processes shape assembly of abundant taxa and generalists, while stochastic processes played a greater role in rare taxa and specialists. Also, bacterial communities in the shrubland ecosystem appear to be more sensitive to environmental changes than other ecosystems, evidenced by the lowest diversity, least connected community network, and strongest local environmental selection driven by surrounding land use. Overall, this study reveals ecological mechanisms underlying the bacterial biogeography in terrestrial ecosystems nationwide and highlights the need to preserve rare biosphere and shrubland ecosystems amid environmental disturbance.
40057356	Influence of surface type on outdoor gait parameters measured using an In-Shoe Motion Sensor System.	The objectives of this study were to measure outdoor gait parameters using an In-Shoe Motion Sensor System (IMS) and evaluate how different types of surfaces affect various gait dynamics. Accurate outdoor gait data are crucial for effective fall risk assessment because surface irregularities and tripping hazards often result in falls during walking. An IMS was used in this study to collect spatiotemporal, spatial, and foot parameters from 27 healthy adults walking on indoor asphalt, soil, and grass surfaces. Data were recorded during a 6-minute walk test, with measurements taken every 2 min and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The results showed significant differences in foot clearance, heel height, and gait cycle across surfaces. Walking on grass significantly increased foot height, swing time, and roll angle of heel contact. These findings may help develop interventions to prevent falls.
40057111	Impact of Repeated Organic Amendments on Trace Element Exposure and Health Risks via the Soil-Vegetable-Human Pathway.	Applying organic fertilizers enriches soil with essential nutrients and organic matter. However, the trace elements (TE) often present in organic fertilizers-such as chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As)-can pose food safety risks. Continuous use of organic amendments can lead to the accumulation of TE in the soil, increasing their uptake by plants and potential risks to human health. To investigate this, we conducted a study across two production cycles to examine the presence of TE along the soil-plant-human contamination pathway. Our focus was on assessing the effects of repeated fertilizer applications on vegetable production and TE contamination, particularly in leafy (lettuce) and root (radish) vegetables. The results showed that using sewage sludge (SS), swine manure (SM), and chemical fertilizer (CF) led to higher vegetable yields compared to compost derived from municipal solid waste (CP). Soil amendments had limit impact on the overall TE concentrations in the soil. However, TE were more concentrated in vegetables grown with organic fertilizers than in those grown with chemical fertilizers. TE levels in the edible parts of vegetables increased significantly following repeated applications. In the first productive cycle of both vegetables, Zn and Cd exhibited moderate bioaccumulation, with BCF values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. In the second cycle, bioaccumulation generally increased, with Zn reaching high bioaccumulation levels in lettuce under SS and SM treatments (BCF > 1.0). Cr in both vegetables and Cu in lettuce maintained moderate bioaccumulation levels. Conversely, both vegetables demonstrated strong defense mechanisms against Pb and As accumulation, as indicated by consistently low BCF values. According to the hazard quotient (HQ), repeated fertilization of lettuce with CF, CP, SS, and SM resulted in a 1.4-1.8-fold increase in the total hazard quotient (THQ) for adults and a 1.3-1.9-fold increase in radish bulbs, with a maximum THQ of 0.23 in the twice-CP fertilization treatment. Overall, the consumption of lettuce and radish grown in amended soils poses no significant health risk, as the THQ values remained consistently below 1.
40057107	Synthesis and Characterization of Cationic Modified Starch Grafted Acrylic Acid-Based Absorbent Resin Dust Suppressant.	In this paper, corn starch was used as the base material, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride was used as a cationic surfactant to modify it. Subsequently, acrylic acid was then used as the primary raw material, and through the combined action of potassium persulfate and N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide, a cationic modified starch grafted acrylic-based water-absorbent resin dust suppressant (CACS) is synthesized via graft polymerization. During the preparation process, the water absorption performance is employed as the key indicator to optimize the process parameters: the degree of neutralization of acrylic acid is set at 50%, the mass ratio of corn starch to acrylic acid is 10 wt%, the volume ratio of CHPTA to acrylic acid is 1:20, the initiator concentration is 0.5 wt%, the coupling agent concentration is 0.1 wt%, and the reaction temperature is maintained at 65 °C. Under these conditions, the water absorption performance of CACS reaches 394.43 g/g. The water absorption and retention properties of the resin are evaluated, and its structure and morphology are characterized using FT-IR, SEM, TG, XRD, and other analytical techniques to validate the effectiveness of the preparation method. Furthermore, samples are prepared into solutions of varying concentrations and sprayed onto the loess surface to assess their dust suppression performance. The results indicate that the soil sample treated with a dust suppressant concentration of 0.25 wt% exhibits a wind erosion resistance rate of 99.58% at a wind speed of 12 m/s and an evaporation resistance rate of 48.28% at a high temperature of 50 °C.
40057106	Exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons among adults and children: Contributions from multiple pathways and sources.	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exist ubiquitously in the natural environment; however, studies seldom evaluate health risks from aggregate exposures to PAHs from multiple environmental media. This study aimed to estimate the doses and risks of 16 priority PAHs in soil and air for both children and adults and quantify their contributors. Soil and ambient air samples were collected at 50 and 8 sites, respectively, in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. Grab soil samples were taken from the upper 2 inches of the soil and air samples were collected every 12 days for over one year. The sum concentration of 16 PAHs (ΣPAH) averaged 7.6±15.0 mg/kg (range 1.5-98.8 mg/kg) in soil and 73.6±25.3 ng/m<sup>3</sup> (range 47.0-121.2 ng/m<sup>3</sup>) in air. Source apportionment identified five broad sources of health risks: vehicle emissions, petrogenic sources, coal combustion, emissions from coal tar, and natural gas combustion. For children aged 3-6 years, the average daily dose (ADD) of ΣPAH was 58.3 ng/kg-day, with 66%, 27%, and 7% from inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact, respectively. The lifetime cancer risk from all PAHs was 0.42×10<sup>-6</sup>, with ingestion being the primary contributor (75%). For adults aged 21-30 years, the ADD of ΣPAH was 46.2 ng/kg-day, with contributions of 67%, 31%, and 2% from dermal contact, inhalation, and ingestion, respectively. The lifetime cancer risk from all PAHs was 0.55×10<sup>-6</sup>, mainly due to dermal contact (96%). Vehicle emissions, petrogenic sources, and coal combustion together contributed over 85% of the cancer risk. The findings provided bases for designing effective exposure controls, including source control and personal behavioral changes.
40056894	From soil sorption to bioaccumulation: Tracing the endectocide ivermectin in soil and earthworms.	Ivermectin (IVM), a widely used antiparasitic drug in veterinary medicine, has emerged as an environmental contaminant due to its semi-persistence and potentially harmful ecotoxicological impacts on non-target terrestrial fauna. This study investigates the innovative combination of sorption, desorption, and bioaccumulation dynamics of IVM in soil-earthworm systems, focusing on the species Eisenia fetida, Aporrectodea caliginosa, and Lumbricus terrestris. Sorption experiments in artificial soil (AS) and its components (sand, clay, peat) revealed a strong affinity of IVM for organic-rich substrates, reducing bioavailability and bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation studies showed that the kinetic bioaccumulation factor BAF<sub>k</sub> for IVM in E. fetida ranged from 0.505 to 0.727 g soil dw/g earthworm dw, with elimination kinetics best described by a biphasic model, and suggesting minimal net accumulation. A. caliginosa and L. terrestris showed slightly higher accumulation potential, with accumulation factors exceeding 1 during the uptake phase, although equilibrium was not reached within 21 days. The prolonged accumulation process, combined with a calculated DT<sub>50</sub> of 142 days in AS, underscores IVM's potential environmental persistence and risk, particularly its ecotoxicological relevance. The results also suggest that strong sorption to organic matter in soils can mitigate bioaccumulation.
40056864	Unlocking the potential of Eudrilus eugeniae in mitigating the pollution risk of pesticides and heavy metals: Fostering machine learning tactics to optimize environmental health.	Agro-industrial waste management remains a critical challenge in sustainable development, particularly due to contamination with heterogeneous micropollutants such as heavy metals (HMs), pesticides, and polyphenols. This study explores an innovative vermistabilization approach using pineapple pomace (PP) to enhance the bioremediation of paper mill sludge (PMS) facilitated by Eudrilus eugeniae. The research demonstrates that the contrasting pH profiles of PMS (a highly alkaline substrate) and PP (a highly acidic substrate) have significantly contributed to nutrient enhancement and stabilization of end products for the mixed feedstock treatments (PP and PMS-based feedstocks) compared to the feedstock treatments in isolations. Results demonstrated a 2.1 fold increase in earthworm population density, and 4-5 fold reduction in organic carbon content confirming its effectiveness of biostabilization in a heterogeneous feed mixture. Vermicomposting enhanced nutrient availability (N, P, K) and microbial metabolic activity by 3-5 folds. Amongst tested ratios, PP + PMS + cowdung (CD) (1:2:1) achieved optimal remediation, reducing HMs (Cd, Pb, Zn, Hg, Ni, Cu, Cr), pesticides (chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, carbofuran), and polyphenols by 8-9 folds. Integration of Artificial Neural Networks coupled with Sobol sensitivity analysis also identified PP + PMS + CD(1:2:1) as the most effective combination in minimizing potential health risks. Furthermore, Taylor plot analysis determined the best-fit model for predicting health risks associated with various PP and PMS-based complex systems. The findings underscored the potential of utilizing PP along with PMS based feedstock for mitigating pollutants whilst simultaneously enhancing nutrient recovery during vermicomposting. Thus, the machine learning techniques could facilitate the optimization of feedstock compositions, advancing large-scale vermistabilization as a sustainable strategy for agro-industrial waste management.
40056820	Matrix preparation and workflow for microplastics analysis in soil.	One of the main difficulties in microplastic (MP) research is the lack of standardized, real-world methods such as matrix blank and simultaneous tracking of polymer particles for enumeration. Building on a previous study, a matrix preparation and experimental workflow for soil matrices is presented that addresses the challenges of purification to allow subsequent analysis using Nile Red-stained MPs as a surrogate. Key steps include peroxide digestion and density separation (NaI) followed by centrifugation for low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surrogates to assess recoveries in terms of number and size, based on fluorescence microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The results yielded false positive recoveries greater than 100% for stained MPs and overall mean recovery around 80% for virgin MPs. Staining reflected the effect of pretreatment on the morphological and fluorescence characteristics of PE and PVC particles. An instrumental approach for fast Raman measurements is also presented, which facilitates counting up to 83%. Although particles down to 21 μm have been tested, this approach appears promising down to single microns due to its traceable and reliable nature for MP particles <300 μm in soil or terrestrial environments. In conclusion, the MP research community should strive to address small polymeric particles that pose an obstacle by agglomerating and interfering with particle-based quantification by spectroscopic techniques.
40056774	Detection of microplastic hotspots in beach sand for national surveys using fluorescence microscopy and infrared spectroscopy: Case study on the Catalan coast.	The aim of this study is the characterization of microplastics (60 μm -5 mm) on Catalan beaches. It takes into consideration factors as sand size distribution, geomorphology, meteorological parameters and anthropogenic pressures. MPs were measured in seventy (n = 70) intertidal sand samples covering 580 km coastline. After dry sieving the fraction over 0.5 mm was analysed by visual sorting and FTIR techniques. The fraction below 0.5 mm was separated by wet density separation processes, oxidation of organic matter and then analysed by Nile Red staining and fluorescence microscopy. A subset of samples (n = 23) was also subjected to μ-FTIR techniques for compositional analysis in order to compare and confirm the results given by the staining method. The concentration of MP > 0.5 mm ranged from <0.55 to 56.8 MPs/kg (60 % fragments). For sizes 60 μm-0.5 mm it varied from 0 to 2013 MPs/kg (70 % fibres). Polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene composed most fragments. Polyester, polyamide, polypropylene and acrylic constituted fibres. Although spectroscopy (μFTIR) is needed to confirm the results, the staining method can be a screening strategy to detect hotspots and provided good approximations for MPs quantification. Only sand particle size is correlated with MPs concentration. Sewage treatment plant discharges, runoff, and local ocean currents might all be significant in the accumulation of MPs along the coast.
40056745	Resilience mechanisms of rhizosphere microorganisms in lead-zinc tailings: Metagenomic insights into heavy metal resistance.	This study investigates the impact of heavy metal contamination in lead-zinc tailings on plant and soil microbial communities, focusing on the resilience mechanisms of rhizosphere microorganisms in these extreme environments. Utilizing metagenomic techniques, we identified a significant association between Coriaria nepalensis Wall. rhizosphere microbial communities and metal(loid) resistance genes. Our results reveal a notable diversity and abundance of bacteria within the rhizosphere of tailings, primarily consisting of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. The presence of metal-resistant bacterial taxa, including Afipia, Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonas, and Miltoncostaea, indicates specific evolutionary adaptations to metal-rich, nutrient-deficient environments. Elevated expression of resistance genes such as znuD, zntA, pbrB, and pbrT underscores the microorganisms' ability to endure these harsh conditions. These resistance genes are crucial for maintaining biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and adaptability. Our findings enhance the understanding of interactions between heavy metal contamination, microbial community structure, and resistance gene dynamics in lead-zinc tailings. Additionally, this research provides a theoretical and practical foundation for employing plant-microbial synergies in the in-situ remediation of contaminated sites.
40056564	Association of infrastructure and operations with antibiotic resistance potential in the dairy environment in India.	The dairy industry in developing countries is often associated with inappropriate use of antibiotics and the subsequent contamination of the environment with co-selectors of antibiotic resistance. However, the specific factors in dairy farm environments that influence antibiotic resistance levels and the subsequent exposure risks to farm workers are unknown. We examined the link between the infrastructure and operations of the dairy farm and the antibiotic resistance potential in India, which is the highest producer and consumer of dairy products globally. We sampled sixteen dairy farms in the Dehradun district, India, that varied in their herd size, infrastructure, and operational features during winter, summer, and monsoon. We collected samples of dung, manure, wastewater, manure-amended, and control soil from these farms. We quantified six antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (sul1, sul2, parC, mcr5, ermF, and tetW), an integron integrase gene cassette (intI1), and 16S rRNA gene copies as an indicator for total bacterial count. We observed that the infrastructure and the operations of the dairy farms were significantly associated with antibiotic resistance potential in the dairy environment. For example, with increased ventilation and exposure to external weather, the levels of sul2 (x͂=10<sup>-1.63</sup>) and parC (x͂=10<sup>-4.24</sup>) in manure increased. When farmers administered antibiotics without veterinary consultation, the relative levels of intI1 (x͂=10<sup>-2.36</sup>), sul2 (x͂=10<sup>-1.58</sup>), and tetW (x͂=10<sup>-3.04</sup>) in manure were lower than the cases where professional advice was sought. Small-scale farms had lower relative ARG levels than medium- and large-scale farms, except for mcr5 (x͂=10<sup>-3.98</sup>) in wastewater. In different sample types, the relative ARG levels trended as manure-amended soil (x͂=10<sup>-2.34</sup>) > wastewater (x͂=10<sup>-2.90</sup>)> manure (x͂=10<sup>-3.39</sup>)> dung (x͂=10<sup>-2.54</sup>). ARGs correlated with the marker for horizontal gene transfer, intI1, which exacerbates overall antibiotic resistance levels. Exposure assessment showed that the agriculture farm workers working in manure-amended agriculture farms are exposed to higher antibiotic resistance potential than dairy farm workers, who manually handle dung. Our study showed that the link between the dairy infrastructure (ventilation and floor type) and operations (scale of operation and veterinary consultation) and the antibiotic resistance potential in the dairy farm environment was statistically significant. This knowledge paves the way for designing interventions that can minimize the antibiotic resistance potential on dairy farms and in affected environments and thus reduce the public health burden of antibiotic-resistant infections in the dairy industry and dairy workers in India.
40056548	Revealing the underestimated role of Gram-positive bacteria in iron reduction within paddy soils.	Iron reduction in paddy fields is crucial for heavy metal migration and nutrient transformation. Gram-negative iron-reducing bacteria like Geobacter and Shewanella have been widely studied due to their strong extracellular electron transfer capabilities. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium are often labeled as weak exoelectrogens, leading to their contributions being overlooked. But could their role in iron reduction have been underestimated? To explore this, we enriched paddy soils with glucose, resulting in a predominance of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Clostridiaceae and Bacillaceae) and a small presence of Gram-negative reducers (e.g., Geobacteraceae). Remarkably, despite the abundance of Gram-positive iron reducers being 880 times higher in the glucose system, their iron reduction rate was comparable to that of acetate and lactate systems with more Gram-negative bacteria. This suggests a significant contribution by Gram-positive bacteria to iron reduction. Pure culture experiments further revealed that the iron reduction rates of Bacillus and Clostridium are 15.4 and 4.0 times slower, respectively, than a Gram-negative reducer, Geobacter. However, even in natural paddy soil of this study, Gram-positive iron reducers are 9 times more abundant than Gram-negative ones. This gives us an unexpected insight: Considering both abundance and rate, Gram-positive weak exoelectrogens may actually contribute significantly to iron reduction. This study reveals the underestimated role of Gram-positive bacteria in paddy soils, highlighting the unique characteristics of paddy habitats and the need for further research on these weak exoelectrogens.
40056530	Biological soil amendments can support survival of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Escherichia coli in soils and sporadic transfer to Romaine lettuce.	Biological soil amendments (BSAs) are essential agricultural inputs that provide critical nutrients in organic leafy green production. Heat-treated poultry pellets (HTPP) and seabird guano (SBG), which have been treated to reduce microbial pathogen loads, are gaining popularity among growers. Using these BSAs in the process of side-dressing, providing nutrients to crops while growing, may provide opportunities for externally introduced bacterial pathogens to survive in soil. In this study, Romaine lettuce was grown in soils in a controlled environmental growth chamber. Soils were side-dressed twice with different combinations of treated BSAs: HTPP, SBG, and corn steep liquor (CSL). Soils were co-inoculated with non-pathogenic E. coli and two E. coli O157:H7 strains at the second of two side-dressing events. Survival of E. coli in soils over 28 days was evaluated. On day 28 post inoculation, two heads of Romaine lettuce from each planter were harvested, and the presence of E. coli on leaves was determined. Four nonlinear statistical models were fit to predict survival of E. coli in soils. In all soils regardless of BSA treatment, E. coli TVS 353 declined by 4.08-4.51 log CFU/g soil over 28 days, and E. coli O157:H7 declined by 2.77-4.3 log CFU/g soil over 28 days. E. coli TVS 353 and O157:H7 were recovered from 13.3 % (6/45) and 11.1 % (5/45) of plants, respectively. Transfer of E. coli from soils to Romaine lettuce was low, sporadic, and could not be measured quantitatively. Side-dressing with treated BSAs used in organic lettuce production supported but did not enhance survival of E. coli in side-dressed soils under controlled environmental conditions.
40056522	Elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying degradation of nicosulfuron and its derivative by Klebsiella jilinsis 2N3 using multiomic analysis.	Nicosulfuron is a herbicide used in agricultural production. Its prolonged application causes significant ecological risks to soil and water environment. In this study, the molecular mechanisms underlying degradation of nicosulfuron and its derivative by Klebsiella jilinsis 2N3 was determined. Strain 2N3 degraded nicosulfuron primarily via cleavage of the sulfonylurea bridge and deamination and demethoxylation of its derivative, 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine (ADMP). Multiomic analysis indicated significant alterations in genes and proteins predominantly associated with glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, quorum sensing, signal transduction, energy metabolism, and nucleotide synthesis. Heterologous expression and gene knockout confirmed that degradation of the sulfonylurea bridge in nicosulfuron by strain 2N3 was accompanied by a hydrolysis process, in which arginine hydrolase Kj-CY657_RS10725 participated in nicosulfuron degradation Deletion of its gene decreased the biodegradation rate of nicosulfuron by 11.04 % in 24 h. Moreover, our study demonstrated that nicosulfuron derivative ADMP can effectively dock within the active site of the Kj-CY657_RS01600 protein, forming hydrogen bonds that enhanced the catalytic activity. Kj-CY657_RS01600 could degrade 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> ADMP by 43.08 % within 30 min, resulting in the formation of 4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine as a byproduct. Additionally, after Kj-CY657_RS01600 knockout, the ability of strain 2N3 to biodegrade ADMP decreased by 52.48 %. This study provided molecular mechanism for comprehensive understanding the biodegradation of nicosulfuron and its derivative ADMP by strain 2N3.
40056520	Remediation strategies of biochar and microbial inoculum for PAHs-contaminated soil: Quorum sensing-mediated PAHs degradation and element cycling.	The pyrolysis of straw for biochar production offers significant advantages in resource recycling and soil improvement. However, the concurrent effects of biochar on contaminant degradation and biogeochemical cycles in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-contaminated soil remain unclear. This study aims to integrate the roles of functional microorganisms, PAHs degradation pathways, and soil element cycles to elucidate the remediation characteristics of PAHs-contaminated soil. The results demonstrated that the addition of biochar increased the removal rate of phenanthrene (PHE) of PAHs in soil by 75.7 %, and microbial inoculum enhanced this rate to 93.4 %. Both treatments simultaneously improved soil physicochemical properties. Additionally, these amendments influenced the composition of the microbial community, increasing microbial diversity as evidenced by a rise in the Chao1 index by 2.75 % and 4.50 %, and the Shannon index by 8.73 % and 7.60 %, respectively. Moreover, the addition of biochar and microbial inoculum enabled quorum sensing and key microbial species to play a significant role in PHE degradation and ecological restoration. Specifically, these amendments have altered the degradation pathways of soil PHE: biochar promoted PHE degradation via the phthalate pathway, whereas microbial inoculum favored the salicylic acid pathway. Furthermore, both amendments expedited nutrient element cycling in soils. Biochar stimulated nitrate assimilation and the degradation of labile organic carbon compounds, while microbial inoculum enhanced the biodegradation of refractory organic carbon, carbon and nitrogen fixation, and concurrently reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This study presents an innovative strategy for ecologically rehabilitating PHE-contaminated soils by integrating microbial interactions with soil element circulation.
40056517	Microbial degradation of polypropylene microplastics and concomitant polyhydroxybutyrate production: An integrated bioremediation approach with metagenomic insights.	The persistence of plastics, particularly polypropylene (PP), and their conversion into microplastics (MPs), specifically PP-MPs, have emerged as serious ecological threats to soil and aquatic environments. In the present study, we aimed to isolate a microbial consortium capable of degrading PP-MPs. The results revealed that three microbial consortia (CPP-KKU1, CPP-KKU2, and CPP-KKU3) exhibited the ability to degrade PP-MPs, achieving weight losses ranging from 11.6 ± 0.2 % to 17.8 ± 0.5 % after 30 days. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis confirmed the degradation through oxidation, as evidenced by the presence of new functional groups (-OH and -C=O). In particular, CPP-KKU3 showed the highest degradation efficiency, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealing surface cracking after treatment. Additionally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified various intermediate compounds, including heterocyclic aromatic compounds, phenyl groups, methylthio derivatives, and ethoxycarbonyl derivatives, indicating complex biochemical processes that were likely mediated by microbial enzymes. Furthermore, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production by these consortia was also investigated. The result showed that both CPP-KKU2 and CPP-KKU3 successfully produced PHB, with CPP-KKU3 demonstrating superior performance in terms of PP-MP degradation and PHB production. Metagenomic analysis of CPP-KKU3 revealed abundant carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), particularly glycosyl transferases and glycoside hydrolases, which are associated with MP digestion. This study presents a promising bioremediation approach that addresses plastic waste degradation and sustainable bioplastic production, offering a potential solution for environmental plastic pollution.
40056504	Antioxidant defense response mediated by DAF-16 attenuates toxicity of herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on Caenorhabditis elegans.	Glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are widely used herbicides in agriculture for weed elimination. These unused glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are discharged into environmental water, soil, and even in the food chain cycle, which greatly threatens ecosystems and human health. However, the toxicological mechanism of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms remains largely unknown. To investigate the toxic effects of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans which is directly exposed to various pesticides in the soil was selected as the object of study. In this study, our results showed that the locomotion, growth, reproduction, and lethality of C. elegans exposed to different concentrations of a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are suppressed. Exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium increases the production of reactive oxygen species, accelerating senescence and shortening the lifespan of C. elegans. The exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium activates antioxidant defense responses mediated by DAF-16 and autophagy mediated by SKN-1. Our research provides a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying antioxidant defense response-mediated detoxification of pesticide residues in soil non-target organisms.
40056463	Study on the improvement of vegetated concrete substrate by biochar and limestone calcined clay cement.	Vegetated concrete has proven to be an effective technique for restoring the ecological environment of rocky slopes, but conventional formulations often suffer from excessive cement content and limited plant growth. This study proposes the use of biochar (BC) and limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) to form an improved vegetated concrete mix. Twenty-five different formulations were tested for their compressive and shear strength, pH values, and Bermuda grass growth. Microstructural studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that LC3 significantly increases the stress at small strains, while BC increases the strain at peak stresses. LC3 hydration produces cementitious material that coats soil particles, filling voids and leading to a linear increase in cohesion. The optimal mixture, with 12% LC3 and 6% BC, showed a 227% increase in cohesion and a 146% increase in internal friction angle. While LC3 increased pH, reducing the germination and growth performance of Bermuda grass, BC effectively improved these parameters, promoting faster and healthier plant growth. This study provides a reference for the application of LC3 and BC in future vegetated concrete development.
40056346	Acaricides in agriculture: balancing livestock health and environmental well-being in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya.	Extensive use of chemicals in food production, although useful, has profound implications. Acaricides, extensively used to control ticks and mites in livestock farming, can leave harmful residues that pose risks to unintended organisms such as plants, insects, people, and other animals. Thus, limiting non-target exposure to acaricides is critical. This study is aimed at assessing acaricide knowledge, use, and disposal methods among farmers and agrochemical dealers in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya, which is well-known for livestock farming. A purposive survey of stakeholders, including 100 farmers and 45 agrochemical shop attendants, revealed concerning practices. The findings revealed insufficient personal protection during acaricide application, with a minority of responders using gloves (33%), safety goggles (0%), masks (42%), or overalls (51%) for agrochemical dealers and gloves (8%), overalls (48%), safety goggles (2%), and masks (28%) for farmers. Furthermore, used acaricide containers and residues were not properly disposed of after spraying, potentially contaminating water sources, soil, and plants. Insects, particularly bees and house flies, were spotted consuming leftovers from unprotected disposal sites, entering food webs. Furthermore, animal drying sections in spraying regions included grass, allowing animals to ingest residues. Recommendations include improved acaricide monitoring and management by extension field staff and educating farmers and pesticide dealers about health concerns, proper disposal techniques, and the importance of wearing personal protective equipment. A regulation requiring agrochemical dealers to sell acaricides together with protective gear is recommended to limit dangers effectively.
40056345	Impact of planned urban development on urban heat island effect: resilient cities for a sustainable future.	This comprehensive study delved into the urban dynamics of Bangalore and Hyderabad, focusing on land cover changes, temperature variations, and their implications for sustainable urban development. Analyzing land cover trends from 2001 to 2021, the study revealed substantial urban expansion in both cities, with notable shifts in built-up, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies. The analysis indicated intensified urbanization, particularly in Hyderabad, raising environmental concerns. The study employed a random forest model to predict contrasting urbanization patterns for 2031, emphasizing the need for resilient and sustainable strategies. The model successfully predicted land surface temperature (LST) and land cover changes, offering insights for informed urban planning. Correlation analyses unveil the influence of factors like proximity to bare soil and built-up areas on LST. The model's performance is robust, outperforming other models, and is employed for 2021 land cover (LC) and LST predictions. Validation demonstrates the model's accuracy in predicting LC distribution and LST across diverse land cover types, urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the model is applied to forecast 2031 LC and LST, revealing contrasting urbanization trends. The study incorporates a hot spot analysis, categorizing thermal zones and highlighting the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The model showcases a capacity to project long-term temperature dynamics, making it a valuable tool for urban planning and climate resilience. The findings underscore the need for sustainable land use planning, emphasizing environmental preservation amid rapid urban growth.
40056274	Human health risk assessment of lead exposure from soil ingestion in a French pilot study: insights from the application of a new bioaccessibility approach.	Despite the consensus on the importance of considering the bioavailability of metal(loid)s by measuring their bioaccessibility when assessing exposure, integrating these parameters into risk calculations often involves proprietary approaches that lack adequate justification. This is the case with the in vitro unified bioaccessibility method (UBM), which is widely used in Europe to assess the bioaccessibility of metal(loid)s in the event of soil ingestion. This study proposes a comprehensive operational approach that incorporates bioaccessibility to refine human exposure and risk assessments. A pilot study of 45 Pb-contaminated soil samples collected in and around Paris highlighted the importance of carefully following soil preparation protocols. Specifically, sieving the soil to 250 µm without mechanical milling is recommended for determining both bioaccessible and total concentrations. A simplified test using dilute hydrochloric acid can predict the bioaccessibility of metal(loid)s in first-tier screening. This affordable, single-extraction method is easy to use in analytical laboratories and is both fast and reproducible. For second-tier validation studies, the UBM protocol should be applied to a limited number of samples. With the new approach, the relative bioavailability can be directly calculated using an in vivo/in vitro equation in the stomach compartment, thus, enabling UBM validation. The results of the pilot study demonstrated that to refine exposure assessments, adjusting chronic daily intake using relative bioavailability data was more effective than were classical approaches based on total concentrations. This method offers a promising perspective for stakeholders in managing polluted sites and soils.
40056263	Leveraging ML to predict climate change impact on rice crop disease in Eastern India.	Rice crop disease is critical in precision agriculture due to various influencing components and unstable environments. The current study uses machine learning (ML) models to predict rice crop disease in Eastern India based on biophysical factors for current and future scenarios. The nine biophysical parameters are precipitation (Pr), maximum temperature (T<sub>max</sub>), minimum temperature (T<sub>min</sub>), soil texture (ST), available water capacity (AWC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) by Random forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Artificial Neural Net (ANN), and Support vector Machine (SVM). The multicollinearity test Boruta feature selection techniques that assessed interdependency and prioritized the factors impacting crop disease. However, climatic change scenarios were created using the most recent Climate Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 datasets. The rice crop disease validation was accomplished using 1105 field-based farmer observation recordings. According to the current findings, Purba Bardhaman district experienced a 96.72% spread of rice brown spot disease due to weather conditions. In contrast, rice blast diseases are prevalent in the north-western region of Birbhum district, affecting 72.38% of rice plants due to high temperatures, water deficits, and low soil moisture. Rice tungro disease affects 63.45% of the rice plants in Bankura district due to nitrogen and zinc deficiencies. It was discovered that the link between NDMI and NDVI is robust and positive, with values ranging from 0.8 to 1. According to SHAP analysis, Pr, T<sub>min</sub>, and T<sub>max</sub> are the top three climatic variables impacting all types of disease cases. The study's findings could have a substantial impact on precision crop protection and meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
40056261	Predicting surface soil pH spatial distribution based on three machine learning methods: a case study of Heilongjiang Province.	Comprehensive and accurate acquisition of surface soil pH spatial distribution information is essential for monitoring soil degradation and providing scientific guidance for agricultural practices. This study focused on Heilongjiang Province in China, utilizing data from 125 soil survey sampling points. Key environmental covariates were identified as modeling inputs through Pearson correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination (RFE). Three machine learning models-support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-were employed to predict surface soil pH in the study area. The modeling outcomes and distinctions among these models were then thoroughly compared. The results showed that the mean monthly temperature maximum (MMTmax), mean monthly precipitation minimum (MMPmin), mean annual precipitation (MAP), drought index (DI), and mean monthly wind speed maximum (MMWSmax) were the most important environmental covariates for modeling. Climate variables are better suited to reflect the nonlinear relationships between soil properties and the environment in large and flat areas during mapping. Among the mapping models, XGBoost exhibited the highest prediction performance (R <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mmultiscripts><mrow></mrow> <mrow></mrow> <mn>2</mn></mmultiscripts> </math> =0.705, RMSE=0.633, MAE=0.484), followed by RF (R <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mmultiscripts><mrow></mrow> <mrow></mrow> <mn>2</mn></mmultiscripts> </math> =0.688, RMSE=0.656, MAE=0.497), while SVM was considered unstable in this study. For uncertainty maps, XGBoost demonstrated lower uncertainty primarily in high-altitude mountainous forest regions, whereas RF achieved higher prediction consistency mainly in low-altitude plain areas. Each prediction model had its advantages in different terrain regions, yet XGBoost was regarded as the optimal model. According to the optimal model, the typical black soil in Heilongjiang Province generally exhibited weak acidity, with an average pH of 6.42, showing a gradual increasing trend from east to west and from north to south. Soil acidification mainly occurred in the meadow black soil and albic black soil regions of Heilongjiang Province's eastern and northeastern parts. It is imperative to rigorously control the application of nitrogen fertilizers and to focus on improving the soil's acid-base buffering capacity.
40056023	PARASITOPHYSIOART: EXPLORING THE INTERSECTION OF ART, PHYSIOLOGY, AND PARASITOLOGY ON STUDENTS´ PERCEPTION AND MOTIVATION.	This study explores the impact of integrating art into the teaching of physiology and parasitology to enhance student engagement, motivation, and perception. Thirty-seven biotechnology students from the Federal University of Paraíba, Brazil, enrolled in human physiology and parasitology courses and participated in the innovative ParasitoPhysioart project. The students were tasked with recreating artworks illustrating key parasitology concepts and their physiological effects on the human body. For instance, one group reinterpreted Wassily Kandinsky's "Several Circles" to represent the lifecycle of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and its effect on the eyes, highlighting how the parasite, transmitted through contaminated soil or food, can invade various organs, including the retina and choroid, potentially leading to blindness. Another group reimagined Clovis Jr.'s "Nossa Senhora Aparecida," replacing the original branches with drawings of <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, a parasite transmitted through contaminated fruits or vegetables. The artwork emphasized the parasite's impact on the lungs, which can cause symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. A voluntary survey answered after the project revealed that 62% of students (n=39) considered physiology challenging. However, about 86% reported that the multidisciplinary approach of combining art with scientific concepts motivated them to study and helped them better understand the disciplines. Results suggest that the artistic reinterpretations vividly illustrated the intersection of parasitology and physiology, highlighting this interdisciplinary approach's educational and creative potential.
40056020	Quantity Versus Quality: Links Between Soil Organic Matter and Bacterial Community Composition Along a Geoclimatic Gradient.	Soil organic matter (SOM) quantity drives soil bacterial community composition from the regional to global scale. Qualitative characteristics of SOM are known to affect soil bacterial communities in manipulation experiments. However, it remains unresolved how strongly SOM characteristics affect soil bacterial community composition at the macroscale. Here, we investigated how quantity versus qualitative characteristics of SOM shape community composition along a biogeochemical gradient of grassland soils. We assessed relative abundance patterns of soil bacteria and characterised SOM based on scalable methods. Soils with higher SOM content (along a continuum between 0.6% and 18.7% SOC) and acidic pH (along a continuum between pH 4.1-6.7) hosted fewer narrowly distributed taxa (i.e., taxa occurring in few sites) and therefore had lower bacterial alpha diversity. We could explain a larger fraction of bacterial community composition (up to 59.6% of 16S rRNA reads) in these soils. Consequently, we understand community composition in low-SOM soils less than in high-SOM soils, because the drivers of narrowly distributed taxa remain poorly understood. Qualitative SOM characteristics did not strongly affect biogeographical patterns of widely distributed soil bacterial taxa. This suggests that broad aspects of SOM quality do not dominate soil bacterial community composition at the investigated macroscale.
40055973	Plant nitrogen uptake preference and drivers in natural ecosystems at the global scale.	Elucidating plant nitrogen (N) acquisition is crucial for understanding plant N strategies and ecosystem productivity. However, the variation in plant N uptake preference and its controlling factors on a global scale remain unclear. We conducted a global synthesis to explore plant N preference patterns and driving factors. Globally, the average contributions of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>), and glycine N to the total plant N uptake were 41.6 ± 1.1%, 32.8 ± 1.2%, and 25.6 ± 0.9%, respectively. However, plant N uptake preferences differed significantly among climatic regions and vegetation types. Soil NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> was the most preferred N form by plants in (sub)tropical regions, whereas NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference was significantly higher in high-latitude than low-latitude regions. Plant functional type was one of the most important factors driving NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference, with significantly higher NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference of nonwoody species than broadleaf-evergreen, conifer, and shrub species. Organic N preference was lowest in (sub)tropics and significantly lower than that in temperate and alpine regions. This study shows clear climatic patterns and different influencing factors of plant NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> preference, which can contribute to the accurate prediction of N constraints on ecosystem productivity and soil carbon dynamics.
40055955	Unlocking the potential of genome editing in agriculture with tissue culture-free techniques.	Genome editing holds great promise for enhancing crop traits; however, progress has been slow due to inefficient delivery methods and reliance on tissue culture for regenerating edited plants, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address these limitations, innovative tissue culture-free techniques have been developed, including meristem editing through biolistic-mediated delivery and RNA virus-mediated delivery. New methods for de novo gene-edited meristem induction and root suckering-based cut-dip-budding have also been established. While these approaches show promise, each faces challenges that must be addressed for practical application in crop improvement. We discuss the transformative potential of these techniques for crop improvement and emphasize the need for ongoing research to refine them and maximize their agricultural impact.
40055835	The universal accumulation of p-aminophenol during the microbial degradation of analgesic and antipyretic acetaminophen in WWTPs: a novel metagenomic perspective.	Acetaminophen, a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug, has become a significant aquatic micro-pollutant due to its extensive global production and increased consumption, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its high-water solubility leads to its pervasive presence in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), posing substantial risks to the environment and human health. Biological treatment is one of the promising approaches to remove such pollutants. Although previous studies have isolated acetaminophen-degrading pure cultures and proposed catabolic pathways, the interactions between microbiotas and acetaminophen, the distribution feature of acetaminophen degradation genes, and the gene-driven fate of acetaminophen in the real-world environment remain largely unexplored.
40055503	Ecological geological vulnerability assessment in Northern Shanxi Province (China) based on sensitivity resilience pressure (SRP) model.	Assessing ecological geological vulnerability is crucial for the protection and restoration of regional ecological environments. Considering the strategic ecological importance of Northern Shanxi Province in China, this study undertakes a thorough regional ecological geological vulnerability assessment, aiming to devise specific countermeasures and generate insightful research contributions. This methodology guides ecological environment evaluations and restorations in Northern Shanxi Province and similar Northwestern Chinese regions. Centering on Northern Shanxi Province, the study utilizes the Sensitivity-Resilience-Pressure (SRP) model to meticulously select 11 indicators, encompassing slope, soil erosion intensity, and the Enhanced Vegetation Indicator (EVI). The study establishes the ecological geological vulnerability index (EGVI) and the ecological geological vulnerability comprehensive index (EGVCI) for the first time, employing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to perform the ecological geological vulnerability assessment. The study results show that the EGVCI index for Northern Shanxi Province is approximately 3.96, which represents the ecological geological vulnerability of Northern Shanxi Province residing at a mild level. Regions with the moderate to extreme vulnerability represent about 23.7% of the total area, mainly distributed in the basin-mountain transition zones and the western low-mountain areas, with the primary ecological geological issues of environmental problems caused by open-pit mining activities, soil erosion, and land salinization. The driving factors of the vulnerability are soil erosion intensity, mineral exploitation intensity, water conservation capacity, land use type, slope, and EVI.
40055491	CRISPR-Cas applications in agriculture and plant research.	Growing world population and deteriorating climate conditions necessitate the development of new crops with high yields and resilience. CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome engineering presents unparalleled opportunities to engineer crop varieties cheaper, easier and faster than ever. In this Review, we discuss how the CRISPR-Cas toolbox has rapidly expanded from Cas9 and Cas12 to include different Cas orthologues and engineered variants. We present various CRISPR-Cas-based methods, including base editing and prime editing, which are used for precise genome, epigenome and transcriptome engineering, and methods used to deliver the genome editors into plants, such as bacterial-mediated and viral-mediated transformation. We then discuss how promoter editing and chromosome engineering are used in crop breeding for trait engineering and fixation, and important applications of CRISPR-Cas in crop improvement, such as de novo domestication and enhancing tolerance to abiotic stresses. We conclude with discussing future prospects of plant genome engineering.
40055409	Mechanical mechanism of soil consolidation by plant roots in loess area of northern Shaanxi.	To reveal the evolution law of the mechanical failure of the root-soil composite and identify the main control factors and their coupling and mutual feeding relationship, this paper takes the most common naturally growing plants in Yan 'an area as the research object and studies the evolution process of the mechanical deformation and failure of the root-soil composite by applying the methods of in-situ pull-out test, indoor direct shear test of the root-soil composite, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis. The mechanical characteristics of root-soil interaction were analyzed, and the mechanism of root-soil fixation was explained. The results show that: (1) the root-soil composite's mechanical deformation and failure characteristics have obvious regularity and stages and are affected by plant growth state, root morphology, soil physical and mechanical properties, and other factors. (2) There are obvious evolutionary stages in the deformation and failure process of the root-soil composite, that is, the coordinated deformation stage of the root-soil, the stress redistribution stage, the secondary root break stage, the main root break stage and the complete failure stage, which correspond to the linear deformation section, the acceleration section, the shock rise section, the steep fall section and the residual deformation section of the F-S curve (Force-displacement curve)obtained by the in-situ pull out test. (3) In the in-situ pull-out test, the final failure body of the root-soil composite was inverted cone shape. The root fracture interface was basically near the boundary of the final inverted cone failure body, in which the stress state of the root system was directly affected by the stress-strain state of the microelement and the characteristics of the root material. (4) The plant roots showed obvious oblique deformation and axial tensile stress with the soil shear dislocation on the fracture surface, which verified the rationality of the "oblique root" hypothesis based on the transformation of shear stress to tensile stress.
40055403	Spatial interpolation of cropland soil bulk density by increasing soil samples with filled missing values.	Large sample sizes are crucial for accurately capturing spatial changes in soil properties by spatial interpolation methods. However, soil bulk density (BD) data in historical datasets is often incomplete, and it's uncertain if filled values enhance spatial interpolation accuracy. Using 2,883 cropland soil BD samples from the Sichuan Basin in China, we developed the best prediction models from traditional pedotransfer function (PTF), multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to fill missing BD values for 1,336 samples. We then applied ordinary kriging (OK) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) to map soil BD, incorporating the filled BD as modeling points. The RBFNN model, tailored for each sub-watershed, yielded the highest accuracy in filling missing BD, with an increase in coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) by 19.54-37.36% and reductions in mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square error (RMSE) by 8.91-14.81%, 9.02-16.22% and 7.71-13.61%, respectively. Incorporating filled BD data reduced the MAE, MRE, and RMSE of OK and IDW by 4.17%, 4.36%, 4.96%, and 6.54%, 6.92%, 8.15%, respectively, significantly lowering spatial interpolation uncertainty. This methodology improves the accuracy of soil property mapping in regions with incomplete historical data.
40055393	Seasonal dynamics of thraustochytrids in mangrove rhizospheres for microbial interactions, PUFA production.	This study investigated seasonal variations of thraustochytrids in rhizosphere soil collected from two mangrove species Rhizophora apiculata and Avicennia marina in natural and planted mangrove stands. Thraustochytrid counts were higher in the natural mangrove stand than in the planted site. The counts varied seasonally, being highest in the post-monsoon season followed by summer, monsoon, and pre-monsoon. Thraustochytrid counts exhibited positive correlations (p < 0.01) with counts of Total heterotrophic bacteria (THB), azotobacters, actinobacteria, fungi, yeasts, and Trichoderma. However, a negative correlation was observed with cyanobacteria. The counts also had positive correlation with silt, clay, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, chromium, copper, magnesium, cadmium, zinc and redox potential, but, negative correlations with temperature, pH, pore water salinity, total organic carbon and sand content of the soil samples. In the present study, 113 thraustochytrid strains were isolated from mangrove habitats. However, only 48 pure cultures survived after being sub-cultured three times. Based on survivability, color, and shape, two isolates from each sampling site in each season were selected. The predominant 24 isolates were identified based on their morphological, and molecular characteristics and were classified under five genera: Thraustochytrium, Schizochytrium, Botryochytrium, Parietichytrium, and Aurantiochytrium. Among the isolates, Aurantiochytrium sp. (AKTSK-06) produced the highest biomass of 15.71 g/L in the post-monsoon season (January-March, 2023), and Aurantiochytrium sp. (PVTSK-03) accumulated the highest lipid content of 61.33%. Thraustochytrids were found to contain Omega-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as EPA up to 8.89% in Aurantiochytrium sp. (VRTSK-01), DPA up to 9.65% in Aurantiochytrium sp. (AKTSK-03), and DHA up to 47.46% in Aurantiochytrium sp. (AKTSK-06). Thus, mangroves provide an ideal ecological niche for thraustochytrids with an abundant supply of omega-3 fatty acids for potential industrial applications.
40055365	Engineering the reversible redox electrochemistry on cuprous oxide for efficient chloride ion uptake.	To address the dual challenges of freshwater scarcity and energy storage demands, battery deionization has emerged as a promising technology for simultaneous salt removal and energy recovery. Compared to the significant research advancement in cation-storage electrodes, anion-storage counterparts remain a critical bottleneck thus limiting the industrialization of battery deionization technique. Here, we employ Cu<sub>2</sub>O as a Cl<sup>-</sup> storage electrode material, by engineering the electrochemical-driven reversible synthesis-decomposition process between Cu<sub>2</sub>O and Cu<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>Cl, the Cu<sub>2</sub>O electrode delivers the state-of-the-art high charge capacity of 286.3 ± 8.1 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> storage capacity of 203.5 ± 21.3 mg g<sup>-1</sup> in natural seawater. Ex-situ liquid cell electrochemical transmission electron microscopy and in-situ powder X-ray diffraction unveil a continuous and spatial confirmed electrochemical-driven electrode oxidation, spatial migration and crystallization mechanism engaged in the reversible structural transformation between Cu<sub>2</sub>O and Cu<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>Cl during battery deionization process. This work not only introduces a highly efficient electrode material for Cl<sup>-</sup> removal but also establishes a basis for leveraging the electrochemical-driven reversible synthesis-decomposition process and spatial confinement reversible structural transformation mechanism to design advanced electrode materials for diverse ion removal applications.
40054796	Characterization of Streptomyces species with poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) degradation capabilities isolated from rice field soil.	The shift towards sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based polymers has become essential for addressing environmental challenges. Among these alternatives, bio-plastics such as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) have gained considerable attention due to their biodegradability into water and carbon dioxide through microbial activity. PHB is one of the most widely commercialized bio-plastics. However, its excessive accumulation in the environment due to insufficient degradation remains a significant ecological concern. This study focused on isolating and characterizing PHB-degrading bacteria from soil samples collected from rice fields. Screening led to the identification of five PHB-degrading bacterial strains belonging to different genera. Among these, Streptomyces sp. AG7 and Streptomyces sp. RG41 were identified as the most effective PHB degraders. Their PHB-degrading abilities were evaluated in shake-flask cultures using PHB films as substrates. After 20 days of incubation at 37 °C, Streptomyces sp. AG7 and Streptomyces sp. RG41 achieved PHB degradation rates of approximately 74.7 % and 68.5 %, respectively. Additionally, both strains demonstrated the ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a key phytohormone that promotes plant growth, and exhibited phosphate-solubilizing activity, which enhances nutrient availability. Further analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed structural changes in the PHB films, while gel permeation chromatography (GPC) confirmed significant alterations in the polymer's molecular properties. These findings highlight the potential of utilizing soil-derived Streptomyces species for sustainable PHB waste management, in order to promote plant growth, improve soil fertility through phosphate solubilization, and contribute to agricultural sustainability.
40054662	Planktonic versus colony growth of Bacillus thuringiensis affects gene expression in vitro and infectivity against an insect host, Galleria mellonella.	The entomopathogenic bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, can complete its life cycle in environments of varying densities like insects, cadavers and soil. The stationary growth phase of the bacterial lifecycle includes virulent, necrotrophic and sporulation stages, which are under the control of pleotropic regulators of quorum sensing. In addition to insecticidal Cry-toxins, B. thuringiensis can generate quorum-dependent virulence factors. Herein, we investigated the development of B. thuringiensis under conditions of planktonic and colony growth. Using an insect host, namely Galleria mellonella larvae, we observed distinct virulence profiles and differential expression of quorum regulatory genes between B. thuringiensis from liquid planktonic growth and those colonies on a solid surface/medium.
40054568	Dissolved organic matter mitigates the toxicity of silver nanoparticles to freshwater algae: Effects on oxidative stress and membrane function.	The mechanisms underlying the destruction of cell membranes by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) remain unclear despite extensive studies on the toxicity of AgNPs to the cell membranes of aquatic organisms. This study investigated the impact of dissolved humic acid (DHA) on the toxicity of AgNPs and silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>) to Chlorella vulgaris cell membranes. Specifically, this research examined the alterations in membrane lipid peroxidation, cell membrane permeability, fatty acid (FA) profiles, membrane fluidity, and ultrastructural changes in algal cells resulting from Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs, both in the absence and the presence of DHA, as well as the potential cytoprotective effect of DHA. The results revealed that DHA promoted C. vulgaris growth, which increased the EC<sub>50</sub> of the AgNPs and Ag<sup>+</sup> from 180 μg L<sup>-1</sup> to 722 μg L<sup>-1</sup> and 25 μg L<sup>-1</sup> to 193 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. DHA addition significantly reduced algal membrane lipid peroxidation caused by Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs. Furthermore, DHA increased the permeability and potential of the algal cellular membranes, particularly in the presence of Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs. In the absence of DHA, both Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs significantly increased the relative content of saturated fatty acids (SFA), while decreasing the unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) levels (p < 0.05). Consequently, both forms of silver decreased the membrane fluidity of algal cells, which increased after adding DHA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the presence of DHA reduced cytoplasmic disintegration and vacuolization during exposure to Ag<sup>+</sup> and AgNPs. These results suggest that DHA may regulate the FA composition of algal cell membranes, aiding C. vulgaris in maintaining membrane structure and function under the toxic stress induced by AgNPs and Ag<sup>+</sup>.
40054564	Leaching dynamics of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> in urban soils of a semi-arid region: A quantitative analysis.	In this study, we evaluate the leaching process and movement of PTEs once they reach the soil profile in urban soils in a semiarid city in northwest Mexico. Concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> were quantified in an urban area using ion-exchange resin (IER) samplers. The IER is a passive method based on ion-exchange resins which allows sampling the transport of elements in macropores under unsaturated flow conditions. Samples were taken during three monitoring periods in a city influenced by the North American Monsoon (NAM). In the first monitoring period, the IER samplers showed leaching rates of 323.40 g Zn<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 15 wk<sup>-1</sup>, 361.90 g Pb<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>15 wk<sup>-1</sup>, and 31.9 g Cu<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>15 wk<sup>-1</sup>. The second period estimated 101.50 g Zn<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 37 wk<sup>-1</sup>, 58.20 g Pb<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 37 wk<sup>-1</sup>, and 20.00 g Cu<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 37 wk<sup>-1</sup>. Finally, in the third monitoring period concentrations of 141.90 g Zn<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>17 wk<sup>-1</sup>, 32.10 g Pb<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 17 wk<sup>-1</sup> and 20.70 g Cu<sup>2+</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> 17 wk<sup>-1</sup> were found. The highest leaching rate of PTEs was identified in the central area of the city and its surroundings, influenced mainly by flood areas and high surface runoff. The results of this study demonstrate the role that monsoon rains and runoff plays in the movement and distribution of PTEs in urban areas.
40054558	Assessing heavy metal pollution levels and associated ecological risks in peatland areas in the Mekong Delta region.	Heavy metal (HM) pollution in soils and sediment is a significant concern, yet its levels and ecological risks in peatland areas remain unexplored. This study evaluates these aspects in three peatland regions of the Long An province in Vietnam. Comparisons of HM concentrations in peatland sediments from Tan Thanh, Thanh Hoa, and Duc Hue provinces in the study locations revealed highest values in the Tan Thanh region. Specifically, Cu and Ni were found in sediments at levels two to three times higher than the threshold effects level (TEL) and the effects range median (ERL) guidelines. The main sources of HM pollution in the study area are predicted to include the production and use of fertilizers and pesticides, metal surface processing, mechanical engineering and electronics manufacturing, and chemical plants. Further, positive correlations between HM concentrations and factors such as pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and clay-silt ratio in the sediments were identified through Spearman correlation analysis. The results obtained from the correlation analysis were further corroborated by Bayesian network analysis, which was also applied in this study. In addition, the contamination factor (CF) index indicated that Ni has a pollution level of "moderate degree" in Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and "considerable degree" in Tan Thanh (CF = 3.2), whereas, Cu has a pollution level of "moderate degree" in both Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and Tan Thanh (CF = 2.4). The modified degree of contamination (mCd) ranked the areas as Tan Thanh > Thanh Hoa > Duc Hue, with mCd indexes of 1.3, 0.7, and 0.4, respectively. The potential ecological risk index (RI) indicated a "low risk" level, with an average RI of 35.6 across all sites. These findings address knowledge gaps in HM pollution in peatlands but also contribute to the development of strategies for the protection of peatlands.
40054362	Micro and mesofauna: Pioneering sustainable solutions for fly ash rejuvenation.	Persistent accumulation of fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion, poses significant environmental challenges due to its elevated levels of toxicity, heavy metal contamination, and ecological issues. Present review explores the ecological significance and functional potential of microfauna and mesofauna in mitigating environmental impacts, focusing on their ability to rehabilitate fly ash dump sites into biologically active and sustainable ecosystems. Microfaunal groups, including protozoa, nematodes, and other small invertebrates, play essential roles in promoting soil aggregation, pollutant biotransformation, and nutrient cycling while fostering synergistic interactions with plant communities to accelerate bioremediation processes and biodiversity recovery. The review also examines the constraints imposed by site-specific factors such as extreme pH, heavy metal toxicity, and organic matter deficiencies, offering targeted strategies to enhance remediation efficiency. It includes bioaugmentation with metal-tolerant strains, organic amendments to enrich soil fertility, and the integration of mycorrhizal fungi to optimize nutrient uptake and establishement of vegetation. The findings underscore the transformative potential of microfauna and mesofauna-based approaches for sustainable fly ash management, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary research and technological innovation to address the ecological and environmental challenges associated with fly ash disposal. This work highlights the promise of advancing microfauna-driven ecological restoration strategies to rehabilitate degraded landscapes and support long-term environmental resilience.
40054360	Localized nutrient management practices enhance the environmental-economic sustainability in potato production of China.	Potatoes, as the fourth most important staple crop in China, play a crucial role in ensuring national food security. However, potato production is heavily reliant on inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, leading to significant environmental challenges that compromise the sustainability of this production. A systematic evaluation of the current state of potato production sustainability in China and its potential for improvement is an urgent scientific issue that needs to be addressed. This study employs emergy sustainability index (ESI), energy return on investment (EROI), energy efficiency cost (EEC), and energy exchange ratio (EnER) methods to assess the environmental and economic aspects of potato production at the county level in China. Results indicate that, in 2015, the average ESI, EROI, EEC, and EnER for potato production in China were 1.37 (0.1-5.4), 2.21 (0.18-7.44), 0.06 (0.01-0.48) $/MJ, and 13.52 (2.68-112.40) MJ/$, respectively, with considerable spatial heterogeneity at the county level. Regions with higher sustainability in potato production are primarily concentrated in the northwest, which is also China's main potato-growing area. The random forest analysis identified yield, phosphorus, and nitrogen fertilizers as key factors influencing the sustainability of potato production. Regionally differentiated fertilizer management strategies led to a 43% and 35% increase in ESI and EROI, respectively, while EEC and EnER decreased by 50% and 47%. This study systematically explores the relationship between the environmental and economic dimensions of potato production from an energy perspective and proposes optimized management strategies for synergistic environmental-economic development. It provides methodological support and scientific guidance for promoting sustainable potato production and offers insights for global potato sustainability systems.
40054359	Prioritizing microbial functions over soil quality for enhanced multifunctionality in saline-sodic soil remediation.	Paddy cultivation has become a widely adopted approach for saline-sodic wasteland reclamation, aiming to mitigate the food crisis and enhance soil quality. Nevertheless, the impact of long-term paddy cultivation on the interplay between soil quality, microbial metabolic functions, and soil ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) remains unclear. Here, we evaluated soil physicochemical properties, the abundance of 132 biomarker functional genes, and soil EMF across a 78-year period of saline-sodic paddy cultivation. After 78 years of paddy cultivation, soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) decreased by 43.38% and 93.02% compared to saline-sodic wasteland (WL), respectively. Moreover, principal component analysis was used to select a minimal dataset of soil indicators and to establish a soil quality index (SQI). Significant positive correlations were observed between SQI and rice yield, implying that soil quality was the main factor driving increases in saline-sodic farmland. The Mantel test indicates that soil microbial biomass, SQI, and the availability of nutrients exhibit a significant positive relationship with the abundance and expression of genes related to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling, encompassing crucial biogeochemical processes like hemicellulose degradation, C fixation, N degradation, and organic P mineralization. This indicates that changes in soil physicochemical properties significantly affect biogeochemical cycling in saline-sodic soils. Differences in the abundance of microbial P core functional genes explained 41.9% of variation in soil EMF, followed by key soil physicochemical indicators (EC, available potassium, microbial biomass nitrogen, etc.) selected through random forest analysis. Further, we identified a key threshold for changes in soil EMF during long-term saline-sodic paddy cultivation, with EMF increasing for the first 20 years of restoration before decreasing thereafter. Finally, partial least squares path modeling revealed the roles of microbial functional genes and SQI in driving soil EMF before and after the threshold. Soil EMF is primarily influenced by the significant negative effects of P functional genes prior to the threshold value, whereas beyond the threshold, it is mainly affected by the positive effects of C functional genes. These findings provide insights into the functional restoration and sustainable development of saline-sodic agricultural ecosystems.
40054356	Unveiling the nitrogen metabolism mechanism for nitrogen retention in compost via in-situ ammonia recycling strategy.	A large amount of ammonia volatilization in compost causes environmental pollution and reduces the quality of compost. Ammonia recycling composting strategy (ARCS) is new strategy for reducing ammonia volatilization by absorbing with backfilling ammonia into the compost. This study revealed the mechanism of ARCS on ammonia volatilization and nitrogen retention during chicken manure composting. The results showed that the adsorption layer containing wood vinegar had an obvious inhibition effect on ammonia volatilization. Compared to CK, ARCS treatment could reduce ammonia emissions and nitrogen loss by 20.65% and 39.6% with T3 (12d), respectively. Different adsorption time would affect the occurrence of various nitrogen components in the adsorption layer, especially the change of inorganic nitrogen content. Metagenomic analysis showed that ARCS treatment resulted in significant changes in bacterial communities, and different backfilling times had significant effects on nitrogen metabolism pathways in compost. Glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase were the key nitrogen metabolism processes during composting, which played an important role in ammonia volatilization and nitrogen retention. The suitable backfilling time (12d) promoted the acceleration of ammonia nitrogen metabolism in the early stage of composting and enhanced the ammonia assimilation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction function in the maturation stage to achieve nitrogen retention. This study provided valuable insights into the effects of in-situ ammonia absorption and backfilling on nitrogen metabolism pathways during composting.
40054352	Combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD facilitates phytoremediation of heavy metals and carbon sequestration: A field experiment.	A field study examined the impact of γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA), both alone and in combination with dicyandiamide (DCD), on the phytoremediation of soil contaminated with Cd, Pb, and Zn. This study focused on the heavy metal (HM) accumulation, and soil CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in Cosmos sulphureus and Pennisetum americanum × P. purpureum, and soil microbial communities. The findings indicated that the application of γ-PGA, either alone or in combination with DCD, increased plant yield and HM bioavailability in the soil, leading to improved HM uptake by plants. For P. americanum × P. purpureum, compared to CK treatment, the combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD increased the Cd, Pb, and Zn extraction by 131.4%, 80.6%, and 99.7%, respectively. Compared to γ-PGA alone, the combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD reduced the soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission and global warming potential by 26.4% and 39.1%, respectively. P. americanum × P. purpureum treated with γ-PGA and DCD achieved C sequestration of 829 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the application of γ-PGA, alone or in combination with DCD, increased the abundance of soil microbes. Bacteria (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Firmicutes) as well as fungi (Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota) contributed to HM accumulation and resistance to stress by altering soil enzyme activities, C and N fractions. Additionally, Acidobacteriota and Patescibacteria are beneficial to reducing soil GHG emissions and GWP in P. americanum × P. purpureum soil treated with γ-PGA and DCD. In conclusion, P. americanum × P. purpureum with the combined addition of γ-PGA and DCD increased HM extraction and total C sequestration in the plant-soil system. This approach offers a scientific basis and promising approach for integrating phytoremediation with C sequestration.
40054351	Decoupled response of aboveground and belowground ecosystem multifunctionality to shrub encroachment in a semiarid grassland.	Large-scale shrub encroachment poses significant challenges for the preservation and enhancement of ecosystem functions and services in grassland ecosystems. However, the impacts of shrub encroachment on grassland ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) remain poorly understood. This study assessed the impact of shrub encroachment on 23 key ecosystem functions in a semiarid grassland, as well as the influence of plant, soil, and microbial factors on both aboveground and belowground EMF. Compared with areas with slight shrub encroachment, most individual aboveground ecosystem functions increased by 62.24%-251.05% with moderate shrub encroachment (p < 0.05). However, these functions significantly decreased (42.96-96.91%) under severe and extremely severe shrub encroachment. In contrast, individual belowground ecosystem functions consistently decreased across all stages of shrub encroachment, with reductions between 29.27% and 94.85% (p < 0.05). Shrub encroachment caused a decoupled response pattern, with the aboveground EMF initially increasing but then decreasing (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.83, p < 0.001), whereas the belowground EMF decreased linearly (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.86, p < 0.001). Soil bulk density and bacterial community composition were identified as the primary drivers of variations in aboveground EMF, whereas plant community composition and soil pH were crucial for regulating belowground EMF. Moreover, plant diversity was essential for maintaining both aboveground and belowground EMF. This study highlights the importance of considering both the stage of shrub encroachment and the specific ecosystem functions affected. These results emphasize the pivotal role of soil and microbial factors in shaping EMF, which is critical for predicting ecosystem responses to extensive changes in vegetation driven by intensifying climate change and human activities.
40054342	Interpretation of ecotoxicity tests using Enchytraeus albidus: Weight of soil characteristics in conditions of diffuse pollution.	One way to evaluate the impact of chemical substances released in the ecosystems is the use of terrestrial organisms in ecotoxicological bioassays. Enchytraeus albidus (Oligochaeta) is a species commonly used in such standardized bioassays aiming at identifying biological responses as life traits (survival and reproduction) using artificial spiked soils or in situ contaminated soils. However, in the latter case, it is known that other factors such as soil characteristics may affect the responses in E. albidus. We hypothesized that, in cases of low diffuse pollution, soil characteristics are major confounding factors that interfere with the interpretation of life trait responses in bioassays when their influence outweighs that of the diffuse pollution itself. To evaluate these confounding factors, 20 soils were collected from a low-contamination area encompassing diverse landscapes (urban, peri-urban, and rural) that exhibited gradients in pedological characteristics, biological parameters, and organic and inorganic contaminant levels, all within the range of classical values considered optimal for reproduction. E. albidus individuals were exposed to each soil sample, and survival and reproduction were monitored as life traits. Soil clustering and multifactorial analysis were employed to identify the confounding factors. Regardless of the life trait, low and sublethal contamination was rarely an explanatory factor for the responses of E. albidus. Survival was unaffected by soil characteristics or diffuse pollution. In contrast, reproduction was significantly and positively associated with soil pH and the levels of exchangeable sodium, calcium carbonate, molybdenum, PAHs, and insecticides, while it was negatively influenced by aluminum and exchangeable manganese. These findings suggest that studies conducted under conditions of diffuse, sublethal contamination should consider multiple natural soil characteristics in ecotoxicological bioassays to enable meaningful comparisons.
40054280	Groundwater pollution management with source remediation and composite geomembrane cut-off wall: An analytical model and field investigation.	This study proposes a two-dimensional analytical model for contaminant migration through the composite GMB cut-off wall (CGCW) and aquifer system considering the effects of the leakage and source remediation. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol's method is conducted to investigate the key impacts of contaminant distribution and degradation rate in the source, cut-off wall retardation factor and Darcy velocity in CGCW. The results show that the performance of the CGCW significantly is controlled by the leakage. The peak contaminant concentration at the outlet of CGCW for large leakage (10<sup>-8</sup> m/s) can be 77.1 times larger than that for small leakage (10<sup>-11</sup> m/s), with a performance deterioration of 98.7 %. Additionally, the performance of the CGCW can be significantly enhanced by the source remediation technique. The CGCW will not be broken through when contaminant source degradation rate is larger than 2.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup> /s. Increasing the cut-off wall retardation factors (> 14.7) and decreasing the standard deviation of contaminant source distribution (< 0.1) can also improve the CGCW performance. Moreover, the analytical model coupled with the genetic algorithm is used for the CGCW leakage detection and performance prediction at an abandoned pesticide site based on the monitoring data. Accurate leakage detections in the field (with errors of < 5 m) can be achieved through the analytical solution, which is validated by the non-destructive high-voltage technique. The analytical solution can be an easy-to-use tool for the design, installation and construction of the CGCW at polluted sites.
40054248	Long-term trends of streamwater chemistry in an agricultural watershed: Effects of anthropogenic and climatic factors.	The chemistry of headwater streams is a key indicator of the health of riparian zones and surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. This chemistry is shaped by biogeochemical processes, including chemical weathering, and anthropogenic activities that interact with one another and are sensitive to climate. Elucidating trends in streamwater chemistry and the drivers that underpin them is essential for informing land-management decisions and anticipating water-quality issues that may affect downstream waters. In this work, we investigated the effects of anthropogenic and climatic factors on long-term variations in the chemistry of a first-order stream draining an agricultural catchment nested within the Sleepers River Research Watershed in Vermont, USA. We observed statistically significant increases in alkalinity and the concentrations of calcium and magnesium over a 31-year period for which 17 years of measurements were available. Through the application of generalized linear models, we found that the upward trends in alkalinity and calcium were associated with rising air temperatures, while a response to historical acid deposition played a minor role. We hypothesize that increased production of biogenic carbon dioxide and organic acids in soil and groundwater may lead to increases in chemical weathering rates under warmer climate conditions. This study emphasizes the important role of rising temperatures in the long-term increase in streamwater alkaline solutes, potentially overshadowing other influences like acidification recovery and agricultural practices. It also highlights the importance of comprehensive, long-term research to understand climate impacts on chemical weathering and inland water chemistry, which is critical for managing water quality and understanding regional and global carbon cycles.
40054241	An assessment of the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrate and trace element concentrations in groundwater in coastal districts of Bangladesh.	Groundwater is considered a significant source of drinking water around the world. However, the naturally occurring trace elements, mostly As, B, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn are proven to deteriorate the groundwater quality. This study aimed to evaluate the seasonal distribution of trace metals and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in groundwater and the associated risk to human health in the coastal region of Bangladesh. The result indicated that As exceeded the WHO and BDWS limits during wet and dry seasons in several coastal districts. Despite the abundant presence of Fe throughout the entire study area, it does not present any significant health risk. But alarming conditions of Mn have been observed all over the coastal area in both seasons. Aquifers with shallow depths showed to be more contaminated than deeper ones. The spatial distribution maps showed that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Cr were found in high concentration in some similar areas during the dry season. The studied elements showed a pattern in exceeding of WHO permissible limits such as Fe > Mn > As > Cr > NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in wet season and Mn > Fe > As > Cr > NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in dry season. Therefore, high non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk was found among adult and children population via oral exposure. Most of the samples showed cancer risk at medium to very high. The principal component analysis observed the pollution sources, revealing that groundwater contamination in this region was mostly due to geogenic sources. This study clearly showed that the groundwater in coastal districts is heavily contaminated, which is a concerning issue. The aforementioned findings have given some clarity on the coastal region's groundwater quality state, which can be beneficial in formulating a plan safe water supply.
40054240	Scarcity of pesticide data in New Zealand with a focus on neonicotinoids: A review.	Since Europe's 2018 neonicotinoid ban on outdoor use of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, there has been growing political, scientific, and public interest in further understanding the impact of neonicotinoids on bees and the environment. Here, we assessed the trends in pesticide use in New Zealand, with a particular focus on neonicotinoids, to aid discussion on their use and associated risks. Obtaining data on annual trends in pesticide quantities is challenging, as there is no central collection of pesticide data across the agrichemical or regulatory sectors in New Zealand. Consequently, the true scale and frequency of pesticide usage, including neonicotinoids, remain largely unknown. The difference in neonicotinoid use patterns between New Zealand, where 45 % of forage brassicas (annual planting) and pastures (infrequent planting) are grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds, and northern hemisphere countries, where 56 % to over 90 % of annual food crops rely on neonicotinoid-treated seeds, indicates a lower overall neonicotinoid use in New Zealand. This difference underscores the need for region-specific approaches to pesticide management and regulation. Although residues can persist and migrate in the soil, current regulations only consider the risk of foliar spray to protect honey bees, overlooking the potential risks to native bees, which primarily live underground, as well as wider lethal and sublethal impacts of residues on non-target organisms. The lack of publicly accessible pesticide data limits scientific research on non-target and environmental effects, and the absence of readily available substitutes for neonicotinoids is the key challenge to be overcome in order to better manage the impact of these pesticides on New Zealand ecosystems.
40054239	Long-term free-air-CO<sub>2</sub>-enrichment increases carbon distribution in the stable fraction in the deep layer of non-clay soils.	Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere can increase plant C input into soils. However, in dryland cropping systems, it remains unclear how eCO<sub>2</sub> may alter soil organic C content and stability in relation to potential changes in microbial community composition and whether these changes may depend on soil type and depth. Using an eight-year free-air-CO<sub>2</sub>-enrichment (SoilFACE) system, this study addressed these questions in three farming soils including a sandy Calcarosol, a clay Vertosol and a silt loam Chromosol at depths of 0-40 cm. Long-term eCO<sub>2</sub> did not change soil C content or its distribution in different C fractions in the top 30-cm soil. The majority of the relatively abundant bacterial taxa significantly affected by eCO<sub>2</sub> in the 0-10 cm layer were copiotrophic; this also occurred to fungal community, except for the Calcarosol where some saprotrophs showed a decreasing trend. These changes in microbial taxa indicate that eCO<sub>2</sub> accelerated the decomposition of both new and pre-existing C pools in the topsoil. Although eCO<sub>2</sub> did not change soil C content in the 30-40 cm layer, it increased soil C content in the stable C fraction associated with particles < 50 μm in the Calcarosol (by 39%) and particles < 2 μm in the Chromosol (by 29%). In the 30-40 cm layer of the Calcarosol, many fungal saprotrophs were enriched, and the abundance of fungal community increased under eCO<sub>2</sub>. Further investigation is warranted on whether the enhanced stability subsoil C under eCO<sub>2</sub> results from the leaching of stable organic molecules from the topsoil to the subsoil for buildup in the non-clay Calcarosol and Chromosol. Overall, these findings suggest that eCO<sub>2</sub> is likely to enhance soil C stability in the deeper parts of the profile of non-clay soils.
40054196	Biotic and abiotic drivers of soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and metal dynamic changes during spontaneous restoration of Pb-Zn mining wastelands.	The biotic and abiotic mechanisms that drive important biogeochemical processes (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and metals dynamics) in metal mine revegetation remains elusive. Metagenomic sequencing was used to explored vegetation, soil properties, microbial communities, functional genes and their impacts on soil processes during vegetation restoration in a typical Pb-Zn mine. The results showed a clear niche differentiation between bacteria, fungi and archaea. Compared to bacteria and fungi, the archaea richness were more tightly coupled with natural restoration changes. The relative abundances of CAZyme-related, denitrification-related and metal resistance genes reduced, while nitrification, urease, inorganic phosphorus solubilisation, phosphorus transport, and phosphorus regulation -related genes increased. Redundancy analysis, hierarchical partitioning analysis, relative-importance analysis and partial least squares path modelling, indicated that archaea diversity, primarily influenced by available lead, directly impacts carbon dynamics. Functional genes, significantly affected by available cadmium, directly alter nitrogen dynamics. Additionally, pH affects phosphorus dynamics through changes in bacterial diversity, while metal dynamics are directly influenced by vegetation. These insights elucidate natural restoration mechanisms in mine and highlight the importance of archaea in soil processes.
40054190	Impact of microplastic concentration on soil nematode communities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: Evidence from a field-based microcosms experiment.	Microplastics are an emerging pollutant that poses a threat to local ecosystems. Recent studies have revealed that microplastics have penetrated the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. While previous studies have investigated the migration and distribution of microplastics and their effects on soil properties, their effects on soil fauna communities remain underexplored. Here, we conducted a 1-year microplastic addition experiment to evaluate the responses of soil nematode communities and employed piecewise structural equation modeling to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of microplastics on these communities. We found that: (1) nematode abundance, diversity, and metabolic footprints exhibited a hump-shaped response to microplastic treatments, peaking at the 0.1 % treatment; (2) nematode biomass was significantly affected by microplastics, with the lowest biomass observed at the 10 % treatment; (3) the direct effects of microplastics on nematode abundance outweighed indirect effects, particularly influencing fungivores and omnivorous nematodes; (4) although microplastics did not significantly alter energy flow within nematode communities, the relationship between the energy flow of fungivores and omnivorous was stronger than those among other trophic groups. Our study offers insights on microplastics' impact on nematode communities and their varied responses to microplastic concentrations, crucial for understanding ecological effects on soil ecosystems.
40054189	Methods to optimize the collection, pretreatment, extraction, separation, and examination of microplastics in soil, groundwater, and human samples.	Microplastics (MPs) in soil, groundwater, and human (SGH) present a significant global challenge due to their ecological and human health impacts. However, current protocols for detecting MPs in these environments and humans are limited, inconsistently applied, and vary significantly, particularly during the pretreatment stages of MP analysis. Moreover, no study has investigated the impact of methodological flaws on MP detection. This study conducted a thorough global assessment of the existing soil and groundwater (SG) pretreatment methods, using statistical tests to evaluate their effectiveness. It also reviewed filtration and analytical techniques for MPs in SGH samples. The analysis included research articles from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science published between 2015 and 2024. Findings show that pretreatment using more than 100 g of soil can impact MP quantification, likely due to soil heterogeneity, while groundwater volume did not significantly affect MP quantification, likely due to the homogeneity of groundwater. During SGH pretreatment, various salts (e.g., ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl) can be used for density flotation. Fenton's reagent was found to be a better choice than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for organic material removal because less heat was released. Post treatment MPs in SGH samples can be analyzed using various instruments and resolutions such as FTIR down to 1-5 µm, ATR-FTIR down to 2 µm, micro-Raman down to 500 nm, and LDIR down to 1 µm. This study lays the foundation for developing an effective MP analysis in SGH.
40054134	Pseudomonas syringae exacerbates apple replant disease caused by Fusarium.	Apple replant disease (ARD) causes significant economic losses globally, including in China. Analyzing the causes of this replant disease from the perspective of rhizosphere microecology is therefore essential. In this study, we examined rhizosphere soils from apple trees subjected to continuous cropping. The mechanisms underlying ARD were elucidated through high-throughput sequencing of the soil microbiome, co-occurrence network analysis using NetShift, and correlation analyses. Core bacterial microbes were isolated, and their roles in altering the microecological environment were verified through reinoculation experiments. The results indicated that the disease indices for apple seedlings cultivated increased in continuously cropped soils. Bacterial diversity decreased in continuously cropped apple orchards for 10 years (R10) and 15 years (R15), but the relative abundance of Pseudomonas increased. In contrast, fungal diversity increased, with the relative abundance of Fusarium also increasing. As a dominant genus, Pseudomonas exhibited significant network variation after 10 years of consecutive cultivation, suggesting that this microorganism may play a key role in the occurrence of ARD. Moreover, the correlation analysis revealed, for the first time, that Pseudomonas is negatively correlated with bacterial diversity but positively correlated with the relative abundance of Fusarium, indicating a close relationship between Pseudomonas and Fusarium in continuously cropped soil. Four key Pseudomonas amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) strains were isolated from the continuously cropped rhizosphere soil of apple trees, and reinoculation experiments verified that introducing Pseudomonas exacerbated the occurrence of replant diseases in both strawberry and apple, with significantly higher disease indices compared to single Fusarium inoculation. The findings of this study provide new and timely insights into the mechanism underlying the occurrence of ARD.

40053538	Hygroscopic effect of high clay-content shale under temperature and humidity conditions and its impact on mechanical properties.	High clay-content shale, containing hydrophilic clay minerals, is highly sensitive to environmental temperature and humidity. It readily absorbs moisture from the air, leading to increased water content and reduced mechanical strength, which poses challenges for underground structures, such as mining roadways, tunnels, and storage chambers. This study investigates the influence of temperature and humidity on the water content of high clay-content shale during its hygroscopic process and examines the evolution of its mechanical properties under variations in water content, aiming to reveal the effects of environmental temperature and humidity on the mechanical behavior of high clay-content shale. Hygroscopic experiments were conducted using a temperature and humidity chamber, with quartz sand as non-clay mineral control groups, and strength experiments were performed on reconstituted shale samples with varying water content. Results from the hygroscopic experiments showed that the equilibrium water content (EWC) of high clay-content shale decreases with lower humidity and higher temperature. When the humidity decreased from 100% RH to 80% RH, the average EWC dropped from 15.88% to 7.53%. Under high-humidity conditions (100% RH), the EWC decreased to 11.92% only after the temperature increased to 30°C. Within the experimental conditions, reducing humidity was found to be more effective than increasing temperature in reducing EWC. Based on the mechanical test results, reducing humidity can decrease the loss of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) caused by moisture absorption from approximately 50% to 15.48%. The results indicate that humidity is the primary factor influencing the EWC and mechanical properties of high clay-content shale. Reducing humidity can significantly mitigate strength loss caused by moisture absorption, while increasing temperature plays a supplementary role. These findings provide a scientific basis for controlling temperature and humidity in underground engineering to enhance structural stability.
40053521	Redox-inactive CC-type glutaredoxins interfere with TGA transcription factor-dependent repression of target promoters in roots.	Changes in nitrogen (N) availability in the soil trigger transcriptional responses in plants to optimize N acquisition, allocation, and remobilization. In roots of N-starved Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants, transcriptional activation of genes encoding, for example, low-affinity nitrate transporters, depends on 4 related C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE DOWNSTREAM (CEPD) proteins, also known as ROXY6, ROXY7, ROXY8, and ROXY9. All 21 ROXYs found in A. thaliana interact with members of the TGACG-binding (TGA) family of transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate that 2 Clade I TGAs (TGA1, TGA4) serve as molecular links between CEPDs and their target promoters in roots. In the roxy6 roxy7 roxy8 roxy9 quadruple mutant (named cepd in this manuscript), transcriptional activation of N-starvation-inducible genes is impaired, most likely due to the association of Clade I TGAs with a repressive complex at their target promoters. In wild-type plants, this repressive complex is nonfunctional, and gene expression may be regulated by the N supply-regulated ratio of CEPDs over opposing ROXYs containing the TOPLESS-interacting ALWL motif. Although CEPDs resemble glutaredoxins with glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase activity, a ROXY9 variant with a mutation in the catalytic cysteine in its putative active site can confer wild-type-like regulation of target genes. This finding demonstrates that ROXY9 does not function through redox-dependent mechanisms.
40053150	pH induced incongruent-dissolution impacts Al-ferrihydrite transformations and As mobilization.	This study investigated the role of Al and As fate during the transformation process of ferrihydrite influenced by different pH values under oxic conditions. The results indicate that the Al doping greatly enhanced the transformation of ferrihydrite (Fh) to Al-substituted goethite at all acidic or alkaline pH values under oxic conditions by promoting the incongruent dissolution and reprecipitation reactions of Al-substituted ferrihydrite (AlFh). Under acidic conditions, the preferential dissolution of structural Fe (4.73 mg/L) from AlFh occurs, whereas under alkaline conditions, the preferential dissolution of structural Al (1.25 mg/L) takes place. In contrast, under neutral conditions, the low solubility of Fh and AlFh induces the significant particle assembly, with Fe/Al minerals primarily transforming into goethite through oriented aggregation. As predominantly remains in an adsorbed state at all pH values during the transformation of Fh and AlFh, with the highest proportion of adsorbed As (86.9-96.7%) observed under neutral conditions. During the aging process, the adsorbed As gradually transforms into non-extractable As, and the changes in As speciation within Fe/Al minerals are closely coupled with the transformation of AlFh and Fh. Under alkaline and acidic conditions, the proportion of non-extractable As in the transformation products of Fh and AlFh increases by 14.02-19.72% and 12.27-16.28%, respectively, while under neutral conditions, it increases only by 12-13.02%. Therefore, regulating soil pH can partially modify As speciation and mitigate its environmental impact by altering the mineral transformation process. The results of this study facilitate better understanding of the role of Al substitution in the transformation of Fh and the cycling of As in the environment.
40053144	Research on the traceability and treatment of nitrate pollution in groundwater: a comprehensive review.	The preservation of groundwater quality is essential for maintaining the integrity of the water ecological cycle. The preservation of groundwater quality is crucial for sustaining the integrity of the water ecological cycle. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) has emerged as a pervasive contaminant in groundwater, attracting significant research attention due to its extensive distribution and the potential environmental consequences it poses. The primary sources of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution include soil organic nitrogen, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, domestic sewage, industrial wastewater, landfill leachate, as well as organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers and manure. A comprehensive understanding of these sources is imperative for devising effective strategies to mitigate NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> contamination. Technologies for tracing NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-polluted groundwater include hydrochemical analysis, nitrogen and oxygen isotope techniques, microbial tracers, and numerical simulations. Quantitative isotope analysis frequently necessitates the application of mathematical models such as IsoSource, IsoError, IsoConc, MixSIR, SIAR, and MixSIAR to deduce the origins of pollution. This study provides a summary of the application scenarios, as well as the strengths and limitations of these models. In terms of remediation, pump and treat and permeable reactive barrier are predominant technologies currently employed. These approaches are designed to remove or reduce NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in groundwater, thereby restoring its quality. The study offers a systematic examination of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution, encompassing its origins, detection methodologies, and remediation approaches, highlighting the role of numerical simulations and integrating multidisciplinary knowledge. Additionally, this review delves into technological advancements and future trends concerning the detection and treatment of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pollution in groundwater. It proposes methods to control the spread of pollution and acts as a guide for identifying and preventing pollution sources.
40053052	Characterization of a G. max × G. soja nested association mapping population and identification of loci controlling seed composition traits from wild soybean.	Wild soybean (Glycine soja Siebold & Zucc.) has valuable genetic diversity for improved disease resistance, stress tolerance, seed protein content and seed sulfur-containing amino acid concentrations. Many studies have reported loci controlling seed composition traits based on cultivated soybean populations, but wild soybean has been largely overlooked. In this study, a nested association mapping (NAM) population consisting of 10 families and 1107 recombinant inbred lines was developed by crossing 10 wild accessions with the common cultivar NC-Raleigh. Seed composition of the F<sub>6</sub> generation grown at two locations was phenotyped, and genetic markers were identified for each line. The average number of recombination events in the wild soybean-derived population was significantly higher than that in the cultivated soybean-derived population, which resulted in a higher resolution for QTL mapping. Segregation bias in almost all NAM families was significantly biased toward the alleles of the wild soybean parent. Through single-family linkage mapping and association analysis of the entire NAM population, new QTLs with positive allele effects were identified from wild parents, including 5, 6, 18, 9, 16, 17 and 20 for protein content, oil content, total protein and oil content, methionine content, cysteine content, lysine content and threonine content, respectively. Candidate genes associated with these traits were identified based on gene annotations and gene expression levels in different tissues. This is the first study to reveal the genetic characteristics of wild soybean-derived populations, landscapes and the extent of effects of QTLs and candidate genes controlling traits from different wild soybean parents.
40052820	Checkpoint kinases regulate the circadian clock after DNA damage by influencing chromatin dynamics.	The interplay between circadian clocks, the cell cycle, and DNA repair has been extensively documented, yet the epigenetic control of circadian clocks by DNA damage responses remains relatively unexplored. Here, we showed that checkpoint kinases CHK1/2 regulate chromatin structure during DNA damage in Neurospora crassa to maintain robust circadian rhythms. Under DNA damage stress, deletion of chk1/2 disrupted the rhythmic transcription of the clock gene frq by suppressing the rhythmic binding of the transcription activator White Collar complex (WCC) at the frq promoter, as the chromatin structure remained condensed. Mechanistically, CHK1/2 interacted with WC-2 and were recruited by WCC to bind at the frq promoter to phosphorylate H3T11, promoting H3 acetylation, especially H3K56 acetylation, to counteract the histone variant H2A.Z deposition, thereby establishing a suitable chromatin state to maintain robust circadian rhythms despite DNA damage. Additionally, a genome-wide correlation was discovered between H3T11 phosphorylation and H3K56 acetylation, showing a specific function at the frq promoter that is dependent on CHK1/2. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that CHK1/2 are responsible for robust rhythmic transcription of metabolic and DNA repair genes during DNA damage. These findings highlight the essential role of checkpoint kinases in maintaining robust circadian rhythms under DNA damage stress.
40052550	Improving phosphorus availability in saline-alkaline agricultural soils through biochar and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) inoculation: a greenhouse experiment.	Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for life on earth and a limiting nutrient for plant growth. However, its availability in saline-alkaline soils is significantly reduced, adversely affecting plant productivity. Saline-alkaline soil is a widespread problem that severely affects plant growth and productivity. The <i>Parthenium</i>-derived biochar (PB) and Sewage sludge-derived biochar (SSB) were analyzed for pH, electric conductivity (EC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), calorific values (CV), and surface area (SSA). The phosphate solubilizing index (SI; 2.83 mM) and quantitative analysis (521.5 µg ml<sup>-1</sup>) were suggested that PSB-01 efficient and the strain identified through 16S rRNA sequencing techniques. The experiment was based on completely randomized block design (CRBD) with triplicates. The results revealed that the application of PB, SSB, and PSB-01 significantly improved <i>Spinacia oleracea</i> (<i>S. oleracea</i>) growth as compared to the control. The highest growth was observed in the combined amendments as compared to single once in both 1% and 3%. The highest reduction in cation and anion concentrations was observed in the combined applications of PB, SSB and PSB-01 for 1% and 3%. The combined application of biochar along with PSB-01 can enhance soil properties (pH, CEC, SSA anoins and cations) and promote plant growth, offering a sustainable solution for saline-alkaline agricultural soil. This study employs an innovative approach by combining biochars derived from <i>Parthenium</i> and sewage sludge with phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSBs) to address multiple issues simultaneously: mitigating saline-alkaline soil, controlling <i>Parthenium</i> overgrowth, and managing sewage sludge problems.
40052378	Betaproteobacterial clade II nosZ activated under high N2O concentrations in paddy soil microcosms.	Microbial communities in paddy soils act as potential sinks of nitrous oxide (N2O), a notorious greenhouse gas, but their potential to reduce external N2O is unclear. The direct observation of N2O reduction in submerged field soils is technically difficult. Here, we aimed to identify soil microbial clades that underpin the strong N2O mitigation capacity.
40052351	Marine bacterium Cobetia sp. strain GM produces fucose-rich extracellular polymeric substance.	Several extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria have beneficial applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries as gelling agents, stabilizers, thickeners, and bioactive ingredients. Most commercialized EPS are derived from soil bacteria, but studies on EPS produced by marine bacteria are scarce. We isolated a marine bacterium Cobetia sp. strain GM, which produces viscous EPS (glycoprotein). Viscosity measurement showed that the EPS of strain GM (GM-EPS) was comparable to commercialized bacterial EPS. Among the tested Cobetia strains, GM-EPS and C. crustatorum EPS were significantly more viscous than other known Cobetia spp. The major constituents of GM-EPS polysaccharide were fucose, glucose, and galactose, which was distinct from exopolysaccharide of known Cobetia spp. This is the first report of a Cobetia sp. strain that produces fucose-rich EPS. GM-EPS protein was rich in hydrophobic and uncharged nonpolar amino acids. GM-EPS exhibited strong emulsion-stabilizing activity that was 1.5 times higher than xanthan.
40052334	Genome and Metagenome Skimming: Future Sequencing Methods for Environmental DNA (eDNA) Studies.	Genome skimming (GS), also referred to as low-coverage shotgun sequencing, is an efficient and cost-effective sequencing method that targets high-copy regions in genomes. It is most commonly used for species identification, phylogenetic analysis and expansion of reference libraries. GS can be applied to single species or composite DNA samples representing multiple species; the latter is termed metagenome skimming (MGS). GS/MGS shows promise as an effective approach for environmental DNA (eDNA) studies, but it is currently limited to ancient sedimentary samples. There is the potential to expand this methodology to other eDNA sources, including water, soil and airborne samples. In this paper, we introduce GS/MGS and briefly review its current applications. We also discuss the potential benefits and challenges of using GS/MGS to assay eDNA. eDNA GS/MGS is a promising technology that could broaden eDNA studies if some methodological challenges can be addressed.
40052326	Human activity, not environmental factors, drives Scedosporium and Lomentospora distribution in Taiwan.	Scedosporium and Lomentospora species are emerging fungal pathogens capable of causing severe infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Previous environmental surveys have suggested potential associations between these fungi and various soil chemical parameters, though the relative influence of human activity versus environmental factors has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we conducted a comprehensive survey of 406 soil samples from 132 locations across Taiwan, analyzing fungal abundance alongside soil physicochemical parameters and the Human Footprint Index (HFI). We recovered 236 fungal isolates comprising 10 species, with S. boydii (32.2%), S. apiospermum (30.9%), and S. dehoogii (14.4%) being the most prevalent. The highest fungal burdens were observed in urban environments (up to 1293 CFU/g), particularly in public spaces and healthcare facilities. Statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between fungal abundance and HFI (r = 0.143, P = 0.005), while soil chemical parameters including nitrogen, carbon, pH, electrical conductivity, and various base cations showed no significant associations despite their wide ranges. These findings indicate that anthropogenic disturbance of environments, rather than soil chemistry, is the primary driver of Scedosporium and Lomentospora distribution in Taiwan. This understanding holds important implications for predicting infection risks and developing targeted public health strategies, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions. Future studies incorporating more specific indicators of human impact may further elucidate the mechanisms underlying these distribution patterns.
40052297	Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics of Plant-Soil Feedbacks Explain the Spread Potential of a Plant Invader Under Climate Warming and Biocontrol Herbivory.	Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) can contribute to the success of invasive plants. Despite strong evidence that plant genetic traits influence soil microbial communities and vice versa, empirical evidence exploring these feedbacks over evolutionary timescales, especially under climate change, remains limited. We conducted a 5-year field study of the annual invasive plant, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., to examine how selection under climate warming and biocontrol insect herbivory shapes plant population genetics, soil properties, and microbial communities. After four generations under warming and herbivory, we collected seeds of the F<sub>4</sub> plant populations together with their conditioned soil for a common garden PSF experiment to explore how resulting PSFs patterns are influencing the performance and spread potential of Ambrosia under changing environmental conditions. This is especially relevant because our recent predictions point to a northward spread of Ambrosia in Europe and Asia under climate change, outpacing the spread of its insect biocontrol agent. We discovered that warming and herbivory significantly but differentially altered plant genetic composition and its soil microbial communities, with less pronounced effects on soil physicochemical properties. Our results indicate that both herbivory and warming generated negative PSFs. These negative PSFs favored plant growth of the seeds from the persistent soil seed bank growing in the conditioned soil under insect herbivory, and by this maintaining the Ambrosia population genetic diversity. They also enhanced the spread potential of warming-selected plant offspring, especially from warmer (southern) to colder (northern) climates. This can be explained by the observed decrease in soil pathogens occurrence under insect herbivory and by the especially strong genetic changes in plant populations under climate warming. Our findings provide insights into how climate warming and biocontrol management affect eco-evolutionary interactions between invasive plant populations and their soil environments, which are critical for predicting invasion dynamics in the context of global change.
40052246	Stomata-Photosynthesis Synergy Mediates Combined Heat and Salt Stress Tolerance in Sugarcane Mutant M4209.	Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is an economically important long-duration crop which is currently facing concurrent heat waves and soil salinity. The present study evaluates an inducible salt-tolerant sugarcane mutant M4209, developed via radiation-induced mutagenesis of elite check variety Co 86032, under heat (42/30°C; day/night), NaCl (200 mM) or heat + NaCl (HS)-stress conditions. Though heat application significantly improved plant growth and biomass in both genotypes, this beneficial impact was partially diminished in Co 86032 under HS-stress conditions, coinciding with higher Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation and lower triacylglycerol levels. Besides, heat broadly equalised the negative impact on NaCl stress in terms of various physiological and biochemical attributes in both the genotypes, indicating its spaciotemporal advantage. The simultaneous up- and downregulation of antagonistic regulators, epidermal patterning factor (EPF) 9 (SoEPF9) and SoEPF2, respectively attributed to the OSD (Open Small Dense) stomatal phenotype in M4209, which resulted into enhanced conductance, transpirational cooling and gaseous influx. This led to improved photoassimilation, which was supported by higher plastidic:nonplastidic lipid ratio, upregulation of SoRCA (Rubisco activase) and better source strength, resulting in overall plant growth enhancement across all the tested stress scenarios. Taken together, the present study emphasised the knowledge-driven harnessing of stomatal-photosynthetic synergy for ensuring global sugarcane productivity, especially under "salt-heat" coupled stress scenarios.
40052218	MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 synergistically regulate arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and the transcription of MdPHT1;13, enhancing phosphorus uptake in apple rootstocks.	Phosphorus in the soil is easily chelated into forms that are unavailable to plants, leading to phosphorus deficiency, which severely affects the growth, development, and fruit quality of apple trees. To address phosphorus deficiency, we used four different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to investigate their effects on the growth and development of apple rootstocks and phosphorus uptake in the soil. We identified Glomus mosseae (Gm) fungi as the most effective AMF for promoting growth and found that under phosphorus-deficient conditions, inoculating with Gm fungi promoted the growth of the above-ground parts of the plants and phosphorus absorption, while it inhibited root growth. After inoculating with Gm fungi, we found phosphorus starvation response factors (PHRs) and auxin response factors (ARFs) were upregulated. Knockdown of MdPHR2 or MdARF6-4 resulted in decreased root arbuscular structures, total mycorrhizal colonization rate, and root phosphorus content, indicating that MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 positively regulate the symbiosis of Gm fungi and phosphorus absorption. In contrast, overexpressing MdARF6-4 led to reduced root development but increased root phosphorus content under Gm fungi inoculation, suggesting that MdARF6-4 is involved in Gm-mediated phosphorus absorption and root development. Moreover, both MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 directly bound to the promoter area of the downstream phosphorus transporter MdPHT1;13, and these two transcription factors interacted with each other in vivo and in vitro. In summary, our study demonstrates that the interaction between MdPHR2 and MdARF6-4 synergistically regulates the Gm symbiosis and the transcription of MdPHT1;13, thereby promoting phosphorus absorption in apple rootstocks.
40052202	Timescale Matters: Finer Temporal Resolution Influences Driver Contributions to Global Soil Respiration.	Understanding the dynamics of soil respiration (R<sub>s</sub>) and its environmental drivers is crucial for accurately modeling terrestrial carbon fluxes. However, current methodologies often lead to divergent estimates and rely on annual predictions that may overlook critical interactions occurring at seasonal scales. A critical knowledge gap lies in understanding how temporal resolution affects both R<sub>s</sub> predictions and their environmental drivers. Here, we employ deep learning models to predict global R<sub>s</sub> at monthly (MRM) and annual (ARM) scales from 1982 to 2018. We then consider three main drivers potentially affecting R<sub>s</sub>, including temperature, precipitation, and a vegetation proxy (leaf area index; LAI). Our models demonstrate strong predictive capabilities with global R<sub>s</sub> estimation of 79.4 ± 5.7 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> for the MRM and 78.3 ± 7.5 Pg C year<sup>-1</sup> for ARM (mean ± SD). While the difference in global estimations between both models is small, there are notable disparities in the spatial contribution of dominant drivers. The MRM highlights an influence of both temperature and LAI, while the ARM emphasizes a dominant role of precipitation. These findings underscore the critical role of temporal resolution in capturing seasonal variations and identifying key R<sub>s</sub>-environment relationships that annual models may obscure. High temporal resolution R<sub>s</sub> predictions, such as those provided by the MRM, are essential for capturing nuanced seasonal interactions between R<sub>s</sub> and its drivers, refining carbon flux models, detecting critical seasonal thresholds, and enhancing the reliability of future Earth system predictions. This work highlights the need for further research into monthly and seasonal R<sub>s</sub> variations, as well as higher timescale resolutions, to advance our understanding of ecosystem carbon dynamics in a rapidly changing climate.

40052080	﻿Fungal fairy rings: history, ecology, dynamics and engineering functions.	Fungal fairy rings (FFR) are fascinating natural phenomena that have intrigued people and scientists for centuries. These patterns, often represented by circular distributions of altered vegetation, are found in grasslands and forest habitats. Fairy rings occur when fungi grow radially in the soil, raising from a central point, progressively degrading organic matter and thus affecting vegetation. The observation of such spatial patterns allows mycologists to conduct an in-depth analysis of the role of fungi in ecosystems. This review presents the current knowledge and scientific advancement of the studies of FFRs. An historical appraisal from the most representative pioneer studies until recent works is presented in different scientific fields, including microbiology, chemistry, botany and ecology. Based on a deep analysis of bibliographic data, we synopsised different aspects of FFRs: i) history of studies, ii) taxonomy, iii) ecology (environmental conditions and biogeography), iv) classification of vegetation patterns, v) spatial dynamics, vi) role as ecosystem engineer (impact on soil chemistry, plants and microbiota). In conclusion, beside still open research areas requiring further investigation, a schematic functional model of fungal fairy rings is proposed, in which on one hand the dynamics of the fungal mycelium is explained by self-DNA accumulation and the build-up of autotoxicity. On the other hand, the effects of fungi on plants are related to the intermingled and differently spatially distributed effects of hydrophobicity, phytotoxicity and phytostimulation.
40052075	﻿Characterisation and comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes of false, yellow, black and blushing morels provide insights on their structure and evolution.	<i>Morchella</i> species have considerable significance in terrestrial ecosystems, exhibiting a range of ecological lifestyles along the saprotrophism-to-symbiosis continuum. However, the mitochondrial genomes of these ascomycetous fungi have not been thoroughly studied, thereby impeding a comprehensive understanding of their genetic makeup and ecological role. In this study, we analysed the mitogenomes of 30 <i>Morchellaceae</i> species, including yellow, black, blushing and false morels. These mitogenomes are either circular or linear DNA molecules with lengths ranging from 217 to 565 kbp and GC content ranging from 38% to 48%. Fifteen core protein-coding genes, 28-37 <i>tRNA</i> genes and 3-8 <i>rRNA</i> genes were identified in these <i>Morchellaceae</i> mitogenomes. The gene order demonstrated a high level of conservation, with the <i>cox1</i> gene consistently positioned adjacent to the <i>rnS</i> gene and <i>cob</i> gene flanked by <i>apt</i> genes. Some exceptions were observed, such as the rearrangement of <i>atp6</i> and <i>rps3</i> in <i>Morchellaimportuna</i> and the reversed order of <i>atp6</i> and <i>atp8</i> in certain morel mitogenomes. However, the arrangement of the <i>tRNA</i> genes remains conserved. We additionally investigated the distribution and phylogeny of homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) of the LAGLIDADG (LAGs) and GIY-YIG (GIYs) families. A total of 925 LAG and GIY sequences were detected, with individual species containing 19-48HEGs. These HEGs were primarily located in the <i>cox1</i>, <i>cob</i>, <i>cox2</i> and <i>nad5</i> introns and their presence and distribution displayed significant diversity amongst morel species. These elements significantly contribute to shaping their mitogenome diversity. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the phylogeny and evolution of the <i>Morchellaceae</i>.
40052072	﻿Just the tip of the iceberg: uncovering a hyperdiverse clade of African <i>Russula</i> (<i>Basidiomycota</i>, <i>Russulales</i>, <i>Russulaceae</i>) species with signs of evolutionary habitat adaptations.	The diversity within the ectomycorrhizal genus Russula (Basidiomycota) in West Africa is largely unexplored. The study area was Benin, where only ten out of the 159 species endemic to tropical Africa have been previously reported. We focused on "<i>Afrovirescentinae</i>", which is a monophyletic lineage within Russulasubgen.Heterophyllidiaesister tosubsect.Virescentinae. The phylogenetic placement of this clade was analysed using sequence data from ITS, LSU, mtSSU, <i>tef1</i>, <i>rpb1</i> and <i>rpb2</i> regions. Ten "<i>Afrovirescentinae</i>" species are recognised, described and illustrated from Benin. Four of them, <i>R.carmesina</i>, <i>R.hiemisilvae</i>, <i>R.inflata</i> and <i>R.sublaevis</i>, were previously published. Five species, <i>Russulaacrialbida</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, <i>R.beenkenii</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, <i>R.coronata</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, <i>R.florae</i> <b>sp. nov.</b> and <i>R.spectabilis</i> <b>sp. nov.</b>, are newly described. Species within this group are characterised by densely reticulated spore ornamentation, but they exhibit considerable variation in field appearance and pileipellis structure. In gallery forests, their basidiomata are ephemeral, small and their basidiospores have prominent ornamentation; while in savannah woodlands, the basidiomata are fleshy, large and basidiospores present low ornamentation. We suggest that these morphological traits may represent evolutionary adaptations to a specific environmental condition. We analysed the species richness, ecological range and distribution of the "<i>Afrovirescentinae</i>" clade globally based on data from the UNITE database, estimating a total diversity of 94 species primarily distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in the Neotropics. Four additional previously described species not detected in Benin were assigned to this clade, based on holotype sequencing. Several species are widely distributed across tropical Africa and do not show specificity regarding their associated plant symbionts.

40051883	Wood density can best predict carbon stock in the forest aboveground biomass following restoration in a post open limestone mining in a tropical region.	Reforestation has been widely considered to best solve this problem, but this requires an accurate estimation of carbon stocks in the forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at a large scale. AGB models based on traits and remote sensing indices (moisture vegetation index (MVI)) are the two good methods for this purpose. But limited studies have developed them to estimate carbon stock in AGB during restoration of degraded mining areas.
