40066487	Mesoporous Nanogel Sprays as Universal Evaporation Interface Modifiers for Boosting Water-Cluster Evaporation.	Accelerating water evaporation is vital for processes like photosynthesis, dehydration, and desalination. Optimizing the pore structure and interfacial properties of evaporative materials can reduce evaporation enthalpy and increase efficiency. However, integrating the evaporation interface with water transport channels poses significant design challenges and complicates low-enthalpy evaporation analysis. To address these challenges, a hydrophilic nanovesicle gel is developed with a hydrophobic mesoporous structure as an ideal spray. This spray effectively upgrades their interface of universal substrates (including PVA hydrogels, balsa wood, nanofiltration membrane, cellulose paper, nylon fabrics, etc.), enabling the simple preparation of evaporation materials. The sprayed samples, at a low spraying dose of 40 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>, achieved evaporation rates of 1.58 and 3.26 kg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> under 0.5 and 1 sun irradiance, which are 297% and 268% higher than their respective substrates. These nanogels offer benefits like edibility, low cost, ease of use, and compatibility with various substrates, showing great potential in seawater desalination, dehydration technology, crop yield enhancement, and coating/paint drying. More importantly, this work highlights the need for researchers to focus on the surface structure of materials, rather than merely using bulk gels, in the development of high-performance evaporative materials.
40066327	An Unexplored Diversity for Adaptation of Germination to High Temperatures in <i>Brassica</i> Species.	Elevated temperatures inhibit the germination of a concerning number of crop species. One strategy to mitigate the impact of warming temperatures is to identify and introgress adaptive genes into elite germplasm. Diversity must be sought in wild populations, coupled with an understanding of the complex pattern of adaptation across a broad range of landscapes. By investigating the landraces, wild, and feral populations of Algeria, Italy, France, Slovenia, Spain, and Tunisia, we assessed the response of germination to temperature increase in an unexplored diversity of 117 accessions of <i>Brassica rapa</i> and 66 of <i>Brassica oleracea</i>. Our results show that both species exhibit heat tolerance to the temperature range tested, especially <i>B. rapa</i>, with an increase in speed and uniformity of germination time, as well as an increase in germination rate as temperature increased. As for <i>B. oleracea</i> accessions, the ability to germinate under heat conditions depended on the geographical origin; in particular, southern populations showed a higher germination rate than northern populations, possibly in relation to their warmer climates of origin. These findings highlight the complex interplay between domestication, feralization, and current agronomic practices in shaping germination characteristics in <i>Brassica</i> species.

Incorporating straw into the soil is a sustainable practice that can mitigate some of the adverse effects of excessive N fertilization on soil structure degradation and microbial diversity reduction.
40066158	The long non-coding RNA MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module regulates phosphate accumulation and disease resistance to <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> in pear.	Pear ring rot disease (<i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i>) is a significant threat to the healthy development of the pear industry. Recent research has identified the functional role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in various biological processes of plants. The role of lncRNAs in the pear defense response remains unknown. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze lncRNAs in pear stem infected with <i>B. dothidea</i>. It identified 3555 lncRNAs, of which 286 were significantly differentially expressed. GO and KEGG analyses showed that <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-regulated target genes were enriched in multiple disease resistance-related pathways. More specifically, MSTRG.32189, predicted as an endogenous target mimic (eTM), was significantly down-regulated in response to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection, and was confirmed to inhibit the cleavage effect of PcmiR399b on <i>PcUBC24.</i> OE-MSTRG.32189 transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> exhibited lower Pi content and weaker disease resistance to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> compared with wild type. In pear callus, overexpression of MSTRG.32189 negatively regulated PcmiR399b, which decreased Pi content and reduced disease resistance. Overexpressing PcmiR399b in pear callus exhibited the opposite effects compared with OE-MSTRG.32189. Overexpression and knockout of <i>PcUBC24</i> further clarified that <i>PcUBC24</i> negatively regulates Pi content and disease resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection. Furthermore, the ROS levels and expressions of disease resistance pathway-related genes were regulated by the MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module in transgenic pear callus, which contributed to disease resistance. Overall, our results demonstrated the role of lncRNAs in the pear defense response, revealing that the MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module regulates phosphate accumulation and disease resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection in pear.
40065924	Quantitative Ethnobotany of Multiple-Use Species and Management of the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	The Yangambi Biosphere Reserve (YBR) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) faces significant challenges regarding the livelihoods of local communities and biodiversity conservation. The lack of scientific information on the spatial distribution of useful woody species hinders sustainable forest resource management and is a development constraint. This study was conducted in the villages of Yaselia, Lilanda, and Bagbanye on the outskirts of the protected area and aimed to identify the most useful woody species, analyze their socio-cultural value, assess their uses based on local community involvement, and evaluate their abundance beyond village forests to contribute to reforestation and conservation policies. An ethnobotanical survey of 105 households and a forest inventory of 9 ha were conducted to assess the abundance of 29 useful woody species. The results revealed that species such as <i>Entandrophragma cylindricum</i> (Sprague) Sprague and Hoyle<i>, Petersianthus macrocarpus</i> (P.Beauv.) Liben, <i>Ricinodendron heudelotii</i> (Baill.) Pierre ex Heckel, <i>Scorodophloeus zenkeri</i> Harms, <i>Pentaclethra macrophylla</i> Benth., <i>Uapaca guineensis</i> Müll.Arg., <i>Blighia welwitschii</i> (Hiern) Radlk., <i>Chrysophyllum lacourtianum</i> De Wild., <i>Dacryodes edulis</i> (G.Don) H.J.Lam, <i>and Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</i> (De Wild.) J.Léonard have high use and cultural value for local communities. The forest inventory showed that primary forests are better represented in terms of abundance and biomass of species with high use and cultural value, while fallow lands are less diverse and dominated by small-diameter trees. However, most of the useful species identified with high use and cultural value have low density/biomass or are absent in most of the plots in secondary forests and fallow land. These results underscore the urgent need to implement sustainable management strategies that include these species through traditional agroforestry projects. Such initiatives would enhance resource valorization, support local livelihoods, and reduce pressure on the YBR, contributing to the preservation of this biodiversity sanctuary and the promotion of sustainable forest management in the region.
40065792	Divergent response associates with the differential amplitudes of immunity against <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> by different blast resistance genes.	Rice blast disease, caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, poses the most devastating threat to global rice production. The products of most blast resistance (<i>R</i>) genes specifically recognize corresponding a virulence effectors from the pathogen, thereby mediating robust immune responses that are crucial for disease resistance. However, it is unclear why different <i>R</i> genes endow with differential amplitudes of immunity against <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>. Here, we demonstrated that different blast <i>R</i> genes confer differential amplitudes of immunity against <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>, presumably due to divergent reprogramming of transcriptional responses. We detected that three rice restorer lines exhibited differential amplitudes of immune responses, despite all lines displaying resistance to <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>. Consistently, different accessions carrying different single <i>R</i> genes exhibited remarkable differentially expressed genes (DEGs) count, indicating different transcriptional re-programming that leads to different fitness cost. Comparative analysis revealed varying degrees of overlap among DEGs across different accessions. By integrating RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data, we recommended some marker genes that distinguish the differential amplitude of immunity against <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i> mediated by different blast <i>R</i> genes. Thus, our study provides valuable insights into the specific and overlapping roles of <i>R</i> gene-mediated immunity. We also propose marker genes that can be used to effectively evaluate the amplitude of immune responses to <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>, thereby facilitating the assessment of <i>R</i> genes with relatively lower amplitude of immunity in order to minimize fitness cost.
40065785	Empowering vital fruit crops with enhanced nutritional contents.	Increasing the nutritional value of any crop plant through various Conventional or non-Conventional methods is known as Biofortification. Deficiency of proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals leads to ailing health and increased vulnerability to various diseases, which in turn lead to uncountable and unpredicted loss in Gross Domestic Product leading to poor economic growth of the country. It is forthcoming and cost-effective approach that will provide a balance of micronutrient deficiency among the people of developing & underdeveloped nations not having the availability to diverse nutritional access. The Biofortified varieties not only provide required calories but also essential nutrients needed for proper growth and development of an individual. It is advantageous in combating malnutrition and hidden hunger by enhancing the micronutrient content of commonly consumed fruits. By increasing essential vitamins, minerals, and beneficial compounds through methods like traditional breeding, genetic engineering, and agronomic practices, biofortified fruits provide a sustainable solution to address deficiencies in regions with limited access to diverse foods. For instance, mango, guava, papaya, and citrus have been improved to offer higher levels of nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin C, and beta-carotene. This makes biofortified fruits a cost-effective way to enhance nutrition, particularly for vulnerable populations, helping to reduce the risks associated with hidden hunger and malnutrition. One of the important targets of United Nation is to provide fortified food enriched with important minerals to the targeted undernourished population in different parts of the world. The lack of essential nutrients, notably minerals such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and vitamin A, is one of the main causes of "hidden hunger", especially in underdeveloped nations. The review covers most of the important aspects of Biofortification in important fruit crops.
40065769	Unveiling functional module associated with fungal disease stress in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>).	Fungal infections pose a considerable threat to the cultivation of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and often limit the crop yield. During infection, the transcriptome undergoes extensive reprogramming involving several regulatory pathways. To address this complexity, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis and co-expression network analysis using rigorously curated RNA-seq datasets from three different fungal diseases. Pre-processing of the data, including batch effect correction, ensured high-quality integration of the datasets. Module-trait relationship (MTR) analysis identified functional modules associated with fungal disease response. Hub genes within these modules were prioritized by multi-model centrality analyses using Cytoscape, which considered the metrics Degree, Closeness, Betweenness and Maximum Clique Centrality together with the MCODE algorithm to detect densely connected subclusters. These hub genes were further validated by cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and achieved AUC values greater than 0.7, confirming their robustness. A total of 6688 consistently expressed genes were identified, including 879 upregulated and 701 downregulated genes. Co-expression networks revealed 19 different gene modules, six of which were significantly associated with the response of barley to fungal infection. The blue module in particular was associated with immune responses such as activation of the MAPK cascade and pathogen recognition, while the green module correlated with defence mechanisms and secondary metabolism. The hub genes within these modules showed high predictive power for fungal resistance, as shown by the AUC values of the ROC curve of over 0.7, emphasizing their potential as biomarkers. This study uniquely integrates multiple RNA-seq datasets to identify novel regulatory networks and hub genes, including 345 transcription factors (TFs) from different families, with MYB and bHLH being particularly abundant. The results provide valuable insights into regulatory networks associated with fungal disease response in barley. These results can support genomic selection and marker-assisted breeding programs and accelerate the development of resistant varieties.
40065586	Environmental and Breed-Related Determinants of Bovine Ephemeral Fever Outbreaks in Southeastern Türkiye.	Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is a biphasic febrile, vector-borne viral disease affecting cattle and buffaloes, leading to significant reductions in milk production and economic losses. BEF's episodic nature often leads to its classification as non-notifiable disease.
40065494	The DNA N6-adenine methylation target gene GhMAF1 promotes fiber initiation at the base of Gossypium ovules.	DNA methylation consists of 5-methylcytosine and N6-methyl deoxyadenosine (6mA) and is crucial in plant development. However, its specific role and potential mechanism to initiate cotton fibers remain unclear. This study employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to analyze DNA methylation alterations in ZM24 and ZM24 fuzzless-lintless (ZM24fl) during fiber initiation. Our results indicated that DNA 6mA methylation exhibited the most remarkable difference among ovule samples at -2, 0, and 5 d post anthesis of ZM24 and ZM24fl. Subsequently, genes with significant changes in DNA 6mA methylation and transcription during fiber initiation were screened. We found that GhMAF1 displayed significant transcriptional upregulation and 6mA enrichment in its promoter, which could serve as a potential target for DNA 6mA in fiber initiation. Further, we knocked out GhMAF1 using CRISPR-Cas technology and demonstrated that GhMAF1 specifically promotes the initiation of fiber cells at the base of the ovule by mediating the downstream JAZ2/CPC-MML3/MML4 pathway. These findings unveil a novel spatial module of fiber cell initiation on the ovule surface that involves GhMAF1. Ultimately, this work provides significant knowledge for the regulatory network of DNA 6mA modification in fiber initiation to improve fiber yield and quality.

40065399	Precise engineering of gene expression by editing plasticity.	Identifying transcriptional cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and understanding their role in gene expression are essential for the precise manipulation of gene expression and associated phenotypes. This knowledge is fundamental for advancing genetic engineering and improving crop traits.
40065196	Development of a tetraplex reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay for three carlaviruses and an ilarvirus infecting hop and viral titer quantification in different tissue types.	The hop plant (Humulus lupulus) is an economically important perennial species of plant due to its role in beer production. While the majority of hop production occurs in central Washington State, local production in regions around the United States is gaining popularity due to local micro-breweries wanting to use locally grown hops in their production. In Florida, production has recently increased, and while most hop plants are grown from tissue culture, the development of a cost-effective diagnostic assay for hop viruses is critical to ensure planting material is clean. In this study, a tetraplex RT-dPCR assay was developed for the detection of four common hop viruses; Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), Hop mosaic virus (HMV), Hop latent virus (HLV) and American hop latent virus (AHLV). A synthetic control was generated with corresponding viral sequences inserted in tandem for optimization. Stem, petiole, and leaf tissue sampled from each of three different cultivars with different viral profiles were screened with the tetraplex RT-dPCR assay. Across all tissue types and cultivars, HLV had the highest titer level, followed by HMV and ApMV having the lowest levels. Additionally, there were significant levels of variation among tissue types across cultivars. These data highlight the utility of this assay for detecting viruses in hop tissue and provide a useful diagnostic tool for screening hop plants to confirm they are healthy. This assay will be utilized in vector studies but also integrated into diagnostic services.
40065195	Evidence for an Asian origin of Sorghum Mosaic Virus Infecting Sugarcane in Louisiana and the Western Hemisphere.	Three viruses causing mosaic-like symptoms in sugarcane and related grasses, namely sorghum mosaic virus (SrMV), sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), and sugarcane streak mosaic virus (SCSMV), have been reported in Louisiana since 1919. In this study, complete genome-coding sequences (9168-9240 nt) were obtained for mosaic viruses from 36 symptomatic leaf samples of cultivated and wild sugarcane and one sample of silver grass. These samples represented historical diseased plants that were collected in Louisiana from the 1940s to the early 2020s. SrMV sequences were obtained from 35 sugarcane samples whereas a SCMV sequence was recovered from one. Miscanthus sinensis mosaic virus (MsiMV) was identified in the silver grass sample. Virus populations of SrMV from the USA and from China differed based on phylogenetic investigations of the complete genome-coding sequence of 59 virus isolates. Recombination events and the greater diversity of SrMV in China suggested that the virus occurring in the USA originated from Asia. All SrMV isolates from the Americas (Argentina, Louisiana, Paraguay, and Texas) also grouped together in a phylogenetic tree based on the coat protein sequence of 683 worldwide virus isolates. These isolates of the Western Hemisphere differed from the isolates from Asia (China, Myanmar, and Vietnam). The isolates of SrMV from the USA, including pathogenic strains H, I, and M, belonged to the same phylogenetic lineage, thus suggesting that the pathogenic variation of the virus needs further investigations and application of strict quarantine measures to avoid further spread of SrMV among sugarcane-producing locations.
40065116	Biofertilizers containing plant growth promoting rhizobacteria enhance nutrient uptake and improve the growth and yield of chickpea plants in an arid environment.	Integrated nutrient management is anticipated as an environmentally friendly method toward sustainable agricultural development and optimum crop production with reduced environmental impacts. In the present study, the pastel sulfur (SPA), powdered sulfur (SPO), sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB), phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), and potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB) were applied. The experimental treatments included (1) SPA, (2) SPO, (3) SOB, (4) SPA + SOB, (5) SPO + SOB, (6) SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (7) SPO + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (8) SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB, (9) NFB + PSB + KSB, and (10) control. The result demonstrated that the application of biofertilizers increased soil bacterial population, photosynthetic pigment content, and grain yield. The highest photosynthetic pigments were observed in NFB + PSB + KSB. The greatest nitrogen fixation nodules and active nodules percentage were recorded in SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB. The biofertilizers enhanced the grain, plant, and soil N, P, and K contents compared with the control. The maximum number of pods per plant, biological yield, grain yield, and 100-grain weight were obtained from SPO + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB and SPA + SOB + NFB + PSB + KSB. Overall, biofertilizers could be a key strategy to maintain soil quality toward agricultural sustainability.
40064938	Time series analysis of Sentinel 1 A SAR data to retrieve annual rice area maps and long-term dynamics of start of season.	Rice is a vital staple crop globally, and accurate estimation of rice area was crucial for effective agricultural management and food security. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has emerged as a valuable remote sensing tool for rice area estimation due to its ability to penetrate cloud cover and capture backscattered signals from rice fields. The backscatter signature of rice showed a minimum dB value at agronomic flooding indicating the Start of Season (SoS). The parameters viz., the minimum values of -22.03 to -17.69 dB at the start of season, maximum value of -16.10 to -14.20 dB at the peak of season coinciding with heading and corresponding mean increase of 5.07 dB during growing stages were utilized for developing rule-based classification system. Rice area was estimated over the Cauvery Delta Zone of Tamil Nadu, India for the past six years during samba (August-January) season from 2017 to 2023 using Sentinel 1 A Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data. Rice area maps were generated for the region utilizing parameterization with a classification accuracy of 88.5 to 94.5 per cent with a kappa score of 0.77 to 0.87 during the study period. The total classified rice area during samba season in the Cauvery Delta Zone was 508,581 ha, 456,601 ha, 506,844 ha, 511,714 ha, 524,723 ha and 476,586 ha for the years 2017-18 to 2022-23, respectively. The Start of Season (SoS) maps for samba season revealed that the major planting periods for rice were between the second fortnight of September to first fortnight of November in all the years except 2018 when early planting happened during the first fortnight of September due to favorable weather conditions and assured water supply. Near real-time information on rice area, start of season, and progress of planting derived using SAR satellite data will facilitate the development of decision support systems for sustaining the productivity of rice-based ecosystems.
40064783	Full-Length Sequencing of Circular DNA Viruses Using CIDER-Seq.	Full-length viral genome sequencing is key for virus distribution profiling, new virus discovery, and understanding virus populations across different samples. Circular DNA Enrichment Sequencing (CIDER-Seq) allows unbiased enrichment and long-read sequencing of circular DNA viruses. CIDER-Seq produces single-read full-length virus genomes, combining PCR-free enrichment with Single Molecule Real-Time sequencing and de-concatenation algorithm. CIDER-Seq data analysis package, using the DeConcat algorithm, processes PacBio sequencing data into intact circular DNA sequences, generating fully annotated and highly accurate circular DNA virus genome sequences.
40064774	Transmission of Grabloviruses by Insect Vectors.	Among the three viruses of the genus Grablovirus in the plant virus family Geminiviridae, insect vector transmission is documented only for grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV), for which Spissistilus festinus (Hemiptera: Membracidae), the three-cornered alfalfa hopper, is identified as a vector. Transmission of GRBV by S. festinus is circulative, nonpropagative; it is also transstadial but neither transovarial, nor via seeds. Here, we thoroughly describe the S. festinus-mediated transmission process of GRBV with Vitis species, the natural hosts of the virus, and Phaseolus vulgaris plants, an experimental pseudo-systemic herbaceous host of the virus.
40064772	Begomovirus Transmission by the Insect Vector, the Whitefly Bemisia tabaci.	Begomoviruses are exclusively transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci in a persistent circulative manner and pose serious threat to the production of important cash crops worldwide. Here, we describe the protocols to study how the whiteflies transmit begomoviruses, including maintenance of whitefly and species identification, preparation of tomato plants infected with virus, acquisition and transmission of virus by whiteflies, dissection of whitefly organs, analysis of virus quantity in whiteflies, immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection of virus in whitefly tissues, membrane feeding of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or antibody and microinjection of dsRNA in whiteflies.
40064739	Metagenomic insights of microbial functions under conventional and conservation agriculture.	Agricultural practices such as conventional (CN) and conservation agriculture (CA) influence the composition and structure of soil microorganisms. We used short reads and genome-resolved metagenomic-based dual sequencing approaches to create a profile of bacterial and archaeal communities in hyperthermic Typic Haplustepts soil after seven years of CA and CN. The most differences in the physico-chemical and biological properties of soil were higher pH, organics carbon, available nitrogen and microbial biomass contents, activities of dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, and arylsulfatase, found in CA soil. The dominant bacterial taxa under both management types were Pseudomonadota (46-48%), Acidobacteriota (12-13%), Planctomycetota (8-10%), Bacteroidota (7-8%), and Actinomycetota (6-7%). Nitrososphaerota (1.1-1.5%) was the predominant archaeal phyla in CA and CN soils. The alpha diversity was 1.5 times higher in CA compared to CN soils. Fourteen high-quality (HQ) metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from both groups. Four HQ metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Pseudomonadota phylum were exclusively recovered from the CA soil. The dominance of this phylum in the CA soil might be correlated with its nutrient richness, as certain classes of Pseudomonadota, such as Alpha, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltaproteobacteria, are known to be copiotrophic. Copiotrophic organisms thrive in nutrient-rich environments, which could explain their prevalence in the CA soil. CAZyme gene analysis showed that Glycoside Hydrolases (GH) and GlycosylTransferases (GT) classes are dominant in the CA group, possibly due to higher substrate availability from the application of crop residues, which provide a rich source of complex carbohydrates. Several biogeochemical gene families related to C1 compounds, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur metabolism were enriched in CA soils, suggesting these practices may contribute to a soil environment with increased organic matter content, microbial diversity, and nutrient availability. Overall, CA practices seemed to improve soil health by supporting soil microbial communities abundance.
40064678	Inherited endurance: deciphering genetic associations of transgenerational and intergenerational heat stress memory in barley.	Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a cornerstone of global cereal crops, is increasingly vulnerable to concurrent heat stress, a critical abiotic factor that is intensified by climate change. This study employed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate "stress memory," a phenomenon where prior stress exposure enhances a plant's response to subsequent stress events. In this study, we analyzed essential agronomic traits, including plant height, spike length, grain number, and thousand-kernel weight, in conjunction with biochemical markers such as chlorophyll content, proline, and soluble proteins. These assessments spanned three successive generations under heat stress, capturing transgenerational and intergenerational effects and uncovering the cumulative impacts of prolonged stress in the third generation. Markedly, our findings highlight the critical influence of heat stress on plant physiology across generational scales, showcasing significant reductions in chlorophyll content, which reflect stress-induced limitations on photosynthetic capacity. In contrast, the observed consistent and substantial increases in proline and soluble protein content across transgenerational, intergenerational, and third-generation stress memory stages underscore their vital roles in stress mitigation and cellular homeostasis. These results provide compelling evidence of generational stress memory, suggesting potential adaptive strategies that plants employ to cope with harsh environmental conditions. Interestingly, identifying significant SNP markers within key genomic regions using GWAS analysis further highlights the potential for harnessing these loci in breeding programs. These results shed light on the intricate mechanisms of barley's stress tolerance and underscore the potential of integrating genomic, epigenomic, and advanced phenotyping tools into breeding programs to develop heat-resilient cultivars.
40064553	Study on Differential Metabolite Active Ingredients in Maize Roots Based on Network Pharmacology and Metabolomics Analysis.	Maize is a globally important crop. Roots are the main part of maize and are mainly used for soil improvement and for maintaining crop growth as agricultural waste. Their application scope is relatively small. It is very important to analyze the components in maize roots in order to increase their resource utilization and reduce the burden of waste disposal. Metabolomics shows that maize roots contain various bioactive components, such as alkaloids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, etc. Therefore, this study explores the potential pharmacological effects of maize root metabolites under drought stress from the perspective of metabolomics combined with network pharmacology. The crude extraction of betaine, a metabolite in maize roots under drought stress, was conducted, and the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of the crude extract were evaluated. The experimental results of DPPH, Fenton, etc. indicate that the crude extract of betaine from maize roots has certain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which provides a basis for its potential applications in the fields of medicine and food. The research on extracting medicinal active substances such as betaine from maize roots as agricultural waste not only has economic and environmental advantages but also has important significance in promoting technological progress and public health.
40064518	Binding Properties of Chemosensory Protein 1 to Plant Volatiles Guiding <i>Nicotiana rustica</i> Recognition in <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>.	<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> is one of the most serious pests attacking tobacco around the world. <i>Nicotiana rustica</i> is widely used as a trap crop in the fields of <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> in China. However, the chemical and molecular bases guiding <i>N. rustica</i> recognition in <i>H. armigera</i> are still unknown. In this study, we found 15 volatiles emitted from <i>N. rustica</i> induced EAG responses of <i>H. armigera</i>, while β-ocimene, α-pinene, and linalool were attractive to the moths in Y-tubes. Oviposition tests showed that <i>H. armigera</i> prefers to lay eggs on tobacco plants treated with β-ocimene and α-pinene. Further assays showed that an antenna-enriched chemosensory protein, HarmCSP1, binds robustly with β-ocimene, benzaldehyde, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. Structural analyses revealed that several key amino acid residues are involved in ligand binding. This study increases the understanding of the chemosensory mechanism of <i>H. armigera</i>'s recognition of <i>N. rustica</i> and provides the foundation for the design of attractants for <i>H. armigera</i> management.

40064215	Cloning of Toll3 and Toll4 and association analysis among their SNP haplotypes and disease resistance in red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).	With the expansion of the culture scale of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), the high incidence of diseases has seriously threatened the development of its industry. In this study, PcToll3 and PcToll4 were respectively cloned and explored SNPs among the germplasm populations, which had been identified relating to disease resistance in crayfish based on our previous study. A total of 3036 bp and 2820 bp of the open reading frame of PcToll3 and PcToll4 encoded 1011 and 939 amino acids, respectively. They were specially expressed in haemolymph, and significantly up-regulated expression after stimulation by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila and white spot syndrome virus. It was found that the expression of downstream genes PcALF, PcCru, PcIMD, PcMyD88, and PcNF-κB were repressed after interference of PcToll3 and/or PcToll4. Totally, 16 and 19 SNPs in the coding region of PcToll3 and PcToll4 were mined, and the favoured haplotypes and the combinations of them were classified according to the associated SNPs with the disease resistance in crayfish. The haplotypes of Toll3-Hap1, Toll4-Hap1 and the combination of Toll3+Toll4-Hap1 were further validated that they had the stronger disease resistance comparing to others haplotypes, and the related KASP markers were developed for further breeding application. This study will advance our understanding of the function of the two Toll genes in crayfish, and provide the markers for the molecular breeding.
40064088	Grapevines and trees: A biodiversity study of microbiomes in an established temperate agroforestry system.	Biodiversity is threatened particularly in perennial crop cultivation such as fruit trees or grapevines. If established, agroforestry has the potential to increase biodiversity by providing a higher habitat heterogeneity at the example of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Riesling) cultivated together with oak or poplar trees for 12 years. Together with the rhizosphere microbiome, the root metabolome was quantified as an indicator of root exudation. Since the root metabolome does not fully align with the exudate metabolome, we are using the root metabolome as a proxy for the exudate metabolome. The results reveal that co-cultivation of grapevine with trees reduces the nutrient availability in the soil and changes the root metabolome of both, grapevine and trees with a more distinct effect of trees on grapevine than vice versa, particularly for oak. Apparently, root-to-root signalling takes place between trees and grapevine. Co-cultivation of grapevine and oak trees also enhanced the alpha diversity of the microbiome. Correlation analysis revealed strong positive correlations between distinct microbial families and metabolites enriched in the roots of Riesling. Thus, microbiome analyses support the view that root-to-root interaction in mixed cultivation of grapevine with trees is mediated by root exudation.
40063884	Enhancing green bean crop maturity and yield prediction by harnessing the power of statistical analysis, crop records and weather data.	Climate change impacts require us to reexamine crop growth and yield under increasing temperatures and continuing yearly climate variability. Agronomic and agro-meteorological variables were concorded for a large number of plantings of green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in three growing seasons over several years from semi-tropical Queensland. Using the Queensland government's SILO meteorological database matched to sowing dates and crop phenology, we derived planting specific agro-meteorological variables. Linear and nonlinear statistical models were used to predict duration of vegetative and pod filling periods and fresh yield using agro-meteorological variables including thermal time, radiation and days of high temperature stress. High temperatures over 27.5∘C and 30∘C in the pod fill period were associated with a lower fresh bean yield. Differences between specific bean growing sites were examined using our bespoke open source software to derive agro-meteorological variables. Agronomically informed statistical models using production data were useful in predicting time of harvest. These methods can be applied to other commercial crops when crop phenology dates are collected.
40063820	A global estimate of multiecosystem photosynthesis losses under microplastic pollution.	Understanding how ecosystems respond to ubiquitous microplastic (MP) pollution is crucial for ensuring global food security. Here, we conduct a multiecosystem meta-analysis of 3,286 data points and reveal that MP exposure leads to a global reduction in photosynthesis of 7.05 to 12.12% in terrestrial plants, marine algae, and freshwater algae. These reductions align with those estimated by a constructed machine learning model using current MP pollution levels, showing that MP exposure reduces the chlorophyll content of photoautotrophs by 10.96 to 12.84%. Model estimates based on the identified MP-photosynthesis nexus indicate annual global losses of 4.11 to 13.52% (109.73 to 360.87 MT·y<sup>-1</sup>) for main crops and 0.31 to 7.24% (147.52 to 3415.11 MT C·y<sup>-1</sup>) for global aquatic net primary productivity induced by MPs. Under scenarios of efficient plastic mitigation, e.g., a ~13% global reduction in environmental MP levels, the MP-induced photosynthesis losses are estimated to decrease by ~30%, avoiding a global loss of 22.15 to 115.73 MT·y<sup>-1</sup> in main crop production and 0.32 to 7.39 MT·y<sup>-1</sup> in seafood production. These findings underscore the urgency of integrating plastic mitigation into global hunger and sustainability initiatives.
40063806	The SUbventral-Gland Regulator (SUGR-1) of nematode virulence.	Pathogens must precisely tailor their gene expression to cause infection. However, a signaling cascade from host signal to effector production has remained elusive for metazoan pathogens. Here, we show that plants contain molecular signals, termed effectostimulins, that activate the first identified regulator of plant-parasitic nematode effectors. SUGR-1 directly binds effector promoters, and is central to a transcriptional network that activates 58 effector genes. Importantly, we demonstrate that downregulation of <i>sugr-1</i> inhibits parasitism, underlining SUGR-1 signaling as a valuable target for crop protection and food security. This, in the wider context of nematodes as parasites of humans and other animals, has scope for potentially broader impact: Disrupting effector production could, in principle, be applied to any pathogen that secrets effectors.
40063805	Sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to multiple <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> traits in transgenic maize.	Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.
40063773	First Report of Brown Stripe Disease Caused by <i>Paracidovorax oryzae</i> on Rice in Guangxi (China).	Rice, being the most important food crop in China, is also the world's largest producer and consumer, accounting for 30% of global production and consumption. In 2023, brown stripes were observed on the leaf sheaths of diseased rice seedlings in a Jingxi rice field (22°51'N, 105°56'E) in Guangxi, China. The investigated area of rice fields, which was about 1.5 hectares, had an estimated disease incidence of 15 ± 5%. Leaf samples exhibiting symptoms of suspected brown stripe disease was collected and stored at 4 °C for bacterial isolation. The junction margins of lesions were surface-sterilized with 75% ethanol-saturated cotton swabs, and sterilized scissors were used to excise leaf sections (5 mm × 5 mm) from the diseased-healthy tissue interfaces. Within a sterile environment, these leaf fragments were soaked in 75% ethanol for three minutes, then ground and cultured on KB medium at a temperature of 28 °C for two days. A single colony (strain JX258) was then inoculated into sterile KB medium and incubated at 28 °C with a rotation speed of 220 rpm for 15 hours to obtain a bacterial suspension. Universal primers (27F/1492R) (Kinoshita et al., 2021) were used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene from strain JX258. A 1,394 bp fragment (GenBank PQ465223) amplified from strain JX258 was obtained and showed 97.80% sequence identity with Paracidovorax oryzae ATCC 19882 (Li, X et al. 2017). Specific primers (Aaaf3/ Aaar2, Aaaf3/ Aaar2) (Osdaghi E. 2023) successfully confirmed that this particular strain is indeed responsible for causing brown stripe disease in rice plants. Rice seeds were soaked in a bacterial suspension (1 × 10^6 CFU·mL⁻¹) for two days before undergoing germination followed by sowing in perlite under moist conditions (Supplemental Figures 1A-D). Brown lesions developed on leaves by 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), whereas mock-inoculated controls (10 mM MgCl₂) remained symptom-free. The seedlings soaked in a suspension of strain JX258 exhibited significantly reduced viability, germination, height, and growth rate, ultimately leading to seed mortality. Moreover, healthy rice leaves that were treated with a bacterial suspension (1 × 10^4 CFU·mL⁻¹) via spray inoculation, resulted in the manifestation of brown rice stripe disease symptoms within 7 days post-inoculation, P. oryzae was reisolated from the infected rice leaves, similar to those observed in the field, fulfilling Koch's postulates (Supplemental Figures 1E-F). The whole genome of JX258 was sequenced using the Sanger method, assembled, and analyzed to identify the strain at the species level. Whole-genome sequencing of JX258 (GenBank JBHJCP000000000.1) revealed 91.20% digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and 98.14% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with P. oryzae ATCC 19882 (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013; Yoon et al., 2017). In the Biolog Microbial Identification System, Version 4.2 (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA), JX258 showed a similarity with a match probability of 73% to Paracidovorax avenae. The utilization of the unique carbon source on BIOLOG GEN III reagent strip by JX258 is shown in Supplemental Table 1. The pathogen was identified as Paracidovorax oryzae based on technological means of pathogenicity assessment, biochemical analysis, phylogenetic analysis (Supplemental Figure 1G), and molecular characterization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Paracidovorax oryzae causing brown stripe disease on rice in Guangxi, China. Therefore, phytosanitary measures have to be implemented to prevent the introduction and spread of the pathogen in other areas.
40063772	First record of watermelon crinkle leaf-associated virus 2 infecting watermelon in open field in Italy.	Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) is an important horticultural crop in Italy, with a production of around 600,000 tons per year (third producer in the Europe). Viruses are considered a limiting factor in watermelon production, especially those transmitted by efficient vectors such as whiteflies and aphids. In July 2023, foliar symptoms on 100% of watermelon plants (cv. Samba), including curling and wrinkling, yellow mottling and chlorosis, were observed in a commercial field of about 4000 m2 at Eboli (Salerno province, South Italy; coordinates: 40°29'83''N 14°57'99''E) (Figure S1). Some fruits were also symptomatic showing circular lesions and deformations. Overall, symptoms resembled those described for watermelon crinkle leaf-associated viruses (WCLaV-1, Coguvirus citrulli and WCLaV-2, Coguvirus henanense; genus Coguvirus, family Phenuiviridae) (Hernandez et al., 2021; Hendricks et al., 2022; Mulholland et al., 2023). Total RNAs were isolated from pooled leaf tissues of 10 symptomatic plants using the Viral Gene-spinTM Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc., South Korea) and used for construction of RNA-seq libraries, which were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform with paired-end reads length of 101 bp. The HTS yielded 31,125,612 raw reads, while after trimming 28,868,089 reads were recovered. Viral genome assembly was performed with the two algorithms implemented in the SPAdes program (v. 3.15.3; Bankevich et al., 2012). Two sets of filtered contigs were obtained: 3,184 contigs with the algorithms implemented in Metaspades, and 3,369 contigs with algorithms implemented in RNAviral. BLASTn/BLASTx analysis of the contigs were carried out against online databases (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Two contigs, obtained from the assembly of 7520 reads for RNA1 and 4585 reads for RNA2 respectively, showed the greatest nucleotide identities with the WCLaV-2 genome. These contigs represented full-length genomic sequences of the corresponding virus. No other viral contigs belonging to other viruses were generated by HTS library. The HTS results were confirmed by RT-PCR on each of the 10 watermelon samples using the WCLaV-2-specific primers WCLaV-2vRP (5'-GTCTCACATTCCTGCACTAACT)/WCLaV-2cRP (5'-ATCGGTCCTGGGTTATTTGTATC) targeting 968 bp of the RdRP and WCLaV-2vMP (5'-GACTTCAGAACCTCAACATCCA)/WCLaV-2cMP (5'-CAAGGGAGAGTGCTGACAAA) targeting 562 bp of the MP (Hernandez et al., 2021). Amplicons of the expected size were sequenced and sequences were 100% identical to the corresponding regions obtained by HTS sequencing, confirming presence of WCLaV-2 in the watermelon plants. After verifying the sequences at the 5' and 3' ends, the sequences of the two genomic ssRNA segments consisted of 6679 nucleotides (nt) for RNA1 and 2729 nt for RNA2. These sequences were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers PQ869160 (RNA1) and PQ869161 (RNA2). According to the BLASTn analysis, the RNA1 was highly similar (99.94% sequence identity; 100% query coverage) to the Ju-01-WCLaV2 isolate (LC636073) from Brazil, while the RNA2 was highly similar (96.23% sequence identity; 99% query coverage) to the KF-15 isolate (NC_079049) from China. WCLaV-2 was first reported in watermelon in China (Xin et al., 2017) and then in USA (Hernandez et al. 2021), Brazil (Maeda et al., 2022) and Australia (Mulholland et al., 2023). Although it was recently detected in some watermelon commercial seeds in Italy (Minutolo et al., 2024), this report confirms for the first time the spread of the virus in open field watermelon crops in southern Italy. Studies to assess the incidence and impact of disease on watermelon production, the identification of potential vectors and the role of the seeds in virus transmission should be conducted to aid the development of the best management practices with the aim to contain the damages caused by the virus.
40063634	Genomic insights into Mediterranean pepper diversity using ddRADSeq.	This work investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of 99 pepper lines (Capsicum annuum L.), acclimated to Mediterranean climate conditions, using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADSeq). The aims were to understand the genetic relationships among these lines, correlate genetic clusters with botanical classifications, and provide insights into pepper domestication in the region. Obtained were 318.76 million raw sequence reads overall, averaging 3.21 million reads per sample. A total of 8475 high-quality SNPs were identified and used to assess genetic diversity and population structure. Chromosome NC_061113.1 displayed the highest amount and Chromosome NC_061118.1 the fewest of these SNPs, which were not equally spaced around the genome. Heterozygosity measures and a negative inbreeding coefficient point to the great genetic diversity seen, therefore highlighting the genetic health of the population. Different genetic clusters found by phylogenetic study and STRUCTURE analysis can be used in breeding programs to mix desired features from many genetic backgrounds. This work showed how well ddRADSeq generates high-quality SNPs for genomic research on peppers, therefore offering useful molecular tools for genomic selection and marker-assisted selection. The analysis identified significant genetic diversity and distinct genetic clusters which are valuable for breeding programs focused on crop improvement. These findings enhance our understanding of pepper domestication and provide valuable genetic resources for breeding programs aimed at improving pepper varieties.
40063562	Water production efficiency and economic benefits under diversified planting modes of intercropping-multiple cropping in arid regions.	Diversified planting patterns are important measures to improve the comprehensive grain production capacity, alleviate the contradiction between grain crops and forage planting, and enhance water production efficiency. In order to explore the suitable diversified planting modes in the Yellow River irrigation area of Ningxia, a total of 4 treatments were designed, including wheat-maize silage intercropping and multiple planting of sorghum-sudangrass hybrid after wheat harvest (T1); wheat-cabbage intercropping, multiple planting of oil sunflower after wheat harvest, followed by maize silage planting after cabbage harvest (T2); sole wheat, after the harvest of wheat, half of the land is used for multiple plantings of maize silage, and the other half is used for multiple plantings of oil sunflower (T3); and sole maize silage (T4). The results showed that all diversified planting modes can increase biomass and land equivalent ratio compared to the control monoculture. The T2 had the highest total biomass and land equivalent ratio, the two-year average was 79.68 t/ha and 2.27, respectively. The highest biological yield per cubic meter of water was achieved by T3, with an average of 12.65 kg/m3 over two years. T1 achieved the highest output value per cubic meter of water, with 16.81 Chinese Yuan/m³ over 2 years. In both T1 and T2, due to the increased spacing between intercropping crops, as well as sufficient water and fertilizer supply and developed root system, maize silage is at a competitive advantage, with a interspecific relative competitive ability between 0.059-0.234. When maize silage and oil sunflower are planted simultaneously, due to the fast growth rate of oil sunflower, it is the dominant crop, the interspecific relative competitive ability in 2022 and 2023 were 0.164 and 0.137, respectively. The net benefit of T1 was the highest, with an average total net income of 84,950 Chinese Yuan/ha over 2 years. It can be seen that diversified planting patterns can improve the yield and economic benefits per unit land area, and are a highly promising planting pattern.
40063508	Wood Biomolecules as Agricultural Adjuvants for Effective Suppression of Droplet Rebound from Plant Foliage.	The agrochemical run-off associated with crop control is an unintended consequence of droplet rebound from plant foliage, which negatively affects crop performance and the environment. This is most critical in water-based formulations delivered on plant surfaces that are typically waxy and nonwetting. This study introduces an alternative to synthetic surfactants and high molecular weight polymers that are used as spreading agents for agrochemicals. Specifically, biopolymeric adjuvants (hemicelluloses and oligomeric lignin) extracted from wood by pressurized hot water are shown for their synergistic pinning capacity and surface activity that can effectively suppress droplet rebound from hydrophobic surfaces. Hemicellulose and lignin mixtures, alongside several model compounds, are investigated for understanding the dynamics of droplet impact and its correlation with biomacromolecule formations. The benefit of utilizing lean solutions (0.1 wt.% concentration) is highlighted for reducing droplet rebounding from leaves, outperforming synthetic systems in current use. For instance, a tenfold deposition improvement is demonstrated on citrus leaves, because of a significantly suppressed droplet roll-off. These results establish the excellent prospects of wood extracts to improve crop performance.
40063342	Evaluation of in vivo fish and amphibian endocrine test guideline assays: current status and future needs.	Endocrine pathways are crucial in regulating physiological functions in organisms, including growth and development, metabolism, tissue function, and reproduction. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with normal hormonal function and lead to adverse effects in organisms and/or their offspring. As a result, regulatory testing and assessment requirements have been implemented to identify and regulate EDCs-defined by the World Health Organization as chemicals that alter the function of an endocrine system and cause "subsequent adverse effects in an intact organism, its progeny, or (sub)populations" - although the approaches taken for assessment vary worldwide. As such, the current typical ecotoxicological assessment paradigm for EDCs involves initial testing for endocrine activity using in vitro and lower-tier in vivo assays, followed by higher-tier in vivo testing which can provide additional endocrine mechanistic data and establishes any consequent adversity. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among other entities, have validated and adopted standardized in vivo test guidelines for mammals, fish, and amphibians. These tests can be challenging and take months to perform, and many require the use of large numbers of laboratory animals. This paper summarizes the current state of the science for evaluating the endocrine disrupting potential of chemicals in fish and amphibians using in vivo test guideline assays across the estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and steroidogenesis modalities. Current challenges associated with conducting and interpreting the in vivo assays are discussed. Opportunities and potential next steps to strengthen this growing area of testing are explored, including potential to inform development and application of new approach methodologies and thereby reduce reliance on using laboratory animals.
40063283	Drought's physiological footprint: implications for crop improvement in rice.	Rice, a staple food for significant percent of the world's population, is increasingly vulnerable to drought stress, threatening global food security. This review synthesizes current knowledge on drought's physiological impact on rice, highlighting key mechanisms, responses, and adaptations. Drought stress alters rice physiology at various stages, from seed germination to grain filling, affecting yield, quality, and nutrient content. Drought tolerance in rice is influenced by physiological traits such as root architecture and depth, stomatal regulation and water use efficiency, Osmo-protectants and antioxidant defences, hormone signalling and stress response pathways. Genetic diversity and molecular breeding have enhanced drought resilience in rice, with key genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling drought tolerance identified, enabling marker-assisted selection and genetic engineering. Despite progress, challenges persist, including limited understanding of drought's impact on rice physiology under field conditions, inefficient screening methods for drought tolerance, and insufficient attention to drought's effects on rice quality and nutritional content. To address these gaps, integrating physiology, genetics, and agronomy for holistic drought mitigation strategies is crucial. Developing high-throughput phenotyping tools for drought tolerance screening and investigating drought's impact on rice grain quality and nutritional content are essential. This review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding drought's physiological footprint in rice and guiding future research toward improving drought tolerance and resilience.
40063235	Identification of Camellia Oil Adulteration With Excitation-Emission Matrix Fluorescence Spectra and Deep Learning.	Camellia oil (CAO), known for its high nutritional and commercial value, has raised increasing concerns about adulteration. Developing an accurate and non-destructive method to identify CAO adulterants is crucial for safeguarding public health and well-being. This study simulates potential real-world adulteration cases by designing representative adulteration scenarios, followed by the acquisition and analysis of corresponding excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) spectra. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was employed to characterize and explore the variations of fluorophores in the EEMF spectra of different adulterated scenarioss, which showed a linear correlation between the relative concentration of PARAFAC components and adulteration levels. A deep learning model named ResTransformer, which combines residual modules with Transformer, was proposed for both the qualitative detection of adulteration types and the quantitative detection of adulteration concentrations from local and global perspectives. The global ResTransformer qualitative models achieved accuracies of over 96.92% based on EEMF spectra and PARAFAC, and quantitative models showed determination coefficient of validation ([Formula: see text]) > 0.978, root mean square error of validation ([Formula: see text]) < 3.0643%, and the ratio performance deviation (RPD) > 7.6741. Compared to traditional chemometric models, the ResTransformer model demonstrated superior performance. The integration of EEMF and ResTransformer presents a highly promising strategy for rapid and reliable detection of CAO adulteration.
40063119	Morphological spore-based characterisation and molecular approaches reveal comparable patterns in glomeromycotan communities.	Traditionally, characterisation and comparison of AMF communities has been carried out by morphological identification of asexual spores in soil. In recent decades, molecular methods such as soil metabarcoding have become more popular than morphological identification of spores, but direct comparisons of the efficiency of both approaches have been rare. In this study, we compared AMF communities in soil samples from vegetable farms using both morphological and molecular methods (internal transcribed spacer, ITS, markers). In addition, we performed a systematic literature search and retrieved nine studies that analysed AMF communities using both approaches in the same soil samples, mostly in agroecosystems. Our results show that AMF communities determined by morphological spore-based identification are different than those determined by molecular genetic markers, but not as often claimed. In some cases, the morphological spore-based characterisation of spores revealed more diverse glomeromycotan communities. Moreover, in several cases the spore-based methods recovered taxa that the molecular methods did not, while in other cases the opposite was observed. The field and literature-based results of this study indicate that for a comprehensive and exhaustive characterisation of AMF communities it is necessary to combine both approaches. However, if the aim is to compare communities under different environmental conditions, both approaches provide comparable patterns.
40063098	Towards quality-assured measurements of microplastics in soil using fluorescence microscopy.	Fluorescence microscopy is increasingly seen as a fast, user-friendly, and high-throughput method for detecting microplastics (MPs) in soil; however, its effectiveness across diverse MP types and soil properties remains underexplored. This study tested a fluorescence microscopy-Nile red (NR) staining approach on eight MP types, covering both biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastics, in three size ranges (≤ 150 µm, 100-250 µm, 500-1000 µm) across loamy, clayey, and sandy soils. Each sample, processed in triplicate, underwent a relatively quick and straightforward extraction procedure involving density separation, organic digestion, and NR staining, followed by fluorescence and bright-field microscopy. A new digital image analysis pipeline using Image J was developed to expedite and (semi)automate MP quantification. Recoveries ranged from 80% to 90% for MPs with a Feret diameter of 500-1000 µm, regardless of soil type. In contrast, the recovery of smaller MPs (Feret dia. ≤ 250 µm) varied depending on the soils and plastic types: recoveries for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) reached 85% in sandy soil and 90% in loamy soil, whereas those for biodegradable polybutylene adipate terephthalate/polylactic acid (PBAT/PLA) were only 60% and 10%, respectively. The lowest recovery rate was observed in clayey soil and for biodegradable plastics. The method was tested on non-agricultural soil samples, yielding a MP mean number concentration of 20.7 ± 9.0 MPs/g for MPs sized from dia. ≥ 25 µm, comparable to Fourier transform infrared (FPA-µ-FTIR) results of 13.1 ± 7.3 MPs/g (p > 0.05). We conclude that fluorescence microscopy with NR staining and automated particle quantification offers a time-efficient, reproducible, and accurate method for MP detection in light-textured soils, whereas limitations remain for reliable MP analysis in clay-dominated soils.
40062942	A Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Markers and Candidate Genes Affecting Tolerance to the Wheat Pathogen <i>Zymoseptoria tritici</i>.	Plants defend themselves against pathogens using either resistance, measured as the host's ability to limit pathogen multiplication, or tolerance, measured as the host's ability to reduce the negative effects of infection. Tolerance is a promising trait for crop breeding, but its genetic basis has rarely been studied and remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal the genetic basis of leaf tolerance to the fungal pathogen <i>Zymoseptoria tritici</i> that causes the globally important septoria tritici blotch disease on wheat. Leaf tolerance to <i>Z. tritici</i> is a quantitative trait that was recently discovered in wheat by using automated image analyses that quantified the symptomatic leaf area and counted the number of pycnidia found on the same leaf. A genome-wide association study identified four chromosome intervals associated with tolerance and a separate chromosome interval associated with resistance. Within these intervals, we identified candidate genes, including wall-associated kinases similar to <i>Stb6</i>, the first cloned STB resistance gene. Our analysis revealed a strong negative genetic correlation between tolerance and resistance to STB, indicative of a trade-off. A trade-off between tolerance and resistance would hinder breeding simultaneously for both traits, but our findings suggest a way forward using marker-assisted breeding. We expect that the methods described here can be used to characterize tolerance to other fungal diseases that produce visible fruiting bodies, such as speckled leaf blotch on barley, potentially unveiling conserved tolerance mechanisms shared among plant species.
40062895	No-tillage systems promote bacterial photosynthetic gene expression in low carbon, semi-arid surface soils.	Managing soils in semi-arid agricultural croplands generally focuses on reducing wind erosion, increasing fertility, and storing carbon. Thus, converting conventionally tilled systems to no-tillage and cover-cropped systems are often the first steps towards a conservation management approach across the growing area of semi-arid croplands. From a soil biological perspective, introducing cover crops to semi-arid soils has been shown to alter microbial community structure, which may lead to changes in the biogeochemical pathways expressed in these soils. In this study, we examined the impact of single-species wheat cover cropping and no-tillage on microbial gene expression after 4 and 5 years of implementation. We sequenced the metatranscriptomes of three production systems with varying levels of conservation management: conventional tillage winter fallow, no-tillage winter fallow, and no-tillage with a winter wheat cover crop. Removing tillage was the biggest factor altering microbial gene expression in this study, specifically resulting in upregulation of several photosystem-associated functions. These functions were taxonomically linked to organisms that make up the early stages of biological soil crusts, which may introduce additional benefits to these semi-arid agricultural systems beyond a reduction in wind erosion. Implementing a cover crop did not clearly alter gene expression beyond the effect of tillage removal; however, it did indicate a potential to reduce fungal disease incidence in 1 year of the study. These alterations of microbial activities and selection for potentially beneficial functions should be considered and further studied to aid in maintaining sustainable croplands for our changing climate.IMPORTANCEEliminating tillage from semi-arid agricultural soils has the potential to significantly alter the activities of the soil bacterial community compared with conventionally tilled soils. A major driver of this change was the activities of biological soil crust forming organisms that can provide several environmental benefits to the soil ecosystem beyond the typically associated benefits of conservation management. Furthermore, this study revealed that the implementation of a cover crop regime on no-tillage soils does not confer a major change in the function of the organisms present. Overall, the study reported here reveals that soil management practices aimed at reducing wind erosion and improving sustainability will positively impact the function of the microbial community and suggests that future investigations into the consequences of these functional changes may provide valuable services to these agricultural ecosystems.
40062824	VqERF1B-VqERF062-VqNSTS2 transcriptional cascade enhances stilbene biosynthesis and resistance to powdery mildew in grapevine.	Grapes, as one of the world's oldest economic crops, are severely affected by grape powdery mildew, causing significant economic losses. As a phytoalexin against powdery mildew, stilbenes and their key synthetic gene, stilbene synthase (STS), are highly sought after by researchers. In our previous research, a new gene, VqNSTS2, was identified from Vitis quinquangularis accession 'Danfeng-2' through transcriptomic analysis. However, the function and molecular mechanism of VqNSTS2 gene remain unknown. Here, by characterization and transient overexpression of VqNSTS2, we demonstrated that its expression product, stilbenes, can be detected in the model plant tobacco, which does not inherently contain STSs. After artificially inoculating transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing VqNSTS2 with Erysiphe necator, it was found that VqNSTS2 actively moved to the pathogen's haustorium after responding to the pathogen, recognized and enveloped the haustorium, blocking the pathogen's infection and invasion and exhibited disease resistance. Furthermore, Agrobacterium-mediated stable overexpression of VqNSTS2 promoted stilbene accumulation and enhanced resistance of the V. vinifera susceptible cultivar 'Thompson Seedless' to E. necator. Additionally, through screening and identification, a transcription factor, VqERF062, was found to directly bind to the DRE and RAA motifs on ProVqNSTS2, positively regulating VqNSTS2 expression. Moreover, VqERF062 directly interacted with VqERF1B to promote the transcription of VqNSTS2 in addition to forming a homodimer with itself. Taken together, our findings reveal that the VqERF1B-VqERF062- module is required for grape resistance to E. necator and providing insights into the regulatory mechanism of stilbenes biosynthesis.
40062713	Wheat MAPK cascade mediates SGT1 nuclear entry targeted by a stripe rust effector.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a fundamental role in plant immunity by transducing external signals inside plant cells. Here, we defined a wheat MAPK cascade, composed of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) TaMKK2 and its downstream MAPK TaMAPK6, which phosphorylates the core immune regulator TaSGT1 (suppressor of G2 allele of Skp1), resulting in enhanced nuclear entry of TaSGT1, thereby conferring resistance against the devastating wheat pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Hence, we identified a TaMKK2-TaMAPK6-TaSGT1 signaling cascade that contributes to wheat stripe rust resistance. During infection, Pst secrets a haustorium-associated secreted protein 215 (HASP215), that targets TaMKK2 and interferes with the interaction of TaMKK2 with TaMAPK6 to suppress TaMAPK6 phosphorylation and activation, thereby leading to reduced capacity of TaMAPK6 to phosphorylate TaSGT1. Consequently, inhibition of TaMAPK6-mediated TaSGT1 phosphorylation resulted in decreased nuclear translocation of TaSGT1 and suppressed plant immunity. Our work elucidates the positive function of TaMKK2-TaMAPK6 cascade in wheat immunity by regulating the immune component TaSGT1, and its regulation by the rust effector HASP215, providing new insights into the MAPK cascade on crop immunity and the pathogenicity mechanism of obligate biotrophic fungus.
40062396	Interaction Between Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus-GAV Movement Protein and VOZ Proteins Delays Flowering of Plant.	Dwarfing and yellowing are characteristic symptoms caused by viral infections and are considered significant contributors for reduced crop yield. In this study, we identified that infection by barley yellow dwarf virus-GAV (BYDV-GAV) leads to a delay in the flowering process, potentially diminishing grain yield in wheat. The BYDV-GAV movement protein (MP) interacts with vascular plant one-zinc finger proteins (VOZs), which play a crucial role in promoting wheat flowering. Expression of MP inhibits floral transition in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Furthermore, BYDV-GAV MP facilitates the degradation of VOZ transcription factors via the 26S proteasome pathway, independently of phytochrome B (PhyB). Domain B in VOZ is essential for the interaction between VOZ and MP. Our results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-induced symptoms.
40062368	Building Climate-Resilient Crops: Genetic, Environmental, and Technological Strategies for Heat and Drought Stress Tolerance.	Global crop production faces increasing threats from the rise in frequency, duration, and intensity of drought and heat stress events due to climate change. Most staple food crops, including wheat, rice, soybean, and corn that provide over half of the world's caloric intake, are not well-adapted to withstand heat or drought. Efforts to breed or engineer stress-tolerant crops have had limited success due to the complexity of tolerance mechanisms and the variability of agricultural environments. Effective solutions require a shift towards fundamental research that incorporates realistic agricultural settings and focuses on practical outcomes for farmers. This review explores the genetic and environmental factors affecting heat and drought tolerance in major crops, examines the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying these stress responses, and evaluates the limitations of current breeding programs and models. It also discusses emerging technologies and approaches that could enhance crop resilience, such as synthetic biology, advanced breeding techniques, and high-throughput phenotyping. Finally, this review emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary research and collaboration with stakeholders to translate fundamental research into practical agricultural solutions.
40062339	Faecal sludge pyrolysis as a circular economic approach to waste management and nutrient recovery.	The disposal of faecal sludge from non-networked sanitation amenities leads to contamination of the surrounding environment and increasing public health problems across developing countries. Permanent solutions to deal with faecal sludge are required to solve the sanitation crisis and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030. Full-scale pyrolysis of faecal sludge in developing countries is fast becoming a safe and long-term option. Pyrolysis not only eliminates pathogens within the sludge but produces biochar as an end product which has the potential as a soil amendment to increase crop yield. In general, faecal sludge biochars have high pH values, high ash contents, and high macro-and micronutrient concentrations. Compared to biochar from lignocellulosic materials, faecal sludge biochar contains less carbon and exhibits lower porosities, and lower surface areas. However, evaluating the properties of faecal sludge biochar is difficult due to the different technologies used in collection, storage, and transportation of the feedstock. Differences in faecal sludge characteristics based on location, climate, age of the sludge, type of sanitation technology and seasonality are also factors in determining the properties of faecal sludge biochars. These factors contribute to the difficulty in describing faecal sludge biochar properties in general terms, and there is an argument to be made that characteristics of large-scale faecal sludge biochar should be determined on a case-by-case basis. The conclusion of this review is that future research should concentrate on short-term and long-term field studies of faecal sludge biochar application to different soil types.
40061816	Crop Wild Relatives (CWRs) in the United Arab Emirates: Resources for Climate Resilience and Their Potential Medicinal Applications.	Global climate change threatens the production, growth, and sustainability of plants. Crop wild relatives (CWRs) offer a practical and sustainable solution to these climatic issues by boosting genetic diversity and crop resilience. Even though CWRs are wild relatives of domesticated plants, they are nevertheless mostly neglected. This review focuses on the possible application of CWRs, which are found in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and are known for their abiotic stress tolerance and potential medicinal properties. In olden days, traditionally, CWRs has been used as medicine for various ailments as they are rich in phytochemical compounds. However, the medicinal potential of these wild plant species is decreasing at an alarming rate due to climate change stress factors. The medicinal potential of these native crop wild plant species must be investigated because they could be a useful asset in the healthcare sector. Research on pangenomics studies of certain CWRs is also highlighted in the review, which reveals genetic variability caused due to climate change stress factors and how these genetic variability changes affect the production of secondary metabolites that have potent medicinal value. This provides insights into developing personalized medicine, in which particular CWRs plant species can be chosen or modified to generate medicinal compounds. Despite their superior medicinal properties, many CWRs in the UAE are still not well understood. Finding the desired genes coding for the biosynthesis of specific phytochemicals or secondary metabolites may help us better understand how these substances are synthesized and how to increase their production for a range of treatments.
40061812	Telomere-to-telomere, gap-free genome of mung bean (<i>Vigna radiata</i>) provides insights into domestication under structural variation.	Mung bean (<i>Vigna radiata</i>), an essential annual legume, holds substantial value in global agriculture due to its short growth cycle, low input requirements, and nutritional benefits. Despite extensive domestication, the genetic mechanisms underlying its morphological and physiological evolution remain incompletely understood. In this study, we present a gap-free, telomere-to-telomere genome assembly of the mung bean cultivar 'Weilv-9', achieved through the integration of PacBio HiFi, Oxford Nanopore, and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) sequencing technologies. The 500-Mb assembly, encompassing 11 chromosomes and containing 28 740 protein-coding genes, reveals that 49.17% of the genome comprises repetitive sequences. Within the genome, we found the recent amplification of transposable elements significantly impacts the expression of nearby genes. Furthermore, integrating structural variation and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from resequencing, we identified that the fatty acid synthesis, suberin biosynthetic, and phenylpropanoid metabolic processes have undergone strong selection during domestication. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms driving domestication and offer a foundation for future genetic enhancement and breeding programs in mung beans and related species.

The biosynthesis of paclitaxel involves intricate biosynthetic pathways, spanning multiple enzymatic steps. Despite advances, challenges remain in optimizing production methods. Microorganisms, particularly endophytic fungi, show potential in producing paclitaxel, though with limitations in yield and stability. The suspension culture of Taxus cells is a promising alternative, offering sustainable production, yet it requires further genetic and environmental optimization. Recent advancements in synthetic biology have enabled partial reconstitution of paclitaxel pathways in microbial and plant chassis. However, achieving complete biosynthesis remains an ongoing challenge. This review consolidates recent progress in paclitaxel biosynthesis, highlighting current limitations and future prospects for industrial-scale production.
40061802	Integrative analysis of genome-wide association studies of polyphenols in apple fruits identifies the MdDof2.4<i>-MdPAT10</i> module that promotes procyanidin accumulation.	Polyphenols represent a significant class of nutrients in apples, contributing to human health and well-being. Among these, procyanidins stand out as the most prevalent polyphenolic compounds in apple fruits. These compounds are abundant in wild apples and generally low in modern apple cultivars. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and recover genetically lost genes that regulate polyphenol accumulation in order to improve the apple quality. To achieve this, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 15 traits related to polyphenol content, utilizing 134 <i>Malus</i> accessions. We identified 1204 marker-trait associations (MTAs) and 840 candidate genes, including known polyphenol biosynthetic and regulatory genes, such as <i>MYB7</i>, <i>TT4</i>, and <i>HCT/HQT</i>. Notably, we pinpointed a protein <i>S</i>-acyl transferase 10 (PAT10), which is significantly associated with procyanidin content. Through experiments with transgenic calli, we determined that apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) MdPAT10 positively regulated procyanidin accumulation. Furthermore, we identified a 51-bp insertion variant (In-868) on the promoter of the <i>PAT10</i>, which influences its expression. Both a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that MdDof2.4 was able to bind to the promoter of <i>MdPAT10</i> containing In-868 (<i>MdPAT10<sub>pro</sub> <sup>In-868</sup></i> ), but not to the promoter of <i>MdPAT10</i> without In-868 (<i>MdPAT10<sub>pro</sub></i> ). Moreover, MdDof2.4 promoted <i>MdPAT10</i> (with <i>MdPAT10<sub>pro</sub> <sup>In-868</sup></i> ) expression and increased procyanidin accumulation in fruits. Overall, our results enhance the understanding of the biosynthetic regulation of apple polyphenols and provide a theoretical foundation and genetic resources for breeding apple varieties with optimal polyphenol content.
40061801	Advancements and strategies of genetic improvement in cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz): from conventional to genomic approaches.	Cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz) is a staple food of 800 million people in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Its industrial utilization for bioethanol, animal feed, and starch are still continuously expanding. It was not until the 1970s that significant scientific efforts were undertaken to improve cassava, despite its considerable economic and social significance. Shortening the breeding cycle and improving the breeding efficiency are always the focus of the cassava breeding study. In this review, we provide a global perspective on the current status of cassava germplasm resources and explore the diverse applications of cassava breeding methods from hybridization, polyploidy, and inbreeding to genomic selection and gene editing. Additionally, we overview at least six nearly complete cassava genome sequences established based on modern genomic techniques. These achievements have substantially supported the advancing of gene discovery and breeding of new cassava varieties. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the advancements in cassava's functional genomics, concentrating on important traits such as starch quality and content, dry matter content, tolerance to postharvest physiological deterioration, nutritional quality, and stress resistance. We also provide a comprehensive summary of the milestone events and key advancements in cassava genetic improvement over the past 50 years. Finally, we put forward the perspective of developing genomic selection breeding model and super-hybrids of cassava through building inbreeding population and emphasize the generation of triploid cassavas, as well as using gene editing technology allowing cassava to be a tropical model plant to serve for basic biological research and molecular breeding.
40061124	Rapid development of naked malting barley germplasm through targeted mutagenesis.	Covered barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) has historically been preferred for malting, as the husk in this plant protects the embryo during harvest and acts as a filter during brewing. Naked barley, which is typically used as food, has the potential to be used in brewing due to recent technical advances, but the grains contain higher levels of β-glucan and polyphenols, which are undesirable in brewing. Introducing the naked trait into brewing cultivars through crossing is time-consuming due to the need to eliminate these undesirable traits. In this study, we rapidly developed naked barley that is potentially suitable for malting by introducing targeted mutations into <i>Nudum</i> (<i>NUD</i>) using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis. The doubled haploid line 'DH120366', which was used as the parental line, was derived from a cross between two covered malting barley cultivars. We generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenized barley harboring mutations in <i>NUD</i> via <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated transformation and confirmed the presence of mosaic mutations in one individual from among 16 T<sub>0</sub> transformants. We sowed T<sub>1</sub> grains exhibiting the naked trait and sequenced the <i>NUD</i> gene in these T<sub>1</sub> seedlings, identifying two types of mutations. Shotgun high-throughput whole-genome sequencing confirmed the absence of the transgene in at least one <i>nud</i> mutant line following <i>k</i>-mer-based analysis. Cultivation in a closed growth chamber revealed no significant differences in agronomic traits between the <i>nud</i> mutants and the wild type. This study demonstrates the feasibility of rapidly developing naked barley with potential use for malting and brewing by targeting only <i>NUD</i> via targeted mutagenesis.

Through this comprehensive analysis, the review seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of the evolving landscape and prospects in this vital area of agricultural research. The review highlights that state-of-the-art deep learning models have achieved impressive accuracies, with classification tasks often exceeding 95% and detection and segmentation networks demonstrating precision rates above 90% in identifying plant diseases and pest infestations. These findings underscore the transformative potential of deep learning in revolutionizing agricultural diagnostics.
40061030	Effects of nitrogen fertilizer on protein accumulation in basal-middle and apical kernels of different low nitrogen tolerant maize hybrids.	Selecting low-nitrogen(N)-tolerant maize hybrids represent an effective approach to enhancing nitrogen use efficiency grain yield. However, the impact of nitrogen fertilization on protein accumulation in low-N-tolerant hybrids remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, a two-year field orientation trial was conducted at four nitrogen fertilizer rate with the different low-N-tolerant maize hybrids. The effect of nitrogen fertilization on the accumulation of protein and its fractions different kernels positions of different low-N-tolerant maize hybrids was studied. The results showed that the protein yield of ZH311 maize kernels was significantly higher than that of XY508, especially under low-N conditions (0N and 150N), and was 25.7%-36.2% higher than that of XY508. There was a significant correlation between protein yield and the accumulation of crude protein and protein fractions. Compared with XY508, the crude protein of ZH311 entered the rapid growth stage later and lasted for a relatively shorter period, but it was 50.8%-53.0% higher due to its higher accumulation rates (v<sub>2</sub> and v<sub>3</sub>) in its middle and late stages, especially in the apical grains. Under low-N conditions, the difference in crude protein accumulation between the apical and basal-middle kernels of ZH311 was only 4.3-8.2%, whereas the difference in XY508 was 29.9-37.3%, suggesting that low-N-tolerant maize hybrids improve protein yield by increasing the accumulation of proteins and their fractions in the apical kernels. Nitrogen fertilization had a greater effect on protein accumulation and yield in XY508, especially on the top kernel and protein yield. In the future, more attention should be paid to the effect of apical kernels when breeding high-quality maize hybrids tolerant to low nitrogen.
40060268	Individual and Interactive Effects of Temperature and Watering Regime on Canola Growth and Physiological Characteristics.	Although many studies have considered the effects of temperature and water on plants, the combined effects of these factors on canola (<i>Brassica napus</i>) growth, physiological traits, and fatty acids require more attention. Canola is an important oilseed crop in Canada and around the world and fatty acids act as regulators of stress signaling. We grew plants under two temperature regimes (22°C/18°C and 28°C/24°C; 16 h light and 8 h dark) and two watering regimes (well-watered and water stressed) in controlled-environment growth chamber for 3 weeks after 1 week of initial growth under 22°C/18°C. We measured growth, biomass, photosynthesis, fatty acids, and other physiological traits of plants. With respect to plant growth and physiological traits, as individual factor, higher temperatures decreased stem diameter, specific leaf mass, leaf water potential, and flavonoids, whereas water stress decreased stem height and diameter, leaf area and number, leaf mass, net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, transpiration, and stomatal conductance, but increased leaf mass ratio (leaf dry mass/plant dry mass). In terms of interaction, higher temperatures increased plant biomass, chlorophyll (Chl) <i>a</i>, carotenoids, and total Chl in the well-watered plants, but decreased all these traits in the water-stressed plants. With respect to fatty acids as individual factor, higher temperatures decreased tricosanoic acid (C23:0), but increased heptadecanoic acid (C17:0). In terms of interaction, higher temperatures decreased <i>cis</i>-10-heptadecenoic acid (C17:1), elaidic acid (C18:1), arachidic acid (C20:0), and <i>cis</i>-11,14-eicosadienoic acid (C20:2) in the water-stressed plants. Lower temperatures also decreased C17:1, C18:1, and C20:2 in the water-stressed plants. Overall, palmitoleic acid (C16:1) was higher in the stem than in the leaf. This study revealed that higher temperatures combined with water stress decreased some physiological traits and fatty acids and, in turn, plant biomass. Further studies are required to determine the effects of multiple climate change components on fatty acids in canola and other oilseed crops.
40060186	Plant metabolomics: applications and challenges in the era of multi-omics big data.

Plant metabolomics, a key branch of systems biology, involves the comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the composition, variation, and functions of these metabolites. Advances in technology have transformed plant metabolomics into a sophisticated process involving sample collection, metabolite extraction, high-throughput analysis, data processing, and multidimensional statistical analysis. In today's era of big data, the field is witnessing an explosion in data acquisition, offering insight into the complexity and dynamics of plant metabolism. Moreover, multiple omics strategies can be integrated to reveal interactions and regulatory networks across different molecular levels, deepening our understanding of plant biological processes. In this review, we highlight recent advances and challenges in plant metabolomics, emphasizing the roles for this technique in improving crop varieties, enhancing nutritional value, and increasing stress resistance. We also explore the scientific foundations of plant metabolomics and its applications in medicine, and ecological conservation.
40060183	A high-throughput protocol for testing heat-stress tolerance in pollen.	Viable pollen is crucial for fertilization, but pollen is generally highly susceptible to heat stress. A quick, reliable method for testing the heat-stress tolerance of pollen is needed to improve the heat-stress tolerance in plants, but current methods require considerable space and labor. In addition, many such methods only test tolerance to a single constant temperature, making it time-consuming to screen heat tolerance over a wide temperature range and to examine the dynamics of pollen viability at different temperatures. To address this issue, we aimed to: (1) develop an easy, reliable method for measuring pollen viability at different temperatures; and (2) identify the best temperature range for screening pollen with high heat-stress tolerance. We harvested mature pollen from wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plants and transferred it to a 96-well plate filled with liquid medium containing sucrose. We placed the plate in a PCR machine operating under a gradient PCR program to simultaneously test a range of temperatures. After incubating the pollen for 4 h, at temperatures ranging from 21.9 to 47 °C, we examined the pollen grains under a light microscope and employed a specific image analysis pipeline to assess the effects of temperature on pollen morphology, germination, and tube growth. This method facilitated the high-throughput screening of many pollen samples, enabling rapid, reliable, and precise analysis of pollen viability in response to temperature. Our approach should be applicable to other plant species and could be used to identify quantitative trait loci or genes influencing heat stress tolerance in pollen for breeding programs.
40060182	Convenient, high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in autotetraploid alfalfa using endogenous <i>U6</i> promoters and visual reporters.	CRISPR/Cas is a simple, robust, versatile tool for plant biology studies and precision plant breeding. However, establishing a high-efficiency gene editing system for multiplex editing of the autotetraploid crop alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.), the most important forage legume worldwide, remains a formidable challenge. Here, we systematically identified endogenous <i>U6</i> promoters in alfalfa through transient expression via <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated infiltration of alfalfa leaves. We further demonstrated the efficacy of the three most active promoters for genome editing using an optimized alfalfa hairy root system. Subsequently, we established an improved CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex system containing three or four tandemly arrayed <i>MsU6</i>-promoter-driven polycistronic tRNA-sgRNA (PTG) expression cassettes, each consisting of three tRNA-sgRNA units, to simultaneously edit three or four alfalfa genes, coupled with the visual reporter <i>RH1</i> or <i>RUBY</i>. This toolkit showed efficient multiplex editing in the hairy root system with visual selection. We successfully obtained regenerated, red-colored shoots resulting from the stable transformation of alfalfa. These results highlight the potential application of the visual reporter system for the stable transformation of alfalfa. Our improved CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex system enables convenient, high-efficiency multiplex genome editing in alfalfa, providing a versatile toolset to facilitate functional studies of multiple genes and gene families for basic research and the genetic improvement of alfalfa.
40060180	LEAFY1 and 2 are required for floral organ development in soybean.	The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is a vital step for the reproductive success of plants. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, LEAFY (LFY) plays crucial roles in inflorescence primordium and floral organ development, but little is known about the roles of its homologs in crop plants such as soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Here, we investigated the expression patterns and functions of the two <i>LFY</i> genes (<i>LFY1</i> and <i>LFY2</i>) in soybean. Both genes were predominantly expressed in unopened flowers and the shoot apical meristem, with <i>LFY2</i> having the higher transcript abundance. In an in situ hybridization assay, <i>LFY</i> genes produced strong signals in the floral meristem. We next generated <i>lfy1</i> and <i>lfy2</i> knockout lines. The <i>lfy2</i> mutants showed obvious changes in floral organ morphology, but the <i>lfy1</i> mutants showed no obvious changes in floral organ morphology or pod development. The <i>lfy1 lfy2</i> double mutants displayed more serious defects in floral organ development than <i>lfy2</i>, resulting in complete sterility. Gene expression analysis revealed differences in expression of the A-class <i>APETALA</i> (<i>AP</i>) genes <i>AP1a</i> and <i>AP1b</i> in the double mutant lines. These results suggest that LFY2 plays an important role in floral organ formation in soybean by regulating the expression of homeotic genes. Our findings increase the understanding of floral development, which could be useful for flower designs during hybrid soybean breeding.
40060179	Emerging strategies to improve heat stress tolerance in crops.	The heat stress (HS) response in plants involves complex processes at the molecular, cellular, and whole-organism levels. Sensitivity to HS differs based on the species and developmental stage of the plant, making it challenging to define HS and its impacts. Efforts to enhance HS tolerance by traditional breeding are constrained by limited genetic resources, but understanding the mechanisms that regulate HS responses can enable efforts to improve heat tolerance by precision breeding and gene editing. Here, we review recent research on the effects of HS on major cereal crops at different developmental stages and identify key genes potentially involved in the HS response, offering insight for precision molecular breeding. Additionally, we discuss the use of favorable natural variants and gene editing to improve crop tolerance to HS, emphasizing the value of alleles involved in thermomemory, combined stress tolerance, and the stress response-growth balance. This review aims to summarize recent advancements in understanding HS responses in crops, highlighting potential avenues for generating heat-tolerant crops.
40060178	Developing a pipeline for identification, characterization and molecular editing of <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements: a case study in potato.	Crop breeding requires a balance of tradeoffs among key agronomic traits caused by gene pleiotropy. The molecular manipulation of genes can effectively improve target traits, but this may not reduce gene pleiotropy, potentially leading to undesirable traits or even lethal conditions. However, molecular editing of <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (CREs) of target genes may facilitate the dissection of gene pleiotropy to fine-tune gene expression. In this study, we developed a pipeline, in potato, which employs open chromatin to predict candidate CREs, along with both transient and genetic assays to validate the function of CREs and CRISPR/Cas9 to edit candidate CREs. We used <i>StCDF1</i> as an example, a key gene for potato tuberization and identified a 288 bp-core promoter region, which showed photoperiodic inducibility. A homozygous CRISPR/Cas9-editing line was established, with two deletions in the core promoter, which displayed a reduced expression level, resulting in late tuberization under both long-day and short-day conditions. This pipeline provides an alternative pathway to improve a specific trait with limited downside on other phenotypes.
40060175	A 6.49-Mb inversion associated with the purple embryo spot trait in potato.	The embryo spot trait leads to a deep purple or reddish coloration at the base of the cotyledons of the embryo, visible on both sides of flat potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) seeds. This trait has long been used by potato researchers and breeders as a morphological marker during dihaploid induction. The formation of embryo spots reflects the accumulation of anthocyanins, but the genetic basis of this trait remains unclear. In this study, we mapped the embryo spot trait to a 6.78-Mb region at the end of chromosome 10 using an F<sub>2</sub> population derived from a cross between spotted and spotless plants. The recombination rate in the candidate region is severely suppressed, posing challenges for the map-based cloning of the underlying gene and suggesting large-scale rearrangements in this region. A de novo genome assembly of the spotted individual and a comparative genomic analysis to the reference genome of spotless potato revealed a 6.49-Mb inversion present in the spotted plant genome. The left breakpoint of this inversion occurred in the promoter region of an R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene that is highly expressed in the cotyledon base of spotted embryos but is not expressed in that of spotless embryos. This study elucidated the genetic basis for embryo spot formation in potato and provides a foundation for future cloning of the causative gene.

The methodology involved training the YOLOv8 model with images of various pests and plant damage. The model achieved a precision of 98.91%, recall of 98.98%, mAP50 of 98.75%, and mAP50-95 of 97.72% for detection tasks. For segmentation tasks, precision was 97.47%, recall 98.81%, mAP50 99.38%, and mAP50-95 95.99%. These metrics demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods, indicating the model's effectiveness. The integration of ChatGPT-4 further enhances the system by providing detailed explanations and recommendations based on detected pests. This approach facilitates real-time expert consultation, making pest management accessible to untrained producers, especially in remote areas. The study's results underscore the potential of combining AI-based detection and language models to revolutionize agricultural practices. Future research should focus on training these models with domain-specific data to improve accuracy and reliability.

40059779	Myricetin alleviates high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice by regulating bile acid metabolism involved in gut microbiota remodeling.	Atherosclerosis poses a significant threat to global health. This study aimed to investigate the effects of myricetin (MYR) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our findings demonstrated that MYR treatment significantly reduced the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, particularly at a high dose of 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, MYR markedly attenuated lipid metabolism disorders in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice by decreasing body weight, improving serum lipid profiles, and reducing lipid deposition. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that MYR treatment enhanced the abundance of probiotic <i>g</i>_<i>Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136</i>, while it reduced that of obesity-associated genera, including <i>Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>. Metabolomic analysis and RT-qPCR tests indicated that MYR upregulated hepatic bile acid biosynthesis, evidenced by increased total bile acid levels and enhanced expression of key enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, particularly through the classical biosynthetic pathway. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed strong associations between the regulated bile acids and these aforementioned bacteria. Therefore, our results demonstrated that MYR exerts an anti-atherosclerotic effect by modulating the gut-liver axis.
40059763	The potential of silicon in crop protection against phloem feeding and chewing insect pests - a review.	As future crop production is threatened by the increasing incidence of insect pests caused by changing climate, it is crucial to focus on searching for alternative methods of insect pest management. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the effect of silicon (Si) on the incidence, growth, development, longevity, survival, feeding efficiency, and reproduction parameters of phloem sap feeding and chewing insects of plants. While Si may negatively impact the biological parameters of both insect guilds, the effect is generally more pronounced in chewing insects, and often varies under different cultivation conditions. In addition to the direct effect of Si on insect pest performance, the potential mechanisms of Si-mediated resistance of infested plants are discussed. These involve increasing plant mechanical properties (Si-based or other organic barriers), and boosting biochemical defence responses, such as increased antioxidant activity, stimulated activity of defence enzymes, attraction of parasitoids and predators of insect pests, and synthesis of toxic and taste repelling compounds. These changes create a complex Si-induced defence system that enables infested plants to better withstand insect pest attack, ultimately reducing pest damage and improving agricultural crop yields.
40059664	18-year plant reproductive phenology dataset from Lambir, Borneo, including four large general flowering events.	Flowering and fruiting phenology can have large impacts on a plant's reproductive success. In many plant species, these phenological events are controlled by seasonal climatic cues, resulting in one-year reproductive cycles. However, parts of SE Asian tropical forests have an aseasonal climate with irregular fluctuations. This database comprises phenology records collected from 1993 to 2011 at the community level in an aseasonal lowland dipterocarp forest of the Lambir Hills National Park in Borneo. Observations were made every two weeks at three sites: The Canopy Biology Plot (CBP) with tree towers and walkways, the Operation Raleigh Tower (ORT) area with a tree tower for tourist attraction, and the Crane Plot located between the CBP and ORT, where plants were monitored from terraces on a canopy crane installed in 2000. The dataset includes in total 172,521 records of 450, 118, and 51 plants in CBP, Crane Plot, and ORT, respectively, representing 303 species. The number of individuals per species ranges from 1 to 21, and 64.9% are represented by only one. The plants in the censuses were mostly trees but also included lianas and epiphytes. The data have been used to study the causes and consequences of synchronized flowering and fruiting at the community level, a phenomenon unique to the region. Previous studies have shown that this synchronization is synergistically driven by cool air temperature and drought. Irregular flowering and fruiting have significant impacts on flower visitors, frugivores, forest material cycling, and plant regeneration. The dataset can also be used for comparing the phenology of the same species or group among forests and regions and exploring its association with climates. One major concern regarding tropical forests in the area is the effects of climate change on this community-wide masting regime, which could disrupt forest regeneration and ecosystem processes. The dataset could be an important source of information for conservation efforts aimed at protecting these amazingly diverse forest ecosystems. This dataset can be freely used for non-commercial purposes. Users of these data should cite this data paper in any publications resulting from its use and acknowledge the Forest Department Sarawak and Sarawak Forestry Corporation.
40059591	IIS/TOR network plays an essential role in ovarian development in the pupal stage of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda.	The ovary plays a crucial role in the female reproductive system of insects and is vital for the perpetuation of insect populations. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling network play a key role in controlling ovarian development and maturation during the adult stage. However, the pupal stage is a critical developmental phase in the reproductive system of holometabolous insects, and the regulatory role of the IIS/TOR network during this stage remains to be elucidated. In this study, we observed that during the pupal stage, the enlargement of ovarian development was accompanied by a corresponding increase in messenger RNA expression levels of genes within the IIS/TOR signaling pathway and insulin levels in the hemolymph. Decapitation experiments, serving as a pivotal approach to assess the regulatory role of the IIS signaling pathway in ovarian development, demonstrated that decapitation markedly inhibited ovarian development at this critical stage. Exogenous insulin administration significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of FOXO, S6K, and 4E-BP, thereby enhancing ovarian development and resulting in significant elongation of the ovarioles. In contrast, the injection of IIS/TOR pathway inhibitors, LY294002 and Rapamycin, reduced the phosphorylation of these proteins, inhibiting ovarian development during the pupal stage and leading to a significant shortening of the ovarioles, negatively impacting the reproductive performance of adult females. The current findings indicate that the IIS/TOR signaling network significantly regulates ovarian development during the pupal stage of Spodoptera frugiperda, providing new molecular insights for the development of pest management strategies.
40059455	TRTBee: A standalone calculator for Time-Reinforced Toxicity according to EFSA honeybee guidelines.	The revised European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidance document for the risk assessment of plant protection products on honeybees requires an assessment of time-reinforced toxicity (TRT) using toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modelling. While there are user-friendly software options available for this modelling, it is not specialised for this new application, therefore conducting the TRT assessment still requires additional manual calculations. Here we present TRTBee: a new, freely available tool which is capable of automatically performing all stages of the TRT assessment. The tool is based on robust and well-known algorithms. We conclude with a brief discussion of the open problems that still exist within the EFSA scheme.

40059268	The oligosaccharyltransferase subunit PsSTT3A regulates N-glycosylation and is critical for development and virulence of Phytophthora sojae.	In eukaryotes, N-glycosylation is a complex, multistep process in which the core subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase, Staurosporine and Temperature Sensitive 3A (STT3A), plays a critical role in the catalytic activity of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. We found that the PsSTT3A gene plays a critical role in the viability of Phytophthora sojae (P. sojae). Furthermore, full PsSTT3A function was crucial to mycelial growth, sporangium production, zoospore production, and pathogenicity, as determined by gene silencing experiments. PsSTT3A is, itself, a highly N-glycosylated protein with six consensus NXS/T (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) motifs and one novel NS motif. However, the N-glycosylation sites on PsSTT3A that are required to support the development and virulence of P. sojae have been uncertain. Here, we demonstrated that glycosylation of site N593 is essential for normal mycelial growth and virulence in P. sojae. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis was disrupted by the mutation of N593. N593A mutations reduced the stability of the elicitin PsSOJ2A, an N-glycoprotein, in gene replacement transformations. Our study reveals the functional significance of N-glycosylation of PsSTT3A in the development and infection cycles of P. sojae, demonstrating that targeting of PsSTT3A may be a promising strategy for developing new mode of action fungicides.
40059228	Transcriptional reprogramming and microbiome dynamics in garden pea exposed to high pH stress during vegetative stage.	High soil pH induces the upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress and nutrient transport, while the enrichment of beneficial microbes (Variovorax, Chaetomium, and Pseudomonas) highlights their potential role in promoting stress adaptation. High soil pH severely impacts plant growth and productivity, yet the transcriptomic changes and microbial dynamics underlying stress adaptation in garden pea (Pisum sativum ssp. hortense) remain unclear. This study demonstrates that high soil pH leads to stunted growth, reduced biomass, impaired photosynthesis, and nutrient status in garden pea. Further, disruption in key nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium indicum, R. leguminosarum, and R. redzepovicii), along with the downregulation of NifA and NifD genes and upregulation of NifH in nodules highlights the critical role of micronutrient balance in legume-microbe symbiosis and a compensatory response to maintain nitrogen status. RNA seq analysis revealed extensive transcriptional reprogramming in roots, characterized by the upregulation of oxidative stress response genes (e.g., oxidoreductase and glutathione transferase activities, metal ion transporters) and the downregulation of genes related to ammonia-lyase activity and ion binding, reflecting broader disruptions in nutrient homeostasis. KEGG pathway analysis identified enrichment of MAPK signaling pathway, likely interacting with other pathways associated with stress tolerance, metabolic adjustment, and structural reorganization as part of adaptive responses to high pH. Root microbiome analysis showed significant enrichment of Variovorax, Shinella, and Chaetomium, suggesting host-driven recruitment under high pH stress. Stable genera, such as Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, Mycobacterium, Herbaspirillum, and Paecilomyces, displayed resilience to stress conditions, potentially forming core microbiome components for adaptation to high pH. In a targeted study, inoculation of plants with an enriched microbiome, particularly C. globosum, under high pH conditions improved growth parameters and increased the abundance of Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas in the roots. It suggests that these bacterial genera may act as helper microbes to C. globosum, collectively promoting stress resilience in pea plants suffering from high pH. These findings provide a foundation for microbiome-aided breeding programs and the development of microbial consortia to enhance the adaptation of pea plants to high pH conditions.
40059178	Advancements and challenges in microalgal protein production: A sustainable alternative to conventional protein sources.	The increasing global demand for sustainable protein sources necessitates the exploration of alternative solutions beyond traditional livestock and crop-based proteins. Microalgae present a promising alternative due to their high protein content, rapid biomass accumulation, and minimal land and water requirements. Furthermore, their ability to thrive on non-arable land and in wastewater systems enhances their sustainability and resource efficiency. Despite these advantages, scalability and economical feasibility remain major challenges in microalgal protein production. This review explores recent advancements in microalgal protein cultivation and extraction technologies, including pulsed electric field, ultrasound-assisted extraction, enzyme-assisted extraction, and microwave-assisted extraction. These innovative techniques have significantly improved protein extraction efficiency, purity, and sustainability, while addressing cell wall disruption and protein recovery challenges. Additionally, the review examines protein digestibility and bioavailability, particularly in the context of human nutrition and aquafeed applications. A critical analysis of life cycle assessment studies highlights the environmental footprint and economical feasibility of microalgal protein production compared to conventional protein sources. Although microalgal protein production requires significant energy inputs, advancements in biorefinery approaches, carbon dioxide sequestration, and industrial integration can help mitigate these limitations. Finally, this review outlines key challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need for cost reduction strategies, genetic engineering for enhanced yields, and industrial-scale process optimization. By integrating innovative extraction techniques with biorefinery models, microalgal proteins hold immense potential as a sustainable, high-quality protein source for food, feed, and nutraceutical applications.
40059163	Effects of DA-6 and MC on the growth, physiology, and yield characteristics of soybean.	As a grain and oil crop, soybean presents a much lower yield than other staple crops. However, crop yields can be improved by applying modern agricultural technology, such as diethylaminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6) and mepiquat chloride (MC), which are important plant-growth regulators that substantially affect crop growth and yield.
40059154	Allele and transcriptome mining in Gossypium hirsutum reveals variation in candidate genes at genetic loci affecting cotton fiber quality and textile flammability.	Breeding valuable traits in crop plants requires identifying diverse alleles in the germplasm that are likely to affect desirable characteristics. The genetic diversity of historic cultivars of cotton is a reservoir of potentially important genes for crop improvement and genetic research. Diversity in the characteristics of harvested cotton fibers affects their suitability for end-use applications. Candidate loci and genes have been identified that affect the length, strength, and maturity of cotton fibers which affect the quality and value of the yarn, thread and textile. Natural genetic mechanisms in the plant may also affect the flammability of the produced textiles.
40059115	Evaluation of soybean germplasms for resistance to stay-green syndrome.	Stay-green syndrome (SGS) resistant germplasms serve as the cornerstone for soybean improvement. A comprehensive assessment was conducted on a panel of 1553 germplasms to evaluate their resistance to SGS through natural inoculation. Over a three-year period, one landrace, ZaoShuHeiDou, emerged as resilient to SGS, displaying a significantly reduced risk of SGS (p < 0.05) compared to its counterparts. The broad-sense heritability of SGS resistance was 0.86. Notably, landraces demonstrated a substantially lower incidence of SGS compared to improved cultivars. Furthermore, the severity of SGS correlated with several key traits pertinent to soybean improvement efforts. In field trials, the application of insecticides effectively mitigated SGS severity, whereas the use of organic fertilizers and soil sterilization had no discernible impact. A total of 83 DNA samples were successfully amplified from SGS-afflicted plants using specific primers for soybean stay-green associated virus (SoSGV), and a SoSGV LCU-1 strain was isolated. The qPCR analysis confirmed a positive correlation between SGS severity and the relative SoSGV copy number in afflicted plants. The findings of this study lay a solid foundation for the development of SGS-resistant cultivars and the exploration of underlying resistance mechanisms.
40059061	Rate of herbicide resistant weed development: A Canadian Prairie case study.	Genetically modified crop adoption in Canada has been the key driver in removing tillage as the lead form of weed control, due to increased weed control efficiency. Land use has transitioned from the use of summerfallow to continuous cropping, predominantly involving zero or minimum tillage practices. Prairie crop rotations have diversified away from mainly cereals to include three-year rotations of cereals, pulses, and oilseeds. Total herbicide volume applied has increased as crop production acres increased, but the rate of herbicide active ingredient applied per hectare has declined. Diverse crop rotations allow for weed control using herbicides with different modes of action, reducing selection pressure for resistant weed development. Herbicide-resistant weeds are an important concern for farmers, as the loss of key herbicides would make weed control exceedingly more difficult. The objective of this case study is to examine herbicide resistance weed development in the Canadian Prairies and to identify changes in resistance development following GM crop adoption.
40058912	Establishing a database of volatile metabolites in whole wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour provides novel insights into quality breeding.	Improving yield traits is the primary goal for wheat breeding, while much less attention has been paid to flavor and odor quality of wheat grain. In this study, a high-throughput protocol was developed for the identification and quantification of volatile compounds (VOCs) in wheat grains via a static head-space coupled with GC-MS. Using a diverse population consisting of 312 wheat germplasms, a database including 94 VOCs was constructed for grains. The main pathways for the biosynthesis of VOCs in wheat grains was constructed by manually assigning the volatiles to the lipoxygenase, the mevalonic acid and the shikimate/phenylalanine pathway, respectively. VOC profiling showed that grain VOCs were mainly synthesized from the LOX pathway and the content of VOCs varied largely between different wheat lines. Clear discrimination was identified between old and modern cultivars by OPLS-DA, indicating a reduction of VOCs both in species and content in modern cultivars. Correlation analysis and machine learning models established a link between VOC profiles and grain protein content. VOCs such as 1-octen-3-ol were significantly correlated with grain protein content, which can be used as diagnostic markers for wheat grain quality. In summary, our study established a comprehensive VOC database for wheat grains and explored the relationships between VOCs and grain quality traits in a diverse wheat population, providing novel insights into grain quality improvement and flavor enhancement in modern breeding programs.
40058890	Visualizing the spatial distribution of metabolites in tomato fruit at different maturity stages by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging.	Tomato is one of the highest-value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide, serving as an important source of micro-nutrients in the human diet. Understanding the spatial distribution changes of critical metabolites during fruit maturation is essential for investigating the physiological roles, nutritional value, and potential functional values of phytochemicals in tomato fruit. However, information on their spatial distribution remains limited. This study aimed to visualize the distribution differences of endogenous metabolites in tomatoes across four maturity stages (from green to red) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Relative quantification results showed that as the fruit ripened, levels of soluble sugars, amino acids and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increased significantly at the red ripening stage, while L-hydroxysuccinic acid exhibited an opposite trend, and citric acid initially decreased, then increased. Mass spectrometry imaging revealed that soluble sugars, organic acids, and amino acids were evenly distributed throughout the fruit across all maturity stages. During maturation, nine VOCs transitioned from a widespread distribution in the flesh tissue to concentrating near the peel, suggesting that aromatic compounds predominantly localize in the fruit's outer regions at full maturity. Additionally, a colocalization phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the spatial distribution imaging of each metabolite. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the changes and distribution of phytochemicals during tomato fruit development, offering a scientific basis for breeding, utilization, and production strategies.
40058874	Role of Arabidopsis monomeric E3 ubiquitin ligases in the ABA signaling pathway.	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key phytohormone that regulates multiple biological processes in plants, including seed germination, seedling growth, and abiotic stress response. ABA enhances drought tolerance by promoting stomatal closure, thereby improving crop productivity under unfavorable stress conditions. Extensive research efforts have focused on understanding ABA signaling more clearly for its potential application in agriculture. The accumulation and stability of signaling components involved in the efficient transduction of downstream ABA signaling are affected by both transcriptional regulation and post-translational modifications. Ubiquitination is a representative post-translational modification that regulates protein stability, and E3 ubiquitin ligase is a key enzyme that determines target substrates for ubiquitination. To date, many E3 ligases functioning as a monomeric form such as RING-, HECT- and Ubox-types have been known to participate in the ABA signaling process. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of ABA-related monomeric E3 ligases, their regulation, and mode of action in Arabidopsis, which will help develop a detailed and integrated understanding of the ABA signaling process in Arabidopsis.
40058441	TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber incorporating hydrophobic TA-HBPSi nanoparticles aerogels for efficient adsorption of fungicides in water.	Fungicide contamination is a critical environmental issue, and the effective removal of fungicide residues from aquatic environments has attracted significant attention from researchers. In this study, the synthesized hyperbranched polysiloxane (TA-HBPSi) was grafted onto TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNF) to fabricate a novel aerogel material (TA-HBPSi@TOCNF) with the aim of enhancing the sorption efficiency of fungicide. The equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity of TA-HBPSi@TOCNF for imazalil (8.04 mg/g) was significantly higher compared to other fungicides, including prochloraz (6.43 mg/g), thiophanate-methyl (4.12 mg/g), carbendazim (0.16 mg/g), and thiabendazole (0.04 mg/g). In the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, the equilibrium adsorption capacity for imazalil increased from 8.04 mg/g to 9.61 mg/g, while the adsorption capacity for Cd<sup>2+</sup> increased from 0.26 mg/g to 0.88 mg/g. Quantum chemical calculations were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level. The energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ΔE(<sub>HOMO-LUMO</sub>)) for various adsorption mechanisms indicated that electrostatic interactions were the dominant driving force for adsorption, followed by π-π electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions and hydrophobic interactions. The developed aerogel demonstrated effective multi-component separation capabilities without inducing secondary environmental pollution, highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for practical water purification applications.
40058434	Characterization of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) raw bast fibers of monoecious versus dioecious cultivars from flowering to senescence: FTIR of lignocelluloses and extract bioactivities.	Hemp is a multipurpose crop. Due to the revived interest in sustainable crops, hemp cultivation has increased in recent years. Both dioecious and monoecious hemp varieties are cultivated, yet few studies provide a comparative characterization. Monoecious cannabis plants are more uniform and economically efficient, being a whole-plant harvesting type. The aim of this research was to provide a comparative characterization of monoecious versus dioecious hemp bast fibers. There was conducted a microscopic analysis that showed their localization, the FTIR characterization of raw lignocellulosic fibers and extract bioactivity assays (antioxidant and microbiologic). Results indicated that FTIR absorbance ratios of peaks 1427/897 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1373-1375/667 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and1373/2905-2910 cm<sup>-1</sup> are relevant for hemp fibers parameters. A significant positive correlation was found between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity (r = 0.69*, r = 0.56*). Analysis of raw bast fibers extract indicated that the monoecious cultivar in the senescence phenophases had highest total phenolic content, and was more effective against all tested pathogenic bacterial strains. Both monoecious cultivar and male plants of the dioecious cultivar had higher total phenolic content than female plants of the dioecious cultivar, although at different phenophases. The male plants in the technological maturity phenophases presented the highest total phenolic content. Lower antioxidant activity was registered by female plants of the dioecious cultivar, which also showed lower total phenolic content, and the extract had no effect against Listeria monocytogenes, regardless of harvest time. The findings thus point to monoecious cultivars as having potential relevance in applications requiring enhanced bioactive properties, besides being advantageous for large-scale cultivation for fibers and seeds due to the economic efficiency.
40058237	Decoding the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors for fine-tuning target genes in rice.	In the intricate landscape of gene regulation, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) play a pivotal role in controlling gene expression across various biological processes in plants. The bHLH domain, about 60 amino acids long, consists of a DNA-binding basic region and a dimerization helix-loop-helix region. In rice, 188 bHLH proteins are encoded and more than 90 functionally characterized. To finely regulate the expression of various target genes, bHLH TFs engage multiple transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.
40058014	Compound effects of drought and COVID-19 on soybean production in Brazil: Challenges and policy responses.	This study investigates the cumulative and interactive impacts of drought and COVID-19 on soybean production in Brazil, focusing on cascading economic and operational disruptions. The country has faced numerous drought events in recent years (1989 to 2022), culminating with one in 2022 that, together with the occurrence of COVID-19, led to the highest decline in soybean production since 1990 (10.5 % of the total national production). Our analyses based on spatial lagged regression models revealed that the cumulative impacts of consecutive drought events significantly affect soybean production. Furthermore, the study uncovered a significant interactive association between COVID-19 and drought by using spatial lag models, emphasizing the compounded challenges posed by simultaneous shocks of climate change and rising agricultural production costs due to pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions. In addition, descriptive statistics on agricultural economics showed that COVID-19 triggered historical peaks in agricultural input prices, forcing producers to enter the 2021-2022 crop season under critical conditions. Specifically, previous losses in soybean production due to droughts during the 2020-2021 season left producers facing financial constraints while contending with historically high production costs for the next season. These results show how the impacts of a global pandemic cascade into soybean production costs (input prices), while highlight the vulnerability of Brazil's soybean production system to multiple shocks. Hence, we envision responses encompassing short-term changes in management practices and land-use decisions at the farm level; mid-term public policies providing risk assessments and emergency credit to address abnormal spikes in production costs caused by socio-health stressors, which would enable producers to secure more suitable input packages, helping to mitigate potential losses associated with co-occurring climate extreme events; and long-term further investments in developing more self-sufficient food production systems, reducing the heavy reliance on imported agricultural inputs-as seen in the Brazilian case-, and development of highly soybean tolerant-drought varieties.
40057982	The myb transcription factor PtoPHL3 positively regulates poplar resistance to canker disease caused by Dothiorella gregaria.	Diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms impair plant growth, leading to reduced crop yields. While the molecular mechanisms of plant disease response are well understood in annual herbaceous species, they remain largely unknown in perennial woody plants. Here, we found that PtoPHL3, a key transcription factor in poplar's phosphorus starvation response, showed significant expression changes after treatments with salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and inoculation of Dothiorella gregaria that causes poplar canker disease. Overexpressing PtoPHL3 conferred increased resistance to D. gregaria in transgenic poplar, while RNA interference-mediated knockdown made the plants more sensitive to the pathogen. DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) identified PtoPHL3-bound chromatin regions associated with disease response. Additionally, PtoPHL3 was found to bind the promoter of TGA6 and the gene body region of ERF5, upregulating their expression, which activates responses to D. gregaria, JA and SA. These findings deepen our understanding of the pathogen response process in poplar and lay a theoretical foundation for research on disease resistance mechanisms and the breeding of disease-resistant germplasm.
40057930	Enhancing wheat resilience: biotechnological advances in combating heat stress and environmental challenges.	Climate change, with its increasing temperatures, is significantly disrupting global agricultural systems, and wheat, a key cereal crop faces severe challenges. Heat stress has emerged as a critical threat, accelerating wheat growth, leading to premature maturation, reduced grain filling, and ultimately lower yields. The situation is exacerbated by more frequent and intense heat waves, particularly in regions already struggling with water scarcity. Maintaining the delicate balance of temperature and water necessary for optimal wheat production is becoming challenging, posing a serious risk to global food security. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop adaptive strategies with innovations in breeding and transgenic technologies crucial to improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses, especially to combat the growing impacts of heat stress. Modern tools like CRISPR/Cas9, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases, and Zinc Finger Nucleases have been instrumental in developing wheat varieties with improved traits. However, the future of wheat cultivation requires more than just resistance to a single stressor. As climate change intensifies, there is an urgent need for wheat varieties that can withstand multiple stresses, including heat, drought, and pests. Developing these multi-stress-tolerant cultivars is crucial for ensuring food security in a rapidly changing climate.
40029899	Mucilage produced by aerial roots hosts diazotrophs that provide nitrogen in Sorghum bicolor.	Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is an important food, feed, and fodder crop worldwide and is gaining popularity as an energy crop due to its high potential for biomass production. Some sorghum accessions develop many aerial roots and produce an abundant carbohydrate-rich mucilage after rain. This aerial root mucilage is similar to that observed in landraces of maize (Zea mays) from southern Mexico, which have been previously shown to host diazotrophs. In this study, we characterized the aerial root development of several sorghum accessions and the impact of humidity on this trait. We conducted a microbiome study of the aerial root mucilage of maize and sorghum and isolated numerous diazotrophs from field sorghum mucilage. We observed that the prevailing phyla in the mucilage were Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, and Bacillota. However, bacterial abundances varied based on the genotype and the location. Using acetylene reduction, 15N2 gas feeding, and 15N isotope dilution assays, we confirmed that these sorghum accessions can acquire about 40% of their nitrogen from the atmosphere through these associations on aerial roots. Nitrogen fixation in sorghum aerial root mucilage offers a promising avenue to reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers and promote sustainable agricultural practices for food, feed, fodder, and bioenergy production.

40057612	Development of accessible and scalable maize pollen storage technology.	The inherent short lifespan of Zea mays (maize, corn) pollen hinders crop improvement and challenges the hybrid seed production required to produce food, fuel, and feed. Decades of scientific effort on maize pollen storage technology have been unable to deliver a widely accessible protocol that works for liters of pollen at a hybrid seed production scale. Here we show how suppressing the pollen cellular respiration rate through refrigeration and optimizing gas exchange within the storage environment are the critical combination of factors for maintaining pollen viability in storage. The common practice of preserving maize pollen by mixing the pollen with talcum powder is critically examined using pollen tube germination testing, electron microscopy of pollen-silk (stigma) interaction, and test pollinations in production environments. These techniques lead to mixing maize pollen collected for storage with anti-clumping carrier compounds, including microcrystalline cellulose. These carriers improve stored pollen flowability during pollination and enable increased seed sets to be obtained from stored pollen. Field testing in maize seed production demonstrates that a wide range of pollen volumes can be stored for up to seven days using low-cost, globally available materials and that stored pollen can achieve seed-set equivalency to fresh pollen.
40057515	Larval spongy moth transcriptomic response to ingestion of broad-versus narrow-spectrum insecticidal Chromobacterium species.	The PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> strain of Chromobacterium subtsugae was the first insecticidal bacterium to be registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use in crop protection applications since approval for Bacillus thuringiensis was granted in 1961. C. subtsugae, a Gram-negative betaproteobacterium, exhibits oral toxicity against a broad range of important insects, including dipteran, coleopteran, lepidopteran, and at least some hemipteran and tetranychidan pests. Chromobacterium sphagni is a closely related bacterium exhibiting a distinctly narrower activity spectrum than that of C. subtsugae: it is toxic to lepidopteran, but not dipteran or coleopteran pest insects. The molecular mode of activity for either species is not well characterized at present, and it remains unclear whether these bacterial species affect insects similarly, notwithstanding their close evolutionary relatedness. In this study, synchronized third-instar larvae of the destructive lepidopteran forest pest, Lymantria dispar dispar (European spongy moth), were separately fed with cultures of C. subtsugae strain PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> or C. sphagni strain 14B-1<sup>T</sup> and sampled after 24 h post infection. Gene expression levels in healthy reference versus treated insects were independently compared at the whole-insect and midgut-only tissue levels to characterize host-specific transcriptional responses to intoxication. Treatment induced up-regulation of such antimicrobial peptides as attacin and cecropin, of two cytochrome P450-encoding genes, and of gelsolin, a molecule involved in actin organization. Some differentially expressed genes were novel or uncharacterized, hence future work with lepidopteran species will be necessary to understand insect physiological responses to Chromobacterium infection.
40057263	Bioconversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into valuable bioproducts via synthetic modular co-culture of engineered Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Escherichia coli.	With increasing concern over environmental problems and energy crises, interest in the biological conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into bioproducts is growing. Although microalgae efficiently utilize CO<sub>2</sub>, their metabolic engineering remains challenging. In contrast, while synthetic biology tools are advanced for many heterotrophic bacteria, these organisms cannot directly utilize CO<sub>2</sub>. As such, a modular co-culture system with a glycolate dehydrogenase 1 (GYD1) deficient Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant and Escherichia coli was developed. The GYD1 mutant secretes glycolic acid via photorespiration, which E. coli metabolizes via the glyoxylate cycle. E. coli growth was improved by implementing two-stage continuous systems to 2.0 mg L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> on CO<sub>2</sub>. The production of green fluorescent protein (0.52 ng L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) and lycopene (6.3 μg L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) was also demonstrated. This study represents a successful case of a synthetic modular co-culture with a microalga and a heterotrophic bacterium, potentially contributing to sustainable industrial processes and reducing environmental impact.
40057046	Cryptochromes (CRYs) in pepper: Genome-wide identification, evolution and functional analysis of the negative role of CaCRY1 under Phytophthora capsici infection.	Cryptochromes (CRYs) are ultraviolet-A (UV-A) and blue light photoreceptors that perceive UV-A and blue light to mediate a range of physiological processes including disease response in plants. However, there has been no report about the roles of CRY genes in pepper, which often suffers from Phytophthora blight caused by Phytophthora capsici. In this work, three pepper CRY genes were identified and their characteristics were examined by bioinformatics analysis. CaCRY1 is an ortholog of AtCRY1 located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and expression analysis by RT-qPCR showed that its transcription was differentially regulated by jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), as well as by P. capsici infection (PCI). Overexpression of CaCRY1 in pepper and Nicotiana benthamiana promoted the susceptibility of plants to PCI. Further virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) analysis showed that silencing of CaCRY1 promoted the resistance of pepper plants to PCI with decreased disease index and transcripts of genes associated with SA biosynthesis. RNA-seq analysis showed that CaCRY1 silencing affected many genes in stress-related metabolic pathways. In summary, our findings show that CaCRY1 plays a negative role in the defense response of pepper to PCI, laying a foundation for studying the roles of CRYs in the future.
40056853	Synthetic biology approaches to improve Rubisco carboxylation efficiency in C<sub>3</sub> Plants: Direct and Indirect Strategies.	Food security remains a pressing issue due to the growing global population and climate change, including the global warming along with increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, which can negatively impact C<sub>3</sub> crop yields. A major limitation in C<sub>3</sub> plants is the inefficiency of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) due to its low carboxylation activity and competing oxygenase activity. Improving Rubisco efficiency in C<sub>3</sub> plants is thus essential for improving photosynthetic performance. Recent advances in synthetic biology have introduced promising strategies to overcome these limitations. This review highlights the latest synthetic biology and gene transformation techniques aimed at optimizing Rubsico carboxylation efficiency. Next, direct approaches such as engineering Rubisco subunits by replacing plant Rubisco with proteins from other organisms are discussed. Additionally, indirect strategies involve modifications of Rubisco-interacting proteins and adjustment of Rubisco environment. We explore CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) based on pyrenoids and carboxysomes, which increase local CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations around Rubisco thus favouring the carboxylation reaction. Lastly, photorespiratory bypasses are also covered in this review.
40056837	Comprehensive experimental and computational analysis of endemic Allium tuncelianum: Phytochemical profiling, antimicrobial activity, and In silico studies for potential therapeutic applications.	Allium tuncelianum (TG), an endemic garlic species from Tunceli, Turkey, was investigated using a multidisciplinary approach combining experimental and computational methods. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with B3LYP/def2-SVP/def2-TZVP basis sets were employed to analyze electronic properties, reactivity, and stability under gas and ethanol conditions. Headspace/GC-MS identified 10 major components, with diallyl disulfide (48.03 %) and 1-propene (20.72 %) as predominant. Antimicrobial assays revealed potent activity against MRSA, Salmonella paratyphi A, and E. coli, with MIC values as low as 0.063 mg/mL. Antioxidant capacity, evaluated via DPPH, metal chelating, and FRAP assays, showed promising results, with the water extract exhibiting the highest activity (1.74 mg BHT equivalent/mL). DFT and molecular docking studies highlighted key compounds as potential inhibitors of E. coli Gyrase B, with binding energies of -5.68 and -6.07 kcal/mol. ADME predictions indicated favorable drug-like properties, though some compounds showed potential CYP450 interactions and toxicity. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of TG's biochemical profile and therapeutic potential, offering insights for future research and optimization.
40056744	Hydrogen sulfide enhances cadmium tolerance in oilseed rape roots by augmenting glutathione-mediated antioxidant defense and ROS homeostasis.	Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) plays a crucial role in regulating plant development and stress responses. Here, the potential role of H<sub>2</sub>S in enhancing cadmium (Cd) tolerance by modulating the antioxidant defense system and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis was investigated. The results shown that Cd (II) exposure significantly inhibited the growth and chlorophyll content of rapeseed seedlings. Optimal exogenous sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS; 50 μM) pretreatment markedly alleviated Cd-induced growth inhibition, chlorosis, and root morphology in contrast to increased Cd accumulation in the roots. The DW of the leaves and roots, and the total chlorophyll content increased by 23.8 %, 21.4 % and 114.8 %, respectively. Cd (II)-induced oxidative damage was significantly ameliorated by NaHS application through the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>) accumulation, which were up to 47.3 % and 67.6 %, respectively. Moreover, exogenous NaHS elevated the glutathione (GSH) content and GSH/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio in Cd-stressed roots from 21.9 - 33.3 % and 39.3-87.4 %, respectively. The activity of antioxidant enzymes, with the exception of ascorbate peroxidase, was further elevated by NaHS application. These results suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S enhances Cd tolerance by augmenting GSH pools and activating antioxidant enzymes to control reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, thereby ameliorating Cd-induced oxidative stress in rapeseed seedling roots.
40056359	Rice grain size: current regulatory mechanisms and future perspectives.	Rice is a staple food for over half of the world's population. To feed the growing population, molecular breeders aim to increase grain yield. Grain size is an important factor for crop productivity, and it has been extensively studied. However, molecular breeders face a major challenge in further improving crop productivity in terms of grain yield and quality. Grain size is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes. Over the past few decades, genetic studies have identified various gene families involved in grain size development. The list of molecular mechanisms, and key regulators involved in grain size development is constantly expanding, making it difficult to understand the main regulators that play crucial roles in grain development. In this review, we focus on the major regulators of grain size, including G-protein signaling, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, transcriptional regulation, the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation (UPD) pathway, and phytohormone signaling. These molecular mechanisms directly or indirectly regulate grain size. We provided a comprehensive understanding of the genes involved in these mechanisms and cross discussions about how these mechanisms are interlinked. This review serves as a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern grain development and can aid in the development of molecular breeding strategies.
