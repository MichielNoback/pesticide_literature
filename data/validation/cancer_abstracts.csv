40066698	Single-cell profiling reveals the intratumor heterogeneity and immunosuppressive microenvironment in cervical adenocarcinoma.	Cervical adenocarcinoma (ADC) is more aggressive compared to other types of cervical cancer (CC), such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and tumor heterogeneity are recognized as pivotal factors in cancer progression and therapy. However, the disparities in TIME and heterogeneity between ADC and SCC are poorly understood.
40066676	Arid4a Suppresses Breast Tumor Metastasis by Enhancing MTSS1 Expression via mRNA Stability.	Tumor metastasis is one of the main causes of death in cancer patients; however, the mechanism controlling metastasis is unclear. The posttranscriptional regulation of metastasis-related genes mediated by AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 4A (Arid4a), an RNA-binding protein (RBP), has not been elucidated.
40066672	Multifunctional Liposomes with Enhanced Stability for Imaging-Guided Cancer Chemodynamic and Photothermal Therapy.	Improvements in tumor therapy require a combination of strategies where targeted treatment is critical. We developed a new versatile nanoplatform, MA@E, that generates high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with effective photothermal conversions in the removal of tumors. Enhanced stability liposomes were employed as carriers to facilitate the uniform distribution and stable storage of encapsulated gold nanorods (AuNRs) and Mn-MIL-100 metal-organic frameworks, with efficient delivery of MA@E to the cytoplasm. In the targeted phagocytosis of tumor cells, MA@E can effectively deplete the reduced glutathione (GSH) with increased hydroxyl radicals that combine with Mn<sup>2+</sup> released from Mn-MIL-100 to trigger Fenton-like reactions, generating ROS that induces cell apoptosis. Exposure to near-infrared (NIR-II) irradiation results in a AuNRs-induced thermogenic effect that expedites the release of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and promotes Fenton-like reactions, achieving increased production of <sup>•</sup>OH. In the murine tumor model, MA@E effectively removed the implanted tumor tissue within 2 days without any obvious toxic effects. This response is attributed to a synergism involving the photothermal capability of AuNRs and ROS chemodynamic treatment. The proposed MA@E provides a new approach to utilizing unstable nanomaterials in effective tumor therapy.

40066659	Inhibition of HDAC4 in granulosa cells improved co-cultured oocyte maturation in vitro independent of LH in porcine.	In domestic animals, the mechanisms by which the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge induces oocyte meiosis resumption and maturation through follicular somatic cells remain unclear. Given the pivotal roles of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in regulating gametogenesis, this study investigated the roles of HDACs in follicular granulosa cells (GCs) in mediating LH action during oocyte maturation in pigs. The results showed that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) levels in cultured GCs increased in a time-dependent manner with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation but significantly decreased with LH treatment. The LH-induced reduction of HDAC4 was mediated by the accumulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which subsequently increased H3K18 acetylation and promoted the recruitment of SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) to the promoter of the EGF-like growth factor amphiregulin (Areg). Notably, specific inhibition of HDAC4 promoted oocyte maturation independently of LH in vitro, and the developmental potential of these matured oocytes was comparable to those induced by LH in vitro. In conclusion, HDAC4 in follicular somatic cells serves as a gonadotrophin-responsive epigenetic modification factor that negatively regulates oocyte meiosis resumption in pigs.
40066656	Socioeconomic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Treatment: The Impact of Area Deprivation Index on Initial Treatment Type for Localized PCa in a North-American Cohort.	Socioeconomic status and geographical location contribute to disparities in localized prostate cancer (PCa) treatment. We examined the impact of area of deprivation index (ADI) on initial treatment type for localized PCa in a North-American cohort.

40066652	Intestinal polyps and chronic schistosomiasis.	Intestinal polyps have been described in association with chronic schistosomiasis, and must be differentiated from malignant tumors and appropriately managed. This uncommon condition may be very rarely detected in people from non-endemic areas of this zoonosis, who were occasionally infected during some travel period. The lesions are more frequently described in men, and predominating in the colon. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathological evaluations and finding eggs of Schistosoma in biopsy samples. The use of Praziquantel has been a very effective treatment. The authors emphasize the diagnosis confirmation as early as possible, avoiding mistakes with cancer.
40066650	Chronotype, sleep timing, sleep regularity, and cancer risk: A systematic review.	Sleep is a multidimensional modifiable lifestyle factor related to cancer risk. Prior research has primarily focused on sleep duration, despite the increasing importance of sleep timing and sleep regularity in the health research field. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the existing literature on the relationship of chronotype, sleep timing, and sleep regularity with cancer risk. We searched four databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Embase) in October 2024. The sleep exposures of interest included sleep timing, sleep regularity, sleep midpoint, social jetlag, chronotype, and weekend catch-up sleep, and the outcome of interest was cancer incidence (overall or site-specific). A total of 22 studies were included, of which 18 investigated chronotype, two investigated social jetlag, two investigated sleep midpoint, and one investigated weekend catch-up sleep as the sleep exposure. The majority of studies assessed sleep using self-reported questionnaires (95%) and investigated site-specific cancer incidence (91%). We found no consistent evidence linking late chronotype, later sleep midpoint, increased social jetlag, or weekend catch-up sleep to elevated risk of cancer. This review highlights the heterogeneity in how sleep timing and sleep regularity are assessed. Future research should standardize measures on how to quantify sleep timing and sleep regularity and replication studies in diverse populations are needed. Current evidence on linking sleep timing, sleep regularity, and chronotype with cancer risk remains inconclusive.

40066644	Impact of Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Pleural Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy in Multimodality Treatment for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.	Few malignancies provoke as many controversies about treatment as pleural mesothelioma. There is limited experience with novel radiotherapy techniques worldwide in adjuvant and particularly in neoadjuvant settings within multimodality treatment. The objective of the current study was to investigate the long-term outcome of neoadjuvant and adjuvant pleural intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) combined with macroscopic complete resection with or without chemotherapy.
40066615	NTRK protein expression in NSCLC and its clinicopathological correlation.	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. Since the discovery of the oncogenic neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion in colorectal cancer in 1986, its understanding has gradually progressed. NTRK's relevance is crucial to understanding some tumor development and how specific tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitors (TRKI) work. <i>NTRK1, NTRK2,</i> and <i>NTRK3</i> (encoding the neurotrophin receptors TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, respectively) rearrangement induces high tumor transforming ability. This study investigates the clinical relevance of NTRK immunohistochemistry in NSCLC patients in a cohort of 482 patients from Karolinska University Hospital with detailed clinical and pathological studies. Immunohistochemical staining for NTRK expression was performed, and the results were correlated with patient demographics, histological subtypes, tumor extent, and staging. Our findings revealed that NTRK expression, predominantly membranous and cytoplasmic, was detected in 22 out of 482 cases (4.56%). Notably, NTRK expression was more frequently observed in squamous-cell carcinoma (SqCC) than in adenocarcinoma (AdCa). Clinical correlations indicated a significant association between NTRK expression and histologic subtypes (<i>p</i><0.001) and grade of differentiation (<i>p</i>=0.036). However, no significant correlations were observed with age, sex, tumor size, staging, or OS. NTRK immunohistochemistry represents a potential biomarker for a subset of NSCLC patients, particularly those with SqCC histology. Understanding the clinical implications of NTRK expression may contribute to personalized treatment strategies in NSCLC.
40066587	Clinical Significance of Bone Metastases in Pleural Mesothelioma.	Bone metastasis (BoM) is common in advanced cancer, but its incidence in pleural mesothelioma (PM) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the incidence of BoM in PM patients and assess its prognosis and risk factors to clarify its clinical significance.
40066580	Comorbidities of hypothyroidism.	Hypothyroidism is a relatively common condition that may affect as many as 10% of the population worldwide when its overt and subclinical presentations are considered. Important clinical comorbidities are highly prevalent in people with hypothyroidism and diminish quality of life and functional status in a manner that is proportional to the number of comorbidities present and their severity. This article reviews the common comorbidities of hypothyroidism, as reported in the literature. The comorbidities of hypothyroidism include clinical conditions commonly associated with hypothyroidism, such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, fatigue or (possibly) cardiovascular disease, and can appear whether or not intervention with LT4 is applied appropriately to ensure biochemical euthyroidism. Other comorbidities may share some pathogenetic background with hypothyroidism, including depression or anxiety, or autoimmune conditions. Hypothyroidism may arise as a comorbidity of some other conditions, e.g. following the application of targeted cancer therapies or alemtuzumab for multiple sclerosis. Other common treatments, including metformin, glucocorticoids or proton pump inhibitors among others, may alter levels of thyrotropin, thus impacting on the monitoring of thyroid dysfunction and the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Ensuring good control of hypothyroidism is a necessary first step in managing any patient with hypothyroidism. Then, physicians should be aware of the possibility of other comorbid conditions that must be addressed to achieve an optimal patient outcome.
40066574	Influence of handgrip strength on postoperative complications and survival in primary liver cancer patients.	the impact of handgrip strength (HGS) on postoperative complications and long-term survival following hepatectomy in patients with primary liver cancer (PLC) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of HGS on postoperative complications and overall survival in patients with PLC.
40066559	Prognostic Value of Serum β2-Microglobulin in Predicting Survival of Patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.	This study investigated the predictive value of β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) on the prognosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients.
40066557	Early Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer via Plasma-Derived SDC2, KCNQ5, and IKZF1 Methylation Levels.	The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly increasing, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving the prognosis and survival rates of patients. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic ability of combined SDC2-KCNQ5-IKZF1 methylation levels in plasma for CRC detection.
40066554	The Diagnostic and Differential Value of the Serum Albumin-to-Globulin Ratio in Multiple Myeloma.

40066548	METTL7A as a New Candidate Biomarker in Gastric Cancer by Genomics and Data-Independent Acquisition Proteomic Analysis.	Early diagnosis and intervention are essential for improving the prognosis and survival of gastric cancer (GC) patients. However, specific biomarkers for early GC diagnosis are still unavailable.
40066547	Immune-Related Adverse Event of Immunotherapy: Diabetes.	The development of immunotherapy has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of malignant tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) function by blocking the receptors and ligands of T cells from binding one another, empowering them to target and attack cancer cells. ICIs along with other immunotherapy treatments, have seen a significant increase in usage in recent years. However, this increased utilization has been accompanied by a significant rise in immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While the majority of irAEs reported are linked to endocrine dysfunction, less common irAES affecting the gastrointestinal, skin, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac systems have also been reported.
40066544	Association of Multiple Clefts Nuclei in Blasts with TCF3::PBX1 Fusion in B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma.	Several particular kinds of typical morphology characteristics of leukemic blasts associated with the specific subtypes of leukemia have been reported. However, B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL) has rarely been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation of TCF3::PBX1 fusion with multiple clefts nuclei of blasts in patients with B-ALL/LBL.
40066532	Clinical, Immunologic, and Genetic Characteristics of T-lymphoblastic Leukemia with STIL-TAL1 Fusion.	T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with a less favorable prognosis. The genetic background of T-ALL is widely heterogeneous, with the co-occurrence of multiple genetic abnormalities. The STIL-TAL1 rearrangement results from a submicroscopic deletion on chromosome 1p33 and is present in 15 - 25% of T-ALL cases. Submicroscopic deletions are not detected by conventional cytogenetic ana-lyses but can be identified through array comparative genomic hybridization and/or high-throughput RNA sequencing. Patients with the STIL-TAL1 fusion exhibit distinct characteristics, such as a young age, high white blood cell count, typical immunophenotype, and specific genetic abnormalities. However, the clinical, laboratory, and prognostic significance of this rearrangement remains unclear. This study was performed to identify STIL-TAL1 rearrangement resulting from submicroscopic 1p33 deletion in T-ALL and to investigate the clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics of T-ALL patients with STIL-TAL1 fusion.
40066516	Quantitative Detection of Orthotopic Liver Cancer in Mice Using Indocyanine Green and Dynamic Diffuse Fluorescence Tomography Imaging.	Orthotopic tumor model has become an essential tool for studying drug biodistribution and tumor progression over time owing to the rapid development of in vivo imaging and immunological science. Dynamic diffuse fluorescence tomography (DFT) is a promising imaging modality that can map the three-dimensional distribution of a fluorophore within the object and capture the metabolic parameters of fluorophores in vivo. It has been widely applied in tumor detection, drug development, and efficacy evaluation. To detect orthotopic liver tumors, we combined indocyanine green (ICG) and a DFT system to perform fluorescence imaging and quantitative analysis for orthotopic liver tumors in mice. The orthotopic liver models were first established, and the liver fluorescence yields were detected in pre- and post-cancerous liver using the DFT system. The results showed that there was higher liver uptake and prolonged retention in orthotopic tumor liver compared to normal liver. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic parameters suggested the uptake coefficient of tumor liver was above twice that of normal liver, while the excretion rates were similar. Additionally, to intuitively assess tumor occurrence, we propose using normalized fluorescence ratios of 5 and maximum fluorescence values of 0.01 mm<sup>-1</sup> as evaluation criteria. The study demonstrates DFT imaging is a promising tool in orthotopic tumor model detection and drug or agent metabolic evaluation.
40066501	FLOT1 Is a Novel Serum Biomarker of Ovarian Cancer Targeted by N6-methyladenosine Modification Inhibition.	Ovarian cancer (OC) is a deadly disease and lacks a precise marker for diagnosis worldwide. Our previous work has shown the overexpression of flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in OC tissue. To improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, we evaluated the serum level of FLOT1 in OC patients and found that the serum concentration of FLOT1 as well as CA125 was significantly increased in patients with OC compared with healthy control (p < 0.01) and those with benign tumors (p < 0.05). The detection rate (above the upper limit of a cut-off value) of FLOT1 and CA125 was 77.78% and 72.22%, respectively, in patients with OC, which was increased to 88.89% in combination. The elevation of FLOT1 was confirmed in the serum of nude mice after the implantation of human OC cells. A high level of FLOT1 protein in the serum was positively correlated with the overexpression of FLOT1 protein in OC tissues. Furthermore, the level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of FLOT1 mRNA was significantly high in OC cells compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells, leading to an increase in FLOT1 mRNA expression. Application of a methylation inhibitor, 3-deazaadenosine, decreased FLOT1 mRNA expression in OC cells and suppressed tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that FLOT1 is a novel serum biomarker of OC and can be targeted by m<sup>6</sup>A modification inhibition. These data highlight the potential application of FLOT1 as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for patients with OC.
40066500	Who cares about the dying? - Unpacking integration of palliative care and oncology in the Danish context.	Integrating palliative care into the trajectories of patients with incurable cancer has been a priority for years. Yet, the intended outcomes of this integration remain elusive. Many patients with advanced cancer continue to receive so-called aggressive treatments in the end-of-life phase or miss out on specialised palliative care entirely. To examine this impasse in the Danish context, we employ the concept of <i>professional value scripts</i> to analyse policy documents and guidelines aimed at guiding professionals working with this patient group. The three identified scripts - cancer treatment, medical palliation and holistic palliative care - embody a distinct understanding of integration, contributing to the challenges of forging an integrated approach. We argue that the central role of the cancer treatment script in patient trajectories creates an obligatory passage point, influencing both the symbolic and practical enactment of integrated palliative care throughout these trajectories.
40066494	Differential Neurogenesis Status Among Achalasia Subtypes.	Achalasia is an acquired esophageal neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by selective loss of inhibitory neurons in the myenteric plexus of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The Enteric neural precursor cell (ENPC) is essential in maintaining neurogenesis, but its role in achalasia pathogenesis is unknown. This study aimed to explore the neurogenesis status in the LES among achalasia patients.
40066493	Impact of diabetes on risk of major adverse cardiovascular events associated with lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.	Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an emerging risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). However, evidence on MACE risk according to Lp(a) level in atherosclerotic patients is insufficient, and more data is needed about whether type 2 diabetes (T2DM) additionally contributes to this risk. We aimed to investigate the association between Lp(a) and MACE in atherosclerotic patients and compare the magnitude of Lp(a)-MACE association in the patients with and without T2DM.
40066469	3D anatomical digital twins: New generation virtual models to navigate robotic partial nephrectomy.	Objective 3D virtual models have gained interest in urology, particularly in the context of robotic partial nephrectomy. From these, newly developed "anatomical digital twin models" reproduce both the morphological and anatomical characteristics of the organs, including the texture of the tissues they comprise. The aim of the study was to develop and test the new digital twins in the setting of intraoperative guidance during robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). Patient and Methods The production path of the 3D model-digital twin of an organ begins with a phantom of virtual elements, including the kidney's parenchyma, vessels, tumour and collecting system. Textures are created from intraoperative robotic surgery images using machine learning algorithms. The result is a 3D model - digital twin that replicates the organ's shape and appearance. Two surgeons, one experienced and one young, used both the standard 3D model and the digital twin in four surgical phases: identifying the organ and its boundaries, dissecting the vascular pedicle, isolating the neoplastic lesion and identifying the renal pelvis and ureter. Results 4 patients, 2 per each surgeon harbouring a low and intermediate complexity (PADUA 6 and 8) renal masses respectively, underwent RAPN. From the assessment made by the surgeons at the end of each procedure, the 3D digital twin models were found to be superior to their standard counterparts both in terms of concordance with real anatomy and in usefulness to guide the identification of the tumour, vascular pedicle and ureter, while they did not demonstrate significant advantages in identifying the kidney and its margins. Conclusions The new 3D digital twin models represent a step forward towards the personalization of virtual reconstructions. Approaching real anatomy more closely, they offer the surgeons a perceived higher degree of concordance with the intraoperative environment, making it easier to identify the structures of interest during the surgical procedure.
40066468	Impact of prostate cancer screening in European ancestry un-affected men with germline DNA repair pathogenic variants.	Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant global health concern, ranking as the second most prevalent cancer among men worldwide. Genetic factors, particularly germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in DNA repair genes (DRGs), play a crucial role in PCa predisposition. Our study aimed to assess patients' adherence to a targeted PCa screening program targeting high-risk individuals with DRG PVs and evaluate the potential reduction in biopsy and MRI rates by employing our screening protocol.
40066458	Survival benefits of postoperative radiotherapy in esophageal cancer during the immunotherapy era:a retrospective cohort study based on the SEER database and a single-center registry in China.

40066456	Influence of gut microbial metabolites on tumor immunotherapy: mechanisms and potential natural products.	In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, individual differences in efficacy have been observed in clinical practice. There is increasing evidence that gut microbial metabolites influence the efficacy of distal tumor immunotherapy via the gut-liver axis, the gut-brain axis and the gut-breast axis, a process that may involve modulating the expression of immune cells and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we systematically explore the relationship between gut microbial metabolites and tumor immunotherapy, and examine the corresponding natural products and their mechanisms of action. The in-depth exploration of this research area will provide new ideas and strategies to enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy and mitigate adverse effects.
40066455	Identification and functional characterization of T-cell exhaustion-associated lncRNA AL031775.1 in osteosarcoma: a novel therapeutic target.	Osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone malignancy predominantly affecting children and adolescents, presents significant therapeutic challenges with a 5-year survival rate below 30% in metastatic cases. T-cell exhaustion, characterized by the overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules, contributes to osteosarcoma progression and immune evasion. Although targeting these inhibitory pathways has shown potential in restoring T-cell activity, the molecular regulators of T-cell depletion in osteosarcoma are poorly understood.
40066454	Integrated multiomics analysis and machine learning refine neutrophil extracellular trap-related molecular subtypes and prognostic models for acute myeloid leukemia.

The formation of NETs is impaired in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which can result in immunodeficiency and increased susceptibility to infection.
40066453	Bioinformatics analysis reveals novel tumor antigens and immune subtypes of skin cutaneous melanoma contributing to mRNA vaccine development.	Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a common malignant skin cancer with high mortality and recurrence rates. Although the mRNA vaccine is a promising strategy for cancer treatment, its application against SKCM remains confusing. In this study, we employed computational bioinformatics analysis to explore SKCM-associated antigens for an mRNA vaccine and suitable populations for vaccination.
40066449	Case report: Efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for high tumour mutational burden malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast as revealed by comprehensive genomic profiling.	High tumour mutational burden (TMB-high), identified through comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP), is a biomarker that predicts the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. CGP testing is recommended for rare cancers with limited effective treatment options. Here, we provide the first report of a malignant phyllodes tumour of the breast demonstrating TMB-high status and effective treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient initially underwent right breast tumour resection and was diagnosed with a malignant phyllodes tumour. Recurrence was observed at the same site with metastases to the pulmonary hilar and right axillary lymph nodes. CGP testing revealed TMB-high status and microsatellite stable. Pembrolizumab was initiated after chemotherapy for the soft tissue sarcoma. After two treatment cycles, imaging revealed a partial response of the pulmonary hilar lymph nodes and necrotic enlargement of the right axillary lymph node. After four cycles, all lymph nodes had reduced in size. Eight months after ten cycles of pembrolizumab treatment, multiple new nodules were observed in both lungs, indicating disease progression. This case highlights the utility of CGP testing in rare cancers, demonstrating the first evidence of TMB-high malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast responding to pembrolizumab and underscoring the value of expanding CGP testing to improve therapeutic strategies for rare cancers.
40066447	Case Report: Complete response to four cycles of camrelizumab in a PD-L1 negative patient with advanced oral squamous cancer.	Immunotherapy has brought better survival benefits in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). However, owing to the lack of relevant biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of this treatment, it often has to be maintained. Here we report on a patient with stage IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue who developed an unresectable lesion in the neck after surgery and radical chemoradiotherapy. After four cycles of intermittent immunotherapy with camrelizumab, complete response (CR) was achieved. Next-generation sequencing showed that the TP53/FANCA/FAT1 gene mutations and negative PD-L1 expression were involved. The patient has been followed up for 4 years without R/M. This situation has not been reported previously, suggesting that some patients can benefit from short-term immunotherapy and even achieve CR; moreover, there may be more molecular markers to be discovered that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy. We can conduct in-depth research on relevant molecular markers, formulate personalized immunotherapy strategies and plans, and facilitate the development of new precision treatment strategies for HNSCC.
40066446	Exercise boost after surgery improves survival in model of metastatic breast cancer.	Despite advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment of the primary tumor, metastatic breast cancer tumors remain largely incurable, and their growth is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. There is therefore a critical need to identify ways to reduce metastatic tumor burden and increase breast cancer patient survival. While surgery and pharmacological treatments are the cornerstones of breast cancer intervention, epidemiological data suggests that physical activity can lower the risk of breast cancer development, improve adjuvant treatment tolerance, reduce the risk of disease recurrence and lower breast cancer-related death.
40066443	Unveiling SSR4: a promising biomarker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) represents a frequent cancer with a poor prognosis. Altered glucose metabolism contributes factor to ESCC progression. In our previous study, signal sequence receptor subunit delta (SSR4) was included in an ESCC prognostic model; however, the mechanisms underlying SSR4 implication in ESCC remain ambiguous. Accordingly, we aim to determine the interconnection between SSR4 expression and clinical characteristics of ESCC.
40066442	A comprehensive prognostic and immunological implications of Gremlin 1 in lung adenocarcinoma.	Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a prevalent form of lung cancer globally, known for its high invasiveness, metastatic potential, and notable heterogeneity, particularly in its response to immunotherapy. Gremlin 1 (GREM1) is implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis in multiple cancers. However, GREM1's specific role in LUAD remains unclear. This study systematically examines GREM1 expression in LUAD and its association with tumor progression, immune microenvironment, and prognosis.
40066440	In-depth analysis of the safety of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors.	In recent years, the rapid progress in oncology, immunology, and molecular biology has dramatically advanced cancer immunotherapy, particularly CAR-T cell therapy. This innovative approach involves engineering a patient's T cells to express receptors that specifically target tumor antigens, enhancing their ability to identify and eliminate cancer cells. However, the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors is often hampered by the challenging tumor microenvironment (TME). The complex TME includes dense stroma that obstructs T cell infiltration, abnormal blood vessel structures leading to hypoxia, and an acidic pH, all of which hinder CAR-T cell function. Additionally, the presence of immunosuppressive factors in the TME reduces the efficacy of CAR-T cells, making successful targeting of tumors more difficult. The safety of CAR-T therapy has gained interest, especially CAR-T therapy has shown considerable effectiveness in various cancers, with notable results in multiple myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, among others. Nonetheless, CAR-T cell therapy is associated with several adverse reactions primarily driven by heightened levels of proinflammatory cytokines. These reactions include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (CANS), and organ toxicity, often leading to serious complications. CRS, characterized by systemic inflammation due to cytokine release, can escalate to severe organ dysfunction. It typically occurs within the first week post-infusion, correlating with CAR-T cell expansion and often presents with fever and hypotension. Meanwhile, CANS encompasses neurological issues ranging from mild symptoms to severe seizures, possibly exacerbated by CRS. Organ toxicity can also arise from CAR-T therapy, with potential damage affecting the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, and lungs, often tied to shared antigens found in both tumor and healthy tissues. Moreover, long-term effects like cytokine-associated hematotoxicity (CAHT) and secondary malignancies represent significant concerns that could affect the patient's quality of life post-treatment. The long-term adverse effects and challenges in treating solid tumors underscore the need for ongoing research. Strategies to improve CAR-T cell efficacy, minimize adverse reactions, and enhance patient safety are critical. Future explorations could include designing CAR-T cells to better navigate the TME, identifying specific target antigen profiles to minimize off-target damage, and developing adjunct therapies to mitigate cytokine-related toxicity. Continued monitoring for long-term effects will also be paramount in improving patient outcomes and maintaining their quality of life. Overall, while CAR-T therapy holds great promise, it must be administered with careful consideration of potential side effects and rigorous management strategies to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy.
40066439	Tissue-resident memory T cells in urinary tract diseases.	Tissue-resident memory T (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells are a specialized subset of memory T cells that permanently reside in non-lymphoid tissues, providing localized and long-lasting immune protection. In the urinary tract, T<sub>RM</sub> cells play critical roles in defending against infections, mediating tumor immunity, and influencing the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic potential is immense, with promising avenues for vaccine development, enhanced cancer immunotherapy, and targeted treatments for chronic inflammation. However, challenges remain in harnessing their protective roles while minimizing their pathological effects, particularly in immunosuppressive or inflammatory microenvironments. This review explores the diverse roles of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in urinary tract diseases, including infections, cancer, and chronic inflammation, and discusses therapeutic strategies and future directions for leveraging T<sub>RM</sub> cells to improve clinical outcomes. By advancing our understanding of T<sub>RM</sub> cell biology, we can develop innovative interventions that balance their immune-protective and regulatory functions.
40066437	Treatment at the end of life in patients with advanced melanoma. A multicenter DeCOG study of 1067 patients from the prospective skin cancer registry ADOReg.	Although systemic therapies have improved considerably over the last decade, up to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma still die due to disease progression. Oncological treatment at the end-of-life phase is challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and type of systemic therapy received by melanoma patients in their end-of-life phase.
40066431	The Impact of Primary Tumor Volume on Survival of Patients with Non-Surgically Treated Advanced-Stage Hypopharyngeal Cancer- Retrospective Study and Literature Overview.	To determine the prognostic value of tumor volume in predicting the survival in patients with stage III-IV of hypopharyngeal carcinoma. We studied 71 patients with advanced stage of hypopharyngeal carcinoma. The volume of primary tumor was calculated by approximation of the ellipsoid volume. Correlation between carcinoma volume and demographic, clinical and carcinoma characteristics has shown that male patients and patients consuming alcohol had greater tumor volumes. The median of overall survival was at 12 months (95% CI: 9.25-14.75); the median of progression-free survival was at 9 months (95% CI: 6.6-11.3). ROC Curve Analysis of carcinoma volumes in outcome prediction shows that the cutoff of 14.69 had the sensitivity of 61% and specifics of 89%. Based on significant independent impact of tumor volume on survival, it is important to include this parameter among possible new treatment protocols.
40066417	Brain Metastasis from Oral Cancer Presenting with Seizures and Cranial Nerve Palsy in Immediate Post Operative Period- A Rare Occurrence.	Metastasis is the hallmark of malignancy but the spread to brain is an exceedingly rare occurrence for oral cancer. Two of our patients who underwent definitive surgery for oral cancer developed manifestations of Central nervous system (CNS) involvement within 7 days of surgery, one with seizures and other with cranial nerve palsies (3rd and 7th ), who were otherwise symptom free for CNS involvement preoperatively. These cases highlight the need for thorough metastasis workup including CNS.
40066416	Assessment of Prevalence and Factors Affecting Trismus in Cases of Oral and Oropharyngeal Malignancies after Complete Treatment.	Trismus, or restricted mouth opening is a very common and often neglected side effect in oral and oropharyngeal malignancies owing to the disease itself as well as its treatment with surgery and/or chemoradiation. This study aims at assessing the prevalence of trismus occurring after complete treatment in diagnosed cases of oral and oropharyngeal malignancy and to assess various risk factors associated with development of trismus in these patients. A prospective, observational study conducted over a 2 years at a tertiary care hospital. All newly diagnosed cases of oral and oropharyngeal malignancy seeking treatment were included. Maximal mouth opening as the interincisoral distance measured using a Vernier Calliper was done so in each patient at presentation before initiation of treatment, before adjuvant therapy, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment and the results were analysed. The primary modality of treatment, type of surgery, reconstruction performed and patient's recovery were monitored. Out of 72 patients included, 60 had oral cancers and the remaining oropharyngeal. The overall prevalence was 61.1%. The following variables were found to be associated with higher prevalence of trismus- Tumour size, advanced primary disease (T3, T4 disease), oral submucous fibrosis and radiation. There is a high prevalence of trismus in treated patients of oral and oropharyngeal malignancies more so in cases of oral cancer undergoing surgery with adjuvant therapy. There is a need to find treatment modalities with better functional outcomes and direct oral rehabilitation strategies towards alleviation of trismus.
40066410	Lymphoepithelial Cyst in the Elderly Neck: A Diagnostic Conundrum.	A 50-year-old male, chronic tobacco chewer, presented with right-sided lateral neck cyst.

This case underscores the diagnostic conundrum posed by the misnomer "branchial cyst" and the necessity for comprehensive evaluation, to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
40066409	Expression of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in Nasal Polyp: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	Nasal polyp (NP) is a pathological benign mass that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. This lesion is occasionally associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which is named chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) indicates abnormal cell proliferation which may help assess the nasopharyngeal lesions and upper airway cancers. This study aimed to examine the PCNA expression in NP tissue. This study was conducted under the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A thorough search using relevant keywords was performed on the electronic database to identify studies examining the PCNA expression in NP. Meta-analysis on pooled single group proportion and means of PCNA expression was conducted by the metamean and metaprop functions in R software (version 4.4.0). Quality assessment was done according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Ten articles were included in this study. The PCNA expression in NP was higher than in normal nasal mucosa (NNM), while its expression in NP was lower than in inverted papilloma (IP). The mean percentage of PCNA expression in NP was 15.73% (95%-CI[2.87-28.58]) with considerable heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 97%[96-98%],<i>p</i>-value < 0.01). Based on a cutoff staining (> 5%), 64% of NP samples were PCNA-positive (95%-CI[42-81%]) with high heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 76%[47-89%], <i>p</i>-value < 0.01). NP tissue has a relatively high expression of the PCNA oncoprotein based on the immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Although more than half of NP samples were positive for PCNA, still the mean expression of this marker in NP was lower than in IP tissue.

Dermatologic complications are thought to be related to hydrogel situated between the electrodes and scalp or skin to facilitate electric field penetration. High intensity of TTFields on these surfaces may also be a contributing factor. We explored conductivity changes in the hydrogel and skin to improve TTFields coverage and penetration.
40066338	Progress of tanshinone IIA against respiratory diseases: therapeutic targets and potential mechanisms.	The respiratory system stands as one of the eight pivotal systems within the human body, responsible for a range of essential functions. Primarily, it facilitates the absorption of oxygen from the external environment and the expulsion of carbon dioxide, thereby playing a crucial role in regulating the body's acid-base balance. Furthermore, it helps to maintain the stability of the internal environment, ensuring the smooth progression of normal metabolic processes and sustaining life activities. In the wake of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak, respiratory diseases have continued to exhibit comparatively high morbidity and mortality rates, underscoring the urgent need for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a bioactive chemical constituent derived from <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge,</i> has emerged as a promising candidate. As a significant fat-soluble compound, Tan IIA has traditionally been utilized in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. As research on Tan IIA has progressed, its multifaceted therapeutic potential has been unveiled. Specifically, Tan IIA has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, anti-fibrosis, and anti-cancer effects. In recent years, a wealth of studies has concentrated on elucidating its impact on various respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, and lung cancer. These findings collectively suggest that Tan IIA holds considerable promise in the realm of anti-respiratory disease therapies. The present article undertakes a comprehensive review of the targets and potential mechanisms of Tan IIA against respiratory diseases, offering valuable insights that can serve as a reference for future research endeavors and clinical applications of Tan IIA in the treatment of respiratory ailments.
40066335	Gold complex QB1561 suppresses drug-resistant cancer cells by inhibiting TrxR and mitochondrial respiratory function.	Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is one of the leading reasons that cause the failures of cancer treatment. Novel agents that may reverse MDR and neutralize drug-resistant cancer cells are highly desirable for clinical practice. The targeting of cellular redox homeostasis and/or mitochondria-mediated energy metabolism are promising strategies for the suppression of drug-resistant cancer cells. Based on the structure of mono-gold(I) complex auranofin (AF), a drug candidate under clinical trials for cancer, we synthesized a new dual-gold(I) complex QB1561 and tested if it can inhibit drug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We also investigated if QB1561 could inhibit thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a well-known target of AF and other gold complexes, and assessed its impact on mitochondrial respiration.
40066333	Cepharanthine hydrochloride: a novel ferroptosis-inducing agent for prostate cancer treatment.	Ferroptosis is an intracellular iron-dependent cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Increasing evidence indicated that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in suppressing tumors, thus providing new opportunities for cancer therapy. The drug cepharanthine, commonly used to treat leukopenia, has been discovered to function as an anticancer agent to multiple types of cancer via diverse mechanisms. However, the effect of cepharanthine on prostate cancer remains unclear.
40066330	Potential mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine intervention in gastric cancer: targeted regulation of autophagy.	Gastric cancer (GC) is a prevalent malignant tumor that originates from the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa, predominantly in the form of adenocarcinoma. Extensive research has confirmed the significant role of autophagy in the initiation, progression, and chemoresistance of GC. The potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to exert anti-tumor effects by modulating autophagy has been demonstrated, particularly in the context of GC prevention and treatment. Natural products (NPs) have great therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of GC by targeting autophagy-related genes and signaling pathways to intervene in the biological behaviors of gastric cancer cells such as proliferation, metastasis, invasion and death. This article describes the molecular mechanisms and key markers of tumor autophagy, the signaling pathways involved in GC-associated autophagy (PI3K/AKT/mTOR, AMPK, MAPK, p53), and summarizes the mechanism of autophagy and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection in GC, how autophagy interacts with apoptotic and iron-death processes and the wide-ranging influences that these factors play in the process. Finally, this paper systematically summarizes the natural compounds of terpenoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, saponins, and polysaccharides that modulate autophagy-related signaling pathways and potential targets for the treatment of GC, and evaluates the toxic effects of NPs, providing a more compelling rationale and direction for GC therapy.
40066325	Optimizing Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Therapy via Ultrasound-Enhanced Piezocatalysis for Targeted Chemodrug Release.	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is known for its high malignancy, limited clinical treatment options, and poor chemotherapy outcomes. Although some advancements have been made using nanotechnology-based chemotherapy for TNBC treatment, the controlled and on-demand release of chemotherapeutic drugs at the tumor site remains a challenge.
40066322	Biomimetic Self-Oxygenated Immunoliposome for Cancer-Targeted Photodynamic Immunotherapy.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy with significant clinical application potential for tumor treatment. However, the tumor hypoxia and limited efficacy against tumor metastasis present significant limitations in the clinical application of PDT. To alleviate tumor hypoxia for PDT against tumor growth and metastasis, we developed a self-oxygenated immunoliposome by encapsulating the catalase (CAT) within the liposome cavity and loading the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and immunoadjuvant MPLA in the lipid bilayer of the immunoliposome (CAT@LP-Ce6-A). Subsequently, we fused it with the cancer cell membrane (CCM) to create the hybrid immunoliposome (CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A). The in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A-based photodynamic immunotherapy (PDIT) was evaluated.

40066272	The landscape of biofilm models for phage therapy: mimicking biofilms in diabetic foot ulcers using 3D models.	Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) affect up to 15-25% of patients suffering from diabetes and are considered a global health concern. These ulcers may result in delayed wound healing and chronic infections, with the potential to lead to amputations. It has been estimated that 85% of diabetes-related amputations are preceded by a diagnosis of DFU. A critical factor in the persistence of this disease is the presence of polymicrobial biofilms, which generally include <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The involvement of diabetic comorbidities such as ischemia, hyperglycemia, and immune-compromised status creates a perfect niche for these bacteria to evade the body's immune response and persist as biofilms. Bacteriophage therapy can target and lyse specific bacteria and is emerging as an effective treatment for biofilm-related infections. While this treatment shows promise in addressing chronic wounds, our current models, including animal and static systems, fail to capture the full complexity of DFU. Innovative approaches such as 3D bioengineered skin models, organoid models, and hydrogel-based systems are being developed to simulate DFU microenvironments more accurately in 3D without using <i>ex vivo</i> or animal tissues. These advanced models are critical for evaluating bacteriophage efficacy in biofilm-associated DFU, aiming to enhance preclinical assessments and improve therapeutic outcomes for DFU patients.
40066263	Ultrasonography: an aid in molecular subtyping of breast carcinoma.	The recognition of molecular subtypes of breast cancer has initiated a new regimen of targeted therapy.

40066262	Integrated Single-Step Terahertz Metasensing for Simultaneous Detection Based on Exosomal Membrane Proteins Enables Pathological Typing of Gastric Cancer.	Exosomes (Exos) are emerging as noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and progression monitoring of gastric cancer (GC). However, the heterogeneity discrimination and ultrasensitive quantification of Exos presents a considerable analytical challenge, thereby impeding severely their clinical application. Herein, we propose an integrated terahertz metasensing platform for the discrimination of Exos in distinct subtypes of GC in a single step-through the simultaneous evaluation of the category and richness level of Exos membrane proteins. Characterized by dual-sided independent sensing capabilities with enhanced sensitivity (169 and 325 GHz per refractive index unit, respectively), the metasensor functionalized with antibodies simultaneously reflects the content of 2 membrane proteins in the terahertz spectral response. Our approach concurrently completes accurate differentiation and precise quantification of GC-subtype Exos by integrating dual-sided sensing information in merely a single assay. The dual-sided sensing design enhances the reliability of detection results. Moreover, combined with the signal amplification of gold nanoparticles, the platform experimentally demonstrates a superior dynamic response to Exos concentrations spanning from 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> particles/ml, with the limit of detection being 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> particles/ml. This work provides new insights into multisensing metasurface design and paves the way for precise and personalized cancer treatment through the specific sensing of Exos.
40066261	Comprehensive investigation of proteoglycan gene expression in breast cancer: Discovery of a unique proteoglycan gene signature linked to the malignant phenotype.	Solid tumors present a formidable challenge in oncology, necessitating innovative approaches to improve therapeutic outcomes. Proteoglycans, multifaceted molecules within the tumor microenvironment, have garnered attention due to their diverse roles in cancer progression. Their unique ability to interact with specific membrane receptors, growth factors, and cytokines provides a promising avenue for the development of recombinant proteoglycan-based therapies that could enhance the precision and efficacy of cancer treatment. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the proteoglycan gene landscape in human breast carcinomas. Leveraging the available wealth of genomic and clinical data regarding gene expression in breast carcinoma and using a machine learning model, we identified a unique gene expression signature composed of five proteoglycans differentially modulated in the tumor tissue: Syndecan-1 and asporin (upregulated) and decorin, PRELP and podocan (downregulated). Additional query of the breast carcinoma data revealed that serglycin, previously shown to be increased in breast carcinoma patients and mouse models and to correlate with a poor prognosis, was indeed decreased in the vast majority of breast cancer patients and its levels inversely correlated with tumor progression and invasion. This proteoglycan gene signature could provide novel diagnostic capabilities in breast cancer biology and highlights the need for further utilization of publicly available datasets for the clinical validation of preclinical experimental results.
40066251	Exploring the underlying molecular connections: a bioinformatics approach to link melanoma and Parkinson's disease.	Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, and Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, have been epidemiologically linked, showing a positive association that suggests a shared etiology. This association implies that individuals with one condition may have an increased risk of developing the other. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in both PD and melanoma to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may contribute to the pathophysiological overlap between these two conditions.

This study presents real-world data on the use of trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab, in combination with anthracycline and taxanes-based chemotherapy regimen.
40066235	Patient-Derived Organoids for Guiding Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Bilateral Primary Breast Cancer: A Case Report.	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard of care for locally advanced breast cancer, but the response to chemotherapy is unpredictable due to unknown information on the tumor drug sensitivity. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have recently been revealed to be a promising platform for assessing drug sensitivity in many cancers. A 46-year-old woman presented to the hospital due to an accidentally discovered mass in the left breast. Based on core-needle biopsies, pathologic examination showed invasive breast cancer in both breasts. In combination with immunohistochemistry, the patient was diagnosed with left breast cancer IIB with axillary lymphatic metastasis and right breast cancer IIA. The NAC with albumin-bound paclitaxel, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide was used. Although partial response was assessed overall, the left tumor did not lessen significantly; thus, organoids from bilateral breasts were cultured. After treatment with PDO-sensitive vinorelbine and carboplatin, partial response was achieved in the left compared with the initial tumor. Meanwhile, bilateral mastectomy was performed successfully, with pathological complete response achieved in the right. This typical case suggests that the PDOs from bilateral primary breast cancers can serve as a powerful tool to identify the sensitivity to NAC, thus providing novel treatment options at the patient-specific level.
40066232	Multidisciplinary Management of Palpebral Melanoma.	Ocular melanoma encompasses the uveal tract, conjunctiva, eyelid, and orbit. Palpebral localization is extremely infrequent, constituting less than 1% of skin melanomas, the main treatment of which is surgical. However, the radicality of the resection is restricted by anatomical location and functional sequelae. The importance of obtaining free surgical margins, which impact the percentage rate of locoregional recurrence and patient survival, has led to recommendations regarding the distance of the margin in the macroscopic (5 mm) and microscopic (>2 mm) evaluation, as well as the use of Mohs surgical technique for selected groups. Adequate surgical and reconstructive planning are the main objectives of multidisciplinary management in these patients. We present the case of a patient with palpebral melanoma treated in an oncology unit in Latin America.
40066231	The Role of Yes-Associated Protein in Inflammatory Diseases and Cancer.	Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays a central role in the Hippo pathway, primarily governing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its significance extends to tumorigenesis and inflammatory conditions, impacting disease initiation and progression. Given the increasing relevance of YAP in inflammatory disorders and cancer, this study aims to elucidate its pathological regulatory functions in these contexts. Specifically, we aim to investigate the involvement and molecular mechanisms of YAP in various inflammatory diseases and cancers. We particularly focus on how YAP activation, whether through Hippo-dependent or independent pathways, triggers the release of inflammation and inflammatory mediators in respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive inflammatory conditions. In cancer, YAP not only promotes tumor cell proliferation and differentiation but also modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby fostering tumor metastasis and progression. Additionally, we provide an overview of current YAP-targeted therapies. By emphasizing YAP's role in inflammatory diseases and cancer, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the protein's pivotal involvement in disease processes, elucidate the intricate pathological mechanisms of related diseases, and contribute to future drug development strategies targeting YAP.
40066228	<i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> Promotes the Growth and Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer by Activating E-Cadherin/Krüppel-Like Factor 4/Integrin α5 Signaling in a Calcium-Dependent Manner.	Gut microbiota and integrins are known to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether they interact has been unclear. Here, we provided evidence that <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> upregulated integrin α5 (ITGA5) in CRC in both human patients and murine models. Knocking down <i>ITGA5</i> in CRC cells weakened the ability of <i>F. nucleatum</i> to stimulate their malignant characteristics. <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which in turn promoted interaction between E-cadherin and Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), resulting in KLF4 phosphorylation and translocation in the nucleus, where it induced <i>ITGA5</i> transcription and activated the downstream signaling. Knocking down E-cadherin or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> with BAPTA-AM antagonized the impact of <i>F. nucleatum</i> on KLF4, whereas knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> antagonized the bacteria's oncogenic role. Knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or <i>ITGA5</i> attenuated <i>F. nucleatum-</i>induced growth of patient-derived organoids, subcutaneous xenografts, and orthotopic tumors, as well as liver metastasis in nude mice. Integrin α5 antibody antagonized the oncogenic role of <i>F. nucleatum</i> in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that <i>F. nucleatum</i> promotes the growth and metastasis of CRC by activating E-cadherin/KLF4/integrin α5 signaling in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner.
40066226	Depletion of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 Facilitates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer Cells by Activating the MAPK/ERK Pathway.	Hyperactivation of fatty acid biosynthesis holds promise as a targeted therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer (PCa). However, inhibiting these enzymes could potentially promote metastatic progression in various other cancers. Herein, we found that depletion of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (encoded by ACACA), the enzyme responsible for the first and rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of PCa cells. This finding was validated in vitro through cell migration assays and in vivo using a metastatic model established by tail vein injection of ACACA-depleted cells into BALB/c nude mice. Additionally, depletion of ACACA activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway. Inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway reduced EMT and migration in ACACA-depleted cells. Our study is the first to indicate targeting ACACA induces an "unexpected" escape program through activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in PCa, ultimately leading to EMT and metastasis. Therefore, we strongly recommend that the potential adverse effects of targeting ACACA or its derived therapeutic agents must be given extreme attention, especially in MAPK-related cancers.
40066223	Tissue-Resident Memory CD8+ T Cells: Differentiation, Phenotypic Heterogeneity, Biological Function, Disease, and Therapy.	CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are strategically located in peripheral tissues, enabling a rapid response to local infections, which is different from circulating memory CD8+ T cells. Their unique positioning makes them promising targets for vaccines designed to enhance protection at barrier sites and other organs. Recent studies have shown a correlation between CD8+ TRM cells and favorable clinical outcomes in various types of cancer, indicating their potential role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the dual nature of CD8+ TRM cells presents challenges, as their inappropriate activation may lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review highlights significant advancements in the field, focusing on the differentiation pathways and phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ TRM cells across different tissues and disease states. We also review their protective roles in various contexts and the implications for vaccine development against infections and treatment strategies for tumors. Overall, this comprehensive review outlines the common features of CD8+ TRM cell differentiation and biological functions, emphasizing their specific characteristics across diverse tissues and disease states, which can guide the design of therapies against infections and tumors while minimizing the risk of autoimmune diseases.

40066205	Treatment of c-MET Antibody-Drug Conjugate Asymptomatic Pneumonitis with a Novel Steroid Regimen in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Case Report.	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a potent class of antineoplastic drugs that deliver cytotoxic agents via targeting with monoclonal antibodies; however, ADCs are associated with high rates of lung toxicities, limiting the therapeutic potential in many patients. We report a case of a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer taking the ADC telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso V) plus osimtertinib who developed ADC-induced pneumonitis despite clinical benefit. This patient was able to tolerate treatment for a prolonged period on a novel steroid regimen, using steroids when pneumonitis was asymptomatic but radiologically evident and as a daily suppressant. This treatment strategy may have implications in the broader management of ADC-interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis and underscores its potential mechanisms.
40066200	Health risk assessment of potentially toxic elements in public pipe-borne water from selected households in Abeokuta, Southwestern, Nigeria.	Public pipe-borne water serves as a significant source of potable water in some communities in Abeokuta. However, the presence of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) at certain concentrations in drinking water can render it unsuitable for consumption due to associated health risks. This study assessed the health risks posed by PTEs in public pipe-borne water collected from ten households in six communities in Abeokuta, Southwestern Nigeria. Pipe-borne water samples were subjected to PTE (lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) analysis using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, following standard digestion procedures for the water samples. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The health risk assessment was conducted for the Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Cancer Risk (CR) using the USEPA IRIS models. The water quality index (WQI) was also evaluated. Results indicated varying levels of PTEs, with certain areas exceeding the permissible limits for Cd (0.01-0.02 mg/L), Cr (0.05-0.11 mg/L), and Pb (0.50-0.97 mg/L), posing significant health risks to humans. The health risk assessment revealed that the HQ for Cd, Cr, and Pb exceeded the permissible limit of 1.0 in pipe-borne water consumed by children and infants, indicating potential adverse effects. Additionally, the CR values for Cd, Cr, and Pb in water samples consumed by all age groups also surpassed the permissible limit of 1.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, suggesting a probable risk of cancer development. The WQIs exceeding the threshold limit of 300 were observed in pipe-borne water samples, indicating that the water is unfit for consumption. Therefore, this study recommends the removal of potential toxic elements at the point of collection by using taps fitted with activated carbon filters.

40066098	An overview of the current evidences on the role of iron in colorectal cancer: a review.	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and lethal malignancy that affects millions of people worldwide. Iron is an essential micronutrient that plays a vital role in various biological processes, but also has pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects that may contribute to carcinogenesis. The relationship between iron and CRC is complex and influenced by multiple factors, such as dietary intake, absorption, storage, metabolism, and excretion of iron, as well as genetic and environmental factors that modulate iron homeostasis. This review article aims to provide an overview of the current evidences on the role of iron in CRC, discussing the potential mechanisms by which iron may affect CRC development and progression, as well as the implications for prevention and treatment. This review tries to focus on the following aspects: an introduction to iron and its role in CRC, role of heme and non-heme iron in CRC, dietary patterns, nutrition, and CRC, iron overload in CRC, iron deficiency and its role in CRC especially in surgery outcome and iron therapy and blood transfusion in CRC.
40066097	Lysosome targeted therapies in hematological malignancies.	Lysosomes are dynamic organelles integral to cellular homeostasis, secretory pathways, immune responses, and cell death regulation. In cancers, lysosomes become dysregulated to sustain proliferative signaling, metabolism, and invasion. In hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), leukemia cells demonstrate lysosome dysregulation with increased lysosomal activity, mTORC1 signaling, catabolic reactions, and autophagy. This supports the survival, metabolism, and proliferation of the leukemia cells. Lysosomes also play a critical role in treatment resistance by promoting cell survival and sequestration of drugs. This has led to the development of lysosome-targeted therapies such as cationic amphiphilic drugs (CAD), ATPase inhibitors or autophagy inhibitors to treat hematological malignancies. Lysosome-targeted treatments have shown effectiveness at inducing cell death by inhibiting cell survival mechanisms and inducing apoptosis. In addition, the combination of lysosome-targeted therapies with standard treatments gives synergistic apoptotic responses in leukemia cells. In this review, we will describe the lysosomal functions, their dysregulation in hematological malignancies and the development of lysosomal targeted therapies for leukemia treatment. By understanding lysosome dysregulation and developing lysosome-targeted agents, innovative treatment strategies could be effective in overcoming drug resistance in hematological malignancies.
40066096	The post-orchiectomy systemic inflammatory index is associated with tumor characteristics in clinical stage I germ cell tumors.	Approximately 25% to 30% of clinical stage I (CSI) germ cell cancer (GCT) patients will experience disease relapse after an orchiectomy. Adding adjuvant treatment will decrease the relapse rate but could lead to over-treatment. Prognostic biomarkers such as lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and/or embryonal carcinoma (EC) in non-seminoma (NSGCT) and rete testis invasion (RTI) and/or primary tumor size (PTS) in seminoma (SGCT) add limited value in treatment decision- making. The aim of this study is to assess the systemic inflammatory index (SII) and lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) with clinicopathological findings along with their prognostic impact.

40066091	Advances in targeting protein S-palmitoylation in tumor immunity and therapy.	S-palmitoylation is a reversible and dynamic post-translational modification of proteins. A palmitoyl group is covalently attached to a cysteine residue of the protein by a thioester link. It regulates the transcription and expression of downstream target genes and cell signaling, influencing cellular functions. Research indicates a substantial correlation between S-palmitoylation and tumorigenesis and immunotherapy, where it plays a pivotal role in modulating T cell activation, cytokine signaling, autophagy, phagocytosis, and death. Moreover, palmitoylation contributes to drug resistance and immunological evasion in tumor cells, enabling them to circumvent the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and immune surveillance. Inhibitors that target S-palmitoylation have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy, offering a novel strategy for cancer treatment. Nonetheless, obstacles such as inhibitor specificity and efficacy persist, requiring more extensive investigations into the exact mechanisms of S-palmitoylation to develop more effective targeted therapeutics. This article summarizes recent developments in S-palmitoylation concerning tumor immunity and treatment. The article examines the regulatory function of S-palmitoylation, its modifying enzymes in tumor cell signaling, and novel tumor immunotherapies that target S-palmitoylation.
