40066676	Arid4a Suppresses Breast Tumor Metastasis by Enhancing MTSS1 Expression via mRNA Stability.	Tumor metastasis is one of the main causes of death in cancer patients; however, the mechanism controlling metastasis is unclear. The posttranscriptional regulation of metastasis-related genes mediated by AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 4A (Arid4a), an RNA-binding protein (RBP), has not been elucidated.
40066670	Ciliopathy due to genetic alterations of TULP3 as an uncommon cause of hepatorenocardiac fibrosis.	Hepatorenocardiac fibrosis is a group of rare, clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited disorders affecting the development and degenerative function of the liver and kidneys. It is associated with ciliopathies, a group of diseases characterized by dysfunction of the primary cilium, a key organelle in cell signaling. We present a clinical case of ciliopathy linked to a genetic alteration in the protein TULP3 (TUB Like Protein 3) as a cause of hepatorenocardiac fibrosis.
40066651	The Dual Role of Active Site Hydroxylated Residue in Peroxiredoxin Sulfinylation Catalysis.	<b><i>Aims:</i></b> Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are ubiquitous Cys peroxidases regulated by sulfinylation, a modification that occurs when the sulfenic acid generated on the catalytic Cys by peroxide reduction reacts with a second molecule of peroxide. In the Prx1 family, sulfinylation sensitivity is controlled by competition between a structural transition from a fully folded (FF) to locally unfolded (LU) conformation and the chemical step of sulfinylation. The initial peroxide reduction relies on a conserved catalytic hydroxylated residue that allows peroxide optimal activation. This study aimed at investigating the role of this catalytic residue in sulfinylation. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Sulfenate attack on peroxide was favored by one order of magnitude when a catalytic Thr was present, for yeast cytosolic Prx1-type enzymes, human Prx1 and yeast mitochondrial Prx, a Prx6-type enzyme. Furthermore, pKa determination supported the notion of electrostatic interaction between the catalytic hydroxyl and sulfenate intermediate. Finally, FF-LU transition kinetics was faster with a catalytic Thr, supporting that the hydroxyl group proximity to the nascent sulfenate group also promotes the FF-LU transition. <b><i>Innovation:</i></b> We identify a major mechanism that activates sulfinylation in hyperoxidation-sensitive Prxs from the Prx1 and Prx6 families. Furthermore, we show that the catalytic hydroxylated residue holds a dual role in regulating hyperoxidation sensitivity, by activating the sulfinylation reaction, while also promoting the competing FF to LU transition, thus acting as an important regulatory determinant. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The present work sets the basis for investigating other instances of Cys proteins regulated by sulfinylation, a modification increasingly recognized in cell redox regulation and signaling. <i>Antioxid.

40066648	Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in aortic stenosis patients scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.	The prevalences of aortic stenosis (AS) and transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) increase with age. Identification of occult ATTR-CM in patients with AS can help explain out-of-proportion myocardial dysfunction, aid in prognostication and prompt initiation of disease-modifying treatment. Studies have suggested that many patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have concomitant ATTR-CM, but some have included unverified ATTR-CM in patients with ambiguous scintigrams. We aimed to assess the co-occurrence of ATTR-CM in patients scheduled for TAVI.
40066647	Reporting a Homozygous Case of Neurodevelopmental Disorder Associated With a Novel PRPF8 Variant.	While recently identified heterozygous PRPF8 variants have been linked to various human diseases, their role in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) remains ambiguous. This study investigates the potential association between homozygous PRPF8 variants and NDDs. Most PRPF8 variants are primarily associated with retinal diseases; however, we analyze a family with multiple members diagnosed with NDDs.
40066641	A NAC transcription factor and a MADS-box protein antagonistically regulate sucrose accumulation in strawberry receptacles.	Sugar accumulation during fruit ripening is an essential physiological change that influences fruit quality. While NAC transcription factors are recognized for their role in modulating strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruit ripening, their specific contributions to sugar accumulation have remained largely unexplored. This study identified FvNAC073, a NAC transcription factor, as a key regulator that not only exhibits a gradual increase in gene expression during fruit ripening but also enhances the accumulation of sucrose. Further investigation showed that FvNAC073 positively regulates the expression of sucrose-6-phosphate synthase 1 (FvSPS1), a gene associated with sucrose synthesis, and negatively regulates sucrose synthase 2 (FvSUS2), which is involved in sucrose breakdown, through direct promoter binding. Additionally, we uncovered that FvCMB1L, a MADS-box protein, exhibits high gene expression levels at the premature fruit stage and acts to repress FvSPS1 while activating FvSUS2, thus negatively affecting sucrose accumulation. Notably, we demonstrated a competitive interaction between FvNAC073 and FvCMB1L in binding to the promoters of FvSPS1 and FvSUS2, resulting in antagonistic regulation of these genes. This intricate dynamic between FvCMB1L and FvNAC073 elucidates a mechanism for balancing sugar content during strawberry fruit development. Our findings offer insights into the complex regulatory network governing sucrose accumulation in strawberries, highlighting the potential for targeted genetic interventions to enhance fruit quality.
40066628	Synergistic Effects of a Novel Multifunctional Bionic Scaffold and Electrical Stimulation Promote Bone Tissue Regeneration.	Electrical stimulation (ES) can effectively regulate cell behavior and promote bone tissue regeneration, and conductive biomaterials can further enhance this effect by enhancing the conduction of electrical signals between cells. In this study, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(l-lactide)-aniline pentamer triblock copolymer (PAP) were used as raw materials to prepare a conductive bionic scaffold (PLGA/PAP). Subsequently, bone morphogenetic protein 2 mimetic peptide containing a DOPA tag (DBMP2MP) was loaded on the scaffold surface. The prepared scaffold (DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP) had a porosity of 79.17% and a porous structure similar to that of natural cancellous bone. After PAP was added, the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the scaffold were increased to 2.79 ± 0.1 kPa and 1.29 ± 0.023 × 10<sup>-6</sup> s/cm. The addition of DBMP2MP significantly improved the hydrophilicity of the scaffold material, and the contact Angle of the scaffold material decreased from 102.45 ± 7.67° to 30.36 ± 5.25°. At the same time, DBMP2MP and scaffold surface bonding ability increased by two times compared with commercial BMP2. The polypeptide DBMP2MP can bind to the surface of scaffolds and exhibit long-lasting biological effects. In vitro cell experiments revealed that the DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP scaffold could significantly promote the proliferation and adhesion of MC3T3-E1 cells and that the combination of DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP with pulsed ES could further synergistically induce cell mineralization and osteogenic differentiation. The results of the rabbit radius defect experiments revealed that grafting the DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP scaffold at the defect site significantly promoted the formation of new bone and collagen fibers. When the DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP scaffold was combined with ES, the regeneration rate of bone tissue further improved, and the newborn collagen tissue is close to normal bone collagen. Therefore, this bionic scaffold with excellent electrical and biological activity shows considerable potential in the field of bone defect repair.
40066622	Mpox virus poxin-schlafen fusion protein suppresses innate antiviral response by sequestering STAT2.	<b>ABSTRACT</b>Mpox virus (MPXV) has to establish efficient interferon (IFN) antagonism for effective replication. MPXV-encoded IFN antagonists have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the IFN antagonism of poxin-schlafen (PoxS) fusion gene of MPXV was characterized. MPXV PoxS was capable of decreasing cGAS-produced 2'3'-cGAMP, like its ortholog poxin of vaccinia virus, which is the first known cytosolic nuclease that hydrolyzes the 3'-5' bond of 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). However, MPXV PoxS did not suppress cGAS-STING-mediated type I IFN production. Instead, MPXV PoxS antagonized basal and type I IFN-induced expression of IFN-stimulated genes such as OAS1, SAMD9, SAMD9L, ISG15, ISG56 and IFIT3. Consistently, MPXV PoxS inhibited both basal and type I IFN-stimulated activity of interferon-stimulated response elements, but did not affect activation of IFN-γ-activated sites. Mechanistically, MPXV PoxS interacted with STAT2 and sequestered it in the cytoplasm. Both the viral schlafen fusion and the active site of 2'3'-cGAMP nuclease were required for STAT2 sequestration and consequent suppression of IFN-stimulated gene expression. MPXV PoxS conferred resistance to the suppression of MPXV replication by type I IFN. Taken together, our findings suggested that MPXV PoxS counteracts host antiviral response by sequestering STAT2 to circumvent basal and type I IFN-induced expression of antiviral genes.
40066615	NTRK protein expression in NSCLC and its clinicopathological correlation.	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. Since the discovery of the oncogenic neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion in colorectal cancer in 1986, its understanding has gradually progressed. NTRK's relevance is crucial to understanding some tumor development and how specific tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitors (TRKI) work. <i>NTRK1, NTRK2,</i> and <i>NTRK3</i> (encoding the neurotrophin receptors TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, respectively) rearrangement induces high tumor transforming ability. This study investigates the clinical relevance of NTRK immunohistochemistry in NSCLC patients in a cohort of 482 patients from Karolinska University Hospital with detailed clinical and pathological studies. Immunohistochemical staining for NTRK expression was performed, and the results were correlated with patient demographics, histological subtypes, tumor extent, and staging. Our findings revealed that NTRK expression, predominantly membranous and cytoplasmic, was detected in 22 out of 482 cases (4.56%). Notably, NTRK expression was more frequently observed in squamous-cell carcinoma (SqCC) than in adenocarcinoma (AdCa). Clinical correlations indicated a significant association between NTRK expression and histologic subtypes (<i>p</i><0.001) and grade of differentiation (<i>p</i>=0.036). However, no significant correlations were observed with age, sex, tumor size, staging, or OS. NTRK immunohistochemistry represents a potential biomarker for a subset of NSCLC patients, particularly those with SqCC histology. Understanding the clinical implications of NTRK expression may contribute to personalized treatment strategies in NSCLC.
40066607	[Early conversion to belatacept post-transplantation: state of the art and expert opinion].	The standard immunosuppressive treatment after organ transplantation typically includes a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine A), an antimetabolite (mycophenolic acid) or an mTOR inhibitor, and corticosteroids. However, these treatments are associated with multiple side effects, including nephrotoxicity. Belatacept, a fusion protein blocking the CD80/86 costimulation pathway, emerges as an effective and well-tolerated alternative. Initial phase III studies showed that de novo belatacept improves renal function and reduces the incidence of donor-specific antibodies, despite a higher rate of acute cellular rejections. Early conversion studies (within the first 6 months post-transplantation) demonstrate significant improvement in renal function, particularly when conversion is performed early. However, the risk of acute rejection and opportunistic infections must be monitored. This article summarizes the available studies on early conversion to belatacept in kidney transplanted patients.
40066599	Insights from traditional fermented legumes towards the innovation of modern plant-based meat analogues.	There has been a major growth in the development of plant-based meat alternatives (PBMA) in recent years. However, current PBMA often contain ultra processed ingredients and numerous additives to be able to mimic animal-based meat (ABM) including the meaty (umami) flavour, characteristic firm/chewy structure and juicy mouthfeel. In this review, the potential of ancient fermentation techniques as a minimally processed alternative to ABM and current PBMA are explored. Fermented foods including tempeh, natto, dawadawa and ugba are naturally high in protein and umami flavours. The nutritional, aroma, flavour and techno-functional properties are provided and discussed in the context of ABM and PBMA. The fermented foods have potential to be used as whole foods ingredients, or their constituents can be used as ingredients in plant-based foods. Particularly the umami flavours and high protein content combined with the naturally occurring high water holding capacity (WHC), solubility and other material properties make fermented legume foods suitable candidates for use in high-protein plant-based foods. Understanding the sensory characteristics and material properties generated during legume fermentation and their similarities to ABM can aid in stimulating innovations in food technology to obtain a new generation of less-processed PBMA with limited additives.
40066598	Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2/3 gene deletions and repeat motifs in Chhattisgarh, India (2017-2018).	Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are vital for malaria diagnosis, especially in resource-limited areas. RDTs targeting histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and its structural homologue PfHRP3 are commonly used for detecting Plasmodium falciparum. However, genetic deletions in these proteins can affect test accuracy. This study aims to examine the gene deletions and sequence variation in the Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes in P. falciparum isolates from Chhattisgarh, India, and assess their correlation with RDT reactivity.

40066546	Evaluation of In Vitro Activity of Ceftazidime-Avibactam and Colistin with VITEK 2 AST-XN21.	Ceftazidime-avibactam and colistin are antibiotics of new and regaining importance used for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. The broth microdilution (BMD) test recommended for detecting colistin sensitivity is labor-intensive and difficult to perform under routine conditions. There is a need for alternative methods that produce fast and reliable results in routine laboratory studies. In our study, we aimed to compare the results obtained with the newly introduced Vitek-2 AST-XN21 cards, which allow the detection of ceftazidime-avibactam and colistin sensitivity simultaneously, with the ceftazidime-avibactam disk diffusion and Diagnostics MIC COL results that we use routinely.

40066532	Clinical, Immunologic, and Genetic Characteristics of T-lymphoblastic Leukemia with STIL-TAL1 Fusion.	T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with a less favorable prognosis. The genetic background of T-ALL is widely heterogeneous, with the co-occurrence of multiple genetic abnormalities. The STIL-TAL1 rearrangement results from a submicroscopic deletion on chromosome 1p33 and is present in 15 - 25% of T-ALL cases. Submicroscopic deletions are not detected by conventional cytogenetic ana-lyses but can be identified through array comparative genomic hybridization and/or high-throughput RNA sequencing. Patients with the STIL-TAL1 fusion exhibit distinct characteristics, such as a young age, high white blood cell count, typical immunophenotype, and specific genetic abnormalities. However, the clinical, laboratory, and prognostic significance of this rearrangement remains unclear. This study was performed to identify STIL-TAL1 rearrangement resulting from submicroscopic 1p33 deletion in T-ALL and to investigate the clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics of T-ALL patients with STIL-TAL1 fusion.
40066528	Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Suppresses Mitophagy to Alleviate Muscle Atrophy in Chronic Renal Failure With Protein-Energy Wasting.	Protein-energy wasting (PEW) facilitates major adverse clinical outcomes in chronic renal failure (CRF), with current therapies not suitable for all patients. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) can alleviate chronic kidney disease, with unclear effects and mechanisms on CRF with PEW. The CRF rat model was constructed by adenine administration, and PEW was induced by a 4% casein diet. The serum creatinine (SCR), urinary protein (UPR), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pathology of the gastrocnemius muscle was estimated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of mitophagy-related markers was detected to assess the mitophagy level. Dexamethasone-induced L6 myotubes established myotube atrophy models. The levels of mitophagy-related markers, muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), and atrophy gene 1 (Atrogin1) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. F. prausnitzii suppressed the SCR, UPR, and BUN expression in serum and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy, which were promoted by CRF with PEW. Dexamethasone-induced expression of MuRF1 and Atrogin1 in L6 myotubes was decreased by F. prausnitzii. Additionally, F. prausnitzii repressed mitophagy in the gastrocnemius muscle and L6 myotubes. In conclusion, F. prausnitzii suppressed renal failure progression and muscle atrophy by inhibiting mitophagy in CRF with PEW.
40066518	LAMP2-FLOT2 interaction enhances autophagosome-lysosome fusion to protect the septic heart in response to ILC2.	Cardiac dysfunction is a serious complication of sepsis-induced multiorgan failure in intensive care units and is characterized by an uncontrolled immune response to overwhelming infection. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), as a part of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in the inflammatory process of heterogeneous cardiac disorders. However, the role of ILC2 in regulating sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that autophagic flux blockage exacerbated inflammatory response and cardiac dysfunction, which was associated with mortality of sepsis. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model, we observed an expansion of ILC2s in the septic heart. Furthermore, IL4 derived from ILC2 mitigated cardiac inflammatory responses and improved cardiac function during sepsis. Additionally, IL4 enhanced LAMP2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2) expression through STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation to stabilize lysosomal homeostasis and rescue the impaired autophagic flux during sepsis. Notably, LAMP2 was preferentially bound to FLOT2 (flotillin 2) after IL4 exposure, and the interaction enhanced autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cardiac endothelial cells. Loss of FLOT2 reversed the regulatory effects of LAMP2 on autophagy mediated by IL4, leading to autophagosome accumulation and suppressed autophagosome clearance. Conclusively, these findings provide novel insights that ILC2 regulates incomplete autophagic flux to protect septic heart and expand our understanding of immunoregulation for sepsis.<b>Abbreviation</b>: ACTB: actin beta; ACTN: actinin, alpha; ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; ANXA5/annexin V: annexin A5; AO: acridine orange; BECN1/Beclin1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CKM: creatine kinase, muscle; CKB: creatine kinase, brain; CLP: cecal ligation and puncture; CO: cardiac output; CQ: chloroquine; CTS: cathepsin; DAPI: 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EC: endothelial cell; EF: ejection fraction; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FLOT: flotillin; FS: fractional shortening; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GATA3: GATA binding protein 3; GLB1/β-Gal: galactosidase, beta 1; HCMEC: human cardiac microvascular endothelial cell; IL: interleukin; ILC: innate lymphoid cell; IL1RL1/ST2: interleukin 1 receptor-like 1; IL4c: IL4 complex; IL7R/CD127: interleukin 7 receptor; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; LAMP: lysosomal-associated membrane protein; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LMP: lysosome membrane permeabilization; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LVEDd: left ventricular end-diastole diameter; LVEDV: left ventricular end-diastole volume; LVESd: left ventricular end-systolic diameter; LVESV: left ventricular end-systole volume; MAN: mannosidase alpha; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MS: mass spectrometry; PECAM1/CD31: platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; PTPRC/CD45: protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C; RORC/RORγt: RAR related orphan receptor gamma; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TBX21/T-bet: T-box 21; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; THY1/CD90.2: thymus cell antigen 1, theta; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-translocating ATPase; VIM: vimentin.
40066506	Indirect ELISA-based detection of histatin 3 and cystatin D for the forensic identification of human saliva.	Analyzing forensically relevant body fluids contributes to proving criminal acts, and saliva is often left on the scene, especially in sexual assault cases. Currently, saliva is presumptively identified using its salivary α-amylase activity as an indicator. However, the specificity of saliva presumptive tests is low, and therefore, they cannot confidently prove the presence of saliva. This study aimed to develop and validate an indirect ELISA-based saliva confirmatory test using the novel human salivary protein markers histatin 3 and cystatin D. Histatin 3 and cystatin D are known to be uniquely expressed in human salivary glands, and the molecular evolution of both genes occurred after the divergence of hominoids; thus, the high specificity of human saliva for both markers was expected. As a result of the validation experiments, both histatin 3 and cystatin D markers were able to distinguish human saliva from other human body fluids and animal saliva using appropriate thresholds of the quantitative absorbance values. Our results indicate that both histatin 3 and cystatin D markers are human saliva-specific; thus, we consider that this method will be useful and practical in identifying human saliva.
40066501	FLOT1 Is a Novel Serum Biomarker of Ovarian Cancer Targeted by N6-methyladenosine Modification Inhibition.	Ovarian cancer (OC) is a deadly disease and lacks a precise marker for diagnosis worldwide. Our previous work has shown the overexpression of flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in OC tissue. To improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, we evaluated the serum level of FLOT1 in OC patients and found that the serum concentration of FLOT1 as well as CA125 was significantly increased in patients with OC compared with healthy control (p < 0.01) and those with benign tumors (p < 0.05). The detection rate (above the upper limit of a cut-off value) of FLOT1 and CA125 was 77.78% and 72.22%, respectively, in patients with OC, which was increased to 88.89% in combination. The elevation of FLOT1 was confirmed in the serum of nude mice after the implantation of human OC cells. A high level of FLOT1 protein in the serum was positively correlated with the overexpression of FLOT1 protein in OC tissues. Furthermore, the level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of FLOT1 mRNA was significantly high in OC cells compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells, leading to an increase in FLOT1 mRNA expression. Application of a methylation inhibitor, 3-deazaadenosine, decreased FLOT1 mRNA expression in OC cells and suppressed tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that FLOT1 is a novel serum biomarker of OC and can be targeted by m<sup>6</sup>A modification inhibition. These data highlight the potential application of FLOT1 as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for patients with OC.
40066478	Metaproteomic Profiling of the Secretome of a Granule-forming Ca. Accumulibacter Enrichment.	Extracellular proteins are supposed to play crucial roles in the formation and structure of biofilms and aggregates. However, often little is known about these proteins, in particular for microbial communities. Here, we use two advanced metaproteomic approaches to study the extracellular proteome in a granular Candidatus Accumulibacter enrichment as a proxy for microbial communities that form solid microbial granules, such as those used in biological wastewater treatment. Limited proteolysis of whole granules and metaproteome isolation from the culture's supernatant successfully classified over 50% of the identified protein biomass to be secreted. Moreover, structural and sequence-based classification identified 387 proteins, corresponding to over 50% of the secreted protein biomass, with characteristics that could aid the formation of aggregates, including filamentous, beta-barrel containing, and cell surface proteins. While various of these aggregate-forming proteins originated from Ca. Accumulibacter, some proteins associated with other taxa. This suggests that not only a range of different proteins but also multiple organisms contribute to granular biofilm formation. Therefore, the obtained extracellular metaproteome data from the granular Ca. Accumulibacter enrichment provides a resource for exploring proteins that potentially support the formation and stability of granular biofilms, whereas the demonstrated approaches can be applied to explore biofilms of microbial communities in general.
40066461	Roles of methyl-CpG-binding-domain (MBD) protiens in regulation of biological processes in plants.	DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mark found in both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic genomes. It is essential for regulating expression of genes and preservation of genomic integrity. Both plants and animals possess specific proteins that mediate biological effects of DNA methylation. Many families of such methylated DNA binding proteins have been discovered in plants; the most prominent of them being the methyl-CpG- binding domain (MBD) proteins. Some of the MBD proteins have the ability to recognize methylated CpGs in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we have described MBD proteins and their functions in a wide range of cellular processes in various plant species. We have also outlined their mechanism of action and interacting protein partners.
40066460	Unraveling the effect of spermidine on biochemical, anatomical and yield attributes in chickpea under chloride dominated salinity.	This study investigates the effect of foliar application of spermidine (Spd) on salt-stressed chickpea genotypes under natural environmental conditions. Four chickpea genotypes were treated with chloride-dominated salinity levels of 4.0 and 8.0 dSm<sup>-1</sup>, followed by foliar application with 0.5 and 1.0 mM Spd during the reproductive stage. The findings reveal that Spermidine application markedly enhances the total chlorophyll upto 21.27%. It also enhanced the total soluble carbohydrate about 46.68% and protein content upto 40% in all chickpea genotypes but HC 3 shows maximum increase, thereby augmenting yield about 36% in HC 5 genotypes under salt stress. Additionally, Spermidine application facilitates the enlargement of xylem vessels diameter upto 34.53% in pedicel and reduction in epidermal wall thickening about 29.33% of filament under salt stress. Importantly, the efficacy of Spermidine application is particularly pronounced in salt-affected chickpea genotypes, especially the 0.5 mM concentration. The insights gained offer a potential solution to enhance plant tolerance and productivity under adverse conditions.
40066453	Bioinformatics analysis reveals novel tumor antigens and immune subtypes of skin cutaneous melanoma contributing to mRNA vaccine development.	Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a common malignant skin cancer with high mortality and recurrence rates. Although the mRNA vaccine is a promising strategy for cancer treatment, its application against SKCM remains confusing. In this study, we employed computational bioinformatics analysis to explore SKCM-associated antigens for an mRNA vaccine and suitable populations for vaccination.
40066450	Case Report: MOGAD - a steroid-responsive autoimmune meningoencephalitis mimicking infection.	This case series reports three patients initially managed for presumed infectious meningoencephalitis, who were ultimately diagnosed with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated disease (MOGAD). Their clinical presentations were strikingly similar to those of acute infectious meningoencephalitis, which posed a challenge to the initial diagnostic process. Notably, despite the absence of typical radiological changes associated with MOGAD, such as cerebral cortical encephalitis, these patients exhibited focal neurological and electroencephalographic changes. This series highlights the importance of considering MOG antibody testing in cases of aseptic meningoencephalitis, where early and accurate diagnosis can influence treatment decisions and patient outcomes in this steroid-responsive condition.
40066449	Case report: Efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for high tumour mutational burden malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast as revealed by comprehensive genomic profiling.	High tumour mutational burden (TMB-high), identified through comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP), is a biomarker that predicts the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. CGP testing is recommended for rare cancers with limited effective treatment options. Here, we provide the first report of a malignant phyllodes tumour of the breast demonstrating TMB-high status and effective treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient initially underwent right breast tumour resection and was diagnosed with a malignant phyllodes tumour. Recurrence was observed at the same site with metastases to the pulmonary hilar and right axillary lymph nodes. CGP testing revealed TMB-high status and microsatellite stable. Pembrolizumab was initiated after chemotherapy for the soft tissue sarcoma. After two treatment cycles, imaging revealed a partial response of the pulmonary hilar lymph nodes and necrotic enlargement of the right axillary lymph node. After four cycles, all lymph nodes had reduced in size. Eight months after ten cycles of pembrolizumab treatment, multiple new nodules were observed in both lungs, indicating disease progression. This case highlights the utility of CGP testing in rare cancers, demonstrating the first evidence of TMB-high malignant phyllodes tumours of the breast responding to pembrolizumab and underscoring the value of expanding CGP testing to improve therapeutic strategies for rare cancers.
40066448	BLIMP-1-dependent differentiation of T follicular helper cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory type 1 cells.	T-regulatory-type-1 (TR1) cells are a subset of interleukin-10-producing but Foxp3<sup>-</sup> Treg cells that arise in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. We have shown that systemic delivery of autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NP) triggers the formation of large pools of disease-suppressing Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells from cognate T-follicular helper (TFH) cell precursors. Here we show that, upon treatment withdrawal, these Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells spontaneously differentiate into a novel immunoregulatory Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subset that inherits epigenetic and transcriptional hallmarks of their precursors, including clonotypic T-cell receptors, and is distinct from other Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg subsets. Whereas the transcription factor BLIMP-1 is dispensable for development of conventional Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, it is necessary for development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 cells. In a model of central nervous system autoimmunity, abrogation of BLIMP-1 or IL-10 expression in the Foxp3<sup>-</sup> and/or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subsets inhibits their development or anti-encephalitogenic activity. Thus, the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway results in the generation of two distinct autoimmune disease-suppressing, IL-10-producing TR1 subsets that are distinguished by the expression of Foxp3 and Foxp3 target genes.
40066447	Case Report: Complete response to four cycles of camrelizumab in a PD-L1 negative patient with advanced oral squamous cancer.	Immunotherapy has brought better survival benefits in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). However, owing to the lack of relevant biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of this treatment, it often has to be maintained. Here we report on a patient with stage IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue who developed an unresectable lesion in the neck after surgery and radical chemoradiotherapy. After four cycles of intermittent immunotherapy with camrelizumab, complete response (CR) was achieved. Next-generation sequencing showed that the TP53/FANCA/FAT1 gene mutations and negative PD-L1 expression were involved. The patient has been followed up for 4 years without R/M. This situation has not been reported previously, suggesting that some patients can benefit from short-term immunotherapy and even achieve CR; moreover, there may be more molecular markers to be discovered that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy. We can conduct in-depth research on relevant molecular markers, formulate personalized immunotherapy strategies and plans, and facilitate the development of new precision treatment strategies for HNSCC.
40066444	The changes of NLRs family members in the brain of AD mouse model and AD patients.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is primarily characterized by progressive neuron loss and memory impairment. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are crucial for immune regulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recently, NLRs have been identified as important contributors to neuroinflammation, thus presenting a potential approach for reducing inflammation and slowing AD progression.
40066442	A comprehensive prognostic and immunological implications of Gremlin 1 in lung adenocarcinoma.	Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a prevalent form of lung cancer globally, known for its high invasiveness, metastatic potential, and notable heterogeneity, particularly in its response to immunotherapy. Gremlin 1 (GREM1) is implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis in multiple cancers. However, GREM1's specific role in LUAD remains unclear. This study systematically examines GREM1 expression in LUAD and its association with tumor progression, immune microenvironment, and prognosis.
40066441	Endometrial immune profiling and precision therapy increase live birth rate after embryo transfer: a randomised controlled trial.	Despite advancements in assisted reproductive treatments, 70% of transferred embryos fail to implant successfully, yielding significant personal and global repercussions. One promising avenue of research is to take into account the individual's immune uterine profile in order to tailor treatment and optimise outcomes. This randomised controlled trial represents the initial exploration into the consequences of disregarding the state of the uterine immune environment in infertile women embarking on IVF/ICSI.
40066440	In-depth analysis of the safety of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors.	In recent years, the rapid progress in oncology, immunology, and molecular biology has dramatically advanced cancer immunotherapy, particularly CAR-T cell therapy. This innovative approach involves engineering a patient's T cells to express receptors that specifically target tumor antigens, enhancing their ability to identify and eliminate cancer cells. However, the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors is often hampered by the challenging tumor microenvironment (TME). The complex TME includes dense stroma that obstructs T cell infiltration, abnormal blood vessel structures leading to hypoxia, and an acidic pH, all of which hinder CAR-T cell function. Additionally, the presence of immunosuppressive factors in the TME reduces the efficacy of CAR-T cells, making successful targeting of tumors more difficult. The safety of CAR-T therapy has gained interest, especially CAR-T therapy has shown considerable effectiveness in various cancers, with notable results in multiple myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, among others. Nonetheless, CAR-T cell therapy is associated with several adverse reactions primarily driven by heightened levels of proinflammatory cytokines. These reactions include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (CANS), and organ toxicity, often leading to serious complications. CRS, characterized by systemic inflammation due to cytokine release, can escalate to severe organ dysfunction. It typically occurs within the first week post-infusion, correlating with CAR-T cell expansion and often presents with fever and hypotension. Meanwhile, CANS encompasses neurological issues ranging from mild symptoms to severe seizures, possibly exacerbated by CRS. Organ toxicity can also arise from CAR-T therapy, with potential damage affecting the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, and lungs, often tied to shared antigens found in both tumor and healthy tissues. Moreover, long-term effects like cytokine-associated hematotoxicity (CAHT) and secondary malignancies represent significant concerns that could affect the patient's quality of life post-treatment. The long-term adverse effects and challenges in treating solid tumors underscore the need for ongoing research. Strategies to improve CAR-T cell efficacy, minimize adverse reactions, and enhance patient safety are critical. Future explorations could include designing CAR-T cells to better navigate the TME, identifying specific target antigen profiles to minimize off-target damage, and developing adjunct therapies to mitigate cytokine-related toxicity. Continued monitoring for long-term effects will also be paramount in improving patient outcomes and maintaining their quality of life. Overall, while CAR-T therapy holds great promise, it must be administered with careful consideration of potential side effects and rigorous management strategies to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy.
40066438	Update on tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative review.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, affecting approximately 1% of the adult population. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor, has emerged as an effective treatment for RA. This narrative review provides an update on TCZ's efficacy and safety based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world evidence (RWE). TCZ, available in subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) formulations, has shown significant benefits in RA management. Key clinical trials, including SAMURAI, OPTION, RADIATE, and TOWARD, have demonstrated TCZ's efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), particularly in patients with inadequate responses to methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. Long-term studies, such as STREAM, have highlighted TCZ's sustained efficacy and favorable safety profile over 5 years. The impact of TCZ on cardiovascular health, lipid profiles, and the risk of infections has been a focal point, with findings suggesting no significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk compared to other RA therapies. RWE further highlights the effectiveness of TCZ, identifying predictors of response, such as age, and emphasizes its suitability for biologic-naïve and overweight patients. Special considerations include TCZ use in RA-associated interstitial lung disease and amyloidosis. Overall, TCZ remains a pivotal option in RA treatment, with a well-established safety and efficacy profile supported by extensive clinical and real-world data.
40066367	Expanding the Ingredient Basket in Aquaculture: Growth Performance and Feed Utilization of Australian Hybrid Abalone (<i>Haliotis laevigata × H. rubra</i>) Fed Methanotrophic Single Cell Protein.	There is growing interest in the use of single cell proteins (SCPs) derived from methanotrophic bacteria for inclusion in aquafeed to reduce reliance on other, potentially less sustainable proteins. This two-part experiment aimed to investigate first (i) the dose effect of replacing soy protein concentrate with SCP in Australian hybrid abalone diets (<i>Haliotis laevigata Haliotis rubra</i>) and second, (ii) the potential for improved palatability of the SCP by using commercially produced liquid protein hydrolysate (PH). This was assessed in a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design. The diets were formulated to be iso-proteic (~40% crude protein as fed) and iso-energetic (~18 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup> as fed). The diets (SCP 0%, SCP 5%, SCP 10%, SCP 20%, SCP 0% + PH, and SCP 20% + PH) were fed to the abalone (~9.25 g initial weight) once daily in the evening for 94 days to apparent satiation. The growth performance and feed utilization of abalone fed with up to 10% SCP was comparable to the control; however, there was a significant reduction in most parameters at the highest inclusion of 20%. In the second experiment, there was a decline in measured protein and energy retention in the abalone fed 20% SCP, with a concomitantly lower apparent biological value. Positively, there were significant improvements in the apparent digestibility of the diet at the 20% SCP inclusion. There was no significant impact of using the PH on growth performance or feed intake. No effects were observed on the digestive enzyme activity (<i>α</i>-amylase, lipase, and trypsin) examined among the treatments. Considering these results collectively, the maximum recommended inclusion of methanotrophic SCP meal should be 10% for hybrid abalone. Reasons for the decline in performance at the highest inclusion may be related to palatability; however, this remains to be fully confirmed.
40066363	Metabolic pathways to sustainability: review of purple non-sulfur bacteria potential in agri-food waste valorization.	Agri-food waste (AFW) represents a significant fraction of the material generated by the agri-food industry, which itself accounts for almost one-third of the annual global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Considering the growing global population and the consequent rise in food demand, the management and valorization of this waste are essential to ensure the sustainability of the entire food chain for future generations. Recycling agri-food waste offers a promising strategy to mitigate the sector's environmental impact, particularly when the waste consists of food-grade materials that enhance its intrinsic value. Retaining such products within the agri-food chain by converting them into feed or food, a process referred to as "waste upcycling," is therefore of critical importance. Purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) are emerging as promising candidates for AFW upcycling due to their remarkable metabolic versatility, which allows them to metabolize a wide range of organic substrates, including carbohydrates, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and alcohols, into valuable microbial biomass. This biomass is notably rich in superior quality proteins, vitamins, pigments, and other high-value compounds. The phototrophic metabolism of PNSB is particularly advantageous for organic matter valorization, as the carbon conversion yield approaches unity by utilizing light as an energy source. This review explores the potential of PNSB in upcycling AFW streams derived from various sources, such as fruit and vegetable residues, as well as effluents from the dairy, brewery, and sugar industries. The pre-treatment methods required to optimize substrate availability are also discussed. Furthermore, we examine the metabolic pathways utilized by PNSB under phototrophic conditions to assimilate the most common carbon substrates found in AFW, highlighting critical gaps in our understanding of their metabolism. Additionally, challenges and opportunities in AFW valorization, with a focus on PNSB applications, are identified. This review underscores recent advancements and ongoing challenges, emphasizing the potential role of PNSB in driving sustainable circular bioeconomy applications for AFW.
40066352	Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of hub genes in ischemic heart failure and atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) frequently coexist and mutually influence each other.

Hence, comprehending their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic targets are urgently needed.
40066347	Constitutive overexpression of <i>Qui-Quine Starch</i> gene simultaneously improves starch and protein content in bioengineered cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz).	Cassava is a crucial source of daily calorie intake for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) but has an inferior protein content. Despite numerous attempts utilizing both traditional and biotechnological methods, efforts to address protein deficiency in cassava have yet to meet with much success. We aim to leverage modern biotechnologies to enhance cassava's nutritional value by creating bioengineered cassava cultivars with increased protein and starch content. In this study, we utilized <i>Qui-Quine Starch</i> (<i>QQS</i>), a novel orphan gene unique to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, to develop transgenic cassava plants with increased protein and starch accumulation in their tissues. A total of 10 independent transgenic cassava lines expressing <i>QQS</i> were successfully regenerated in this study, among which line R7 (F) demonstrated superior growth vigor. Quantitative RT-PCR verified the expression of the <i>QQS</i> gene in the transgenic lines. Data showed that <i>QQS</i> expression in cassava plants increased leaf protein content by 36% in line R''' (LA) L2 and root protein by 17% for the same line compared to their wild-type and empty vector (NPTII) control plants. Moreover, leaf-soluble total carbohydrates increased by 51.76% in line R (G) L2, and root-soluble total carbohydrates increased by 46.75% in line R7 (F). The novel function of <i>QQS</i> in increasing the starch content in the transgenic biomass is demonstrated. No significant change in the content of specific amino acids was observed among the lines and various plant parts. In addition, <i>QQS</i> expression revealed increased biomass, plant vigor, and early In vitro mini-tubers production for line R7 (F). Gene interaction study between AtQQS and 59 interacting partners generated 184 interactions or edges. These gene networks comprised several functional categories regulating the starch metabolic and auxin biosynthetic processes. The role of <i>QQS</i> in imparting starch and protein content of transgenic cassava plants is validated. The next logical step is the evaluation of biochemical profiles of cassava lines expressing <i>QQS</i> that reach maturity and the transferability of these findings to consumer-preferred cassava cultivars and local landraces grown in SSA. This study represents the first biotechnological report demonstrating a simultaneous increase of protein and starch content in bioengineered cassava.
40066333	Cepharanthine hydrochloride: a novel ferroptosis-inducing agent for prostate cancer treatment.	Ferroptosis is an intracellular iron-dependent cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Increasing evidence indicated that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in suppressing tumors, thus providing new opportunities for cancer therapy. The drug cepharanthine, commonly used to treat leukopenia, has been discovered to function as an anticancer agent to multiple types of cancer via diverse mechanisms. However, the effect of cepharanthine on prostate cancer remains unclear.

However, the therapeutic efficiency remains unsatisfactory due to complicated periodontal anatomy, limited plaque removal, short retention of antibiotics, and related side effects.
40066321	Successful Management of Infective Endocarditis Complicated by Pheochromocytoma: A Case Report.	Pheochromocytomas present with paroxysmal hypertension due to a sudden release of catecholamines stimulated by radiological contrast media, surgery, or anesthetic agents. This often complicates the maintenance of patient hemodynamics during surgery. A 55-year-old man with a high fever was admitted to a hospital. Laboratory blood tests revealed elevated white blood cell and C-reactive protein levels. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed moderate aortic regurgitation, along with aortic valve vegetation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cerebral embolisms, whereas computed tomography showed a left adrenal incidentaloma. Further examinations showed high levels of plasma-free metanephrine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline in the blood and metanephrines in the urine. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy revealed ligand accumulation in the tumor at 6 and 24 h after injection. Based on these results, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed. Doxazosin was promptly administered, and its dosage was escalated. Despite ongoing antimicrobial therapy, transesophageal echocardiography did not reveal any reduction in the size of the vegetation. Hence, the patient underwent surgical treatment. A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was initially performed. The patient's blood pressure increased with insufflation and manipulation around the tumor but dropped immediately after the adrenal tumor was resected. Following the adrenalectomy, a cardiopulmonary bypass was established. The bicuspid aortic valve leaflets along with the vegetation were completely resected. Subsequently, a mechanical aortic valve was implanted. Inotropic agents were completely weaned off within two days after surgery. A pathological examination confirmed the adrenal incidentaloma to be pheochromocytoma. One-stage surgery with adrenalectomy before cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass may be an effective strategy for patients with pheochromocytomas diagnosed with infective endocarditis. In addition, it can reduce the risk of complications with pheochromocytoma by managing the patient's systemic condition as much as possible before cardiac surgery.
40066318	Nedd4L signaling contributes to carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in female mice and is associated with enteric dysbacteriosis.	Liver fibrosis is characterized by hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and collagen overproduction, but its pathogenesis remains largely unknown. This study aimed to uncover the role of neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (Nedd4L) signaling in liver fibrosis and its relationship with gut microbiota.
40066315	<i>Cellulophaga algicola</i> alginate lyase and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Psl glycoside hydrolase inhibit biofilm formation by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> CF2843 on three-dimensional aggregates of lung epithelial cells.	<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that produces a biofilm containing the polysaccharides, alginate, Psl, and Pel, and causes chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients. Others and we have previously explored the use of alginate lyases in inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation on plastic and lung epithelial cell monolayers. We now employ a more physiologically representative model system, i.e., three-dimensional aggregates of A549 lung epithelial cells cultured under conditions of microgravity in a rotary cell culture system to mimic the natural lung environment, and a previously isolated clinical strain, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> CF2843 that we engineered by transposon-mediated integration to express Green Fluorescent Protein and for which we also report the complete genome sequence. Immunostaining and lectin binding studies indicated that the three-dimensional cell aggregates harbored sialylated and fucosylated epitopes as well as Muc1, Muc5Ac, and β-catenin on their surfaces, suggestive of mucin secretion and the presence of tight junctions, hallmark features of lung epithelial tissue. Using this validated model system with confocal microscopy and viable bacterial counts as readouts, we demonstrated that <i>Cellulophaga algicola</i> alginate lyase and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Psl glycoside hydrolase, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Pel glycoside hydrolase, inhibit biofilm formation by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> on three-dimensional lung epithelial cell aggregates.

There is an urgent need for a convenient and reliable method for the rapid detection and surveillance of APV1.
40066262	Integrated Single-Step Terahertz Metasensing for Simultaneous Detection Based on Exosomal Membrane Proteins Enables Pathological Typing of Gastric Cancer.	Exosomes (Exos) are emerging as noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and progression monitoring of gastric cancer (GC). However, the heterogeneity discrimination and ultrasensitive quantification of Exos presents a considerable analytical challenge, thereby impeding severely their clinical application. Herein, we propose an integrated terahertz metasensing platform for the discrimination of Exos in distinct subtypes of GC in a single step-through the simultaneous evaluation of the category and richness level of Exos membrane proteins. Characterized by dual-sided independent sensing capabilities with enhanced sensitivity (169 and 325 GHz per refractive index unit, respectively), the metasensor functionalized with antibodies simultaneously reflects the content of 2 membrane proteins in the terahertz spectral response. Our approach concurrently completes accurate differentiation and precise quantification of GC-subtype Exos by integrating dual-sided sensing information in merely a single assay. The dual-sided sensing design enhances the reliability of detection results. Moreover, combined with the signal amplification of gold nanoparticles, the platform experimentally demonstrates a superior dynamic response to Exos concentrations spanning from 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> particles/ml, with the limit of detection being 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> particles/ml. This work provides new insights into multisensing metasurface design and paves the way for precise and personalized cancer treatment through the specific sensing of Exos.
40066258	Implications of draxin in neurological disorders.	Axon guidance proteins not only play a role in the formation of proper neural circuits but also have other important functions, such as cell survival, migration, and proliferation in the brain. Therefore, mutations in the genes encoding these proteins frequently cause various types of neurological disorders, including psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously identified an axon guidance protein, draxin, that is essential for the development of several neural circuits and cell survival in the brain. Recently, the deletion of the <i>draxin</i> gene was identified in an inbred BTBR T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup>/J (BTBR/J) mouse, which is a widely used model of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), suggesting that <i>draxin</i> deletion is a genetic factor for ASD-like characteristics in BTBR/J mice. In this review, I summarize the neuroanatomical abnormalities in <i>draxin</i> knockout mice by comparing them to BTBR/J mice and discuss the possible contributions of draxin to anatomical and behavioral phenotypes in BTBR/J mice.
40066253	A Rare Case of <i>PRKACA</i> Duplication-Associated Childhood-Onset Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease.	Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a rare but important cause of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent Cushing syndrome (CS). It usually presents as cyclical CS in young adults. Childhood onset of PPNAD is exceedingly rare. About 90% of cases of PPNAD are associated with Carney complex (CNC). Both PPNAD and CNC are linked to diverse pathogenic variants of the <i>PRKAR1A</i> gene, which encodes the regulatory subunit type 1 alpha of protein kinase A (PKA). Pathogenic variants of <i>PRKACA</i> gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit alpha of PKA, are extremely rare in PPNAD. We report a case of a female child, aged 8 years and 3 months, who presented with features suggestive of CS, including obesity, short stature, hypertension, moon facies, acne, and facial plethora but without classical striae or signs of CNC. Hormonal evaluation confirmed ACTH-independent CS. However, abdominal imaging revealed normal adrenal morphology. Genetic analysis identified a duplication of the <i>PRKACA</i> gene on chromosome 19p, which is linked to PPNAD. The patient underwent bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and histopathological study confirmed the PPNAD diagnosis. Postoperative follow-up showed resolution of cushingoid features and hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a female child with <i>PRKACA</i> duplication presenting as CS due to PPNAD.
40066251	Exploring the underlying molecular connections: a bioinformatics approach to link melanoma and Parkinson's disease.	Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, and Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, have been epidemiologically linked, showing a positive association that suggests a shared etiology. This association implies that individuals with one condition may have an increased risk of developing the other. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in both PD and melanoma to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may contribute to the pathophysiological overlap between these two conditions.
40066246	Examining the Relationship Between Consumption of a Protein-Based Diet and Hypertension Among Urban Households: A Cross-Sectional Study.	Hypertension continues to be a significant health challenge, contributing to numerous deaths. Dietary factors are key risk factors for hypertension.

This study aims to analyze the impact of protein intake on the health status of household members living with hypertension in Gauteng province, South Africa.
40066231	The Role of Yes-Associated Protein in Inflammatory Diseases and Cancer.	Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays a central role in the Hippo pathway, primarily governing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its significance extends to tumorigenesis and inflammatory conditions, impacting disease initiation and progression. Given the increasing relevance of YAP in inflammatory disorders and cancer, this study aims to elucidate its pathological regulatory functions in these contexts. Specifically, we aim to investigate the involvement and molecular mechanisms of YAP in various inflammatory diseases and cancers. We particularly focus on how YAP activation, whether through Hippo-dependent or independent pathways, triggers the release of inflammation and inflammatory mediators in respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive inflammatory conditions. In cancer, YAP not only promotes tumor cell proliferation and differentiation but also modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby fostering tumor metastasis and progression. Additionally, we provide an overview of current YAP-targeted therapies. By emphasizing YAP's role in inflammatory diseases and cancer, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the protein's pivotal involvement in disease processes, elucidate the intricate pathological mechanisms of related diseases, and contribute to future drug development strategies targeting YAP.
40066229	Pulmonary Hypertension: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Studies.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) stands as a tumor paradigm cardiovascular disease marked by hyperproliferation of cells and vascular remodeling, culminating in heart failure. Complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms collectively contribute to the disruption of pulmonary vascular homeostasis. In recent years, advancements in research technology have identified numerous gene deletions and mutations, in addition to <i>bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2</i>, that are closely associated with the vascular remodeling process in PH. Additionally, epigenetic modifications such as RNA methylation, DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs have been shown to precisely regulate PH molecular networks in a cell-type-specific manner, emerging as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review summarizes and analyzes the roles and molecular mechanisms of currently identified genes and epigenetic factors in PH, emphasizing the pivotal role of long ncRNAs in its regulation. Additionally, it examines current clinical and preclinical therapies for PH targeting these genes and epigenetic factors and explores potential new treatment strategies.
40066226	Depletion of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 Facilitates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer Cells by Activating the MAPK/ERK Pathway.	Hyperactivation of fatty acid biosynthesis holds promise as a targeted therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer (PCa). However, inhibiting these enzymes could potentially promote metastatic progression in various other cancers. Herein, we found that depletion of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (encoded by ACACA), the enzyme responsible for the first and rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of PCa cells. This finding was validated in vitro through cell migration assays and in vivo using a metastatic model established by tail vein injection of ACACA-depleted cells into BALB/c nude mice. Additionally, depletion of ACACA activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway. Inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway reduced EMT and migration in ACACA-depleted cells. Our study is the first to indicate targeting ACACA induces an "unexpected" escape program through activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in PCa, ultimately leading to EMT and metastasis. Therefore, we strongly recommend that the potential adverse effects of targeting ACACA or its derived therapeutic agents must be given extreme attention, especially in MAPK-related cancers.
40066225	Clinical Utility of <sup>18</sup>Fluorine-Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor-04 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in the Evaluation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: Comparison With <sup>18</sup>Fluorine-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly susceptible to metastasis, making early detection of metastases and associated risk factors crucial for effective management. This study aimed to assess the performance of <sup>18</sup>fluorine (<sup>18</sup>F)- fibroblast activation protein inhibitor-04 (<sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in detecting metastasis and predicting pathological characteristics and risk factors in 67 PDAC patients. Comparisons were made with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) PET/CT. Lesion identifications and radiotracer uptakes were evaluated through visual inspection and semiquantitative analysis using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). We analyzed the risk factors for metastasis and observed that <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04 identified more positive lesions and showed significantly higher SUVmax values than <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in both primary tumors and metastases, leading to upstaging in several cases. In primary tumors, <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04 was associated with higher levels of poorly differentiated PDAC, compared to those with moderately differentiated tumors. Notably, the SUVmax of 18F-FAPI-04 in primary tumors demonstrated a significant correlation with pathological differentiation and served as an independent prognostic factor for peritoneal metastasis, rather than lymph node or liver metastasis. Our findings suggested that <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI-04 PET/CT offers superior tumor detectability and improved node-metastasis (NM) staging in PDAC patients, positioning it as a more effective tool than <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT.
40066224	Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 1A Attenuates Apoptosis and Oxidative Stress via ERK/JNK Pathway in Hyperplastic Prostate.	Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a prevalent disorder in aging males. It is investigated whether heat shock protein family A member 1A (HSPA1A), a cytoprotective chaperone induced under stress, has been implicated in the development of BPH. RNA-sequencing and single-cell sequencing analyses revealed significant upregulation of HSPA1A in BPH compared to controls. In vitro experiments elucidated that HSPA1A was localized in prostatic epithelium and stroma, with upregulated expression in BPH tissues. Moreover, HSPA1A silencing augmented apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, inhibiting proliferation via ERK/JNK activation, while overexpression reversed these effects in prostatic BPH-1 and WPMY-1 cells. Additionally, ERK1/2 suppression with U0126 rescued the effects of HSPA1A silencing. In vivo, testosterone-induced BPH (T-BPH) rat models treated with the HSPA1A antagonist KNK437 exhibited prostatic atrophy and molecular changes consistent with reduced HSPA1A activity. Finally, we conducted a tissue microarray (TMA) analysis of 139 BPH specimens from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, which revealed a positive correlation between HSPA1A expression and clinical parameters, including prostate volume (PV), tPSA, fPSA, and IPSS. In conclusion, our findings suggested that HSPA1A attenuated apoptosis and oxidative stress through the ERK/JNK signaling pathway, contributing to BPH pathogenesis.
40066211	A Novel Missense Variant of <i>ZC3H12A</i> in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.	Because Regnase-1, encoded by <i>ZC3H12A</i>, suppresses the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by controlling pro-inflammatory cytokines, we aimed to identify <i>ZC3H12A</i> variants in patients with PAH.
40066207	Safety evaluation of pea fibre concentrate (FIPEA) as food additive.	The EFSA Panel on Food Additive and Flavourings (FAF Panel) provides a scientific opinion on the safety assessment of the proposed use of pea fibre concentrate (FIPEA) as a food additive. FIPEA is a powder consisting mainly of dietary fibres (i.e. pectin and hemicellulose), and low amounts of protein, derived from yellow pea (<i>P. sativum</i>). The manufacturing process includes extensive heat treatments, (e.g. > 100°C for more than 40 min), conditions which lead to inactivation of lectins, that in FIPEA do not pose a safety concern. A specific α-amylase is used in the manufacturing, and this should be included in the definition of the proposed specifications. The Panel considered that the additional contribution of FIPEA to the total fibre intake in adults and toddlers would be acceptable considering the levels that are considered adequate by the NDA Panel. The Panel recommended to lower the specification limits proposed for the toxic elements. The solubility test indicates that the material does not require specific assessment at the nanoscale. No toxicological data have been submitted on FIPEA. The Panel considered that, similarly to water-soluble soybean polysaccharides, FIPEA is not absorbed intact but undergoes extensive fermentation by the intestinal microbiota in humans and is not of genotoxic concern. Dry peas (raw material) are a staple food, with a very long history of safe use in the EU. FIPEA is extracted with hot water from the insoluble fibrous material of dehulled yellow peas, therefore the structure of the fibres is not chemically modified, and no new by-products or components of toxicological concern are expected from the manufacturing process. The Panel concluded that there was no need for a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) and that pea fibre concentrate (FIPEA) as a new food additive does not raise a safety concern at the proposed use and use levels.
40066202	Extracellular Vesicles Derived From Regenerating Tissue Promote Stem Cell Proliferation in the Planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted nanoparticles composed of a lipid bilayer that carry lipid, protein, and nucleic acid cargo between cells as a mode of intercellular communication. Although EVs can promote tissue repair in mammals, their roles in animals with greater regenerative capacity are not well understood. Planarian flatworms are capable of whole-body regeneration due to pluripotent somatic stem cells called neoblasts that proliferate in response to injury. Here, using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and protein content examination, we showed that EVs enriched from the tissues of the planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> had similar morphology and size as other eukaryotic EVs, and that these EVs carried orthologs of the conserved EV biogenesis regulators ALIX and TSG101. PKH67-labeled EVs were taken up efficiently by planarian cells, including S/G2 neoblasts, G1 neoblasts/early progeny, and differentiated cells. When injected into living planarians, EVs from regenerating tissue fragments enhanced the upregulation of neoblast-enriched and proliferation-related transcripts. In addition, EV injection increased the number of <i>F-ara</i>-EdU-labelled cells by 49% as compared to buffer injection only. Our findings demonstrate that regenerating planarians produce EVs that promote stem cell proliferation, and suggest the planarian as an amenable in vivo model for the study of EV function during regeneration.
40066199	Targeting Non-Eosinophilic Immunological Pathways in COPD and AECOPD: Current Insights and Therapeutic Strategies.	COPD is a multifactorial illness characterized by a long-term restriction of airflow and an inflammatory reaction in the lungs. The associated emphysema leads to the breakdown of alveolar proteins and abnormal expansion of the lung air spaces. Chronic bronchitis caused by the same disease can result in increased deposition of structural proteins, narrowing of the airways, and excessive mucus secretion leading to acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). The most commonly prescribed medications for it, such as glucocorticoids and bronchodilators, provide important therapeutic benefits, but they also have negative side effects, including immunosuppression and infection. Therefore, it is necessary to develop medications for the treatment of COPD that specifically target the immune system and molecular components. This review focuses on non-eosinophilic aspects of immunological modulation in COPD management. Since, existing literature extensively covers eosinophilic inflammation, this review aims to fill the gap by examining alternative immunological pathways and their therapeutic implications. The findings suggest that targeting specific immune responses may enhance treatment efficacy while minimizing adverse effects associated with traditional therapies. In summary, this review emphasizes the importance of advancing research into non-eosinophilic immunological mechanisms in COPD, prescribing for the development of novel therapies that can more effectively manage this disease.

40066124	Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors: A Systematic Review of Structure-Activity Relationship Studies.	Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) is a serine exopeptidase enzyme that hydrolyzes the amide bond at the N-terminal of peptides. This enzyme converts incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide I and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, into their inactive forms, thereby preventing them from stimulating insulin secretion. Numerous studies have confirmed the role of DPP-4 in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, leading to the development of various DPP-4 inhibitors. In recent years, research on DPP-4 inhibitors has expanded significantly, resulting in the creation of both non-peptidomimetic heterocyclic compounds and peptidomimetic scaffolds.
40066119	Modulating the Biliverdin Reductase (BVR)/ERK1/2 Axis to Attenuate Oxidative Stress in Rat Arterial Rings.	Biliverdin reductase (BVR) plays a central role in bile pigment metabolism by reducing biliverdin (BV) to bilirubin (BR), a potent antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) under normal and pathological conditions. Elevated oxidative stress activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling, which strongly interacts with BVR's C and D motifs, forming the BVR/ERK1/2 axis. In pathological states, increased ERK1/2 activity inhibits BVR's ability to convert BV to BR, exacerbating oxidative damage and contributing to cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the interaction between BVR and ERK1/2 is critical in modulating oxidative stress.
40066112	Predictive Insights Into Bioactive Compounds from Streptomyces as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mutant Strains by Receptor Binding Domain: Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation Approaches.	The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in humans. To date, numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those involving mutations in the RBD, have been identified. These variants exhibit differences in transmission, pathogenicity, diagnostics, and vaccine efficacy.
40066109	Characterization of a novel zebrafish model of <i>MTMR5</i>-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B3.	Biallelic loss of expression/function variants in <i>MTMR5/SBF1</i> cause the inherited peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. There is an incomplete understanding of the disease pathomechanism(s) underlying Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3, and despite its severe clinical presentation, currently no disease-modifying therapies. A key barrier to the study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3 is the lack of pre-clinical models that recapitulate the clinical and pathologic features of the disease. To address this barrier, we generated a zebrafish Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 mutant line with a full gene deletion of <i>mtmr5.</i> Resulting homozygous deletion zebrafish are born at normal Mendelian ratios and have preserved motor function. However, starting by 10 days post-fertilization, mutant zebrafish develop obvious morphometric changes in head size and brain volume. These changes are accompanied at the pathological level by abnormal axon outgrowths and by the presence of dysmyelination changes reminiscent of the nerve pathology in human Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. Importantly, RNA sequencing from brain-enriched samples identifies novel disease pathways including transcriptional changes in genes responsible for neurogenesis, chromatin remodelling/organization, and synaptic membrane homeostasis. Overall, our <i>mtmr5</i> knockout zebrafish mirror genetic, clinical and pathologic features of human Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. As such, it represents a first pre-clinical model to phenocopy the disease, and an ideal tool for future studies on disease pathomechanism(s) and therapy development.
40066091	Advances in targeting protein S-palmitoylation in tumor immunity and therapy.	S-palmitoylation is a reversible and dynamic post-translational modification of proteins. A palmitoyl group is covalently attached to a cysteine residue of the protein by a thioester link. It regulates the transcription and expression of downstream target genes and cell signaling, influencing cellular functions. Research indicates a substantial correlation between S-palmitoylation and tumorigenesis and immunotherapy, where it plays a pivotal role in modulating T cell activation, cytokine signaling, autophagy, phagocytosis, and death. Moreover, palmitoylation contributes to drug resistance and immunological evasion in tumor cells, enabling them to circumvent the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and immune surveillance. Inhibitors that target S-palmitoylation have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy, offering a novel strategy for cancer treatment. Nonetheless, obstacles such as inhibitor specificity and efficacy persist, requiring more extensive investigations into the exact mechanisms of S-palmitoylation to develop more effective targeted therapeutics. This article summarizes recent developments in S-palmitoylation concerning tumor immunity and treatment. The article examines the regulatory function of S-palmitoylation, its modifying enzymes in tumor cell signaling, and novel tumor immunotherapies that target S-palmitoylation.

40066084	Association of NR1I2 Polymorphism with Midazolam Clearance in Mechanically Ventilated ICU Patients: A Population Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacogenetic Study.	Significant variability in the metabolism of midazolam (MDZ) exists among mechanically ventilated (MV) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to complex clinical conditions and genetic factors. The NR1I2 gene (PXR), which encodes a nuclear receptor that regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP3A4, plays a critical role in MDZ metabolism. Polymorphisms in NR1I2, along with variations in genes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, may influence enzyme activity and MDZ pharmacokinetics (PK). Understanding these factors is essential for optimizing MDZ dosing in high-risk patient populations.

However, the direct role of SPN on bone metabolism remains unclear. In this study, the effects of SPN on d-galactose (d-gal)-induced mice, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and nuclear factor-κB ligand-induced osteoclasts were examined.
40066070	Biological boundary conditions regulate the internalization of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia by alveolar cells.	The lung environment is defined by unique biological boundary conditions, including complex alveolar geometry, extracellular matrix composition and mechanical forces generated during respiration. These factors were shown to regulate alveolar permeability, surfactant secretion, cell contractility and apoptosis, but their role in fungal infections remains unknown. <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is a critical fungal pathogen that causes severe pulmonary infections in immunocompromised individuals. Our study addresses a knowledge gap by investigating how boundary conditions affect <i>A. fumigatus</i> conidia interactions with alveolar epithelial cells.
40066069	Drug resistance mutations to integrase inhibitors, proteinase, and reverse transcriptase inhibitors in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections in Hebei province, China, 2018-2022.	HIV-1 protease (PR)-reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors as national free antiretroviral drugs have been used for 20 years. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been conditionally used as a component of HIV/AIDS treatment regimens in recent years. However, the systematic investigation on the changes in primary drug resistance (PDR) in Hebei province, China was limited.
40066064	Revisiting the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> druggable genome using predicted structures and data mining.	Identification of novel drug targets is a key component of modern drug discovery. While antimalarial targets are often identified through the mechanism of action studies on phenotypically derived inhibitors, this method tends to be time- and resource-consuming. The discoverable target space is also constrained by existing compound libraries and phenotypic assay conditions. Leveraging recent advances in protein structure prediction, we systematically assessed the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> genome and identified 867 candidate protein targets with evidence of small-molecule binding and blood-stage essentiality. Of these, 540 proteins showed strong essentiality evidence and lack inhibitors that have progressed to clinical trials. Expert review and rubric-based scoring of this subset based on additional criteria such as selectivity, structural information, and assay developability yielded 27 high-priority antimalarial target candidates. This study also provides a genome-wide data resource for <i>P. falciparum</i> and implements a generalizable framework for systematically evaluating and prioritizing novel pathogenic disease targets.
40066058	A Nomogram Based on S100A7 and Clinicopathological Characteristics to Predict the Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Study.	We have previously found that S100 calcium-binding protein A7 (S100A7) is strongly associated with chemoresistance in breast cancer (BC). In this study, we investigated whether S100A7 can be used to predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and assessed its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics in BC.
40066033	T and NK cell functionality in a patient harboring heterozygous novel BCL11B p.Asp632fsAla∗91 and STX11 p.R129P mutations.	BCL11B is a transcription factor essential for central nervous system development and T-cell differentiation that regulates numerous genes across various pathways. Heterozygous BCL11B defects can lead to a broad spectrum of phenotypes, including neurological disorders with or without immunological features. STX11 encodes a t-SNARE protein crucial for the final fusion of lytic granules with the plasma membrane of NK-cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Biallelic mutations in STX11 are linked to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 4. We analyzed the functional impact of heterozygous BCL11B (p.Asp632fsAla∗91) and STX11 (p.R129P) variants present in a pediatric patient with Evans syndrome and neurodevelopmental delay, without hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis presentation. The BCL11B p.Asp632fsAla∗91 variant, positioned to escape nonsense-mediated decay, likely produces a truncated protein losing three zinc finger domains. Given that BCL11B is involved in the activation of IL-2 gene expression, we evaluated this function and found a reduced IL-2 production by the patient's CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. On the other hand, structural analysis of STX11 indicated that the proline substitution at position 129 could disrupt key interactions with Munc18-2. The patient's cells exhibited decreased NK-cell degranulation and cytotoxicity, and diminished CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell degranulation compared to healthy donors. <i>In vitro</i> IL-2 treatment restored these functions to healthy donor levels. We also observed a reduced STX11 protein expression in patient PBMCs. We hypothesize that impaired IL-2 secretion caused by the BCL11B mutation may reduce the patient's ability to compensate for STX11 dysfunction, suggesting that the combined effect of BCL11B and STX11 mutations contributes to the observed immune dysfunction and the patient's complex phenotype. Additionally, our findings suggest that abnormal NK- and T-cells function could play a role in the onset of autoimmune disorders.
40066032	Proteome-wide identification of druggable targets and inhibitors for multidrug-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> using an integrative subtractive proteomics and virtual screening approach.	<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a versatile and antibiotic-resistant gram-negative pathogen, poses a critical threat to both immunocompromised and immunocompetent populations, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic targets. This study applies an extensive subtractive proteomics approach to identify viable drug targets within the core proteome of <i>P. aeruginosa PAO1</i>, analyzing a total of 5563 proteins. Through a rigorous, multi-stage process, we excluded human homologs, identified essential proteins, mapped functional pathways, determined subcellular localization, and assessed virulence and resistance factors. This comprehensive analysis led to the identification of three novel, druggable targets integral to <i>P. aeruginosa's</i> pathogenicity and multidrug resistance: preprotein translocase subunit SecD, chemotaxis-specific methyl esterase, and imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisF2. Following this, inverse virtual screening of 464,867 compounds from the VITAS-M library, performed using Schrödinger's Glide module, initially pinpointed 15 potent hits with favorable binding affinities and pharmacokinetic profiles as confirmed by QikProp analysis. Subsequent molecular dynamics, MMPBSA and DFT calculations refined these to three promising candidates: STK417467 for imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisF2, STL321396 for chemotaxis-specific methylesterase, and STL243336 for preprotein translocase subunit SecD. These compounds show strong potential as inhibitors and could be developed further as therapeutic agents against multidrug-resistant <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections. This study provides a robust computational framework for the discovery of drug targets and candidate inhibitors, marking a significant step toward effective treatments for resistant <i>Pseudomonas</i> infections.
40066030	A novel signature predicts prognosis in pancreatic cancer based on tumor membrane-associated genes.

40065993	Association between RC/HDL-C and hyperuricemia in adults: evidence from NHANES 2005-2018.	The incidence of hyperuricemia is growing in the world, with a significant influence on the survival and healthy condition of the patient. The connection between serum residual cholesterol (RC) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio and hyperuricemia is uncertain. Consequently, we tried to elucidate the connection between the hyperuricemia and RC/HDL-C ratio.
40065976	Solvation, geometry, and assembly of the tobacco mosaic virus.	Biological self-assembly is a fundamental aspect in the development of complex structures in nature. A paradigm for such a process is the assembly of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) capsid proteins into helical rods around the viral genome. The self-assembly process of the virus is typically modelled through attractive interactions between protein subunits, however capsid proteins also interact with their aqueous environment through solvation free energy. An open question is what role solvation plays in virus self-assembly. Here, we show that a purely geometric model of nonpolar solvation free energy, the morphometric approach, is sufficient to simulate the assembly of up to three protein subunits of TMV. The lowest solvation free energy states we find in a geometric simulation setting are remarkably close to the correctly assembled states of various experimentally determined structures. This demonstrates that van der Waals forces and entropic considerations are sufficient to guide assembly in the absence of attractive interactions between protein subunits. It further illustrates the impact of the morphometric approach as a computationally efficient model for nonpolar solvation free energy of solutes, in particular those with complicated geometry. This demonstration of the role of solvation raises important questions about the driving forces behind biological self-assembly and the paramount role of geometry.
40065921	Phylogenomic Analysis Reveals Evolutionary Relationships of Tropical Drosophilidae: From <i>Drosophila</i> to <i>Scaptodrosophila</i>.	Species radiation in the family Drosophilidae has led to a diversity of species occupying a wide range of ecological niches. Despite the high diversity within this family, with over thousands of species and more than a hundred species recorded in Thailand and the Malay Peninsula, taxonomic classifications remain complicated due to morphological plasticity and inconsistent phylogenetic reconstructions based on limited genetic data. In this study, we assemble new mitochondrial genomes from <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Scaptodrosophila</i> species collected in Thailand, expanding the genomic resources for these underexplored tropical regions. Phylogenetic analyses of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes revealed well-supported evolutionary relationships, with <i>Scaptodrosophila</i> forming a distinct lineage and several <i>Drosophila</i> subgroups, such as <i>ananassae</i>, <i>montium</i>, and <i>melanogaster</i>, exhibiting monophyly. Notable discrepancies were observed in the placement of the <i>suzukii</i> subgroup, which was not recovered as monophyletic, and the position of the <i>punjabiensis</i> subgroup, reflecting the complexities of lineage sorting and hybridization events. This comprehensive genomic analysis provides a more accurate understanding of evolutionary relationships within the family Drosophilidae's diversification in the tropics.
40065908	<i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> Alleviates Colitis by Regulating FXR-NLRP3 Mediated Macrophage Pyroptosis.	Ulcerative colitis (UC), a typical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is pathologically defined by mucosal inflammation confined to the colonic mucosa. <i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> (Sb), a commonly utilized probiotic yeast for managing digestive disorders like UC, has not been thoroughly investigated regarding its precise mechanisms for alleviating colitis. Increasing evidence indicates the involvement of FXR in UC. Meanwhile, the regulatory role of FXR on NLRP3 has garnered increasing attention. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of Sb supernatant (SbS) on colitis and elucidated the role of the FXR-NLRP3 signaling pathway in this process.
40065899	Transcanal Endoscopic Repair of Cerebrospinal Fluid Otorrhea Secondary to Congenital Inner Ear Anomaly Using Topical Fluorescein.	An eight-year-old female, known to have sensorineural hearing loss due to inner ear anomalies, presented with a history of recurrent attacks of right acute otitis media complicated by bacterial meningitis. Temporal bone computed tomography showed right middle ear and mastoid effusion without bony dehiscence or erosion, with features of common cavity inner ear anomaly on the right side. Given the patient's inner ear malformation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea was suspected. Further evaluation with myringocentesis and beta trace protein analysis confirmed the diagnosis. The patient underwent transcanal endoscopic right ear exploration. Initially, the site of the defect was not revealed; the CSF leak was successfully localized at the oval window, surrounding the stapes footplate. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, describing topical fluorescein application in a transcanal endoscopic approach to obliterating CSF otorrhea due to inner ear malformation.
