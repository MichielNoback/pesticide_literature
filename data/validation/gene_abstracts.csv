40066691	Robust Sensory Traits Across Light Habitats: Visual Signals but Not Receptors Vary in Centrarchids Inhabiting Distinct Photic Environments.	Visual communication in fish is often shaped by their light environment, which influences both sensory (e.g., eye size, opsin gene expression) and signalling traits (e.g., body reflectance). This study explores the phenotypic variation in the visual communication traits of six species of centrarchids (Centrarchidae) inhabiting two contrasting light environments. We measured morphological, molecular and signalling traits to determine their variation across photic conditions. Our findings reveal significant interspecific variation in sensory traits but no consistent phenotypic variation between light environments. Centrarchids showed robust visual systems with green-sensitive rh2 and red-sensitive lws opsin genes representing the main chromatic channels, with their expression remaining largely unaffected between distinct light habitats. We also found significant molecular evolution in the visual opsin genes, although these changes were not associated with environmental conditions. However, body reflectance displayed species-specific responses to environmental conditions, suggesting that signalling traits may be more flexible than sensory traits. Overall, our results challenge the generality of the current paradigm in visual ecology, which portrays visual systems in fish as highly tunable owing to photic conditions. Our study highlights the potential evolutionary or developmental constraints on centrarchid visual systems and their implications for adaptability to various habitats and novel environmental threats.

40066645	Synergistic Inactivation of Airborne Viruses by Low-Concentration Ozone With High Humidity and Temperature.	Ambient humidity, temperature, and ozone influence the viability of airborne viruses, but their synergistic effects are poorly understood, particularly regarding ozone with humidity/temperature changes. Therefore, we examined the inactivation of airborne influenza viruses and coronaviruses under combinations of low ambient ozone concentrations, relative humidity (RH) levels, and temperatures typical of daily life. Viral fluid was atomized in a closed chamber conditioned with different combinations of these factors. The atomized aerosol particles containing the virus were exposed to ambient air and then sampled for titration. Active virus levels in ambient air at 50%-85% RH with 15, 35, and 55 ppb ozone significantly decreased compared with those in ambient air with 0 ppb ozone, whereas those in ambient air at < 40% RH decreased only slightly, even with 100 ppb ozone. Viral gene copy numbers, assayed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, remained similar across all conditions. Inactivation increased with higher temperatures, although not at 15°C. These findings suggest that low concentrations of ambient ozone, when combined with high humidity and temperature, effectively inactivate airborne viruses, potentially influencing viral transmission in real-world environments.
40066641	A NAC transcription factor and a MADS-box protein antagonistically regulate sucrose accumulation in strawberry receptacles.	Sugar accumulation during fruit ripening is an essential physiological change that influences fruit quality. While NAC transcription factors are recognized for their role in modulating strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruit ripening, their specific contributions to sugar accumulation have remained largely unexplored. This study identified FvNAC073, a NAC transcription factor, as a key regulator that not only exhibits a gradual increase in gene expression during fruit ripening but also enhances the accumulation of sucrose. Further investigation showed that FvNAC073 positively regulates the expression of sucrose-6-phosphate synthase 1 (FvSPS1), a gene associated with sucrose synthesis, and negatively regulates sucrose synthase 2 (FvSUS2), which is involved in sucrose breakdown, through direct promoter binding. Additionally, we uncovered that FvCMB1L, a MADS-box protein, exhibits high gene expression levels at the premature fruit stage and acts to repress FvSPS1 while activating FvSUS2, thus negatively affecting sucrose accumulation. Notably, we demonstrated a competitive interaction between FvNAC073 and FvCMB1L in binding to the promoters of FvSPS1 and FvSUS2, resulting in antagonistic regulation of these genes. This intricate dynamic between FvCMB1L and FvNAC073 elucidates a mechanism for balancing sugar content during strawberry fruit development. Our findings offer insights into the complex regulatory network governing sucrose accumulation in strawberries, highlighting the potential for targeted genetic interventions to enhance fruit quality.
40066622	Mpox virus poxin-schlafen fusion protein suppresses innate antiviral response by sequestering STAT2.	<b>ABSTRACT</b>Mpox virus (MPXV) has to establish efficient interferon (IFN) antagonism for effective replication. MPXV-encoded IFN antagonists have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the IFN antagonism of poxin-schlafen (PoxS) fusion gene of MPXV was characterized. MPXV PoxS was capable of decreasing cGAS-produced 2'3'-cGAMP, like its ortholog poxin of vaccinia virus, which is the first known cytosolic nuclease that hydrolyzes the 3'-5' bond of 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). However, MPXV PoxS did not suppress cGAS-STING-mediated type I IFN production. Instead, MPXV PoxS antagonized basal and type I IFN-induced expression of IFN-stimulated genes such as OAS1, SAMD9, SAMD9L, ISG15, ISG56 and IFIT3. Consistently, MPXV PoxS inhibited both basal and type I IFN-stimulated activity of interferon-stimulated response elements, but did not affect activation of IFN-γ-activated sites. Mechanistically, MPXV PoxS interacted with STAT2 and sequestered it in the cytoplasm. Both the viral schlafen fusion and the active site of 2'3'-cGAMP nuclease were required for STAT2 sequestration and consequent suppression of IFN-stimulated gene expression. MPXV PoxS conferred resistance to the suppression of MPXV replication by type I IFN. Taken together, our findings suggested that MPXV PoxS counteracts host antiviral response by sequestering STAT2 to circumvent basal and type I IFN-induced expression of antiviral genes.
40066615	NTRK protein expression in NSCLC and its clinicopathological correlation.	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. Since the discovery of the oncogenic neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion in colorectal cancer in 1986, its understanding has gradually progressed. NTRK's relevance is crucial to understanding some tumor development and how specific tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitors (TRKI) work. <i>NTRK1, NTRK2,</i> and <i>NTRK3</i> (encoding the neurotrophin receptors TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, respectively) rearrangement induces high tumor transforming ability. This study investigates the clinical relevance of NTRK immunohistochemistry in NSCLC patients in a cohort of 482 patients from Karolinska University Hospital with detailed clinical and pathological studies. Immunohistochemical staining for NTRK expression was performed, and the results were correlated with patient demographics, histological subtypes, tumor extent, and staging. Our findings revealed that NTRK expression, predominantly membranous and cytoplasmic, was detected in 22 out of 482 cases (4.56%). Notably, NTRK expression was more frequently observed in squamous-cell carcinoma (SqCC) than in adenocarcinoma (AdCa). Clinical correlations indicated a significant association between NTRK expression and histologic subtypes (<i>p</i><0.001) and grade of differentiation (<i>p</i>=0.036). However, no significant correlations were observed with age, sex, tumor size, staging, or OS. NTRK immunohistochemistry represents a potential biomarker for a subset of NSCLC patients, particularly those with SqCC histology. Understanding the clinical implications of NTRK expression may contribute to personalized treatment strategies in NSCLC.
40066598	Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2/3 gene deletions and repeat motifs in Chhattisgarh, India (2017-2018).	Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are vital for malaria diagnosis, especially in resource-limited areas. RDTs targeting histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and its structural homologue PfHRP3 are commonly used for detecting Plasmodium falciparum. However, genetic deletions in these proteins can affect test accuracy. This study aims to examine the gene deletions and sequence variation in the Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes in P. falciparum isolates from Chhattisgarh, India, and assess their correlation with RDT reactivity.

40066545	Changes in Blood Groups of Patients Cared for in a Third Level Hospital in Istanbul Over the Years.	There has been a large number of immigration to Turkey after 2011, and in the past 13 years, a mixed population has been formed with both the transition to Turkish citizenship and high fertility rates. Along with numerous human migrations, gene trait transfer also occurs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of migration on blood group changes in Turkey by determining the blood group distribution of Turkish citizens living in Turkey, the blood group distribution of foreign nationals coming to Turkey, and the blood group distribution of 0-year-old babies born in the last four years.

40066532	Clinical, Immunologic, and Genetic Characteristics of T-lymphoblastic Leukemia with STIL-TAL1 Fusion.	T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with a less favorable prognosis. The genetic background of T-ALL is widely heterogeneous, with the co-occurrence of multiple genetic abnormalities. The STIL-TAL1 rearrangement results from a submicroscopic deletion on chromosome 1p33 and is present in 15 - 25% of T-ALL cases. Submicroscopic deletions are not detected by conventional cytogenetic ana-lyses but can be identified through array comparative genomic hybridization and/or high-throughput RNA sequencing. Patients with the STIL-TAL1 fusion exhibit distinct characteristics, such as a young age, high white blood cell count, typical immunophenotype, and specific genetic abnormalities. However, the clinical, laboratory, and prognostic significance of this rearrangement remains unclear. This study was performed to identify STIL-TAL1 rearrangement resulting from submicroscopic 1p33 deletion in T-ALL and to investigate the clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics of T-ALL patients with STIL-TAL1 fusion.

40066528	Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Suppresses Mitophagy to Alleviate Muscle Atrophy in Chronic Renal Failure With Protein-Energy Wasting.	Protein-energy wasting (PEW) facilitates major adverse clinical outcomes in chronic renal failure (CRF), with current therapies not suitable for all patients. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) can alleviate chronic kidney disease, with unclear effects and mechanisms on CRF with PEW. The CRF rat model was constructed by adenine administration, and PEW was induced by a 4% casein diet. The serum creatinine (SCR), urinary protein (UPR), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pathology of the gastrocnemius muscle was estimated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of mitophagy-related markers was detected to assess the mitophagy level. Dexamethasone-induced L6 myotubes established myotube atrophy models. The levels of mitophagy-related markers, muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), and atrophy gene 1 (Atrogin1) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. F. prausnitzii suppressed the SCR, UPR, and BUN expression in serum and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy, which were promoted by CRF with PEW. Dexamethasone-induced expression of MuRF1 and Atrogin1 in L6 myotubes was decreased by F. prausnitzii. Additionally, F. prausnitzii repressed mitophagy in the gastrocnemius muscle and L6 myotubes. In conclusion, F. prausnitzii suppressed renal failure progression and muscle atrophy by inhibiting mitophagy in CRF with PEW.
40066523	Modelling the effects of temperature, pH and osmotic shifts on the autofluorescence of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in vitro.

40066518	LAMP2-FLOT2 interaction enhances autophagosome-lysosome fusion to protect the septic heart in response to ILC2.	Cardiac dysfunction is a serious complication of sepsis-induced multiorgan failure in intensive care units and is characterized by an uncontrolled immune response to overwhelming infection. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), as a part of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in the inflammatory process of heterogeneous cardiac disorders. However, the role of ILC2 in regulating sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that autophagic flux blockage exacerbated inflammatory response and cardiac dysfunction, which was associated with mortality of sepsis. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model, we observed an expansion of ILC2s in the septic heart. Furthermore, IL4 derived from ILC2 mitigated cardiac inflammatory responses and improved cardiac function during sepsis. Additionally, IL4 enhanced LAMP2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2) expression through STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation to stabilize lysosomal homeostasis and rescue the impaired autophagic flux during sepsis. Notably, LAMP2 was preferentially bound to FLOT2 (flotillin 2) after IL4 exposure, and the interaction enhanced autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cardiac endothelial cells. Loss of FLOT2 reversed the regulatory effects of LAMP2 on autophagy mediated by IL4, leading to autophagosome accumulation and suppressed autophagosome clearance. Conclusively, these findings provide novel insights that ILC2 regulates incomplete autophagic flux to protect septic heart and expand our understanding of immunoregulation for sepsis.<b>Abbreviation</b>: ACTB: actin beta; ACTN: actinin, alpha; ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; ANXA5/annexin V: annexin A5; AO: acridine orange; BECN1/Beclin1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CKM: creatine kinase, muscle; CKB: creatine kinase, brain; CLP: cecal ligation and puncture; CO: cardiac output; CQ: chloroquine; CTS: cathepsin; DAPI: 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EC: endothelial cell; EF: ejection fraction; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FLOT: flotillin; FS: fractional shortening; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GATA3: GATA binding protein 3; GLB1/β-Gal: galactosidase, beta 1; HCMEC: human cardiac microvascular endothelial cell; IL: interleukin; ILC: innate lymphoid cell; IL1RL1/ST2: interleukin 1 receptor-like 1; IL4c: IL4 complex; IL7R/CD127: interleukin 7 receptor; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; LAMP: lysosomal-associated membrane protein; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LMP: lysosome membrane permeabilization; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LVEDd: left ventricular end-diastole diameter; LVEDV: left ventricular end-diastole volume; LVESd: left ventricular end-systolic diameter; LVESV: left ventricular end-systole volume; MAN: mannosidase alpha; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MS: mass spectrometry; PECAM1/CD31: platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; PTPRC/CD45: protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C; RORC/RORγt: RAR related orphan receptor gamma; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TBX21/T-bet: T-box 21; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; THY1/CD90.2: thymus cell antigen 1, theta; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-translocating ATPase; VIM: vimentin.
40066506	Indirect ELISA-based detection of histatin 3 and cystatin D for the forensic identification of human saliva.	Analyzing forensically relevant body fluids contributes to proving criminal acts, and saliva is often left on the scene, especially in sexual assault cases. Currently, saliva is presumptively identified using its salivary α-amylase activity as an indicator. However, the specificity of saliva presumptive tests is low, and therefore, they cannot confidently prove the presence of saliva. This study aimed to develop and validate an indirect ELISA-based saliva confirmatory test using the novel human salivary protein markers histatin 3 and cystatin D. Histatin 3 and cystatin D are known to be uniquely expressed in human salivary glands, and the molecular evolution of both genes occurred after the divergence of hominoids; thus, the high specificity of human saliva for both markers was expected. As a result of the validation experiments, both histatin 3 and cystatin D markers were able to distinguish human saliva from other human body fluids and animal saliva using appropriate thresholds of the quantitative absorbance values. Our results indicate that both histatin 3 and cystatin D markers are human saliva-specific; thus, we consider that this method will be useful and practical in identifying human saliva.

Genetic factors, particularly germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in DNA repair genes (DRGs), play a crucial role in PCa predisposition. Our study aimed to assess patients' adherence to a targeted PCa screening program targeting high-risk individuals with DRG PVs and evaluate the potential reduction in biopsy and MRI rates by employing our screening protocol.
40066463	The influence of genetic polymorphisms on cytokine profiles in pediatric COVID-19: a pilot study.	Recent studies have underscored the importance of genetic factors in predicting COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. While cytokine storms are crucial in disease severity, genetic predisposition significantly influences immune responses. Our study examined genes related to SARS-CoV-2 invasion <i>(ACE2 rs2074192</i>) and interferon-induced immunity (<i>IFNAR2 rs2236757, TYK2 rs2304256, OAS1 rs10774671, OAS3 rs10735079</i>). Additionally, we investigated genes linked to Kawasaki disease (<i>CD40 rs4813003, FCGR2A rs1801274, CASP3 rs113420705</i>) that play roles in immunogenesis.
40066461	Roles of methyl-CpG-binding-domain (MBD) protiens in regulation of biological processes in plants.	DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mark found in both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic genomes. It is essential for regulating expression of genes and preservation of genomic integrity. Both plants and animals possess specific proteins that mediate biological effects of DNA methylation. Many families of such methylated DNA binding proteins have been discovered in plants; the most prominent of them being the methyl-CpG- binding domain (MBD) proteins. Some of the MBD proteins have the ability to recognize methylated CpGs in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we have described MBD proteins and their functions in a wide range of cellular processes in various plant species. We have also outlined their mechanism of action and interacting protein partners.
40066459	Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of <i>CYP450</i>s under various stress treatment in <i>Dendrobium huoshanense</i>.	The cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP450) are the largest enzyme family in plant metabolism, playing a key role in the biosynthesis of both primary and secondary metabolites. However, the CYP450 has not yet been systematically characterized in Dendrobium species. In this study, 193 <i>DhCYP450</i> genes were identified in the genome of <i>Dendrobium huoshanense</i> through bioinformatics, and divided into 2 groups and 10 clans. Chromosome localization results revealed that <i>DhCYP450</i> genes are distributed across 19 chromosomes. We identified eight common conserved motifs within the <i>DhCYP450</i> family of <i>D. huoshanense</i>. Furthermore, prediction analysis of <i>cis</i>-acting elements in the promoter region indicated the presence of elements responsive to low temperature, drought, and hormones responsive elements in most <i>DhCYP450</i> genomes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated the experiments expression patterns of <i>DhCYP450</i> genes in response to cold, drought treatment, and hormones, suggesting their involvement in abiotic stress responses and their role in Dendrobium growth. Overall, these results provide valuable insights into the functional dynamics of the <i>DhCYP450</i> genes and highlight potential candidates for further study of their biological roles.
40066455	Identification and functional characterization of T-cell exhaustion-associated lncRNA AL031775.1 in osteosarcoma: a novel therapeutic target.	Osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone malignancy predominantly affecting children and adolescents, presents significant therapeutic challenges with a 5-year survival rate below 30% in metastatic cases. T-cell exhaustion, characterized by the overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules, contributes to osteosarcoma progression and immune evasion. Although targeting these inhibitory pathways has shown potential in restoring T-cell activity, the molecular regulators of T-cell depletion in osteosarcoma are poorly understood.
40066454	Integrated multiomics analysis and machine learning refine neutrophil extracellular trap-related molecular subtypes and prognostic models for acute myeloid leukemia.

40066453	Bioinformatics analysis reveals novel tumor antigens and immune subtypes of skin cutaneous melanoma contributing to mRNA vaccine development.	Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a common malignant skin cancer with high mortality and recurrence rates. Although the mRNA vaccine is a promising strategy for cancer treatment, its application against SKCM remains confusing. In this study, we employed computational bioinformatics analysis to explore SKCM-associated antigens for an mRNA vaccine and suitable populations for vaccination.
40066448	BLIMP-1-dependent differentiation of T follicular helper cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory type 1 cells.	T-regulatory-type-1 (TR1) cells are a subset of interleukin-10-producing but Foxp3<sup>-</sup> Treg cells that arise in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. We have shown that systemic delivery of autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NP) triggers the formation of large pools of disease-suppressing Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells from cognate T-follicular helper (TFH) cell precursors. Here we show that, upon treatment withdrawal, these Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells spontaneously differentiate into a novel immunoregulatory Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subset that inherits epigenetic and transcriptional hallmarks of their precursors, including clonotypic T-cell receptors, and is distinct from other Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg subsets. Whereas the transcription factor BLIMP-1 is dispensable for development of conventional Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, it is necessary for development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 cells. In a model of central nervous system autoimmunity, abrogation of BLIMP-1 or IL-10 expression in the Foxp3<sup>-</sup> and/or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subsets inhibits their development or anti-encephalitogenic activity. Thus, the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway results in the generation of two distinct autoimmune disease-suppressing, IL-10-producing TR1 subsets that are distinguished by the expression of Foxp3 and Foxp3 target genes.
40066447	Case Report: Complete response to four cycles of camrelizumab in a PD-L1 negative patient with advanced oral squamous cancer.	Immunotherapy has brought better survival benefits in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). However, owing to the lack of relevant biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of this treatment, it often has to be maintained. Here we report on a patient with stage IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue who developed an unresectable lesion in the neck after surgery and radical chemoradiotherapy. After four cycles of intermittent immunotherapy with camrelizumab, complete response (CR) was achieved. Next-generation sequencing showed that the TP53/FANCA/FAT1 gene mutations and negative PD-L1 expression were involved. The patient has been followed up for 4 years without R/M. This situation has not been reported previously, suggesting that some patients can benefit from short-term immunotherapy and even achieve CR; moreover, there may be more molecular markers to be discovered that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy. We can conduct in-depth research on relevant molecular markers, formulate personalized immunotherapy strategies and plans, and facilitate the development of new precision treatment strategies for HNSCC.
40066445	<i>Ex vivo</i> lung perfusion: recent advancements and future directions.	Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) has emerged as a transformative technique in lung transplantation, offering a solution for evaluating and rehabilitating donor lungs that would otherwise be deemed unsuitable. This review article examines the significant advancements in EVLP technology and its application in clinical practice. We discuss the criteria for selection and rehabilitation of donor lungs, emphasizing the use of EVLP for lungs with compromised function due to factors like prolonged ischemic time and donor smoking history. Further, we elaborate on the technological advancements that have improved the functional assessment of lungs, including the development of more sophisticated perfusion solutions and the integration of artificial intelligence for real-time assessment. Additionally, we discuss the future prospects of EVLP, focusing on potential innovations in perfusion solutions, the integration of regenerative medicine and gene therapy to improve allograft quality. Through this comprehensive review, we aim to provide a clear understanding of the current status of EVLP and its promising future directions, ultimately contributing to improved outcomes in lung transplantation.
40066443	Unveiling SSR4: a promising biomarker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) represents a frequent cancer with a poor prognosis. Altered glucose metabolism contributes factor to ESCC progression. In our previous study, signal sequence receptor subunit delta (SSR4) was included in an ESCC prognostic model; however, the mechanisms underlying SSR4 implication in ESCC remain ambiguous. Accordingly, we aim to determine the interconnection between SSR4 expression and clinical characteristics of ESCC.
40066442	A comprehensive prognostic and immunological implications of Gremlin 1 in lung adenocarcinoma.	Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a prevalent form of lung cancer globally, known for its high invasiveness, metastatic potential, and notable heterogeneity, particularly in its response to immunotherapy. Gremlin 1 (GREM1) is implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis in multiple cancers. However, GREM1's specific role in LUAD remains unclear. This study systematically examines GREM1 expression in LUAD and its association with tumor progression, immune microenvironment, and prognosis.
40066374	Bioactive and degradable collagen-based three-dimensional scaffold encapsulated with adipose mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes improved diabetic wound healing.	A diabetic wound is the most frequent form of chronic wound. Because diabetic wounds have multiple factors contributing to their development, the best treatments involve using a combination of approaches. Herein we assessed whether bioactive and degradable bioengineered micro-porous collagen-based three-dimensional scaffold (CTS) encapsulated with adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs)-derived exosomes could accelerate the wound healing process in diabetic rats. Diabetic animals were assigned to the control group, CTS group, Exo group, and CTS+Exo group. Tissue samples were collected on days 7, 14, and 21 for evaluations including stereological, molecular, and tensiometrical assessments. The findings showed that in the treatment groups, there was a notably increase in wound closure rate, total volumes of newly formed epidermis and dermis, numerical densities of fibroblasts and blood vessels, collagen density, and biomechanical parameters than the control group, with the most noticeable changes seen in the CTS+Exo group. Additionally, there was a notably increase in the transcript of miRNA-146a, TGF-β, bFGF, and VEGF genes in the treatment groups than the control group, with the highest expression observed in the CTS+Exo group. In the CTS+Exo group, there was a much greater decrease in TNF-α and IL-1β expression, as well as in the number of neutrophils, compared to the other groups. These results validated that the combination of CTS and ASCs-derived exosomes has a greater effect on improving diabetic wound healing.
40066360	Selenium-modified hydroxyapatite titanium coating: enhancing osteogenesis and inhibiting cancer in bone invasion by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) frequently invades the jaw, and surgical treatment often leads to bone defects requiring reconstruction with titanium plates. To enhance the anti-tumor and bone regeneration properties of titanium, a selenium-modified hydroxyapatite coating was developed on titanium surfaces.
40066353	Modeling thoracic aortic genetic variants in the zebrafish: useful for predicting clinical pathogenicity?	Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) significantly impact cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A large subset of TAAD cases, particularly those with an earlier onset, is linked to heritable genetic defects. Despite progress in characterizing genes associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic heritable TAAD, the causative gene remains unknown in most cases. Another important bottleneck in the correct and timely diagnosis of TAAD is the large proportion of variants of unknown significance (VUS) that are routinely encountered upon medical genetic testing. Reliable functional modeling data is required to accurately identify new causal genes and to determine the pathogenicity of VUS. To address this gap, our collaborative effort-comprising teams from Yale University, University of Kentucky, and Ghent University-explores a novel approach: modeling TAAD in zebrafish. Leveraging the unique advantages of this animal model promises to allow for accelerated variant pathogenicity assessment, ultimately enhancing patient care. In this review, we critically explore the currently available zebrafish-based approaches that can be used for testing pathogenicity of genes and variants related to TAAD, and we offer an outlook on the implementation of these strategies for clinical applications.
40066352	Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of hub genes in ischemic heart failure and atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) frequently coexist and mutually influence each other. The association between AF and the subtype of HF, Ischaemic heart failure (IHF), remains insufficiently described, despite their high prevalence. Hence, comprehending their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic targets are urgently needed.
40066347	Constitutive overexpression of <i>Qui-Quine Starch</i> gene simultaneously improves starch and protein content in bioengineered cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz).	Cassava is a crucial source of daily calorie intake for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) but has an inferior protein content. Despite numerous attempts utilizing both traditional and biotechnological methods, efforts to address protein deficiency in cassava have yet to meet with much success. We aim to leverage modern biotechnologies to enhance cassava's nutritional value by creating bioengineered cassava cultivars with increased protein and starch content. In this study, we utilized <i>Qui-Quine Starch</i> (<i>QQS</i>), a novel orphan gene unique to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, to develop transgenic cassava plants with increased protein and starch accumulation in their tissues. A total of 10 independent transgenic cassava lines expressing <i>QQS</i> were successfully regenerated in this study, among which line R7 (F) demonstrated superior growth vigor. Quantitative RT-PCR verified the expression of the <i>QQS</i> gene in the transgenic lines. Data showed that <i>QQS</i> expression in cassava plants increased leaf protein content by 36% in line R''' (LA) L2 and root protein by 17% for the same line compared to their wild-type and empty vector (NPTII) control plants. Moreover, leaf-soluble total carbohydrates increased by 51.76% in line R (G) L2, and root-soluble total carbohydrates increased by 46.75% in line R7 (F). The novel function of <i>QQS</i> in increasing the starch content in the transgenic biomass is demonstrated. No significant change in the content of specific amino acids was observed among the lines and various plant parts. In addition, <i>QQS</i> expression revealed increased biomass, plant vigor, and early In vitro mini-tubers production for line R7 (F). Gene interaction study between AtQQS and 59 interacting partners generated 184 interactions or edges. These gene networks comprised several functional categories regulating the starch metabolic and auxin biosynthetic processes. The role of <i>QQS</i> in imparting starch and protein content of transgenic cassava plants is validated. The next logical step is the evaluation of biochemical profiles of cassava lines expressing <i>QQS</i> that reach maturity and the transferability of these findings to consumer-preferred cassava cultivars and local landraces grown in SSA. This study represents the first biotechnological report demonstrating a simultaneous increase of protein and starch content in bioengineered cassava.
40066333	Cepharanthine hydrochloride: a novel ferroptosis-inducing agent for prostate cancer treatment.	Ferroptosis is an intracellular iron-dependent cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Increasing evidence indicated that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in suppressing tumors, thus providing new opportunities for cancer therapy. The drug cepharanthine, commonly used to treat leukopenia, has been discovered to function as an anticancer agent to multiple types of cancer via diverse mechanisms. However, the effect of cepharanthine on prostate cancer remains unclear.
40066330	Potential mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine intervention in gastric cancer: targeted regulation of autophagy.	Gastric cancer (GC) is a prevalent malignant tumor that originates from the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa, predominantly in the form of adenocarcinoma. Extensive research has confirmed the significant role of autophagy in the initiation, progression, and chemoresistance of GC. The potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to exert anti-tumor effects by modulating autophagy has been demonstrated, particularly in the context of GC prevention and treatment. Natural products (NPs) have great therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of GC by targeting autophagy-related genes and signaling pathways to intervene in the biological behaviors of gastric cancer cells such as proliferation, metastasis, invasion and death. This article describes the molecular mechanisms and key markers of tumor autophagy, the signaling pathways involved in GC-associated autophagy (PI3K/AKT/mTOR, AMPK, MAPK, p53), and summarizes the mechanism of autophagy and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection in GC, how autophagy interacts with apoptotic and iron-death processes and the wide-ranging influences that these factors play in the process. Finally, this paper systematically summarizes the natural compounds of terpenoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, saponins, and polysaccharides that modulate autophagy-related signaling pathways and potential targets for the treatment of GC, and evaluates the toxic effects of NPs, providing a more compelling rationale and direction for GC therapy.
40066329	Intestinal current measurement detects age-dependent differences in CFTR function in rectal epithelium.	Intestinal current measurement (ICM) provides a sensitive bioassay for assessment of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function in rectal biopsies <i>ex vivo</i> and is used as a diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis (CF). Furthermore, ICM was shown to be sensitive to detect pharmacological rescue of CFTR function by CFTR modulators in people with CF carrying responsive <i>CFTR</i> mutations. Results from clinical trials of CFTR modulators across age groups indicate that CFTR function in the sweat duct may be age-dependent with children reaching higher levels than adults. However, little is known about age dependency of CFTR function in the intestinal epithelium.
40066327	An Unexplored Diversity for Adaptation of Germination to High Temperatures in <i>Brassica</i> Species.	Elevated temperatures inhibit the germination of a concerning number of crop species. One strategy to mitigate the impact of warming temperatures is to identify and introgress adaptive genes into elite germplasm. Diversity must be sought in wild populations, coupled with an understanding of the complex pattern of adaptation across a broad range of landscapes. By investigating the landraces, wild, and feral populations of Algeria, Italy, France, Slovenia, Spain, and Tunisia, we assessed the response of germination to temperature increase in an unexplored diversity of 117 accessions of <i>Brassica rapa</i> and 66 of <i>Brassica oleracea</i>. Our results show that both species exhibit heat tolerance to the temperature range tested, especially <i>B. rapa</i>, with an increase in speed and uniformity of germination time, as well as an increase in germination rate as temperature increased. As for <i>B. oleracea</i> accessions, the ability to germinate under heat conditions depended on the geographical origin; in particular, southern populations showed a higher germination rate than northern populations, possibly in relation to their warmer climates of origin. These findings highlight the complex interplay between domestication, feralization, and current agronomic practices in shaping germination characteristics in <i>Brassica</i> species.
40066291	Asiaticoside-nitric oxide synergistically accelerate diabetic wound healing by regulating key metabolites and SRC/STAT3 signaling.	Diabetic wounds pose significant clinical challenges due to impaired healing processes, often resulting in chronic, nonhealing ulcers. Asiaticoside (AC), a natural triterpene derivative from <i>Centella asiatica</i>, has demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. However, the synergistic effects of nitric oxide (NO)-a recognized promoter of wound healing-combined with AC in treating diabetic wounds remain inadequately explored.
40066288	Allelic frequency of <i>msp</i>2 and <i>glurp</i> genes in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> isolates from Awka, Anambra, Nigeria.	The genetic diversity of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> correlates with its pathogenicity, therefore design of evidence-based intervention strategies to eradicate malaria requires genetic diversity surveillance. This study characterised the allelic frequencies and genetic diversity of <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites isolated from Awka, Nigeria.
40066275	Genomic and proteomic analyses of Nus-dependent non-lambdoid phages reveal a novel coliphage group prevalent in gut: mEp<sub>immI</sub>.	Nus-dependent Mexican <i>Escherichia coli</i> phages (mEp) were previously isolated from clinical samples of human feces. Approximately 50% corresponded to non-lambdoid temperate phages integrating a single immunity group, namely immunity I (mEp<sub>immI</sub>), and these were as prevalent as the lambdoid phages identified in such collection.
40066274	Addressing the global challenge of bacterial drug resistance: insights, strategies, and future directions.	The COVID-19 pandemic underscored bacterial resistance as a critical global health issue, exacerbated by the increased use of antibiotics during the crisis. Notwithstanding the pandemic's prevalence, initiatives to address bacterial medication resistance have been inadequate. Although an overall drop in worldwide antibiotic consumption, total usage remains substantial, requiring rigorous regulatory measures and preventive activities to mitigate the emergence of resistance. Although National Action Plans (NAPs) have been implemented worldwide, significant disparities persist, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Settings such as farms, hospitals, wastewater treatment facilities, and agricultural environments include a significant presence of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG), promoting the propagation of resistance. Dietary modifications and probiotic supplementation have shown potential in reshaping gut microbiota and reducing antibiotic resistance gene prevalence. Combining antibiotics with adjuvants or bacteriophages may enhance treatment efficacy and mitigate resistance development. Novel therapeutic approaches, such as tailored antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and nanoparticles, offer alternate ways of addressing resistance. In spite of advancements in next-generation sequencing and analytics, gaps persist in comprehending the role of gut microbiota in regulating antibiotic resistance. Effectively tackling antibiotic resistance requires robust policy interventions and regulatory measures targeting root causes while minimizing public health risks. This review provides information for developing strategies and protocols to prevent bacterial colonization, enhance gut microbiome resilience, and mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance.
40066273	Mobile genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>: important pathways for the acquisition of virulence and resistance.	<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> is an opportunistic pathogen primarily associated with nosocomial infections, characterized by a propensity for multi-drug resistance and the potential evolution into hypervirulent strains. Based on its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, <i>K. pneumoniae</i> can be classified into two types: classical <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (cKP) and hypervirulent <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (hvKP). The spread of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> has led to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (CRKP) and carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (CR-hvKP). The emergence of CR-hvKP is particularly concerning due to its multidrug resistance, high pathogenicity, and increased transmissibility. This review summarizes the types of MGEs present in <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, the mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by these mobile elements, their roles in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence genes, and the relationships among MGEs that resemble Russian dolls or exhibit hybrid characteristics. Additionally, the clinical treatment and epidemiological characteristics of CR-hvKP are discussed. Given the high variability and transmissibility of MGEs, continuous monitoring and control of the variation and transmission of such genetic material in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> should be prioritized.
40066269	Genomic and phenotypic characterisation of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> isolates from canine otitis externa reveals high-risk sequence types identical to those found in human nosocomial infections.	Canine otitis externa (OE) is a frequently-diagnosed condition in veterinary practices worldwide. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is commonly associated with chronic and recalcitrant canine OE, but studies with detailed genomic and phenotypic characterisation of clinical isolates are lacking.
40066261	Comprehensive investigation of proteoglycan gene expression in breast cancer: Discovery of a unique proteoglycan gene signature linked to the malignant phenotype.	Solid tumors present a formidable challenge in oncology, necessitating innovative approaches to improve therapeutic outcomes. Proteoglycans, multifaceted molecules within the tumor microenvironment, have garnered attention due to their diverse roles in cancer progression. Their unique ability to interact with specific membrane receptors, growth factors, and cytokines provides a promising avenue for the development of recombinant proteoglycan-based therapies that could enhance the precision and efficacy of cancer treatment. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the proteoglycan gene landscape in human breast carcinomas. Leveraging the available wealth of genomic and clinical data regarding gene expression in breast carcinoma and using a machine learning model, we identified a unique gene expression signature composed of five proteoglycans differentially modulated in the tumor tissue: Syndecan-1 and asporin (upregulated) and decorin, PRELP and podocan (downregulated). Additional query of the breast carcinoma data revealed that serglycin, previously shown to be increased in breast carcinoma patients and mouse models and to correlate with a poor prognosis, was indeed decreased in the vast majority of breast cancer patients and its levels inversely correlated with tumor progression and invasion. This proteoglycan gene signature could provide novel diagnostic capabilities in breast cancer biology and highlights the need for further utilization of publicly available datasets for the clinical validation of preclinical experimental results.
40066258	Implications of draxin in neurological disorders.	Axon guidance proteins not only play a role in the formation of proper neural circuits but also have other important functions, such as cell survival, migration, and proliferation in the brain. Therefore, mutations in the genes encoding these proteins frequently cause various types of neurological disorders, including psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously identified an axon guidance protein, draxin, that is essential for the development of several neural circuits and cell survival in the brain. Recently, the deletion of the <i>draxin</i> gene was identified in an inbred BTBR T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup>/J (BTBR/J) mouse, which is a widely used model of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), suggesting that <i>draxin</i> deletion is a genetic factor for ASD-like characteristics in BTBR/J mice. In this review, I summarize the neuroanatomical abnormalities in <i>draxin</i> knockout mice by comparing them to BTBR/J mice and discuss the possible contributions of draxin to anatomical and behavioral phenotypes in BTBR/J mice.
40066253	A Rare Case of <i>PRKACA</i> Duplication-Associated Childhood-Onset Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease.	Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a rare but important cause of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent Cushing syndrome (CS). It usually presents as cyclical CS in young adults. Childhood onset of PPNAD is exceedingly rare. About 90% of cases of PPNAD are associated with Carney complex (CNC). Both PPNAD and CNC are linked to diverse pathogenic variants of the <i>PRKAR1A</i> gene, which encodes the regulatory subunit type 1 alpha of protein kinase A (PKA). Pathogenic variants of <i>PRKACA</i> gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit alpha of PKA, are extremely rare in PPNAD. We report a case of a female child, aged 8 years and 3 months, who presented with features suggestive of CS, including obesity, short stature, hypertension, moon facies, acne, and facial plethora but without classical striae or signs of CNC. Hormonal evaluation confirmed ACTH-independent CS. However, abdominal imaging revealed normal adrenal morphology. Genetic analysis identified a duplication of the <i>PRKACA</i> gene on chromosome 19p, which is linked to PPNAD. The patient underwent bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and histopathological study confirmed the PPNAD diagnosis. Postoperative follow-up showed resolution of cushingoid features and hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a female child with <i>PRKACA</i> duplication presenting as CS due to PPNAD.
40066251	Exploring the underlying molecular connections: a bioinformatics approach to link melanoma and Parkinson's disease.	Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, and Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, have been epidemiologically linked, showing a positive association that suggests a shared etiology. This association implies that individuals with one condition may have an increased risk of developing the other. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in both PD and melanoma to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may contribute to the pathophysiological overlap between these two conditions.
40066229	Pulmonary Hypertension: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Studies.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) stands as a tumor paradigm cardiovascular disease marked by hyperproliferation of cells and vascular remodeling, culminating in heart failure. Complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms collectively contribute to the disruption of pulmonary vascular homeostasis. In recent years, advancements in research technology have identified numerous gene deletions and mutations, in addition to <i>bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2</i>, that are closely associated with the vascular remodeling process in PH. Additionally, epigenetic modifications such as RNA methylation, DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs have been shown to precisely regulate PH molecular networks in a cell-type-specific manner, emerging as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review summarizes and analyzes the roles and molecular mechanisms of currently identified genes and epigenetic factors in PH, emphasizing the pivotal role of long ncRNAs in its regulation. Additionally, it examines current clinical and preclinical therapies for PH targeting these genes and epigenetic factors and explores potential new treatment strategies.
40066222	RNA Modification in Metabolism.	Epigenetic regulation in disease development has been witnessed within this decade. RNA methylation is the predominant form of epigenetic regulation, and the most prevalent modification in RNA is N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A). Recently, RNA modification has emerged as a potential target for disease treatment. RNA modification is a posttranscriptional gene expression regulation that is involved in both physiological and pathological processes. Evidence suggests that m<sup>6</sup>A methylation significantly affects RNA metabolism, and its abnormal changes have been observed in a variety of diseases. Metabolic diseases are a series of diseases caused by abnormal metabolic processes of the body, the common metabolic diseases include diabetes mellitus, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, etc.; although the pathogenesis of these diseases differs from each other to the current understanding, most recent studies suggested pivotal role m<sup>6</sup>A in modulating these metabolic diseases, and m<sup>6</sup>A-based drug development has been on the agenda. This paper reviewed recent understanding of RNA modification in metabolic diseases, hoping to provide systematic information for those in this area.
40066202	Extracellular Vesicles Derived From Regenerating Tissue Promote Stem Cell Proliferation in the Planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted nanoparticles composed of a lipid bilayer that carry lipid, protein, and nucleic acid cargo between cells as a mode of intercellular communication. Although EVs can promote tissue repair in mammals, their roles in animals with greater regenerative capacity are not well understood. Planarian flatworms are capable of whole-body regeneration due to pluripotent somatic stem cells called neoblasts that proliferate in response to injury. Here, using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and protein content examination, we showed that EVs enriched from the tissues of the planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> had similar morphology and size as other eukaryotic EVs, and that these EVs carried orthologs of the conserved EV biogenesis regulators ALIX and TSG101. PKH67-labeled EVs were taken up efficiently by planarian cells, including S/G2 neoblasts, G1 neoblasts/early progeny, and differentiated cells. When injected into living planarians, EVs from regenerating tissue fragments enhanced the upregulation of neoblast-enriched and proliferation-related transcripts. In addition, EV injection increased the number of <i>F-ara</i>-EdU-labelled cells by 49% as compared to buffer injection only. Our findings demonstrate that regenerating planarians produce EVs that promote stem cell proliferation, and suggest the planarian as an amenable in vivo model for the study of EV function during regeneration.
40066194	Prevalence and molecular characterization of cystic echinococcosis in livestock in the Hazara Division, Pakistan.	Echinococcosis is a parasitic zoonotic disease caused by <i>Echinococcus</i> tapeworm larvae, forming cysts in organs like the liver and lungs. It primarily affects livestock and humans, with significant public health and economic implications worldwide. In the Hazara Division, the prevalence and genetic diversity of the <i>Echinococcus</i> is largely unexplored. Therefore, the current study aims to assess the prevalence o<i>f Echinococcus granulosis</i> (EG) in livestock.
40066177	The complete mitochondrial genome of <i>Amolops hainanensis</i> (anura: ranidae).	The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of <i>Amolops hainanensis</i> is 17778 bp in length (GenBank accession number PP734094) and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes. The mitochondrial gene arrangement of <i>A. hainanensis</i> is identical to those of other <i>Amolops</i> species and has a typical neobatrachian arrangement. Mitogenomic phylogenetic analysis revealed that <i>Amolops</i> is composed of two main clades. <i>A. hainanensis</i> is a member of the western clade and split from the basalmost node of the subclade composed of the other species of the western clade of <i>Amolops</i>.
40066175	Augmenting the human interactome for disease prediction through gene networks inferred from human cell atlas.	Gene co-expression network inference from bulk tissue samples often misses cell-type-specific interactions, which can be detected through single-cell gene expression data. However, the noise and sparsity of single-cell data challenge the inference of these networks. We developed scNET, a framework for integrative cell-type-specific co-expression network inference from single-cell transcriptome data, demonstrating its utility in augmenting the human interactome for more accurate disease gene prediction. We address the limitations of <i>de novo</i> network inference from single-cell expression data through dropout imputation, metacell formation, and data transformation. Employing this data preprocessing pipeline, we inferred cell-type-specific co-expression links from single-cell atlas data, covering various cell types and tissues, and integrated over 850K of these inferred links into a preexisting human interactome, HumanNet, resulting in HumanNet-plus. This integration notably enhanced the accuracy of network-based disease gene prediction. These findings suggest that with proper data preprocessing, network inference from single-cell gene expression data can be highly effective, potentially enriching the human interactome and advancing the field of network medicine.
40066167	Somatic mutations in Brazilian patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a comprehensive analysis.	Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare clonal hematopoietic stem cell disease characterized by acquired abnormalities in the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (<i>PIG-A</i>) gene.
40066162	Genome-wide association study of salicylic acid provides genetic insights for tea plant selective breeding.	Salicylic acid (SA) is a phenolic phytohormone widely believed to regulate plant growth and stress response. Despite its significance, the genetic basis of SA-mediated resistance to biotic stressors in tea plants is little understood. Our study investigated the genetic diversity, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns of 299 tea accessions using 79 560 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. Our genome-wide association study identified <i>CSS0033791.1</i>, an essential gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (CsNCED1), which catalyzes a vital step in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. Exogenous ABA treatment and transgenic overexpression of the <i>CsNCED1</i> gene lowered SA content in the respective tea plants by inhibiting the expression of the <i>ICS</i> gene. Further analysis revealed that ABA could reduce the expression levels of the SA receptor gene (<i>NPR1</i>) and NPR1 target genes (<i>PR1</i> and <i>WRKY18</i>), increasing the plant's susceptibility to biotic stressors. Furthermore, the feeding behavior of <i>Spodoptera litura</i> revealed that the insect bite area on transgenic leaves was substantially more extensive than that in wild type (WT), implying that the <i>CsNCED1</i> gene had a negative regulatory role in SA-mediated immune response. This study thus provides the foundation for future insect resistance breeding, sustainable tea plant resource usage, and molecular marker-assisted (MAS) tea plant breeding.
40066161	High-resolution genome assembly and population genetic study of the endangered maple <i>Acer pentaphyllum</i> (Sapindaceae): implications for conservation strategies.	<i>Acer pentaphyllum</i> Diels (Sapindaceae), a highly threatened maple endemic to the dry-hot valleys of the Yalong River in western Sichuan, China, represents a valuable resource for horticulture and conservation. This study presents the first chromosomal-scale genome assembly of <i>A. pentaphyllum</i> (~626 Mb, 2<i>n</i> = 26), constructed using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C sequencing technologies. Comparative genomic analyses revealed significant recent genomic changes through rapid amplification of transposable elements, particularly long terminal repeat retrotransposons, coinciding with the dramatic climate change during recent uplift of the Hengduan Mountains. Genes involved in photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and plant-pathogen interaction showed expansion and/or positive selection, potentially reflecting adaptation to the species' unique dry-hot valley habitat. Population genomic analysis of 227 individuals from 28 populations revealed low genetic diversity (1.04 ± 0.97 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) compared to other woody species. Phylogeographic patterns suggest an unexpected upstream colonization along the Yalong River, while Quaternary climate fluctuations drove its continuous lineage diversification and population contraction. Assessment of genetic diversity, inbreeding, and genetic load across populations revealed concerning levels of inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious mutations in small, isolated populations, particularly those at range edges (TKX, CDG, TES). Based on these results, we propose conservation strategies, including the identification of management units and recommendations for genetic rescue. These findings not only facilitate the conservation of <i>A. pentaphyllum</i> but also serve as a valuable resource for future horticultural development and as a model for similar studies on other endangered plant species adapted to extreme environments.
40066160	Two shikimate dehydrogenases play an essential role in the biosynthesis of galloylated catechins in tea plants.	Tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>) is widely cultivated throughout the world for its unique flavor and health benefits. Galloylated catechins in tea plants serve as important secondary metabolites that play a pivotal role in tea taste determination and pharmacological effects. However, the genetic basis of galloylated catechins traits remains elusive. We identified a stable and major-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with galloylated catechins index (GCI), designated <i>qGCI6.2</i>. Within the QTL's confidence interval, two shikimate dehydrogenases (<i>CsSDH4</i>, <i>CsSDH3</i>) were identified. These enzymes catalyze gallic acid (GA) production from 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, thereby contributing to galloylated catechins accumulation. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that <i>CsSDH4</i> and <i>CsSDH3</i> expression levels and GA and galloylated catechins contents were positively correlated. Furthermore, overexpressing <i>CsSDH4</i> and <i>CsSDH3</i> in transgenic tomato plants markedly increased GA and galloylated catechin contents. RNA-seq analysis of transgenic tomato indicated that <i>CsSDH4</i> and <i>CsSDH3</i> primarily regulate genes related to shikimic acid and flavonoid pathways, and jointly promote galloylated catechins synthesis. Our findings have further elucidated the galloylated catechins synthesis pathway and provided a theoretical basis for cultivation of tea cultivars with high galloylated catechin contents.
40066159	Development of an efficient and heritable virus-induced genome editing system in <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>.	The CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to introduce site-specific mutations into the genome of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. However, the direct application of this revolutionary technology to desirable tomato cultivars has been hindered by the challenges of generating transgenic plants. To address this issue, we developed an efficient and heritable genome editing system using tobacco rattle virus (TRV) for an elite tomato cultivar (the paternal line of Saladette). Notably, this virus-induced genome editing (VIGE) system enables the rapid production of various mutant seeds without the need for additional plant transformation and tissue culture, once a Cas9-expressing tomato line is established. This VIGE system consists of transgenic tomato plants that express Cas9 under the control of the tomato ubiquitin 10 (<i>SlUbi1</i>0) gene promoter and a mobile guide RNA scaffold (gRNA:SlmFT) generated using the sequence of the tomato <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>SlFT</i>) gene. We determined its editing efficiency by targeting the tomato phytoene desaturase (<i>SlPDS</i>) gene, which causes photobleaching symptoms when disrupted. Most transgenic seedlings infected with the TRV vectors carrying the <i>SlPDS-</i>targeting sgRNA developed chimeric albino leaves associated with a high frequency of indel mutations in the <i>SlPDS</i> gene. Remarkably, fruits from these plants yielded homozygous <i>SlPDS</i> knockout seeds at rates ranging from 15% to 100%. These results demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of our VIGE system in rapidly generating heritable genome edits in tomato.
40066158	The long non-coding RNA MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module regulates phosphate accumulation and disease resistance to <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> in pear.	Pear ring rot disease (<i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i>) is a significant threat to the healthy development of the pear industry. Recent research has identified the functional role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in various biological processes of plants. The role of lncRNAs in the pear defense response remains unknown. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze lncRNAs in pear stem infected with <i>B. dothidea</i>. It identified 3555 lncRNAs, of which 286 were significantly differentially expressed. GO and KEGG analyses showed that <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-regulated target genes were enriched in multiple disease resistance-related pathways. More specifically, MSTRG.32189, predicted as an endogenous target mimic (eTM), was significantly down-regulated in response to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection, and was confirmed to inhibit the cleavage effect of PcmiR399b on <i>PcUBC24.</i> OE-MSTRG.32189 transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> exhibited lower Pi content and weaker disease resistance to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> compared with wild type. In pear callus, overexpression of MSTRG.32189 negatively regulated PcmiR399b, which decreased Pi content and reduced disease resistance. Overexpressing PcmiR399b in pear callus exhibited the opposite effects compared with OE-MSTRG.32189. Overexpression and knockout of <i>PcUBC24</i> further clarified that <i>PcUBC24</i> negatively regulates Pi content and disease resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection. Furthermore, the ROS levels and expressions of disease resistance pathway-related genes were regulated by the MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module in transgenic pear callus, which contributed to disease resistance. Overall, our results demonstrated the role of lncRNAs in the pear defense response, revealing that the MSTRG.32189-PcmiR399b-<i>PcUBC24</i> module regulates phosphate accumulation and disease resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection in pear.
40066151	Warming stimulates cellulose decomposition by recruiting phylogenetically diverse but functionally similar microorganisms.	Cellulose is the most abundant component of plant litter, which is critical for terrestrial carbon cycling. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how global warming affects cellulose-decomposing microorganisms. Here, we carried out a 3-year litterbag experiment to examine cellulose decomposition undergoing +3°C warming in a tallgrass prairie. Most cellulose-associated bacteria and fungi in litterbags were also detected in bulk soil, and bacteria in litterbags had higher community-level <i>rrn</i> copy numbers, larger genome sizes, and higher genome guanine-cytosine (GC) contents than those in bulk soil, implying higher growth rates. Warming stimulated soil respiration by 32.3% and accelerated mass loss of cellulose, concurring with the increase in relative abundances of most functional genes associated with carbon decomposition in litterbags. Incorporating cellulose-decomposing genes into an ecosystem model reduced model parameter uncertainty and showed that warming stimulated microbial biomass, activity, and soil carbon decomposition. Collectively, our study supports a trait-centric view since cellulose-decomposing genes or genomic traits are amenable for ecosystem modeling. By characterizing the phylogenetically diverse yet functionally similar cellulose-associated microorganisms and their responses to warming, we take a step toward more precise predictions of soil carbon dynamics under future climate scenarios.
40066127	Regulation of Apoptosis, Autophagy, and Metastasis by Luteolin in Human Bladder Cancer EJ138 Cells: An Experimental Study.	Chemotherapy remains a primary approach to cancer treatment, widely applied in bladder cancer (BC). However, the various side effects and resistance associated with chemotherapeutic drugs pose significant challenges in BC therapy, prompting interest in natural compounds like luteolin. Studies focus on its effects on key biological processes involved in BC, including metastasis, apoptosis, and autophagy.

40066109	Characterization of a novel zebrafish model of <i>MTMR5</i>-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B3.	Biallelic loss of expression/function variants in <i>MTMR5/SBF1</i> cause the inherited peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. There is an incomplete understanding of the disease pathomechanism(s) underlying Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3, and despite its severe clinical presentation, currently no disease-modifying therapies. A key barrier to the study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3 is the lack of pre-clinical models that recapitulate the clinical and pathologic features of the disease. To address this barrier, we generated a zebrafish Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 mutant line with a full gene deletion of <i>mtmr5.</i> Resulting homozygous deletion zebrafish are born at normal Mendelian ratios and have preserved motor function. However, starting by 10 days post-fertilization, mutant zebrafish develop obvious morphometric changes in head size and brain volume. These changes are accompanied at the pathological level by abnormal axon outgrowths and by the presence of dysmyelination changes reminiscent of the nerve pathology in human Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. Importantly, RNA sequencing from brain-enriched samples identifies novel disease pathways including transcriptional changes in genes responsible for neurogenesis, chromatin remodelling/organization, and synaptic membrane homeostasis. Overall, our <i>mtmr5</i> knockout zebrafish mirror genetic, clinical and pathologic features of human Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B3. As such, it represents a first pre-clinical model to phenocopy the disease, and an ideal tool for future studies on disease pathomechanism(s) and therapy development.
40066091	Advances in targeting protein S-palmitoylation in tumor immunity and therapy.	S-palmitoylation is a reversible and dynamic post-translational modification of proteins. A palmitoyl group is covalently attached to a cysteine residue of the protein by a thioester link. It regulates the transcription and expression of downstream target genes and cell signaling, influencing cellular functions. Research indicates a substantial correlation between S-palmitoylation and tumorigenesis and immunotherapy, where it plays a pivotal role in modulating T cell activation, cytokine signaling, autophagy, phagocytosis, and death. Moreover, palmitoylation contributes to drug resistance and immunological evasion in tumor cells, enabling them to circumvent the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and immune surveillance. Inhibitors that target S-palmitoylation have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy, offering a novel strategy for cancer treatment. Nonetheless, obstacles such as inhibitor specificity and efficacy persist, requiring more extensive investigations into the exact mechanisms of S-palmitoylation to develop more effective targeted therapeutics. This article summarizes recent developments in S-palmitoylation concerning tumor immunity and treatment. The article examines the regulatory function of S-palmitoylation, its modifying enzymes in tumor cell signaling, and novel tumor immunotherapies that target S-palmitoylation.
40066086	Vaccarin Ameliorates Renal Fibrosis by Inhibiting Ferroptosis via Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 Signaling Pathway.	Vaccarin is a natural flavonoid glycoside with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and nephroprotective effects. However, the effects of vaccarin on renal fibrosis (RF) and its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vaccarin on RF and its molecular mechanisms.
40066084	Association of NR1I2 Polymorphism with Midazolam Clearance in Mechanically Ventilated ICU Patients: A Population Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacogenetic Study.	Significant variability in the metabolism of midazolam (MDZ) exists among mechanically ventilated (MV) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to complex clinical conditions and genetic factors. The NR1I2 gene (PXR), which encodes a nuclear receptor that regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes like CYP3A4, plays a critical role in MDZ metabolism. Polymorphisms in NR1I2, along with variations in genes such as CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, may influence enzyme activity and MDZ pharmacokinetics (PK). Understanding these factors is essential for optimizing MDZ dosing in high-risk patient populations.

Specnuezhenide (SPN) is an iridoid glycoside isolated from <i>Fructus Ligustri Lucidi</i>, an herb prescribed for the treatment of senile osteoporosis. However, the direct role of SPN on bone metabolism remains unclear. In this study, the effects of SPN on d-galactose (d-gal)-induced mice, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), and nuclear factor-κB ligand-induced osteoclasts were examined.
40066069	Drug resistance mutations to integrase inhibitors, proteinase, and reverse transcriptase inhibitors in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections in Hebei province, China, 2018-2022.	HIV-1 protease (PR)-reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors as national free antiretroviral drugs have been used for 20 years. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been conditionally used as a component of HIV/AIDS treatment regimens in recent years. However, the systematic investigation on the changes in primary drug resistance (PDR) in Hebei province, China was limited.
40066067	Antivirotics based on defective interfering particles: emerging concepts and challenges.	Viruses are obligate parasites, that use the host's internal metabolic systems for their own reproduction. This complicates the search for molecular targets to prevent the spread of viral infection without disrupting the vital functions of human cells. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are natural competitors of viruses for important resources of viral reproduction. DIPs emerge during infection, originate from the normal viral replication process and inhibit its progression, making them an interesting candidate for antiviral therapy. Here we describe the biology of DIPs, advances in DIP-based antiviral technology, analyze their therapeutic potential and provide a systemic overview of existing preventive and therapeutic antiviral strategies.
40066053	Chestnut (<i>Castanea crenata</i> S. et Z.) inner shell-A by-product promotes anti-obesity by regulating adipogenesis and lipogenesis-related genes and the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.	A by-product is a secondary substance unintentionally produced during manufacturing and can be repurposed through recycling. In particular, by-products generated from the processing of natural materials are valuable because of their bioactive compound content, such as polyphenols and anthocyanins. Obesity is a global health issue, and medicines for obesity have side effects, such as insomnia and headaches. The demand for safe anti-obesity treatments based on natural products has increased. In this study, the anti-obesity efficacy of chestnut inner skin powder (CIS), a by-product, was investigated in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model. CIS (100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) was administered orally for 7 weeks, and 200 mg/kg garcinia was used as the positive control. Body weight (BW) and food intake were monitored weekly. Our results showed that CIS intake reduced BW, liver weight, white adipose tissue (WAT) weight (epididymal, retroperitoneal, and perirenal tissues), leptin levels, LDL-c levels, and expression of adipogenesis- and lipogenesis-related genes, similar to the positive control group. Additionally, CIS activated the AMPK/ACC signaling pathway in the liver and reduced adipocyte size in the WAT H&E stain. In conclusion, these findings suggest that CIS may prevent and treat obesity by regulating adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipid metabolism.

40066049	Comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial resistance, biofilm formation and virulence factors of staphylococci isolated from bovine mastitis.	Bovine mastitis, a prevalent disease, is often attributed to staphylococci species. These microorganisms can express a diverse array of virulence genes and have the capability to form biofilms, establishing a robust defense against antimicrobials and host immune responses. In this study, we analyzed 191 <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp.<i>,</i> of which 81 % were identified as <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and 19 % as non-aureus staphylococci (NAS), including species such as <i>S. borealis, S. chromogenes, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, S. capitis, S. ratti,</i> and <i>S. pasteuri</i>. Our analysis involved determining antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, assessing biofilm-forming capacities, and identifying genes associated with virulence, biofilm formation, adhesion, and antimicrobial resistance. Notably, 17.2 % of the strains exhibited resistance to penicillin, with 97 % carrying the <i>blaZ</i> gene, while 9.4 % demonstrated resistance to erythromycin. All strains were sensitive to gentamicin and cefoxitin. Additionally, resistance was observed for clindamycin (8.4 %) and tetracycline (1.0 %). Concerning biofilm development, 2.6 % displayed no formation, 24.6 % were categorized as weak producers, 47.1 % as moderate, and 25.7 % as strong formers. Our investigation also unveiled the presence of virulence genes, such as superantigens like <i>sea</i> (4.7 %), <i>seb</i> (3.7 %), sec (8.4 %), <i>sed</i> (0.5 %), and <i>tst</i> (6.8 %); Panton-Valentine leukocidin (<i>pvl</i>) (59.7 %); haemolysins <i>hla</i> (88.5 %) and <i>hlb</i> (91.1 %); genes responsible for biofilm production <i>icaA</i> (87.9 %), <i>icaD</i> (78.5 %), and <i>bap</i> (4.2 %); and adhesion genes <i>fnbpA</i> (89.5 %), <i>fnbpB</i> (20.4 %), and <i>clfA</i> (89.0 %). Additionally, the strains were categorized into four groups based on their virulence attributes, revealing differences between <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> and NAS, with the latter showing a lower presence of the studied genes compared to <i>S. aureus</i> strains. This research sheds light on the resistance and virulence profiles of staphylococci strains associated with bovine mastitis, providing valuable insights for potential treatment approaches.
40066042	Characterization of the immune cell infiltration patterns in lung adenocarcinoma to facilitate immunotherapy.	Although Immunotherapy has emerged as an efficient treatment in lung carcinoma, merely a subset of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients could be benefited from it. Increasing evidence revealed that tumor immune cell infiltrating (ICI) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly related to patient prognosis and characteristics of the tumor. Thus far, the immune cell infiltration patterns of LUAD remain unclear. Herein, ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT algorithms were conducted to characterize the ICI patterns of 1155 patients with LUAD. Three ICI subtypes were determined, and the ICI score was constructed by performing PCA. A high ICI score group referred to increased activation of the signaling pathways related to immune activation and drug metabolism, reduced tumor mutation burden (TMB), as well as significantly higher expression levels of CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG3, and immune-activation-related genes. Patients who had high ICI scores showed better overall survival (OS) compared to those with low ICI scores, irrespective of TMB status. This study demonstrated that ICI scores serve as an original and effective indicator for independent prognostic prediction as well as customized immune therapy of LUAD. Establishing the ICI patterns of a larger patient population will extend our knowledg of TME, and it may facilitate the development of immunotherapies specific to LUAD.
40066033	T and NK cell functionality in a patient harboring heterozygous novel BCL11B p.Asp632fsAla∗91 and STX11 p.R129P mutations.	BCL11B is a transcription factor essential for central nervous system development and T-cell differentiation that regulates numerous genes across various pathways. Heterozygous BCL11B defects can lead to a broad spectrum of phenotypes, including neurological disorders with or without immunological features. STX11 encodes a t-SNARE protein crucial for the final fusion of lytic granules with the plasma membrane of NK-cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Biallelic mutations in STX11 are linked to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 4. We analyzed the functional impact of heterozygous BCL11B (p.Asp632fsAla∗91) and STX11 (p.R129P) variants present in a pediatric patient with Evans syndrome and neurodevelopmental delay, without hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis presentation. The BCL11B p.Asp632fsAla∗91 variant, positioned to escape nonsense-mediated decay, likely produces a truncated protein losing three zinc finger domains. Given that BCL11B is involved in the activation of IL-2 gene expression, we evaluated this function and found a reduced IL-2 production by the patient's CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. On the other hand, structural analysis of STX11 indicated that the proline substitution at position 129 could disrupt key interactions with Munc18-2. The patient's cells exhibited decreased NK-cell degranulation and cytotoxicity, and diminished CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell degranulation compared to healthy donors. <i>In vitro</i> IL-2 treatment restored these functions to healthy donor levels. We also observed a reduced STX11 protein expression in patient PBMCs. We hypothesize that impaired IL-2 secretion caused by the BCL11B mutation may reduce the patient's ability to compensate for STX11 dysfunction, suggesting that the combined effect of BCL11B and STX11 mutations contributes to the observed immune dysfunction and the patient's complex phenotype. Additionally, our findings suggest that abnormal NK- and T-cells function could play a role in the onset of autoimmune disorders.

40065997	The assembly and annotation of two teinturier grapevine varieties, Dakapo and Rubired.	Teinturier grapevines, known for their pigmented flesh berries due to anthocyanin production, are valuable for enhancing the pigmentation of wine, for potential health benefits, and for investigating anthocyanin production in plants. Here, we assembled and annotated the Dakapo and Rubired genomes, two teinturier varieties. For Dakapo, we combined Nanopore sequencing, Illumina sequencing, and scaffolding to the existing grapevine assembly to generate a final assembly of 508.5 Mbp. Combining <i>de novo</i> annotation and lifting over annotations from the existing grapevine reference produced annotation 36,940 gene annotations for Dakapo. For Rubired, PacBio HiFi reads were assembled, scaffolded, and phased to generate a diploid assembly with two haplotypes 474.7-476.0 Mbp long. <i>De novo</i> annotation of the diploid Rubired genome yielded annotations for 56,681 genes. Both genomes are highly contiguous and complete. The Dakapo and Rubired genome assemblies provide genetic resources for investigations into berry flesh pigmentation and other traits of interest in grapevine.
40065954	Mammaglobin negative secretory carcinoma of salivary gland--a diagnostically challenging case report.	Secretory carcinoma, impacting the salivary gland, embodies a low-intermediate grade malignancy characterized by the propensity for local dissemination. The fourth edition of the 2017 head and neck World Health Organization's repertoire has recently integrated SC of the salivary gland into its classification scheme. We aim to delve into a case involving a 35-year-old female presenting with swelling on the left side of her face, persisting for the past 12 years, and exhibiting a negative mammaglobin status.
40065921	Phylogenomic Analysis Reveals Evolutionary Relationships of Tropical Drosophilidae: From <i>Drosophila</i> to <i>Scaptodrosophila</i>.	Species radiation in the family Drosophilidae has led to a diversity of species occupying a wide range of ecological niches. Despite the high diversity within this family, with over thousands of species and more than a hundred species recorded in Thailand and the Malay Peninsula, taxonomic classifications remain complicated due to morphological plasticity and inconsistent phylogenetic reconstructions based on limited genetic data. In this study, we assemble new mitochondrial genomes from <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Scaptodrosophila</i> species collected in Thailand, expanding the genomic resources for these underexplored tropical regions. Phylogenetic analyses of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes revealed well-supported evolutionary relationships, with <i>Scaptodrosophila</i> forming a distinct lineage and several <i>Drosophila</i> subgroups, such as <i>ananassae</i>, <i>montium</i>, and <i>melanogaster</i>, exhibiting monophyly. Notable discrepancies were observed in the placement of the <i>suzukii</i> subgroup, which was not recovered as monophyletic, and the position of the <i>punjabiensis</i> subgroup, reflecting the complexities of lineage sorting and hybridization events. This comprehensive genomic analysis provides a more accurate understanding of evolutionary relationships within the family Drosophilidae's diversification in the tropics.
40065908	<i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> Alleviates Colitis by Regulating FXR-NLRP3 Mediated Macrophage Pyroptosis.	Ulcerative colitis (UC), a typical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is pathologically defined by mucosal inflammation confined to the colonic mucosa. <i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> (Sb), a commonly utilized probiotic yeast for managing digestive disorders like UC, has not been thoroughly investigated regarding its precise mechanisms for alleviating colitis. Increasing evidence indicates the involvement of FXR in UC. Meanwhile, the regulatory role of FXR on NLRP3 has garnered increasing attention. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of Sb supernatant (SbS) on colitis and elucidated the role of the FXR-NLRP3 signaling pathway in this process.
40065879	Successful BRCA2 Mutation Detection via Tissue-Based Gene Panel Testing in Post-bone Marrow Transplant Breast Cancer: Implications for Precision Medicine.	<i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> (<i>BRCA1/2</i>) mutation screening is recommended for patients with advanced breast cancer or early breast cancer suspected to have hereditary origins based on family history or tumor characteristics. Blood-based testing is the standard approach, but it is not feasible in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation due to the replacement of blood cells with donor-derived cells. We report a case of a patient who, following bone marrow transplantation, required an alternative to blood-based germline <i>BRCA1/2</i> screening. A germline <i>BRCA2</i> mutation was inferred through tissue-based gene panel testing on a tumor sample, using variant allele frequency analysis. This approach allowed the initiation of targeted therapy with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, resulting in sustained progression-free intervals. This case demonstrates the potential of tissue-based gene panel testing to identify actionable germline mutations in breast cancer patients when blood-based testing is not feasible, thereby expanding therapeutic options in complex clinical scenarios.
40065838	The tumor coagulome as a potential biological determinant of postsurgical recurrence of oral squamous cell carcinoma.	The tumor coagulome is an intrinsic characteristic of human tumors and a key determinant of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT). Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) establish a local procoagulant state that contributes to a broad range of vascular complications, and potentially also to tumor progression. Recent clinical studies suggest that biomarkers of coagulation might be of interest for predicting postsurgical recurrence of OSCC, but it remains unclear whether specific properties of the coagulome of OSCC are conducive to postsurgical recurrence. We examined this possibility using transcriptomic analyses of OSCC.
40065807	Comparison of naturalization mouse model setups uncover distinct effects on intestinal mucosa depending on microbial experience.	Concerns regarding the translational value of preclinical mouse models have been addressed by introducing various approaches of 'naturalizing' research mice, which provide them with more diverse microbiomes and physiological immune responses. We have previously shown that 'feralized' mice, that is, inbred laboratory mice raised in a farmyard-like, microbe-rich environment exhibit a shifted gut microbiota, matured immunophenotype, and reduced severity of colorectal cancer. Similar studies occasionally involve co-housing with wild or pet-store-raised mice as microbial donors integrating species-specific commensals and pathogens. To what extent these different practices of microbial exposure are crucial for the resulting mouse phenotype remains unclear.
40065792	Divergent response associates with the differential amplitudes of immunity against <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> by different blast resistance genes.	Rice blast disease, caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, poses the most devastating threat to global rice production. The products of most blast resistance (<i>R</i>) genes specifically recognize corresponding a virulence effectors from the pathogen, thereby mediating robust immune responses that are crucial for disease resistance. However, it is unclear why different <i>R</i> genes endow with differential amplitudes of immunity against <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>. Here, we demonstrated that different blast <i>R</i> genes confer differential amplitudes of immunity against <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>, presumably due to divergent reprogramming of transcriptional responses. We detected that three rice restorer lines exhibited differential amplitudes of immune responses, despite all lines displaying resistance to <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>. Consistently, different accessions carrying different single <i>R</i> genes exhibited remarkable differentially expressed genes (DEGs) count, indicating different transcriptional re-programming that leads to different fitness cost. Comparative analysis revealed varying degrees of overlap among DEGs across different accessions. By integrating RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data, we recommended some marker genes that distinguish the differential amplitude of immunity against <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i> mediated by different blast <i>R</i> genes. Thus, our study provides valuable insights into the specific and overlapping roles of <i>R</i> gene-mediated immunity. We also propose marker genes that can be used to effectively evaluate the amplitude of immune responses to <i>M</i>. <i>oryzae</i>, thereby facilitating the assessment of <i>R</i> genes with relatively lower amplitude of immunity in order to minimize fitness cost.
40065784	Resolving phylogenetic conflicts in Pandanales: the dual roles of gene flow and whole-genome duplication.	Accurate phylogenetic reconstruction is crucial for understanding evolutionary relationships and biodiversity. Despite advances in molecular systematics, the relationships within Pandanales-which include Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae, Stemonaceae, Triuridaceae, and Velloziaceae-remain unresolved. This study aims to clarify these relationships by analyzing transcriptomic and genomic data from these families.
40065769	Unveiling functional module associated with fungal disease stress in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>).	Fungal infections pose a considerable threat to the cultivation of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and often limit the crop yield. During infection, the transcriptome undergoes extensive reprogramming involving several regulatory pathways. To address this complexity, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis and co-expression network analysis using rigorously curated RNA-seq datasets from three different fungal diseases. Pre-processing of the data, including batch effect correction, ensured high-quality integration of the datasets. Module-trait relationship (MTR) analysis identified functional modules associated with fungal disease response. Hub genes within these modules were prioritized by multi-model centrality analyses using Cytoscape, which considered the metrics Degree, Closeness, Betweenness and Maximum Clique Centrality together with the MCODE algorithm to detect densely connected subclusters. These hub genes were further validated by cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and achieved AUC values greater than 0.7, confirming their robustness. A total of 6688 consistently expressed genes were identified, including 879 upregulated and 701 downregulated genes. Co-expression networks revealed 19 different gene modules, six of which were significantly associated with the response of barley to fungal infection. The blue module in particular was associated with immune responses such as activation of the MAPK cascade and pathogen recognition, while the green module correlated with defence mechanisms and secondary metabolism. The hub genes within these modules showed high predictive power for fungal resistance, as shown by the AUC values of the ROC curve of over 0.7, emphasizing their potential as biomarkers. This study uniquely integrates multiple RNA-seq datasets to identify novel regulatory networks and hub genes, including 345 transcription factors (TFs) from different families, with MYB and bHLH being particularly abundant. The results provide valuable insights into regulatory networks associated with fungal disease response in barley. These results can support genomic selection and marker-assisted breeding programs and accelerate the development of resistant varieties.

40065746	Compound screening in human airway basal cells identifies Wnt pathway activators as potential pro-regenerative therapies.	Regeneration of the airway epithelium restores barrier function and mucociliary clearance following lung injury and infection. The mechanisms regulating the proliferation and differentiation of tissue-resident airway basal stem cells remain incompletely understood. To identify compounds that promote human airway basal cell proliferation, we performed phenotype-based compound screening of 1,429 compounds (from the ENZO and Prestwick Chemical libraries) in 384-well format using primary cells transduced with lentiviral luciferase. 17 pro-proliferative compounds were validated in independent donor cell cultures, including the antiretroviral therapy abacavir and several Wnt signalling pathway activating compounds. The effects of compounds on proliferation were further explored in colony formation and 3D organoid assays. Structurally and functionally-related compounds that more potently induced Wnt pathway activation were investigated. One such compound, 1-azakenpaullone, induced Wnt target gene activation and basal cell proliferation in mice. Our results demonstrate the pro-proliferative effect of small-molecule Wnt pathway activators on airway basal cells. These findings contribute to the rationale to develop novel approaches to modulate Wnt signalling during airway epithelial repair.
40065730	LncRNA CASC2 mediates SOCS6 mRNA stabilization via U2AF2 recruitment to modulate macrophage polarisation in diabetic retinopathy.	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a prevalent microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of vision loss among diabetic individuals. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of DR by releasing cytokines and exosomal cargo, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), that modulate local immune responses, maintain retinal immune homeostasis and influence macrophage polarisation. Recent studies suggest that lncRNA cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (CASC2) may be involved in the regulation of DR progression. However, the regulatory mechanisms linking CASC2 with RPE cells and its role in macrophage polarisation remain insufficiently understood.

This study aims to investigate the impact of BFT-host interactions on N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of host mRNA and its underlying mechanisms.
40065719	Endogenous ERMAP Affects T-Cell Function in EAE Mice.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease (AID) mediated by myelin-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of human MS. Erythrocyte membrane-associated protein (ERMAP) is a novel erythrocyte-specific adhesion/receptor molecule associated with erythrocyte adhesion. We have previously characterised it as a novel inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule and demonstrated that recombinant ERMAP proteins ameliorate EAE; however, the specific mechanism of action of ERMAP and the effects of endogenous ERMAP on T-cell function are largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of endogenous ERMAP in T-cell and macrophage homeostasis and EAE development. We show here that erythrocyte membrane-associated protein (ERMAP) gene knockout (ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup>) mice have increased numbers of T cells and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and enhanced T-cell activation, as compared to wild-type (ERMAP<sup>+/+</sup>) mice. When induced to develop EAE, ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice have more severe EAE symptoms and pathology, which are related to increased numbers of T cells (especially Th1 and Th17 T cells) and M1 macrophages, enhanced activation of T cells, and increased generation of inflammatory cytokines, but decreased proportion of Th2 T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Global gene analysis by RNA-seq shows that signalling molecules in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway are decreased in ERMAP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results suggest that endogenous ERMAP plays an important role in T-cell and macrophage homeostasis and EAE development.
40065709	Molecular Classification of Hepatocellular Carcinoma based on Zoned Metabolic Feature and Oncogenic Signaling Pathway.

40065698	Research progress on glycolipid metabolism of Sertoli cell in the development of spermatogenic cell.	Sertoli cells play an important role in the process of spermatogenesis by providing energy for spermatogenic cells and themselves through glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Abnormalities in spermatogenesis are closely related to disruptions of glucose and lipid metabolism in Sertoli cells. The metabolic environment of Sertoli cells is hypoxic, with glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation being the primary metabolic pathways. In Sertoli cells, glycolysis produces lactate to provide energy for spermatogenic cells, while fatty acid β-oxidation generates ATP. However, the relationship of glucose and lipid metabolism with spermatogenic cell development in Sertoli cells, and the interplay between glucose and lipid metabolism remain unclear. Various hormones, including sex hormones, can affect glucose metabolism of Sertoli cells by endocrine regulation. The activation or inhibition of signaling pathways such as AMPK, mTOR, and Akt can alter the expression levels of glycolysis-related transporter genes and the generation of fatty acids, thereby affecting the glycolipid metabolism in Sertoli cells. Some transcription factors such as PPARγ can regulate downstream fatty acid metabolism-related genes by directly binding to response elements, and can promote the oxidation of fatty acids in Sertoli cells. In this article we elaborate on the key factors influencing glucose and lipid metabolism in Sertoli cells and their interconnections, and their potential clinical implications, offering new insights for the precise targeted treatments of male infertility.
40065693	TrAGEDy-Trajectory Alignment of Gene Expression Dynamics.	Single-cell transcriptomics sequencing is used to compare different biological processes.

40065683	Rhadinorhynchus villalobosi sp. n. (Acanthocephala: Rhadinorhynchidae) from the gafftopsail pompano Trachinotus rhodopus (Carangiformes: Carangidae) from the Pacific coast in Mexico.	A new species of Acanthocephala is described based on specimens found parasitising the intestine of the gafftopsail pompano Trachinotus rhodopus Gill in the State of Oaxaca, off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Rhadinorhynchus villalobosi sp. n. differs from the other 25 species of the genus known from the Pacific Ocean by a combination of morphological traits, such as the fewer number of rows of hooks along the proboscis, the distribution of spines of the trunk forming two fields, the position of genital pore, subterminal in both sexes, a shorter neck and cement glands, among others. The phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the nuclear 18S and 28S rRNA genes, as well as the mitochondrial cox1, all agree that R. villalobosi sp. n. is part of the genus, and closely related to Rhadinorhynchus trachinoti Grano-Maldonado, Sereno-Uribe, Hernández-Payán, Pérez-Ponce de León et García-Varela, 2025, a recently described Mexican species, despite the marked morphological differences between the two and being distributed in different areas.
40065658	Advantages of Mutant Generation by Genome Rearrangements of Non-Conventional Yeast via Direct Nuclease Transfection.	We previously developed a genome engineering method (TAQing2.0) based on the direct delivery of DNA endonucleases into living cells, which induces genome rearrangements even in non-sporulating nonconventional yeasts without introducing foreign DNA. Using TAQing2.0 and conventional mutagenesis (by nitrosoguanidine), we obtained mutant asexual Candida utilis strains capable of growing under highly acidic conditions (pH 1.8). Whole genome resequencing revealed that the genomic sequences of mutants generated by both methods contain a negligible small population of unmappable sequences, suggesting that both types of mutants can be regarded as equivalent to naturally occurring mutants. TAQing2.0 mutants exhibit multiple genome rearrangements with few point mutations, whereas conventional mutagenesis produces numerous point mutations. This feature enabled us to easily identify candidate genes (e.g., LYP1 homolog) responsible for acid resistance. TAQing2.0 is a powerful and versatile tool for mutant production and gene hunting without invasion of foreign DNA.
40065657	Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Promotes Glomerular Mesangial Cells Differentiation of Human Bone Marrow Hematopoietic Stem Cells - An In Vitro Study.	Glomerular filtration function and homeostasis are largely due to the cross-talk between podocytes, endothelial cells, and mesangial cells (MCs). Any disturbance in this association causes glomerular diseases (GD). Cell-based therapies are the best option in the treatment of GD. It is contemplated that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are best suited to regenerate these cells; earlier, we have shown the differentiation of HSCs into podocytes. In this study, MCs formation was initiated with retinoic acid (RA), BMP-7, and Activin A, resulting in comma-shaped intermediate mesoderm (IM) cells prominently expressing Osr1. Followed by inducing with EGF, FGF, and BMP-7, which resulted in elongated metanephric mesenchyme (MM) cells conspicuously expressing Pax2, Wt1, Foxd1, and Eya1. Finally, MM cells were induced with platelet-derived growth factor to form polygonal-shaped MCs expressing α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, CD44, and PDGFRβ. The growing MCs showed positivity to periodic acid Schiff's, and ANAE staining with a prominent expression of the Itga8 elucidating phagocytic property of MCs. These MCs showed conspicuous expression of CD133, notch-2, and telomerase, determining the quiescence nature with a 31.2% proliferation rate revealed through Ki-67 staining. The functionality of MCs was assessed by growing MCs in 5.5 and 25 mM glucose concentrations, and noticeable expression of angiotensinogen, angiotensin-I and II, angiotensin-converting enzyme, collagen-4, fibronectin, and TGFβ1 was observed in 25 mM concentration, while lowered expression of these genes was observed in 5.5 mM concentration explaining the role of MCs in regulating the filtration pressure.

40065639	Genetic origins of the Kiritimati population from central-eastern Micronesia.	The migration of Austronesian-speaking populations through Oceania has intrigued researchers for decades. The Kiribati islands, situated along the boundaries of Micronesia and Polynesia, provide a crucial link in this migration. We analyzed the genome-wide data of the Kiritimati population of Kiribati to uncover their genetic origins and connections with other Oceanian groups. Our study reveals that the Kiritimati population primarily exhibits Remote Oceanian-related ancestry associated with ancient Lapita and present-day Polynesian populations. In addition, our identity-by-descent analysis identifies populations from Philippines as their closest relatives in Island Southeast Asia. The genetic links between Kiritimati, ancient Lapita, and modern Polynesians underscore the shared ancestry and continuous gene flow across these regions. This genetic continuity and ongoing links are supported by linguistic and cultural evidence, illustrating a complex history of migration and admixture in Oceania.
40065635	Intake, digestion, and rumen microbial impacts of black soldier fly larvae and frass provided as protein supplements to cattle consuming forage.	Insects reared in large-scale, commercial settings may be a sustainable alternative to conventional livestock feeds. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) has been researched as a potential protein supplement for cattle, but knowledge gaps remain in how BSFL affects rumen microbial populations. Further, frass and larval sheddings (FRS) are produced in greater quantities than larval biomass and are N rich but have not been investigated as feed. Accordingly, the objective of our study was to compare the effects of isonitrogenous levels of cottonseed meal (CSM), BSFL, and FRS on forage utilization responses and rumen microbial communities in cattle consuming low-quality forage. Angus steers (n=8; 240 ± 22.5 kg BW) with ad libitum access to low-quality forage (5.9% crude protein) were used in replicated 4 × 4 Latin squares. One of four treatments was provided daily: no supplemental protein (CON), CSM, partially defatted BSFL, or FRS all provided at 100 mg N/kg BW. There were four 16-d experimental periods which included an 8-d adaptation to treatments, 7-d measurement of intake and digestion, and 1-d for determination of ruminal fermentation and sampling of rumen content for determination of microbial populations. Rumen content samples were separated into liquid and solid fractions, extracted for genomic DNA, PCR amplified for the V3 to V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, sequenced on a MiSeq platform, and analyzed using the QIIME2 pipeline. Protein supplementation increased forage organic matter (OM) intake and total digestible OM intake (TDOMI) relative to CON (P≤0.01). For TDOMI, there were differences (P≤0.03) between CSM (2.84 kg/d) and BSFL (3.07 kg/d) and CSM and FRS (3.05 kg/d). Treatment did not affect OM (P=0.82) or neutral detergent fiber (P=0.43) digestibility. Relative abundances of certain bacterial genera (i.e., Butyrvibrio, NK4A214, Prevotellacaeae UCG003, and Veillonellacaeae) were significantly affected by treatment in either the liquid or solid rumen fraction, but diversity indices, phyla, and dominant families were not affected. These data indicate that BSFL and FRS stimulate forage utilization to a similar or greater extent than a conventional protein supplement. The minor observed impacts on microbial community composition suggests no adverse effects on the rumen microbiome associated with supplementation of BSFL or FRS. Ultimately, BSFL and FRS may be suitable protein supplements for beef steers consuming low-quality forage.
40065631	Genome Mining and Antagonism of Stenotrophomonas geniculata MK-1, Against Peanut Foliage Fungus Diseases.	Stenotrophomonas geniculata, a bacterium, has been recognized as an eco-friendly substitute for chemical fungicides in managing peanut foliar diseases, web blotch, and early leaf spot. Core genome and pan-genome analysis identified that strain MK-1 belongs to Stenotrophomonas geniculata, and nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis confirmed that strain belongs to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The research revealed that S. geniculata MK-1 had a notable antagonistic impact on Peyronellaea arachidicola and Cercospora arachidicola and demonstrated a biocontrol efficacy of over 95% against peanut early leaf spot and web blotch disease. The nonredundant protein sequences (NR) database identified 4324 annotations related to S. geniculata, with 2682 genes similar to strain MK-1. The COG database categorized 3041 annotations into 22 functional groups, and 33 distinct metabolic pathways associated with 1851 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations. Most genes linked with metabolism are found in S. geniculata, with 380 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 44 genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database identified 194 annotations are linked to non-ribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites. The Pathogen-Host Interactions (PHI) database showed reduced virulence in strain MK-1, while unaffected pathogenicity protein counts were 52. The MK-1 strain can produce antifungal siderophores secondary metabolites, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and siderophores.
40065625	[Advances in application of small-molecule compounds in neuronal reprogramming].	Neuronal reprogramming is an innovative technique for converting non-neuronal somatic cells into neurons that can be used to replace lost or damaged neurons, providing a potential effective therapeutic strategy for central nervous system (CNS) injuries or diseases. Transcription factors have been used to induce neuronal reprogramming, while their reprogramming efficiency is relatively low, and the introduction of exogenous genes may result in host gene instability or induce gene mutation. Therefore, their future clinical application may be hindered by these safety concerns. Compared with transcription factors, small-molecule compounds have unique advantages in the field of neuronal reprogramming, which can overcome many limitations of traditional transcription factor-induced neuronal reprogramming. Here, we review the recent progress in the research of small-molecule compound-mediated neuronal reprogramming and its application in CNS regeneration and repair.
40065611	[The role of microglia activated by the deletion of immune checkpoint receptor CD200R1 gene in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease].	The study aimed to investigate the effect of the CD200R1 gene deletion on microglia activation and nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss in the Parkinson's disease (PD) process. The CRISPR-Cas9 technology was applied to construct the CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The primary microglia cells of wild-type and CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were cultured and treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia phagocytosis level was assessed by a fluorescent microsphere phagocytosis assay. PD mouse model was prepared by nigral stereotaxic injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector carrying human α-synuclein (α-syn). The changes in the motor behavior of the mice with both genotypes were evaluated by cylinder test, open field test, and rotarod test. Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess the loss of dopamine neurons in substantia nigra. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression level of CD68 (a key molecule involved in phagocytosis) in microglia. The results showed that CD200R1 deletion markedly enhanced LPS-induced phagocytosis <i>in vitro</i> by the microglial cells. In the mouse model of PD, CD200R1 deletion exacerbated motor behavior impairment and dopamine neuron loss in substantia nigra. Fluorescence intensity analysis results revealed a significant increase in CD68 expression in microglia located in the substantia nigra of CD200R1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The above results suggest that CD200R1 deletion may further activates microglia by promoting microglial phagocytosis, leading to increased loss of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in the PD model mice. Therefore, targeting CD200R1 could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of early-stage PD.
40065596	Abundance, Identity, and Potential Diazotrophic Activity of nifH-Containing Organisms at Marine Cold Seeps.	Diazotrophic microorganisms alleviate nitrogen limitation at marine cold seeps using nitrogenase, encoded in part by the gene nifH. Here, we investigated nifH-containing organisms (NCOs) inside and outside six biogeochemically heterogeneous seeps using amplicon sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of nifH genes and transcripts. We detected nifH genes affiliated with phylogenetically and metabolically diverse organisms spanning 18 bacterial and archaeal phyla (17 within seeps). Detected NCOs included methane-oxidising ANME-2 archaea and sulfate-reducing Desulfobacteraceae, which have been shown to fix nitrogen at seeps previously, as well as Desulfuromonadales and putatively hydrocarbon-oxidising Desulfoglaeba and Candidatus Methanoliparia. We detected nifH transcripts at five of the six seeps, suggesting widespread diazotrophic activity. We corrected our qPCR data based on our amplicon results, which found that 71% of recovered sequences were not bona fide nifH, and we recommend a similar correction in future qPCR studies that use broad nifH primers. NifH abundance was up to three orders of magnitude higher within seeps, was correlated with mcrA abundance, and, when corrected, was negatively correlated with porewater ammonium < 25 μM, consistent with the inhibition of diazotrophy by ammonium. Our findings expand the known diversity of NCOs at seeps and emphasise seeps as hotspots for deep-sea diazotrophy.
40065595	Glucose Transport by Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Is Mediated Through the Akt/FOXO1 Pathway in Ovine Granulosa Cells.	Glycolysis in granulosa cells (GCs) is the primary location of energy metabolism and its substrates in oocytes and is closely related to follicular development in mammals. The complex morphological structure and physiological functions of GCs are regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but little is known about how FSH regulates glycolysis in GCs, and its mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which FSH activates the Akt/FOXO1 pathway, thereby regulating glucose metabolism in ovine GCs. Granulosa cells were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of FSH and a CCK-8 assay was used to measure the proliferation of the treated cells. Next, qRT-PCR was performed to measure the transcription of the target genes, glucose transporter (GLUT). Western-blot analysis of the phospho-Akt and -FOXO1 levels induced by FSH through the glucose signalling pathway, in addition to the effects of these proteins on the expression levels of the downstream GLUT genes, was measured. Results showed that the addition of 10ng/mL FSH to the culture medium increased the viability of granulosa cells. Transcription of GLUT1 and 4 was significantly up-regulated in FSH-treated cells through activation of the Akt/FOXO1 phosphorylation pathway, thereby affecting glucose metabolism. This study contributes to the current understanding of the metabolic features of and the associated developmental pathways of ovine follicular GCs.
40065586	Environmental and Breed-Related Determinants of Bovine Ephemeral Fever Outbreaks in Southeastern Türkiye.	Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is a biphasic febrile, vector-borne viral disease affecting cattle and buffaloes, leading to significant reductions in milk production and economic losses. BEF's episodic nature often leads to its classification as non-notifiable disease.
40065567	Recent advances in targeted degradation in the RAS pathway.	<i>RAS</i> (rat sarcoma) is one of the most frequently mutated gene families in cancer, encoding proteins classified as small GTPases. Mutations in RAS proteins result in abnormal activation of the RAS signaling pathway, a key driver in the initiation and progression of various malignancies. Consequently, targeting RAS proteins and the RAS signaling pathway has become a critical strategy in anticancer therapy. While RAS was historically considered an "undruggable" target, recent breakthroughs have yielded inhibitors specifically targeting KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutations, which have shown clinical efficacy in patients. However, these inhibitors face limitations due to rapid acquired resistance and the toxic effects of combination therapies in clinical settings. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies, such as PROTACs and molecular glues, provide a novel approach by selectively degrading RAS proteins, or their upstream and downstream regulatory factors, to block aberrant signaling pathways. These degraders offer a promising alternative to traditional inhibitors by potentially circumventing resistance and enhancing therapeutic precision. This review discusses recent advancements in RAS pathway degraders, with an emphasis on targeting RAS mutations as well as their upstream regulators and downstream effectors for potential cancer treatments.
40065563	Cystic fibrosis-causing variants in Chinese patients with congenital absence of the vas deferens: a cohort and meta-analysis.	Individuals with congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD) may transmit cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene to their offspring through assisted reproductive technology (ART). We aimed to delineate the spectrum and estimate the prevalence of CF-causing variants in Chinese individuals with CAVD through a cohort analysis and meta-analysis. CFTR was sequenced in 145 Chinese individuals with CAVD. CFTR variants were classified as CF-causing or non-CF-causing variants regarding clinical significance. A comprehensive genotype analysis was performed in Chinese individuals with CAVD, incorporating previous studies and our study cohort. The prevalence of CF-causing variants was estimated through meta-analysis. In our cohort, 56 different CFTR variants were identified in 108 (74.5%) patients. Twenty variants were categorized as CF-causing and were detected in 28 (19.3%) patients. A comprehensive genotype analysis of 867 patients identified 174 different CFTR variants. Sixty-four were classified as CF-causing variants, 56.3% of which had not been previously reported in Chinese patients with CF. Meta-analysis showed that 14.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.0%-18.9%) CAVD cases harbored one CF-causing variant, and 68.6% (95% CI: 65.1%-72.0%) CAVD cases carried at least one CFTR variant. Our study underscores the urgent need for extensive CFTR screening, including sequencing of whole exons and flanking regions and detection of large rearrangements and deep intronic CF-causing variants, in Chinese individuals with CAVD before undergoing ART. The established CF-causing variants spectrum may aid in the development of genetic counseling strategies and preimplantation diagnosis to prevent the birth of a child with CF.
40065531	Telomere Position Effect-Over Long Distances Acts as a Genome-Wide Epigenetic Regulator Through a Common Alu Element.	Among epigenetic modifiers, telomeres represent attractive modulators of the genome in part through position effects. Telomere Position Effect-Over Long Distances (TPE-OLD) modulates gene expression by changes in telomere-dependent long-distance loops. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of TPE-OLD, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome and methylome analysis in proliferative fibroblasts and myoblasts or differentiated myotubes with controlled telomere lengths. By integrating omics data, we identified a common TPE-OLD dependent cis-acting motif that behaves as an insulator or enhancer. Next, we uncovered trans partners that regulate these activities and observed the consistent depletion of one candidate factor, RBPJ, at TPE-OLD associated loci upon telomere shortening. Importantly, we confirmed our findings by unbiased comparisons to recent Human transcriptomic studies, including those from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We concluded that TPE-OLD acts at the genome-wide level and can be relayed by RBPJ bridging Alu-like elements to telomeres. In response to physiological (i.e., aging) or pathological cues, TPE-OLD might coordinate the genome-wide impact of telomeres through recently evolved Alu elements acting as enhancers in association with RBPJ.
40065510	Genotype-Phenotype Correlations, Treatment, and Prognosis of Children With Early-Onset (Neonatal) Marfan Syndrome.	Early-onset Marfan syndrome (eoMFS) is a severe and rare form of Marfan syndrome characterized by severe atrioventricular valve insufficiency developing before or shortly after birth. It is unclear which factors (interventions and/or genotype) influence survival. Forty-one individuals with eoMFS with a fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) variant in exon 24-32 (CRCh37) were included. At the last follow-up, 14/41 (34%) were alive (8 months-18 years) and 27/41 (66%) were deceased. Median age of death was 1 month and 88% of the deaths occurred before 5 months of age. More individuals alive past the age of 16 months versus those who were deceased before that age had undergone cardiovascular surgery at an older age (13 months, range 3-72, vs. 2 months, range 2-2, p = 0.03). Survival was better in those with single amino acid substitutions/small in-frame deletions than in those with large in-frame deletions (p = 0.007), but variants involving a cysteine substitution in an EGF-like domain versus those involving other amino acids did not significantly influence survival. EoMFS ranges from a (pre-)neonatal life-threatening disorder to a disorder with enhanced survival, creating a window for cardiovascular surgery. Individuals with single amino acid substitutions/small in-frame deletions had better survival compared to those with variants significantly impacting exon 24-32 length.
40065506	DNA methylation signatures of cervical pre-invasive and invasive disease: An epigenome-wide association study.	Epigenetic alterations are essential in the development of cancers, while epigenome-wide exploration in cervical cancer has been limited. In this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) we explore differential DNA methylation signatures associated with CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) grade 3 and cervical cancer to better understand potential drivers and biomarkers of cervical carcinogenesis. 247 women were recruited between 2014 and 2020 (N = 119 benign, N = 74 CIN3/CGIN [cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia] and N = 54 cancer). Methylation signatures were obtained from exfoliated cervical cells and sequenced using the Illumina 850 k array. Logistic regression and conditional analyses were used to test for independent associations between Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites and case-control status, with adjustment for batch, chip, age, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status. 409 CpG sites were strongly associated with CIN3/cancer (p-value <5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Following conditional analysis, two CpG sites located in PAX1 (cg16767801) and NREP-AS1 genes (cg23642047) were independently associated with case status, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (AUC = 0.97 for invasive disease). In a validation dataset (CIN3 only) PAX1/NREP-AS1 yielded a combined AUC of 0.77. Methylation markers offer promise for use in cervical screening, particularly as triage tests and self-sampling. We have identified a novel combined methylation marker that offers a high accuracy for the detection of CIN3 or worse.
40065499	The transcription factor RIP140 regulates interferon γ signaling in breast cancer.	RIP140 (receptor interacting protein of 140 kDa) is an important player in breast cancer (BC) by regulating key cellular pathways such as nuclear hormone receptor signaling. In order to identify additional genes specifically regulated by RIP140 in BC, we performed a transcriptomic analysis after silencing its expression in MCF-7 cells. We identified the interferon γ (IFNγ) signaling as being substantially repressed by RIP140 knockdown. Using the GBP1 (guanylate binding protein 1) gene as a reporter of IFNγ signaling, we demonstrated its robust induction by RIP140 through an ISRE motif, leading to a significant reduction of its induction upon IFNγ treatment. Furthermore, we showed that low levels of RIP140 amplified the IFNγ-dependent inhibition of BC cell proliferation. In line with these data, reanalysis of transcriptomic data obtained in human BC samples revealed that IFNγ levels were associated with good prognosis only for BC patients exhibiting tumors expressing low levels of RIP140, thus confirming its effect on the anti-tumor activity of IFNγ provided by our experimental data. Altogether, this study identifies RIP140 as a new regulator of IFNγ signaling in breast tumorigenesis.

40065494	The DNA N6-adenine methylation target gene GhMAF1 promotes fiber initiation at the base of Gossypium ovules.	DNA methylation consists of 5-methylcytosine and N6-methyl deoxyadenosine (6mA) and is crucial in plant development. However, its specific role and potential mechanism to initiate cotton fibers remain unclear. This study employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to analyze DNA methylation alterations in ZM24 and ZM24 fuzzless-lintless (ZM24fl) during fiber initiation. Our results indicated that DNA 6mA methylation exhibited the most remarkable difference among ovule samples at -2, 0, and 5 d post anthesis of ZM24 and ZM24fl. Subsequently, genes with significant changes in DNA 6mA methylation and transcription during fiber initiation were screened. We found that GhMAF1 displayed significant transcriptional upregulation and 6mA enrichment in its promoter, which could serve as a potential target for DNA 6mA in fiber initiation. Further, we knocked out GhMAF1 using CRISPR-Cas technology and demonstrated that GhMAF1 specifically promotes the initiation of fiber cells at the base of the ovule by mediating the downstream JAZ2/CPC-MML3/MML4 pathway. These findings unveil a novel spatial module of fiber cell initiation on the ovule surface that involves GhMAF1. Ultimately, this work provides significant knowledge for the regulatory network of DNA 6mA modification in fiber initiation to improve fiber yield and quality.

Centropogon subgenus Centropogon comprises 55 species found primarily in midelevation Andean forests featuring some of the most curved flowers among angiosperms. Floral curvature is linked to coevolution with the sicklebill hummingbird, which pollinates most species. Despite charismatic flowers, there is limited knowledge about the phylogenetic relationships and floral evolution.
40065480	GHSR gene knockout alleviates the liver pathological response in Echinococcus granulosus infection by reducing parasite survival.	Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, and the immunosuppressive microenvironment exacerbates disease progression. Ghrelin, a peptide hormone, plays a role in modulating immune inflammation and may influence the progression of E. granulosus infection through its receptor, GHSR (growth hormone secretagogue receptor). However, whether GHSR downregulation can inhibit E. granulosus infection remains unclear. In this study, we extracted liver tissues from E. granulosus-infected mice and those treated with the GHSR antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6. Proteomic analysis revealed 341 differentially expressed proteins, of which 185 were upregulated and 156 were downregulated. Metabolomic sequencing revealed 101 differentially expressed metabolites, including 62 upregulated and 39 downregulated metabolites. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of both proteomic and metabolomic data revealed seven key signalling pathways, 11 key proteins, and 26 key metabolites that interact through metabolic and organic system networks. Next, we examined the disease progression of E. granulosus infection in GHSR-knockout mice. Compared with the E. granulosus (Eg) group, the GHSR-KO group presented a significant reduction in the number of liver infection foci. The serum and liver ghrelin levels were significantly greater in the E. granulosus group than in the control group, along with increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ) and decreased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). In contrast, the GHSR-KO group presented significantly lower ghrelin levels in both the serum and liver, with reduced proinflammatory cytokine secretion and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, similar to those of the control group. Furthermore, ghrelin and inflammation-related factors, including MyD88, NF-κB p65, iNOS, and Arg-1, exhibited coordinated expression changes in liver lesions and surrounding areas. These findings suggest that GHSR gene knockout can ameliorate the progression of liver E. granulosus infection and associated liver inflammation.
40065479	Wolbachia bacteria in Mansonella perstans isolates from patients infected in different geographical areas: a pilot study from the ESCMID Study Group for Clinical Parasitology.	Mansonella perstans is a vector-borne filarial parasite widely endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, with sporadic cases in Latin America. Infection is often overlooked; treatment is not standardized, and effectiveness of common regimes is difficult to ascertain. Anti-Wolbachia macrofilaricidal treatment with doxycycline has been applied, but there are scant and contrasting reports about the presence of Wolbachia in M. perstans isolates from different geographical locations. Taking advantage of a network of European centres expert in traveller and migrant health, we aimed to expand the knowledge concerning the distribution of Wolbachia in M. perstans to contribute to the design of optimal treatment approaches.

40065431	New Insight Into the Mechanism of Nitrite Enhancement on Heterotrophic Nitrification and Aerobic Denitrification Bacterium in Gene Expression.	The growth and nitrogen metabolism of heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification (HN-AD) bacteria are affected by nitrite, but the mechanisms underlying this for strain Acinetobacter johnsonii EN-J1 are unclear. In this study, the addition of 10 mg/L nitrite increased the reduction rate of ammonium by 1.0 mg/L/h, and 20 mg/L nitrite increased the reduction rate of nitrate by 3.9 mg/L/h. Compared with the control, the nitrate reductase activity, electron transfer activity, and adenosine triphosphate content of EN-J1 were enhanced by 142.0%, 278.0% and 279.0%, respectively, in the nitrate removal process after the addition of 20 mg/L nitrite. The whole genome was annotated with nitrogen removal genes such as narGHI, narK, nsrR, nirBD, nasA, glnA, gltB, gdhA and amt. Transcriptome analysis showed that nitrite triggered significant upregulation of several key pathways, including nitrogen metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism for enhancing denitrification. The expression of key denitrification genes (narG, narK, hmp, nirBD, glnA and nasA) was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. These results suggested that nitrite enhances denitrification by increasing the expression of denitrification genes, electron transfer and adenosine triphosphate levels, which is important for elucidating the mechanism of nitrite promotion of biological nitrogen removal efficiency.

40065401	Development and validation of potential molecular subtypes and signatures of thyroid eye disease based on angiogenesis-related gene analysis.	Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the orbit, associated with a range of potential clinical sequelae. Tumor cells in TED overexpress pro-angiogenic factors, driving the formation of heterogeneous and immature neovascularization. This dysregulated angiogenesis often leads to a hypoxic microenvironment due to insufficient perfusion. Despite its importance, the role of angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) in TED pathophysiology remains poorly understood.

40065387	Additive association of blood group A allele with 15 cardiometabolic diseases: a UK Biobank life-course study.	Although existing studies have reported associations between blood group A and cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), most have focused on dominant inheritance models. However, genome-wide association studies have mostly been based on additive genotypes. This study aims to investigate the association between the blood group A allele and 15 CMD using recessive, dominant, and additive models and identify potential mediators.
40065384	DNAH9 variants in children with post-infectious bronchiolitis/bronchitis obliterans.	Post-infectious bronchiolitis/bronchitis obliterans (PIBO) is a chronic irreversible obstructive lung disease that results in obstruction and/or obliteration of small airways. Previous reports have indicated that PCD-related gene mutations contribute to PIBO incidence. However, the relationship between DNAH9 variants and PIBO remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between DNAH9 mutations and the incidence of PIBO. In our cohort, 126 PIBO patients conducted Whole Exome Sequence (WES) test and twelve variants of DNAH9 gene were identified. Detailed clinical information, high-resolution computerized tomography and/or electronic bronchoscopy findings of the six pediatric children carried DNAH9 variants were systematically collected, meticulously reviewed, and rigorously analyzed. Clinical evaluation revealed three patients with bronchiolitis obliterans, two patients with bronchitis obliterans and one with both conditions. All patients had at least one previous bout of pneumonia, which in three cases was linked to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, in two cases to adenovirus infection, and in one case to co-infection with both pathogens. Genetic analysis of all cases identified six compound heterozygous DNAH9 mutations encompassing twelve variants: c.12,925 C > T (p.Arg4309*), c.5152-10G > T (-), c.4604 A > G (p.Gln1535Arg), c.12844-14T > C (-), c.4816T > C (p.Phe1606Leu), c.8831G > A (p.Arg2944Gln), c.9479 C > T (p.Ala3160Val), c.7415G > A (p.Arg2472Gln), c.5692G > T (p.Glu1898*), c.11,572 C > T (p.Arg3858Trp), c.11,176 C > T (p.Arg3726Trp), c.1010 C > T (p.Pro337Leu). These variants included two nonsense mutations, two mutations near splice sites, and eight missense mutations. All variants exhibited negligible or low minor allele frequencies based on the gnomAD database and were predicted to be variants of uncertain significance (VUS) or deleterious based on comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Our findings suggest that DNAH9 compound complex variants may contribute to development of PIBO following severe M. pneumoniae and/or adenoviral infectious pneumonia in pediatric patients.
40065383	Autism spectrum disorder and 3p24.3p23 triplication: a case report.	The role of copy number variants as genomic mutations causative of neurodevelopmental disorders has been recently established. They can act as risk factors of conditions with multifactorial etiopathogenesis and incomplete penetrance, such as nonsyndromic autism, and, in this case, are often inherited from an unaffected parent. Conversely, dominant syndromes, with high penetrance, can be caused by de novo occurring variants.
40065382	Morphological and molecular characterisation of Sarcocystis capracanis, Sarcocystis cornagliai and Sarcocystis rossii n. sp. infecting the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex).	The cyst-forming coccidia of the genus Sarcocystis (Sarcocystidae) are widespread protists of mammals, particularly of domestic and wild ruminants. Research on genus Sarcocystis in wild members of the subfamily Caprinae is, however, rather limited. Sarcocystis in the Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) have only been investigated in depth once and then solely by morphological techniques. In the current investigation we aimed to morphologically and genetically characterise Sarcocystis species of Alpine ibex in Austria.
40065372	Engineered extracellular vesicles promote the repair of acute kidney injury by modulating regulatory T cells and the immune microenvironment.	Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical condition. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKI have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatment options remain limited. Studies have shown that immune cells play a critical role in AKI, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) being one of the most important immunosuppressive lymphocytes. Tregs proliferation can attenuate AKI, whereas depletion exacerbates kidney injury. Given that endothelial cells (ECs) are the initial cells that interact with immune cells when they invade the tissue parenchyma, ECs are closely associated with immune reactions.
40065368	Hypoxia-induced MIR31HG expression promotes partial EMT and basal-like phenotype in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma based on data mining and experimental analyses.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common and aggressive type of pancreatic cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 8%. Its high mortality is largely due to late diagnosis, metastatic potential, and resistance to therapy. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in metastasis, enabling cancer cells to become mobile. Partial EMT, where cells maintain both epithelial and mesenchymal traits, is more frequent in tumors than complete EMT and contributes to cancer progression. The long non-coding RNA MIR31 host gene (MIR31HG) has recently emerged as a critical factor in PDAC oncogenesis. This study aimed to investigate MIR31HG's role in partial EMT and its association with the basal-like PDAC subtype.
40065365	Prognostic implications and characterization of tumor-associated tertiary lymphoid structures genes in pancreatic cancer.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the most aggressive cancers, with rising incidence and limited responsiveness to immunotherapy due to its highly suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), ectopic formation structures of immune cells, are linked to better prognosis and improved immunotherapy responses in PDAC. Understanding TLS's role in PDAC could enhance immunotherapy effectiveness.
40065364	Fidgetin-like 2 knockdown increases acute neuroinflammation and improves recovery in a rat model of spinal cord injury.	Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause permanent dysfunction proceeding from multifaceted neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to damage and repair. Fidgetin-like 2 (FL2), a microtubule-severing enzyme that negatively regulates axon growth, microglial functions, and wound healing, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for central nervous system injuries and neuroinflammation. To test the hypothesis that FL2 knockdown increases acute neuroinflammation and improves recovery after SCI, we examined the effects of nanoparticle-encapsulated FL2 siRNA treatment after a moderate contusion SCI in rats. SCI significantly increased FL2 expression in the lesion site and rostral to the lesion 1 day post-injury (dpi). A single treatment of FL2 siRNA after injury led to modestly improved locomotor recovery consistent with the preservation of corticospinal tract function, accompanied by reduced inflammation and increased presence of oligodendrocytes. In determining the acute effects of treatment, RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that FL2 siRNA modulates early cellular responses, including chemokine signaling, both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune reactions, and neurotransmitter signaling pathways at 1, 4, and 7 dpi. Follow-up analyses at 4 dpi using dual in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that SCI increased FL2 mRNA and that FL2 was colocalized with microglia/macrophages. FL2 downregulation resulted in a marked accumulation of microglia at the lesion site, accompanied by increased inflammatory markers (IL-1β, TGF-β1, and CD68). The results suggest SCI induces an increase in FL2 expression that undermines acute inflammatory responses as well as spinal cord integrity and growth. Overall, our study suggests that targeting FL2 holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for treating SCI.
40065360	Trans-ancestral rare variant association study with machine learning-based phenotyping for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, rare coding variant studies have been limited by phenotyping challenges and small sample sizes. We test associations of rare and ultra-rare coding variants with proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and MASLD case-control status in 736,010 participants of diverse ancestries from the UK Biobank, All of Us, and BioMe and performed a trans-ancestral meta-analysis. We then developed models to accurately predict PDFF and MASLD status in the UK Biobank and tested associations with these predicted phenotypes to increase statistical power.
40065355	Differential growth and flowering capacity of tulip bulbs and the potential involvement of PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE-BINDING PROTEINS (PEBPs).	Tulipa gesneriana reproduces vegetatively by the development of bulb clusters from axillary meristems in the scales of a mother bulb. While part of the daughter bulbs in a cluster develop into large, flowering bulbs, others stay small and vegetative under the same environmental conditions. This study aims to investigate how these different developmental fates are orchestrated.
40065352	A rapid ecologic analysis, confirmed by a case-control study, identifies class I HLA alleles correlated to the risk of COVID-19.	Several studies suggest that the heterogeneous spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics started on December 2019 could be partially upheld by the prevalence of permissive class I HLA alleles in specific populations. Such HLA alleles are in fact unable to shape an efficient anti-viral immune-response in the hosts or sustain an exaggerated inflammatory T cell mediated response responsible for the COVID-19 disease. We previously reported an ecologic correlation between the risk of COVID-19 spreading across Italy and the germinal expression of permissive HLA-C*01 and -B*44 alleles in specific inter and intraregional populations along the first spreading wave.
40065336	Modulation of the Epithelial-mesenchymal transition process by Forkhead Box C2 in the repair of airway epithelium after injury.	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regarded as a key process in repair of airway epithelium after injury. Forkhead Box C2 (FOXC2) is a transcription factor involved in EMT process, whether it is involved in repair of bronchial epithelium remains unknown.
40065328	Extraction of a stromal metastatic gene signature in breast cancer via spatial profiling.	The identification of molecular features characterizing metastatic disease is a critical area of oncology research, as metastatic foci often exhibit distinct biological behaviors compared to primary tumors. While the focus has largely been on the neoplastic cells themselves, the characterization of the associated stroma remains largely underexplored, with significant implications for understanding metastasis.
40065321	Characterization and genomic analysis of Sharanji: a jumbo bacteriophage of Escherichia coli.	Bacteriophages are the most genetically diverse biological entities in nature. Our current understanding of phage biology primarily stems from studies on a limited number of model bacteriophages. Jumbo phages, characterized by their exceptionally large genomes, are less frequently isolated and studied. Some jumbo phages exhibit remarkable genetic diversity, unique infection mechanisms, and therapeutic potential.
40065304	Prognostic significance of miR-378 in cancers: a meta-analysis.	The prognostic significance of miR-378 in cancers remains controversial. We carried out the meta-analysis to clarify the issue.
40065301	SLC25A35 enhances fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis to promote the carcinogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by upregulating PGC-1α.	Mitochondria dysfunction has been closely linked to a wide spectrum of human cancers, whereas the molecular basis has yet to be fully understood. SLC25A35 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins. However, the role of SLC25A35 in mitochondrial metabolism reprogramming, development and progression in human cancers remains unclear. Here, we found that SLC25A35 markedly reprogramed mitochondrial metabolism, characterized by increased oxygen consumption rate and ATP production and decreased ROS level, via enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Meanwhile, SLC25A35 also enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis characterized by increased mitochondrial mass and DNA content. Mechanistic studies revealed that SLC25A35 facilitated FAO and mitochondrial biogenesis through upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) via increasing acetyl-CoA-mediated acetylation of PGC-1α. Clinically, SLC25A35 was highly expressed in HCC and correlated with adverse patients' survival. Functionally, SLC25A35 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the carcinogenesis in a DEN-induced HCC mice model. Moreover, we found that SLC25A35 upregulation is caused, at least in part, by decreased miR-663a in HCC cells. Together, our results suggest a crucial oncogenic role of SLC25A35 in HCC by reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism and suggest SLC25A35 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
40065289	ARMC5 mutations in primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia: a family case report.	Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH) is a rare cause of overt Cushing's syndrome (CS), which usually manifests as bilateral macronodular adrenal nodules and varying levels of cortisol secretion. Previous studies have shown that ARMC5 play a huge role in the occurrence of PBMAH, which may be inherited to family members and lead to more severe clinical symptoms. ARMC5 variants may be associated with meningiomas, which is also illustrated by our report.
40065269	Tumor protein 53 gene polymorphism, demographic attributes and associated risk factors among liver cancer patients in Calabar, Nigeria.	Mutations in the TP53 gene had been attributed to the development of liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver tumour are liver diseases having high mortality rates in several populations. There is no information on the TP53 gene polymorphism among liver diseases patients in Calabar, Nigeria. This study investigated the genetic polymorphism of TP53 among HCC and liver tumour in Calabar. This research was carried out in the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar. Blood samples were collected from 35 clinically diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma and 10 tumour patients and 10 healthy controls. DNA was extracted from all blood samples and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed using specific primers. The PCR amplicons were digested using Hae III restriction enzyme and the genotypic and allelic frequencies was determined. Demographic data among participants showed that males were 68.9% (31), females (31.1%; 14), sex ratio (2.2: 0.5), mean age was 41.51 ± 2.13 years with an odds ratio of 1.25. The distribution of participants according to marital status were 33(73.3%), 10(22.2%), and 2(4.4%) for married, single, and widowed respectively. The participants were from different extractions with varied representations of Yakurr (22.2%, 10), Efik (20%, 9), Boki (13.3%, 6), Ogoja (13.3%, 6), Annang (8.8%, 4), Ibibio (2.2%, 1) and Igbo (2.2%, 1) and respectively. Approximately, 64.7% (30) of the chronic liver diseases were from the Central and Northern part of Cross River State. The risk factors were HCV infection, HBsAg<sup>+</sup>, alcoholism, smoking, consumption of groundnuts that may have been contaminated with aflatoxin and family history of the disease. PCR product yielded 254 bp and digested PCR product showed homozygous TT mutation (27), heterozygous GT mutation (17) and homozygous GG wild type (1) in cases. The overall TP53 gene mutation frequency was 46.32% (44). The frequency of G allele, T allele, GG, GT and TT were 0.21, 0.79, 0.04, 0.33 and 0.62 respectively among cases, while GG (wild type) was only detected among controls in the study population. The genotypic and allelic frequencies conform to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium meaning that the forces of evolution were not acting on the locus. There were significant differences in the genotypic proportions of the TP53 gene polymorphism among patients and controls. This study on the TP53 gene polymorphism will serve as baseline information on the molecular etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver tumour in Cross River State.
40065264	Molecular breeding of pigs in the genome editing era.	To address the increasing demand for high-quality pork protein, it is essential to implement strategies that enhance diets and produce pigs with excellent production traits. Selective breeding and crossbreeding are the primary methods used for genetic improvement in modern agriculture. However, these methods face challenges due to long breeding cycles and the necessity for beneficial genetic variation associated with high-quality traits within the population. This limitation restricts the transfer of desirable alleles across different genera and species. This article systematically reviews past and current research advancements in porcine molecular breeding. It discusses the screening of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) to identify resistance loci in swine and the challenges and future applications of genetically modified pigs.
40065259	Manganese-Driven Plasmid Nanofibers Formed <i>In Situ</i> for Cancer Gene Delivery and Metalloimmunotherapy.	While nucleic-acid-based cancer vaccines hold therapeutic potential, their limited immunogenicity remains a challenge due in part to the low efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery caused by lysosomal entrapment. In this work, we found that plasmids encoding both an antigen and a STING agonist protein adjuvant can self-assemble into coordination nanofibers, triggered by manganese ions. We developed a strategy to construct a DNA vaccine, termed MnO<sub>2</sub>-OVA-CDA-mem, formed by the coencapsulation of manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>), an antigen-expressing plasmid (encoding ovalbumin, OVA), and an adjuvant enzyme-expressing plasmid (encoding STING agonist, CDA) within dendritic cell (DC) membranes. Upon uptake into acidic lysosomes, Mn<sup>2+</sup> released from MnO<sub>2</sub> triggered the nucleic acids to undergo a morphological change from nanospheres (∼180 nm diameter) to nanofibers (∼1 μm length), resulting in an increase in mechanical strength by about 9-fold and consequently lysosomal membrane disruption. The antigen OVA and adjuvants Mn<sup>2+</sup> and CDA in the cytoplasm triggered strong DC activation and antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell metalloimmune responses, significantly inhibiting the growth of B16-OVA tumors and inducing long-term immune memory. Altogether, MnO<sub>2</sub>-OVA-CDA-mem holds potential as a platform for nucleic acid antigen and adjuvant delivery using an <i>in situ</i> self-assembly strategy in a metal-driven, stimulus-responsive, and programmable manner for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.
40065248	Different NGS identification methods of somatic mutation sites in solid tumors impact TMB results.	Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is a predictive biomarker for assessing the response of various tumor types to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). TMB is quantified based on somatic mutations identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) using targeted panel data. This study aimed to investigate whether different NGS methods will affect the results of TMB detection in solid tumors.
40065246	Epigallocatechin -3- gallate mitigates diazinon neurotoxicity via suppression of pro-inflammatory genes and upregulation of antioxidant pathways.	Diazinon is a commonly used organophosphate (OP) insecticide especially in developing countries for the control of insect pests, however, exposure to its toxic impact especially in humans and other non-target species remains an important public health concern. The study aimed to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin -3- gallate (EGCG), abundant in green tea plants on neurobehavioural, biochemical, and pathological changes in the brain of male Wistar rats following exposure to diazinon toxicity. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were acclimatized for seven days and subsequently randomly assigned into six treatment groups as follows: Group I: Control group (0.2 mL distilled water); Group II: Diazinon at 3 mg/kg (1% LD50); Group III: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (50 mg/kg, ~ 2% of LD50); Group IV: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (100 mg/kg, ~ 5% of LD50); Group V: EGCG (50 mg/kg) and Group VI: EGCG (100 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally once daily for 14 days. Neurobehavioural studies, biomarkers of oxidative stress, histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) were performed. Diazinon alone impaired recognition memory, increased oxidative stress markers and altered antioxidant defense in the brain. It upregulated TNF-α and IL-6 genes and repressed GPx 4 gene expressions. It was also associated with increased GFAP, Tau, and α-SN immunoreactivity. Microscopic examination revealed loss of Purkinje and hippocampal cells in brain. Co-treatment with EGCG however improved cognition, lowered oxidative stress markers, improved antioxidant status and suppressed TNF-α and IL-6. In conclusion, findings from this study demonstrated that EGCG offered protection against diazinon-induced neurotoxicity. Hence, natural sources of epigallocatechin -3- gallate such as fruits and vegetables could offer immense benefits by protecting against oxidative stress and inflammation in neurodegenerative disease conditions.Clinical trial number Not applicable.
40065237	SNPeBoT: a tool for predicting transcription factor allele specific binding.	Mutations in non-coding regulatory regions of DNA may lead to disease through the disruption of transcription factor binding. However, our understanding of binding patterns of transcription factors and the effects that changes to their binding sites have on their action remains limited. To address this issue we trained a Deep learning model to predict the effects of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) on transcription factor binding. Allele specific binding (ASB) data from Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments were paired with high sequence-identity DNA binding Domains assessed in Protein Binding Microarray (PBM) experiments. For each transcription factor a paired DNA binding Domain was selected from which we derived E-score profiles for reference and alternate DNA sequences of ASB events. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to predict whether these profiles were indicative of ASB gain/loss or no change in binding. 18211 E-score profiles from 113 transcription factors were split into train, validation and test data. We compared the performance of the trained model with other available platforms for predicting the effect of SNP on transcription factor binding. Our model demonstrated increased accuracy and ASB recall in comparison to the best scoring benchmark tools.
40065228	SWI/SNF-type complexes-transcription factor interplay: a key regulatory interaction.	ATP-dependent switch/sucrose nonfermenting-type chromatin remodeling complexes (SWI/SNF CRCs) are multiprotein machineries altering chromatin structure, thus controlling the accessibility of genomic DNA to various regulatory proteins including transcription factors (TFs). SWI/SNF CRCs are highly evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes. There are three main subtypes of SWI/SNF CRCs: canonical (cBAF), polybromo (pBAF), and noncanonical (ncBAF) in humans and their functional Arabidopsis counterparts SYD-associated SWI/SNF (SAS), MINU-associated SWI/SNF (MAS), and BRAHMA (BRM)-associated SWI/SNF (BAS). Here, we highlight the importance of interplay between SWI/SNF CRCs and TFs in human and Arabidopsis and summarize recent advances demonstrating their role in controlling important regulatory processes. We discuss possible mechanisms involved in TFs and SWI/SNF CRCs-dependent transcriptional control of gene expression. We indicate that Arabidopsis may serve as a valuable model for the identification of evolutionarily conserved SWI/SNF-TF interactions and postulate that further exploration of the TFs and SWI/SNF CRCs-interplay, especially in the context of the role of particular SWI/SNF CRC subtypes, TF type, as well as cell/tissue and conditions, among others, will help address important questions related to the specificity of SWI/SNF-TF interactions and the sequence of events occurring on their target genes.
40065216	Immunization induces inflammation in the mouse heart during spaceflight.	Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA's Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight.
40065214	Tumor Prognostic Risk Model Related to Monocytes/Macrophages in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Machine Learning and Multi-Omics.	Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are crucial in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and invasion. This study explores monocyte/ macrophage-associated gene expression profiles in HCC, constructs a prognostic model based on these genes, and examines its relationship with drug resistance and immune therapy responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq) data from 10 HCC tissue biopsy samples, totaling 24,597 cells, were obtained from the GEO database to identify monocyte/macrophage-associated genes. A prognostic model was constructed and validated using external datasets and Western blot. Relationships between the model, clinical correlates, drug sensitivity, and immune therapy responses were investigated. From scRNA-seq data, 2,799 monocyte/macrophage marker genes were identified. Using the TCGA dataset, a prognostic model based on the single-gene UQCRH was constructed, stratifying patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on overall survival rates. High-risk group patients showed reduced survival rates and higher UQCRH expression in tumor tissues. Western blot analysis further confirmed the elevated expression of UQCRH in HCC cell lines. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed that high UQCRH expression co-localized with malignant cells in the tumor tissue. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed that the high-risk group had lower sensitivity to sorafenib and axitinib. Immune therapy response analysis indicated poorer outcomes in the high-risk group, with more pronounced APC inhibition and a weaker IFN-II response. Clinical indicator analysis showed a positive correlation between high UQCRH expression and tumor invasion. Enrichment analysis of UQCRH and associated molecules indicated involvement in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial electron transport. This study introduces a prognostic model for HCC patients based on monocyte/macrophage marker genes. The single-gene model predicts HCC patient survival and treatment outcomes, identifying high-risk individuals with varying drug sensitivities and immune suppression states.
40065213	The efficacy and safety of zavegepant nasal inhalation versus oral calcitonin-gene related peptide receptor antagonists in the acute treatment of migraine: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of the literature.	The latest randomized controlled trial (RCT) revealed that zavegepant, a new nasal inhalation calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, has a clear efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine. However, whether the efficacy of this new nasal inhalation drug is better than other oral CGRP receptor antagonists remained to be confirmed. Therefore, we designed this network meta-analysis (NMA) to provide a reference for the clinical application of zavegepant.
40065209	Integrated bulk RNA sequencing and mass cytometry analysis reveal the circulating immune landscape in ischemic and hemorrhagic Moyamoya disease.	Moyamoya disease (MMD) is increasingly recognized as being influenced by chronic inflammation, with circulating immune cells playing a role in its progression. However, research on the immune characteristics of different MMD subtypes is limited. This study aims to compare the peripheral immune profiles of ischemic and hemorrhagic MMD patients.
40065206	LungGENIE: the lung gene-expression and network imputation engine.	Few cohorts have study populations large enough to conduct molecular analysis of ex vivo lung tissue for genomic analyses. Transcriptome imputation is a non-invasive alternative with many potential applications. We present a novel transcriptome-imputation method called the Lung Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine (LungGENIE) that uses principal components from blood gene-expression levels in a linear regression model to predict lung tissue-specific gene-expression.
40065199	Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in PNPLA3, TM6SF2 and MBOAT7 genes and markers of cancer aggressiveness in a Sri Lankan NASH-related HCC cohort.	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) and membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 7 (MBOAT7) genes were reported to be strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenicity among different populations. We investigated whether these SNPs are associated with prognostic factors and genetic biomarkers of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the Sri Lankan context.
40065170	LILRB3 genetic variation is associated with kidney transplant failure in African American recipients.	African American (AA) kidney transplant recipients exhibit a higher rate of graft loss compared with other racial and ethnic populations, highlighting the need to identify causative factors. Here, in the Genomics of Chronic Allograft Rejection cohort, pretransplant blood RNA sequencing revealed a cluster of four consecutive missense single-nucelotide polymorphisms (SNPs), within the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B3 (LILRB3) gene, strongly associated with death-censored graft loss. This SNP cluster (named LILRB3-4SNPs) encodes missense mutations at amino acids 617-618 proximal to a SHP1/2 phosphatase-binding immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. The LILRB3-4SNPs cluster is specifically enriched within AA individuals and exhibited a strong association with death-censored graft loss and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline in the AA participants from multiple transplant cohorts. In two large Biobanks (BioMe and All-of-Us), the LILRB3-4SNPs cluster was associated with the early onset of end-stage renal disease and acted synergistically with the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) G1/G2 allele to accelerate disease progression. The SNPs were also linked to multiple immune-related diseases in AA individuals. Last, on multiomics analysis of blood and biopsies, recipients with LILRB3-4SNPs showed enhanced inflammation and monocyte ferroptosis. While larger and prospective studies are needed, our data provide insights on the genetic variation underlying kidney transplant outcomes.
40065168	Selection for somatic escape variants in SERPINA1 in the liver of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.	Somatic variants accumulate in non-malignant tissues with age. Functional variants, leading to clonal advantage of hepatocytes, accumulate in the liver of patients with acquired chronic liver disease (CLD). Whether somatic variants are common to CLD from differing etiologies is unknown. We analyzed liver somatic variants in patients with genetic CLD from alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency or hemochromatosis. We show that somatic variants in SERPINA1, the gene encoding A1AT, are strongly selected for in A1AT deficiency, with evidence of convergent evolution. Acquired SERPINA1 variants are clustered at the carboxyl terminus of A1AT, leading to truncation. In vitro and in vivo, C-terminal truncation variants reduce disease-associated Z-A1AT polymer accumulation and disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum, supporting the C-terminal domain swap mechanism. Therefore, somatic escape variants from a deleterious germline variant are selected for in A1AT deficiency, suggesting that functional somatic variants are disease-specific in CLD and point to disease-associated mechanisms.

40065146	Mitochondrial genetics, signalling and stress responses.	Mitochondria are multifaceted organelles with crucial roles in energy generation, cellular signalling and a range of synthesis pathways. The study of mitochondrial biology is complicated by its own small genome, which is matrilineally inherited and not subject to recombination, and present in multiple, possibly different, copies. Recent methodological developments have enabled the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in large-scale cohorts and highlight the far-reaching impact of mitochondrial genetic variation. Genome-editing techniques have been adapted to target mtDNA, further propelling the functional analysis of mitochondrial genes. Mitochondria are finely tuned signalling hubs, a concept that has been expanded by advances in methodologies for studying the function of mitochondrial proteins and protein complexes. Mitochondrial respiratory complexes are of dual genetic origin, requiring close coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear gene-expression systems (transcription and translation) for proper assembly and function, and recent findings highlight the importance of the mitochondria in this bidirectional signalling.
40065140	Establishment and validation of a simple and accurate qPCR detection method for Haemophilus parasuis.	As an infectious disease that poses a significant threat to the rapidly growing pig breeding industry, the detection of Haemophilus parasuis (HPS) is often compromised by various interfering substances present in the test sample during quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The rapid detection of HPS is important for the isolation of infectious pigs and their treatment. We designed and optimized a rapid qPCR test to detect the INFB gene of HPS in clinical and environmental samples on pig farms. The method was evaluated for its specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, anti-interference capability, and its ability to detect HPS in clinical samples. The results indicated that the method was specific for the detection of HPS when evaluated against pathogens and intestinal probiotics found in pig farms. By using a seven-fold dilution series of the recombinant plasmid DNA in triplicate, it was determined that the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for this method was less than 10 copies/µL. The results of inter-batch and intra-batch repeatability tests showed that the coefficient of variation (CV) was consistently below 1%. Furthermore, the impact of 14 endogenous and exogenous interfering substances on the Ct values detected by the HPS qPCR was found to be less than 5% when compared to the Ct values obtained in the absence of interfering substances. A total of 248 clinical samples were analyzed using the HPS qPCR, commercial kits, and corresponding national standards, yielding positive rates of 9.27%, 6.05%, and 9.27%, respectively. Notably, the positive and negative percent agreement between the detection method developed in this research and the national standard was 100%. These findings demonstrate that the established detection method is suitable for epidemiological research on HPS and for diagnosing clinical samples containing interfering substances, thereby providing essential technical support for the prevention and control of HPS.

40065134	Bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria accelerate injury-induced mucosal healing in the colon.	Host-microbiome communication is frequently perturbed in gut pathologies due to microbiome dysbiosis, leading to altered production of bacterial metabolites. Among these, 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids are notably diminished in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Herein, we investigated whether restoration of 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids levels by Clostridium scindens, a human-derived 7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, can reestablish intestinal epithelium homeostasis following colon injury. Gnotobiotic and conventional mice were subjected to chemically-induced experimental colitis following administration of Clostridium scindens. Colonization enhanced the production of 7α-dehydroxylated bile acids and conferred prophylactic and therapeutic protection against colon injury through epithelial regeneration and specification. Computational analysis of human datasets confirmed defects in intestinal cell renewal and differentiation in ulcerative colitis patients while expression of genes involved in those pathways showed a robust positive correlation with 7α-dehydroxylated bile acid levels. Clostridium scindens administration could therefore be a promising biotherapeutic strategy to foster mucosal healing following colon injury by restoring bile acid homeostasis.
40065108	Adrenocortical stem cells in health and disease.	The adrenal cortex is the major site of production of steroid hormones, which are essential for life. The normal development and homeostatic renewal of the adrenal cortex depend on capsular stem cells and cortical progenitor cells. These cell populations are highly plastic and support adaptation to physiological demands, injury and disease, linking steroid production and adrenal (organ) homeostasis with systemic endocrine cues and organismal homeostasis. This Review integrates findings from the past decade, outlining the mechanisms that govern the establishment and maintenance of the adrenal stem cell niche under different physiological and pathological conditions. The sophisticated regulation of the stem cell niche by gene regulatory networks, coordinated through paracrine and endocrine signalling, is highlighted in a context-dependent and sex-specific manner. We discuss how dysregulation of this intricate regulatory network is implicated in a wide range of adrenal diseases, and how emerging knowledge from adrenal stem cell research is inspiring the future development of gene-based and cell-based therapeutic strategies.
40065106	A nationwide comprehensive genomic profiling and molecular tumor board platform for patients with advanced cancer.	The Belgian Approach for Local Laboratory Extensive Tumor Testing (BALLETT) study assessed the feasibility of using comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in clinical decision-making for patients with advanced cancers. This multi-center study enrolled 872 patients from 12 Belgian hospitals. CGP was performed on tumor tissues using a standardized CGP panel (523 genes) across nine laboratories with success in 93% of patients and a median turnaround time of 29 days. Actionable genomic markers were identified in 81% of patients, substantially higher than the 21% using nationally reimbursed, small panels. A national molecular tumor board (nMTB) recommended treatments for 69% of patients, with 23% receiving matched therapies. Reasons for non-compliance were highly variable across clinical sites. Overall, BALLETT demonstrates the feasibility of implementing decentralized CGP and its potential to identify actionable targets in most patients with advanced cancers. BALLETT reinforces CGP's utility and emphasizes the importance of collaboration, standardization, and addressing implementation challenges.
40065081	Compensatory lymphangiogenesis is required for edema resolution in zebrafish.	Edema, characterized by the accumulation of interstitial fluid, poses significant challenges in various pathological conditions. Lymphangiogenesis is critical in edema clearance, and delayed or inadequate lymphatic responses significantly hinder healing processes. However, real-time observation of dynamic changes in lymphangiogenesis during tissue repair in animal models has been challenging, leaving the mechanisms behind compensatory lymphatic activation for edema clearance largely unexplored. To address this gap, we subjected zebrafish larvae to osmotic stress using hypertonic (375 mOsm/L) and isotonic (37.5 mOsm/L) solutions to induce osmotic imbalance and subsequent edema formation. Intravital imaging of vascular transgenic larvae revealed significant lymphatic vessel remodeling during tissue edema. The observed increase in lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells, alongside the sustained expansion and remodeling of primary lymphatics, indicates active lymphangiogenesis during the recovery phase. We developed a novel method employing translating ribosome affinity purification to analyze the translatome of lymphatic and venous endothelial cells in vivo, which uncovered the upregulation of key pro-lymphangiogenic genes, particularly vegfr2 and vegfr3, during tissue recovery. Inhibition of compensatory lymphangiogenesis impaired edema fluid clearance and tissue recovery. Our findings establish a new model for in vivo live imaging of compensatory lymphangiogenesis and provide a novel approach in investigating lymphatic activation during edema resolution.
40065073	Single cell transcriptomic analysis of SGLT2 expression supports an indirect or off-target role for the cardioprotective benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure.	Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), such as empagliflozin, have shown remarkable benefits in reducing cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with heart failure irrespective of diabetes. Because of the magnitude of the benefits and broad application in both heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction, there have been concerted efforts to identify a mechanism for the observed benefits. One hypothesis is that SGLT2i act directly on the heart. Given empagliflozin's high specificity to SGLT2, we reasoned that SGLT2 expression would be a requirement for cells to respond to treatment via the expected drug target. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of SLC5A2, which encodes SGLT2 at the single cell level in multiple datasets from healthy and HF donors, confirming its expression in a subset of kidney epithelial cells but minimal expression in other cell types. This was true irrespective of developmental stage, disease state, sequencing method or depth, and species. Therefore, it is likely that the cardioprotective benefits of SGLT2i cannot be explained by "canonical" interactions with SGLT2.
40065071	MicroRNA 320a-3p up-regulation reduces PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer cells: an experimental and bioinformatic study.	Growing evidence suggests that dysregulated microRNAs were critical in the development of tumors and the progression number of malignancies. This research aimed to check the effect of microRNA 320a-3p transfection on gastric cancer (GC) cell lines. Following transfection, the efficacy was determined by the RT-PCR method. After that, MTT, scratch assay, DAPI staining, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry were used respectively. The results demonstrated that the viability of GC cells considerably decreased following transfection. Moreover, microRNA 320a-3p transfection significantly suppressed cell migration and induced apoptosis in these cells. We found that transfection of microRNA 320a-3p remarkably decreased PD-L1 gene expression and influenced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related and apoptotic gene expressions. The findings propose that microRNA 320a-3p could decrease cell proliferation and migration and induce apoptosis by increasing TP53 and CASP3 expression levels in GC cells. Notably, microRNA 320a-3p might be a potential target in GC immunotherapy by suppressing the PD-L1 gene expression.
40065065	The m6A reader IGF2BP3 promotes HCC progression by enhancing MCM10 stability.	Abnormal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications were associated with the occurrence, development, and metastasis of cancer. However, the functions and mechanisms of m6A regulators in cancer remained largely elusive and should be explored. Here, we identified that insulin like growth Factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) was specifically overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, IGF2BP3 promoted HCC cells progression in an m6A-dependent manner, IGF2BP3 silencing significantly inhibited proliferation and migratory ability of tumor cells in vitro and in in vivo. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 interacted with minichromosomal maintenance complex component (MCM10) mRNAs to prolong stability of m6A-modified RNA. Therefore, our findings indicated that m6A reader IGF2BP3 contributed to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis, providing a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.
40065062	Population genetic structure and historical demography of Saccostrea echinata in the Northern South China sea and Beibu Gulf.	Marine invertebrates, such as oysters, were once thought to form large, panmictic populations with little genetic differentiation due to their high reproductive capacity and dual life stages. However, recent studies have shown significant genetic structuring and moderate gene flow across populations, influenced by factors like ocean currents, historical climate events, and environmental changes. The black-lip oyster (Saccostrea echinata), with its extensive dispersal potential, is ideal for population genetics studies. In current study, mitochondrial DNA (COI gene) was utilized to investigate the population structure, genetic diversity, and demographic history of S. echinata in the northern South China Sea (NSCS) and Beibu Gulf. Results revealed high genetic diversity with 82 haplotypes from 190 specimens, a star-shaped haplotype network, and significant genetic differentiation, with most variation occurring within populations. Genetic analysis identified three distinct genetic groups across the sampled regions. Historical demographic analysis indicated population expansion approximately 44-155 Kya after the Last Glacial Maximum. Genetic structure was shaped by historical climatic events causing isolation and secondary contact, as well as contemporary ocean currents influencing gene flow. The study highlights the complex interplay of genetic diversity, population structure, and historical dynamics in S. echinata, with implications for conservation and aquaculture in the Asia-Pacific region.

40065044	Transcriptome combined with single-cell sequencing explored prognostic markers associated with T cell exhaustion characteristics in head and neck squamous carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) ranks among the most prevalent cancers worldwide, characterized by significant heterogeneity and a complex immune microenvironment. T cell exhaustion is pivotal in the pathogenesis of HNSC, where depleted T cells exhibit reduced proliferative capacity and diminished effector function, facilitating tumor immune escape and subsequent disease progression. A thorough understanding of the primary mechanisms driving T cell depletion within the tumor microenvironment is essential for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches in HNSC, with profound implications for patient outcomes. In this study, a single-cell atlas of HNSC was constructed, enabling an in-depth analysis of T cell heterogeneity. The differentiation trajectory of T cells, transitioning from normal tissue to HNSC, was characterized, revealing a predisposition toward depletion in the C2 T cell subgroup. A subsequent cross-analysis of significantly upregulated differentially expressed genes in the C2 T cell subset identified five characteristics pertinent to T cell C2, which informed the development of a clinical prognostic model. Additionally, maximum half inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values for various pharmacological agents were calculated, leading to the identification of eleven drugs relevant to the risk model, providing an intriguing starting point for further work in personalized cancer treatment. However, certain limitations of this study must be acknowledged. While T cell heterogeneity and differentiation trajectories were mapped, the interrelationships among these subpopulations remain poorly understood. Further research is required to elucidate the specific biological processes and molecular evolutionary mechanisms involved. The insights from this study provide a valuable foundation for future investigations into the molecular mechanisms and immune landscape associated with the progression from normal tissue to malignant squamous cell carcinoma.
40065040	Cloning and expression analysis of RhHsf24 gene in Rose (Rosa hybrida).	Rose (Rosa hybrida) is one of the most important ornamental and perfume industry crops worldwide, both economically and culturally. Abiotic stresses, such as high temperature and salt are crucial factors influencing the quality of roses. In this study, RhHsf24 was isolated from rose (R. hybrida 'Samantha'), which encodes 295 amino acids (aa). Sequence comparison with members of Arabidopsis Hsfs family revealed that this gene is most closely related to AtHsfB1; phylogenetic tree analysis with proteins from other species showed that it clusters with R. rugosa (RrHSF24), Fragaria vesca (FvHSFB1a) and Argentina anserina (AaHSF24), which are the closest relatives and belong to the class B heat shock transcription factors. RhHsf24 was localized in the nucleus. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the gene was expressed in roots, stems, leaves, flowers and buds. Expression analysis of the gene in leaves subjected to various temperatures and durations of heat stress treatment demonstrated that RhHsf24 gene expression is induced by heat stress. Under salt stress, the expression of the RhHsf24 gene generally exhibited a high level of expression with increasing concentration. The above results preliminarily clarified the biological function of RhHsf24, and provide a genetic resource and theoretical reference for the resistance breeding of roses.
40065038	Advancing sepsis diagnosis and immunotherapy machine learning-driven identification of stable molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets.	Sepsis represents a significant global health challenge, necessitating early detection and effective treatment for improved outcomes. While traditional inflammatory markers facilitate the diagnosis of sepsis, the aspect of immune suppression remains poorly addressed. This study aimed to identify critical immune-related genes (IIRGs) associated with sepsis through genomic analysis and machine learning techniques, thereby enhancing diagnostic and treatment response predictions. Analyses of two extensive datasets were conducted, identifying significant immune genes using the ESTIMATE algorithm, Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), and five machine learning methods. Prediction models were constructed and validated using six machine learning algorithms, achieving high accuracy (AUC > 0.75). Eleven key IIRGs were identified as active in immune pathways, such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and were significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration in sepsis. Additionally, drug sensitivity analysis indicated that IIRGs correlated with responses to anticancer drugs. These results underscore the potential of these genes in enhancing sepsis diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the imperative for further validation across diverse populations.
40065031	Responses of rice plant to multiple abiotic stresses revealed by transcriptome meta-analysis and identification of novel genetic factors.	Plant responses to abiotic stresses have a complex polygenic nature including main and epistatic genetic factors. Several tolerant rice varieties were subjected to drought, salt and cold stresses and their transcriptomic responses were evaluated using affymetrix probe set. Meta-analysis of standardized microarray data was conducted to identify specific and common genes responding to multiple abiotic stresses. 375 and 298 genes were up- and downregulated under drought stress, 281 and 313 genes were up- and downregulated under salt stress, and 1,273 and 2,996 genes were up- and downregulated under cold stress. In addition to many specific genes for each stress condition, common genes were identified for response to drought and salt (n=91), drought and cold (n=121), and salt and cold (n=108), while 14 genes were common for response to all 3 stresses. 12 out of 14 genes were downregulated under the 3 stresses; however, only 2 upregulated genes (including an auxin-responsive protein and a LRR protein) were common among the 3 stresses. One of the common downregulated genes is a non-ABC transporter belonging to proton-dependent oligopeptide transport (POT) family protein which is novel and has a vital role in uptake of nutrients, particularly nitrate, and in recognizing plant defense compounds and hormones. In addition, two other non-ABC transporters (OsAAP7C and OsGT1) were identified which were downregulated under drought, salinity and cold stresses. This finding can explain why and how the uptake of necessary nutrients for growth and development of plants decreases under these oxidative stresses. Another novel downregulated gene under the 3 stresses is a TraB-related protein with vital role for normal mitochondrial function. These results open new insights into genetic engineering and molecular breeding of plants for tolerance to abiotic stresses.
40065020	Long-term macular atrophy growth in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: influential factors and role of genetic variants.	This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the long-term growth and associated risk factors of macular atrophy (MA) in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) compounds.
40065011	Building a hereditary cancer program in Colombia: analysis of germline pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants spectrum in a high-risk cohort.	Genetic studies in Latin America have expanded, but further efforts are needed to understand cancer susceptibility genes beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2, especially by characterizing the prevalence and spectrum of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (PVs) in the region. This study aimed to determine the frequency of hereditary cancer syndromes (HCS) in Colombians with solid tumors and to characterize the spectrum of PVs. Using data from the Colombia's largest Institutional Hereditary Cancer Program, we included patients aged ≥18 years with solid tumors who met HCS criteria and were offered genetic testing with a 105-cancer gene panel. We calculated the prevalence of PVs and HCS by cancer type (beyond breast) and gene. For patients with breast cancer, we examined genotype-phenotype correlations with molecular subtypes and stratified positivity rates by different genetic testing criteria. Among 769 patients, we identified 216 PVs in 43 genes in 197 patients (26%). Thirty-three PVs were recurrent. Autosomal HCS was found in 21% (160/769) of patients (159 dominant, one recessive), while 5% (37/769) were heterozygous carriers of PVs in autosomal recessive genes. In 42% (321/769) of the cases, only one or more variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were identified, whereas 33% (251/769) had neither PVs nor VUS detected (negative results). HCS prevalence varied by cancer type (11-26%). The triple-negative subtype and bilateral presentation were strong predictors of inherited breast cancer. Our study reveals a significant presence of PVs among high-risk Colombian patients with solid tumors, underscoring the importance of genetic counseling and testing in the region.
40065010	EMD missense variant causes X-linked isolated dilated cardiomyopathy with myocardial emerin deficiency.	Pathogenic variants in the EMD gene cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy type 1 (EDMD1), typically presenting with joint contractures and skeletal muscle atrophy, followed by atrial arrhythmias, cardiac conduction defects, and atrial dilatation. Although an association with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been suggested, evidence is currently insufficient to verify the gene-disease association. We investigated the causality of a missense variant, c.23C>G, p.Ser8Trp, in EMD in a large family with a history of DCM and suspected sudden cardiac death (SCD) in males. DCM was diagnosed in six hemizygous males aged 36-50 and detailed phenotyping identified end-stage heart failure, cardiac conduction defects, and ventricular arrhythmias as prominent features. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed late gadolinium enhancement with mixed ischemic and non-ischemic patterns. Muscular dystrophy was absent in all six males, of whom five underwent neuromuscular examination including serum-creatine kinase measurement. Immunohistochemical analysis showed greatly reduced levels of emerin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle samples. The EMD variant c.23C>G co-segregated with DCM, with an estimated LOD score of 3.9 and full-likelihood Bayes factor of >2500:1 in favor of causality. Among the 17 heterozygous females, ages 20-87, one developed DCM at age 72. We concluded that the EMD c.23C>G missense variant is associated with DCM in the absence of muscular dystrophy, thereby providing new evidence of isolated DCM as a distinct cardiac EMD-phenotype, separate from EDMD1. The phenotypic similarities with LMNA-DCM, with a high risk of cardiac conduction defects and ventricular arrhythmias, might warrant early interventions to prevent SCD.
40065004	Poly-γ-glutamic acid alleviates slow transit constipation by regulating aquaporin and gut microbes.	Slow transit constipation (STC) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder caused by colon dysfunction. Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), an anionic polymer known for its moisture retention, degradability, and food safety, was studied for its effects on loperamide-induced STC in mice. Treatment with γ-PGA for one week significantly increased both defecation frequency and fecal water content, with the high-dose group (10 g/kg/d) restoring fecal water content to 34.23%, outperforming the low- (16.16%) and medium-dose (27.08%) groups and exceeding the positive control, PEG, by 1.35 times. γ-PGA enhanced intestinal peristalsis and reduced the expression of inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, caspase-1, TLR2) and water-electrolyte transport genes (AQP3, AQP4, ENaC-β), while improving the expression of tight junction proteins (Claudin-1, Occludin, ZO-1) damaged by loperamide. Histopathological analyses confirmed γ-PGA's capacity to repair intestinal damage. Additionally, Western Blot analysis indicated reduced AQP3/4 levels in the colon, and molecular docking showed good binding affinity between γ-PGA and AQPs. γ-PGA also positively altered gut microbiota composition. Overall, γ-PGA shows promise in treating STC by modulating aquaporins and gut microbiota.
40064976	Protective effects of Rosa roxburghii Tratt. extract against UVB-induced inflammaging through inhibiting the IL-17 pathway.	Chronic inflammation is a critical mechanism contributing to the aging process; however, research specifically addressing chronic inflammation in skin biology remains limited. This study investigates the protective mechanism of Rosa roxburghii Tratt. (RRT) extract against UVB-induced inflammaging. RRT extract effectively reduces the secretion of IL-6, IL-1α, TNF-α, and PGE2 in keratinocytes. Additionally, it attenuates UVB-induced IL-17 pathway activation by downregulating IL-17RA, c-Fos, and c-Jun protein levels, as well as the gene expression of IL-17RA, TRAF6, HSP90, and IKKγ. Co-culturing human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) with inflammatory factors secreted by UVB-exposed keratinocytes reveals that these factors significantly reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby promoting aging in HFF. The anti-inflammaging effects of RRT extract are achieved through the reduction of β-galactosidase activity, targeting of the TGF-β1-Smad2/3 signaling pathway, upregulation of COL1A1 expression, and reduction of senescence-associated secretory phenotype secretion. This study provides a novel perspective and robust scientific foundation for exploring mechanisms of skin aging and potential therapeutic interventions.
40064975	Investigating ferroptosis-related genes NFE2L2 in neutrophils for ankylosing spondylitis: therapeutic potential of cassia twigs.	We determined the relationship between ferroptosis and immune cells in ankylosing spondylitis and the role of the Chinese herbal medicine Cassia twigs in treating ankylosing spondylitis. We analyzed clinical data on ankylosing spondylitis, transcriptome data, single-cell sequencing data, and genes related to ferroptosis and Cassia twigs. Clinical variables related to AS were selected through logistic regression analysis of the clinical data combined with machine learning. GSEA and enrichment analysis were performed on genes related to ferroptosis, combined with transcriptome data and drug-related genes, to identify the key genes and drug targets related to AS, as well as, the key immune cells. Then, the single-cell data and cell subtypes were analyzed. Finally, the interconnections between immune cells were analyzed through intercellular communication. Five variables, including neutrophils, were screened for clinical data analysis. The AUC of the experimental group was 0.859 and that of the validation group was 0.807. Ferroptosis gene NFE2L2 was identified as the final drug target of AS; it was upregulated in AS and downregulated in the control group by immunohistochemical verification, both of which were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Neutrophils were divided into two subgroups: high expression of NFE2L2 and low expression of NFE2L2. Through molecular docking, Cassia twigs were found to effectively act on the ferroptosis gene NFE2L2. Neutrophils act as important immune cells in AS. The twigs of the Chinese herb Cassia can treat AS by acting on the protein structure of the ferroptosis gene NFE2L2.
40064955	Integrative single cell transcriptomic analysis reveals 3p deletion associated tumor microenvironment and chemoresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a prevalent and lethal malignancy, with a five-year survival rate of just 50% for cases of locally advanced disease. Chromosomal aberrations, particularly the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p), have been strongly associated with poor prognosis and more aggressive tumor phenotypes. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy. This study aims to elucidate the impact of 3p deletion on the TME, immune cell infiltration, and treatment response in HNSCC, to identify novel therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and bulk transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Pseudo-time trajectory and cell-cell communication analyses were performed with the Monocle and CellChat packages. The Wilcoxon test was used to evaluate the differential gene expression between wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut) groups. Prognostic models were developed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm and Cox regression analyses to find the genes related to survival, with survival analysis conducted via Kaplan-Meier curves. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was employed to investigate pathway dysregulation, and immune cell infiltration was assessed using various immune scoring methodologies to explore the differences immune environment. The Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) database was utilized to predict the potential efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. mRNA and protein expression levels of SPP1 were examined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, while cell proliferation was assessed using the CCK8 assay. The mut group demonstrated significant alterations in cellular composition, characterized by increased endothelial cells and macrophages and decreased fibroblasts and CD8 + T cells, indicative of an immunosuppressive TME. Differential expression analysis revealed downregulation of immune pathways, including antigen processing and presentation, T cell receptor signaling, and B cell receptor signaling pathways in the mut group, along with enhanced metabolic activity in glycolysis and lipid metabolism. The prognostic model identified nine key genes associated with poor survival in HNSCC. The mut group exhibited poorer overall survival and a more immunosuppressive microenvironment compared to the wt group, which correlated with the outcomes observed in high-risk versus low-risk groups. High-risk patients also showed a diminished response to immunotherapy compared to low-risk patients. Additionally, SPP1 emerged as a critical gene associated with chemotherapy resistance and macrophage M2 polarization. This study demonstrates that 3p deletion significantly reshapes the TME, contributing to poor prognosis in HNSCC by fostering an immunosuppressive environment and enhancing chemoresistance. These findings highlight the potential for developing targeted therapies that address the genetic and immunological landscape of HNSCC.
40064941	Chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of pawak croaker (Pennahia pawak).	The diversity of fish coloration is a fascinating scientific question. The pawak croaker (Pennahia pawak) is distinguished by its silver-white colour, setting it apart from other Sciaenidae species. However, the genomic information of this genus remains largely unexplored. This study aims to advance our understanding by assembling and annotating the genome of P. pawak at the chromosome level using multi-platform sequencing data. The assembled genome size of P. pawak is 613.02 Mb, closely matching the estimated size of 570.32 Mb from 21-mer analysis. The assembly features a scaffold N50 of 27.09 Mb, with 24 chromosomes successfully constructed using Hi-C technology, achieving a mounting rate of 99.31%. Genome annotation revealed that 26.20% of the genome consists of repetitive sequences and identified 26,361 protein-coding genes, of which 25,885 have functional annotations. This chromosome-level genome assembly of P. pawak provides valuable resources for comparative genomic studies within the Sciaenidae family and offers foundational data for researchers to understand its unique silver-white pigmentation.
40064935	Diversity of ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer stem cells attained using selective culture techniques.	Breast cancer stem cells are a promising therapeutic target in cancer. We explored breast cancer stem cell diversity and establish a methodology for selectively culturing breast cancer stem cells. We collected breast cancer tissues from surgical samples of treatment-naïve patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Following isolation, cells were subjected to spheroid culture on non-adherent plates. Of the 57 cases, successful culture was achieved in 48 cases, among which the average ratio of CD44+/CD24- breast cancer cells increased from 13.8% in primary tumors to 61.6% in spheroids. A modest number of spheroid cells successfully engrafted in mice and subsequently re-differentiated within the murine environment, confirming their stemness. ER expression in spheroid cells exhibited negative conversion in 52.1% of cases. The proportion of Twist-, Snail-, and Vimentin-positive cells increased from 43.8%, 12.9%, and 7.7-75.0%, 58.1%, and 37.7%, respectively. ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer stem cells were classified into two groups using DNA microarrays. Gene Ontology analysis unveiled higher expression of immune response-related genes in one group and protein binding-associated genes in the other. We demonstrated stable and selective culture of breast cancer stem cells from patient-derived breast cancer tissue using spheroid cultures.
40064933	Relating the molecular phenotype of ulcerative colitis to the clinical course.	The expanding portfolio of targeted therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC) suggests that a more precise approach to defining disease activity will aid clinical decision-making. This prospective study used genome-wide microarrays to characterize gene expression in biopsies from the most inflamed colon segments from patients with UC and analyzed associations between molecular changes and short-term outcomes while on standard-of-care treatment. We analyzed 141 biopsies-128 biopsies from 112 UC patients and 13 biopsies from eight inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) patients. Endoscopic disease was associated with expression of innate immunity transcripts, e.g. complement factor B (CFB); inflammasome genes (ZBP1 and PIM2); calprotectin (S100A8 and S100A9); and inflammation-, injury-, and innate immunity-associated pathway analysis terms. A cross-validated molecular machine learning classifier trained on the endoscopic Mayo subscore predicted the endoscopic Mayo subscore with area-under-the-curve of 0.85. A molecular calprotectin transcript score showed strong associations with fecal calprotectin and the endoscopic Mayo subscore. Logistic regression models showed that molecular features (e.g. molecular classifier and molecular calprotectin scores) improved the prediction of disease progression over conventional, clinical features alone (e.g. total Mayo score, fecal calprotectin, physician global assessment). The molecular features of UC showed strong correlations with disease activity and permitted development of machine-learning predictive disease classifiers that can be applied to expanded testing in diverse cohorts.
40064932	Enzyme-activating B-cell receptors boost antigen presentation to pathogenic T cells in gluten-sensitive autoimmunity.	Autoantibodies against the enzyme transglutaminase 3 (TG3) are characteristic to the gluten-sensitive skin disorder dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), which is an extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease. We here demonstrate that TG3-specific B cells can activate gluten-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated internalization of TG3-gluten enzyme-substrate complexes. Stereotypic anti-TG3 antibodies using IGHV2-5/IGKV4-1 gene segments enhance the catalytic activity of TG3, and this effect translates into increased gluten presentation to T cells when such antibodies are expressed as BCRs. The crystal structure of TG3 bound to an IGHV2-5/IGKV4-1 Fab shows that antibody binding to a β-sheet in the catalytic core domain causes the enzyme to adopt the active conformation. This mechanism explains the production of stereotypic anti-TG3 autoantibodies in DH and highlights a role for TG3-specific B cells as antigen-presenting cells for gluten-specific T cells. Similar boosting effects of autoreactive BCRs could be relevant for other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.
40064919	Competitive antagonism of KAT7 crotonylation against acetylation affects procentriole formation and colorectal tumorigenesis.	Accurate procentriole formation is critical for centriole duplication. However, the holistic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we show that KAT7 crotonylation, facilitated by the crotonyltransferase hMOF, competes against its acetylation regulated by the deacetylase HDAC2 at the K432 residue upon DNA damage stimulation. This competition diminishes its histone acetyltransferase activity, leading to the inhibition of procentriole formation in colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, the reduction of KAT7 histone acetyltransferase activity by the antagonistic effect of KAT7 crotonylation against its acetylation decreases the gene expression associated with procentriole formation by modulating the enrichment of H3K14ac at their promoters and plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Furthermore, KAT7 crotonylation and acetylation are associated with the prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unidentified role of KAT7 in the regulation of procentriole formation and colorectal tumorigenesis via competitive antagonism of its crotonylation against acetylation.
40064914	DNA lesions can frequently precede DNA:RNA hybrid accumulation.	While DNA:RNA hybrids contribute to multiple genomic transactions, their unscheduled formation is a recognized source of DNA lesions. Here, through a suite of systematic screens, we rather observed that a wide range of yeast mutant situations primarily triggering DNA damage actually leads to hybrid accumulation. Focusing on Okazaki fragment processing, we establish that genic hybrids can actually form as a consequence of replication-born discontinuities such as unprocessed flaps or unligated Okazaki fragments. Strikingly, such "post-lesion" DNA:RNA hybrids neither detectably contribute to genetic instability, nor disturb gene expression, as opposed to "pre-lesion" hybrids formed upon defective mRNA biogenesis, e.g., in THO complex mutants. Post-lesion hybrids similarly arise in distinct genomic instability situations, triggered by pharmacological or genetic manipulation of DNA-dependent processes, both in yeast and human cells. Altogether, our data establish that the accumulation of transcription-born DNA:RNA hybrids can occur as a consequence of various types of natural or pathological DNA lesions, yet do not necessarily aggravate their genotoxicity.
40064910	A Chromosome-level genome assembly of the American bullfrog (Aquarana catesbeiana).	The American bullfrog (Aquarana catesbeiana) is both an economically important aquaculture species and a globally distributed invasive organism with high environmental adaptability. In this study, we present a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly for the species, comprising 13 chromosomes with a total length of 6.32 Gb and a scaffold N50 of 691.8 Mb. Genome completeness was evaluated at 95.5% using BUSCO and 99.9% using Merqury. Repetitive sequences accounted for 79.51% of the genome. Through a combination of RNA-seq, Ab initio and homology-based gene prediction, we identified 32,382 protein-coding genes, with 98.96% of these genes functionally annotated. This chromosome-level assembly provides an important resource for future studies on the evolution, functional genomics and molecular breeding of the American bullfrog.

40064893	Chromosome-level genome assembly of Jaguar guapote (Parachromis manguensis) by massive parallel sequencing.	Parachromis managuensis is a native cichlid fish from Central America and is the most commonly traded species within its genus. This study presents the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of P. managuensis using PacBio HiFi long reads and Hi-C sequencing data. The size of the P. managuensis genome is approximately 896.66 Mb, with a scaffold N50 of 38.19 Mb. The assembled genome demonstrates high quality in terms of completeness and accuracy, with a BUSCO score of 98.85% and a quality value (QV) of 50.95. A total of 888.60 Mb (99.10%) sequences were anchored to 24 pseudochromosomes. Additionally, 21,145 protein-coding genes and 325.58 Mb (~36.31%) repetitive sequences were identified. This chromosome-level genome assembly provides a crucial reference for studying the evolution and ecological adaptability of P. managuensis.
40064891	Suppression of stress granule formation is a vulnerability imposed by mutant p53.	Missense mutations in the TP53 (p53) gene have been linked to malignant progression. However, our in-silico analyses reveal that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with mutant p53 (mutp53) have better overall survival compared to those with p53-null (p53<sup>null</sup>) HCC, unlike other cancer types. Given the historical use of sorafenib (SOR) monotherapy for advanced HCC, we hypothesize that mutp53 increases sensitivity to SOR, a multikinase inhibitor that induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here we show that mutp53 inhibits stress granule (SG) formation by binding to an ER stress sensor, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and a key SG component, GAP SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), contributing to increased sensitivity of SG-competent cells and xenografts to ER stress inducers including SOR. Our study identifies a unique vulnerability imposed by mutp53, suggesting mutp53 as a biomarker for ER stress-inducing agents and highlighting the importance of SG inhibition for cancer treatment.
40064889	Discovery of the widespread site-specific single-stranded nuclease family Ssn.	Site-specific endonucleases that exclusively cut single-stranded DNA have hitherto never been described and constitute a barrier to the development of ssDNA-based technologies. We identify and characterize one such family, from the GIY-YIG superfamily, of widely distributed site-specific single-stranded nucleases (Ssn) exhibiting unique ssDNA cleavage properties. By first comprehensively studying the Ssn homolog from Neisseria meningitidis, we demonstrate that it interacts specifically with a sequence (called NTS) present in hundreds of copies and surrounding important genes in pathogenic Neisseria. In this species, NTS/Ssn interactions modulate natural transformation and thus constitute an additional mechanism shaping genome dynamics. We further identify thousands of Ssn homologs and demonstrate, in vitro, a range of Ssn nuclease specificities for their corresponding sequence. We demonstrate proofs of concept for applications including ssDNA detection and digestion of ssDNA from RCA. This discovery and its applications set the stage for the development of innovative ssDNA-based molecular tools and technologies.
40064881	In vivo prime editing rescues photoreceptor degeneration in nonsense mutant retinitis pigmentosa.	The next-generation gene editing tool, prime editing (PE), is adept at correcting point mutations precisely with high editing efficiency and rare off-target events and shows promising therapeutic value in treating hereditary diseases. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common type of inherited retinal dystrophy and is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptors and, consequently, visual decline. To date, effective treatments for RP are lacking. Herein, a PE system is designed to target the PDE6B Y347X mutation in the rd1 mouse strain, a preclinical RP model. We screen and develop the PE system with epegRNA and RT<sup>ΔRnH</sup>, which is delivered via dual-AAV in vivo with an editing efficiency of 26.47 ± 13.35%, with negligible off-target effects confirmed by AID-Seq and PE-tag. Treatment with the PE system in vivo greatly restores PDE6B protein expression and protects rod cells from degeneration. Mouse behavioural experiments also show that compared with no treatment, prime editing inhibits vision deterioration in littermate rd1 mice. This study provides a therapeutic opportunity for the use of PE to correct mutated RPs at the genomic level.
