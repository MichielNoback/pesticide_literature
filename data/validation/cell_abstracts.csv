40066698	Single-cell profiling reveals the intratumor heterogeneity and immunosuppressive microenvironment in cervical adenocarcinoma.	Cervical adenocarcinoma (ADC) is more aggressive compared to other types of cervical cancer (CC), such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and tumor heterogeneity are recognized as pivotal factors in cancer progression and therapy. However, the disparities in TIME and heterogeneity between ADC and SCC are poorly understood.

40066679	Advancing Tumor Microenvironment Analysis: A Fluorescence Nanosystem for Caspase-1 Monitoring and Synergistic Therapy.	The lack of precise, real-time analytical tools for monitoring tumor microenvironment changes during treatment hinders advancements in integrated diagnostic and therapeutic platforms. Traditional caspase-3 monitoring strategies are limited by their inability to address drug resistance and newly discovered apoptotic pathways, leading to reduced accuracy and practicality. To overcome these limitations, we developed a fluorescence-based "Trojan horse" nanosystem, PFpR@CM, featuring high-sensitivity Caspase-1 detection, tumor-targeted delivery, and photothermal therapy. Caspase-1 was selected as a biomarker due to its ability to provide accurate feedback on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The system employs Fe-doped polydopamine nanoparticles and red fluorescent carbon quantum dots (RCQDs) as the analytical core, achieving a detection limit of 0.024 U/mL for Caspase-1 with a linear range of 0.05-1.0 U/mL. By integrating MG-63 cell membrane camouflage, PFpR@CM ensures tumor specificity and immune evasion, allowing precise in situ monitoring of ROS production during ferroptosis. Experimental results demonstrate that the system enables simultaneous real-time fluorescence tracking and localized therapeutic interventions, achieving over 80% tumor volume reduction in vivo with minimal systemic toxicity. This work establishes a novel analytical chemistry approach for multifunctional tumor monitoring and treatment, providing an innovative solution to challenges in precision oncology.

Tumor metastasis is one of the main causes of death in cancer patients; however, the mechanism controlling metastasis is unclear. The posttranscriptional regulation of metastasis-related genes mediated by AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 4A (Arid4a), an RNA-binding protein (RBP), has not been elucidated.
40066673	Towards high-temperature fuel cells using sulfonated-phosphonated poly(pentafluorostyrene).	Herein, we present a hybrid polymer material with phosphonic acid and sulfonic acid moieties on a poly(pentafluorostyrene) backbone utilizing the S<sub>N</sub>Ar Michaelis-Arbuzov and the <i>para</i>-fluoro-thiol reaction. Blending the hybrid material with a benzimidazole polymer yielded a mechanically stable membrane featuring proton conductivities up to three times higher than conventional Nafion N211 at temperatures above 120 °C.
40066672	Multifunctional Liposomes with Enhanced Stability for Imaging-Guided Cancer Chemodynamic and Photothermal Therapy.	Improvements in tumor therapy require a combination of strategies where targeted treatment is critical. We developed a new versatile nanoplatform, MA@E, that generates high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with effective photothermal conversions in the removal of tumors. Enhanced stability liposomes were employed as carriers to facilitate the uniform distribution and stable storage of encapsulated gold nanorods (AuNRs) and Mn-MIL-100 metal-organic frameworks, with efficient delivery of MA@E to the cytoplasm. In the targeted phagocytosis of tumor cells, MA@E can effectively deplete the reduced glutathione (GSH) with increased hydroxyl radicals that combine with Mn<sup>2+</sup> released from Mn-MIL-100 to trigger Fenton-like reactions, generating ROS that induces cell apoptosis. Exposure to near-infrared (NIR-II) irradiation results in a AuNRs-induced thermogenic effect that expedites the release of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and promotes Fenton-like reactions, achieving increased production of <sup>•</sup>OH. In the murine tumor model, MA@E effectively removed the implanted tumor tissue within 2 days without any obvious toxic effects. This response is attributed to a synergism involving the photothermal capability of AuNRs and ROS chemodynamic treatment. The proposed MA@E provides a new approach to utilizing unstable nanomaterials in effective tumor therapy.
40066670	Ciliopathy due to genetic alterations of TULP3 as an uncommon cause of hepatorenocardiac fibrosis.	Hepatorenocardiac fibrosis is a group of rare, clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited disorders affecting the development and degenerative function of the liver and kidneys. It is associated with ciliopathies, a group of diseases characterized by dysfunction of the primary cilium, a key organelle in cell signaling. We present a clinical case of ciliopathy linked to a genetic alteration in the protein TULP3 (TUB Like Protein 3) as a cause of hepatorenocardiac fibrosis.
40066661	The Glutamate/GABA-Glutamine Cycle: Insights, Updates, and Advances.	Synaptic homeostasis of the principal neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA is tightly regulated by an intricate metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes known as the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle. In this cycle, astrocytes take up glutamate and GABA from the synapse and convert these neurotransmitters into glutamine. Astrocytic glutamine is subsequently transferred to neurons, serving as the principal precursor for neuronal glutamate and GABA synthesis. The glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle integrates multiple cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, uptake, synthesis, and metabolism. All of these processes are deeply interdependent and closely coupled to cellular energy metabolism. Astrocytes display highly active mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and several unique metabolic features, including glycogen storage and pyruvate carboxylation, which are essential to sustain continuous glutamine release. However, new roles of oligodendrocytes and microglia in neurotransmitter recycling are emerging. Malfunction of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle can lead to severe synaptic disruptions and may be implicated in several brain diseases. Here, I review central aspects and recent advances of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle to highlight how the cycle is functionally connected to critical brain functions and metabolism. First, an overview of glutamate, GABA, and glutamine transport is provided in relation to neurotransmitter recycling. Then, central metabolic aspects of the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the critical metabolic roles of glial cells. Finally, I discuss how aberrant neurotransmitter recycling is linked to neurodegeneration and disease, focusing on astrocyte metabolic dysfunction and brain lipid homeostasis as emerging pathological mechanisms. Instead of viewing the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle as individual biochemical processes, a more holistic and integrative approach is needed to advance our understanding of how neurotransmitter recycling modulates brain function in both health and disease.
40066659	Inhibition of HDAC4 in granulosa cells improved co-cultured oocyte maturation in vitro independent of LH in porcine.	In domestic animals, the mechanisms by which the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge induces oocyte meiosis resumption and maturation through follicular somatic cells remain unclear. Given the pivotal roles of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in regulating gametogenesis, this study investigated the roles of HDACs in follicular granulosa cells (GCs) in mediating LH action during oocyte maturation in pigs. The results showed that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) levels in cultured GCs increased in a time-dependent manner with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation but significantly decreased with LH treatment. The LH-induced reduction of HDAC4 was mediated by the accumulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which subsequently increased H3K18 acetylation and promoted the recruitment of SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) to the promoter of the EGF-like growth factor amphiregulin (Areg). Notably, specific inhibition of HDAC4 promoted oocyte maturation independently of LH in vitro, and the developmental potential of these matured oocytes was comparable to those induced by LH in vitro. In conclusion, HDAC4 in follicular somatic cells serves as a gonadotrophin-responsive epigenetic modification factor that negatively regulates oocyte meiosis resumption in pigs.
40066651	The Dual Role of Active Site Hydroxylated Residue in Peroxiredoxin Sulfinylation Catalysis.	<b><i>Aims:</i></b> Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are ubiquitous Cys peroxidases regulated by sulfinylation, a modification that occurs when the sulfenic acid generated on the catalytic Cys by peroxide reduction reacts with a second molecule of peroxide. In the Prx1 family, sulfinylation sensitivity is controlled by competition between a structural transition from a fully folded (FF) to locally unfolded (LU) conformation and the chemical step of sulfinylation. The initial peroxide reduction relies on a conserved catalytic hydroxylated residue that allows peroxide optimal activation. This study aimed at investigating the role of this catalytic residue in sulfinylation. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Sulfenate attack on peroxide was favored by one order of magnitude when a catalytic Thr was present, for yeast cytosolic Prx1-type enzymes, human Prx1 and yeast mitochondrial Prx, a Prx6-type enzyme. Furthermore, pKa determination supported the notion of electrostatic interaction between the catalytic hydroxyl and sulfenate intermediate. Finally, FF-LU transition kinetics was faster with a catalytic Thr, supporting that the hydroxyl group proximity to the nascent sulfenate group also promotes the FF-LU transition. <b><i>Innovation:</i></b> We identify a major mechanism that activates sulfinylation in hyperoxidation-sensitive Prxs from the Prx1 and Prx6 families. Furthermore, we show that the catalytic hydroxylated residue holds a dual role in regulating hyperoxidation sensitivity, by activating the sulfinylation reaction, while also promoting the competing FF to LU transition, thus acting as an important regulatory determinant. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The present work sets the basis for investigating other instances of Cys proteins regulated by sulfinylation, a modification increasingly recognized in cell redox regulation and signaling. <i>Antioxid.

40066628	Synergistic Effects of a Novel Multifunctional Bionic Scaffold and Electrical Stimulation Promote Bone Tissue Regeneration.	Electrical stimulation (ES) can effectively regulate cell behavior and promote bone tissue regeneration, and conductive biomaterials can further enhance this effect by enhancing the conduction of electrical signals between cells. In this study, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(l-lactide)-aniline pentamer triblock copolymer (PAP) were used as raw materials to prepare a conductive bionic scaffold (PLGA/PAP). Subsequently, bone morphogenetic protein 2 mimetic peptide containing a DOPA tag (DBMP2MP) was loaded on the scaffold surface. The prepared scaffold (DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP) had a porosity of 79.17% and a porous structure similar to that of natural cancellous bone. After PAP was added, the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the scaffold were increased to 2.79 ± 0.1 kPa and 1.29 ± 0.023 × 10<sup>-6</sup> s/cm. The addition of DBMP2MP significantly improved the hydrophilicity of the scaffold material, and the contact Angle of the scaffold material decreased from 102.45 ± 7.67° to 30.36 ± 5.25°. At the same time, DBMP2MP and scaffold surface bonding ability increased by two times compared with commercial BMP2. The polypeptide DBMP2MP can bind to the surface of scaffolds and exhibit long-lasting biological effects. In vitro cell experiments revealed that the DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP scaffold could significantly promote the proliferation and adhesion of MC3T3-E1 cells and that the combination of DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP with pulsed ES could further synergistically induce cell mineralization and osteogenic differentiation. The results of the rabbit radius defect experiments revealed that grafting the DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP scaffold at the defect site significantly promoted the formation of new bone and collagen fibers. When the DBMP2MP@PLGA/PAP scaffold was combined with ES, the regeneration rate of bone tissue further improved, and the newborn collagen tissue is close to normal bone collagen. Therefore, this bionic scaffold with excellent electrical and biological activity shows considerable potential in the field of bone defect repair.
40066620	Parallelized Droplet Vitrification for Single-Run Vitrification of Hepatocytes from an Entire Rat Liver.	Drug discovery pipelines rely on the availability of isolated primary hepatocytes for investigating potential hepatotoxicity prior to clinical application. These hepatocytes are isolated from livers rejected for transplantation and subsequently cryopreserved for later usage. The gold standard cryopreservation technique, slow-freezing, is a labor-intensive process with significant poststorage viability loss. In this work, we introduce parallelized droplet vitrification, a technique for high-volumetric, rapid vitrification of suspended cells. We show the utility of this technique through the single-run vitrification of the whole rat liver hepatocyte yield, resulting in the vitrification of 250 million cells in 40 mL of a vitrification solution at 10 mL/min. Additionally, we showed that these implementations maintained improved postpreservation outcomes in primary rat hepatocytes.
40066615	NTRK protein expression in NSCLC and its clinicopathological correlation.	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex disease with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics. Since the discovery of the oncogenic neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion in colorectal cancer in 1986, its understanding has gradually progressed. NTRK's relevance is crucial to understanding some tumor development and how specific tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitors (TRKI) work. <i>NTRK1, NTRK2,</i> and <i>NTRK3</i> (encoding the neurotrophin receptors TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, respectively) rearrangement induces high tumor transforming ability. This study investigates the clinical relevance of NTRK immunohistochemistry in NSCLC patients in a cohort of 482 patients from Karolinska University Hospital with detailed clinical and pathological studies. Immunohistochemical staining for NTRK expression was performed, and the results were correlated with patient demographics, histological subtypes, tumor extent, and staging. Our findings revealed that NTRK expression, predominantly membranous and cytoplasmic, was detected in 22 out of 482 cases (4.56%). Notably, NTRK expression was more frequently observed in squamous-cell carcinoma (SqCC) than in adenocarcinoma (AdCa). Clinical correlations indicated a significant association between NTRK expression and histologic subtypes (<i>p</i><0.001) and grade of differentiation (<i>p</i>=0.036). However, no significant correlations were observed with age, sex, tumor size, staging, or OS. NTRK immunohistochemistry represents a potential biomarker for a subset of NSCLC patients, particularly those with SqCC histology. Understanding the clinical implications of NTRK expression may contribute to personalized treatment strategies in NSCLC.
40066605	Noncontact Detection of Blood Coagulation Dynamics Based on Speckle Deviation Analysis Using Optical Coherence Tomography.	Red blood cells aggregate from individual cells into larger aggregates during blood coagulation. This process causes the light-scattering particles to enlarge and their motion to become restricted. The size and motion of these light-scattering particles during coagulation provide valuable information on the progress of blood coagulation. This paper proposes an optical coherence tomography speckle deviation (OCT-SD) method for the noncontact assessment of blood coagulation dynamics by detecting changes in the size and motion of scattering particles. The coagulation characteristics of static and flowing blood were quantitatively evaluated through coagulation reaction time and clot formation duration by monitoring the blood coagulation process. The OCT imaging, incorporating SD analysis, enables noncontact coagulation assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently and accurately assess coagulation dynamics, offering significant potential for in situ coagulation detection.

Alloimmunization to red blood cells (RBCs) presents a significant challenge in blood transfusion for individuals afflicted with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia. However, there is a scarcity of data regarding the prevalence of RBC alloimmunization in such patients in Saudi Arabia. To address this gap, a comprehensive meta-analysis was undertaken to ascertain the rate of RBC alloimmunization in SCD and thalassemia patients who receive regular transfusions in Saudi Arabia.
40066548	METTL7A as a New Candidate Biomarker in Gastric Cancer by Genomics and Data-Independent Acquisition Proteomic Analysis.

40066547	Immune-Related Adverse Event of Immunotherapy: Diabetes.	The development of immunotherapy has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of malignant tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) function by blocking the receptors and ligands of T cells from binding one another, empowering them to target and attack cancer cells. ICIs along with other immunotherapy treatments, have seen a significant increase in usage in recent years. However, this increased utilization has been accompanied by a significant rise in immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While the majority of irAEs reported are linked to endocrine dysfunction, less common irAES affecting the gastrointestinal, skin, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac systems have also been reported.

40066532	Clinical, Immunologic, and Genetic Characteristics of T-lymphoblastic Leukemia with STIL-TAL1 Fusion.	T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with a less favorable prognosis. The genetic background of T-ALL is widely heterogeneous, with the co-occurrence of multiple genetic abnormalities. The STIL-TAL1 rearrangement results from a submicroscopic deletion on chromosome 1p33 and is present in 15 - 25% of T-ALL cases. Submicroscopic deletions are not detected by conventional cytogenetic ana-lyses but can be identified through array comparative genomic hybridization and/or high-throughput RNA sequencing. Patients with the STIL-TAL1 fusion exhibit distinct characteristics, such as a young age, high white blood cell count, typical immunophenotype, and specific genetic abnormalities. However, the clinical, laboratory, and prognostic significance of this rearrangement remains unclear. This study was performed to identify STIL-TAL1 rearrangement resulting from submicroscopic 1p33 deletion in T-ALL and to investigate the clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics of T-ALL patients with STIL-TAL1 fusion.
40066528	Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Suppresses Mitophagy to Alleviate Muscle Atrophy in Chronic Renal Failure With Protein-Energy Wasting.	Protein-energy wasting (PEW) facilitates major adverse clinical outcomes in chronic renal failure (CRF), with current therapies not suitable for all patients. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) can alleviate chronic kidney disease, with unclear effects and mechanisms on CRF with PEW. The CRF rat model was constructed by adenine administration, and PEW was induced by a 4% casein diet. The serum creatinine (SCR), urinary protein (UPR), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pathology of the gastrocnemius muscle was estimated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of mitophagy-related markers was detected to assess the mitophagy level. Dexamethasone-induced L6 myotubes established myotube atrophy models. The levels of mitophagy-related markers, muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1), and atrophy gene 1 (Atrogin1) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. F. prausnitzii suppressed the SCR, UPR, and BUN expression in serum and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy, which were promoted by CRF with PEW. Dexamethasone-induced expression of MuRF1 and Atrogin1 in L6 myotubes was decreased by F. prausnitzii. Additionally, F. prausnitzii repressed mitophagy in the gastrocnemius muscle and L6 myotubes. In conclusion, F. prausnitzii suppressed renal failure progression and muscle atrophy by inhibiting mitophagy in CRF with PEW.
40066525	Direct Integration of Spent LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with High Voltage Aqueous Zinc-Manganese Redox Flow Batteries as a Practical Upcycling Process.	With the explosive growth of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), research on the recycling of spent batteries is widely conducted. However, conventional processes involve complex procedures, high costs, and environmental issues. This study introduces the electrochemical upcycling of spent LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LMO) cathode material, incorporating pre-filtration (PF) and pre-reduction (PR) processes to enable its direct application in redox flow batteries (RFBs). Moreover, a double membrane system is applied to address the low operating voltage and energy density by balancing the different pH levels of the zinc anode and manganese cathode. The aqueous zinc-manganese RFB, derived from spent LMO pouch full cells, achieves coulombic efficiency of 90% and energy efficiency (EE) exceeding 70% over 250 cycles. The LMO-containing electrolyte is further treated to precipitate the manganese ions by a simple pH adjustment, enabling 100% separation of lithium, thereby enhancing the sustainability of rare metal resources. This work presents a remarkable advancement in the upcycling method of LIB cathode materials and contributes to establishing a circular system for battery materials.
40066518	LAMP2-FLOT2 interaction enhances autophagosome-lysosome fusion to protect the septic heart in response to ILC2.	Cardiac dysfunction is a serious complication of sepsis-induced multiorgan failure in intensive care units and is characterized by an uncontrolled immune response to overwhelming infection. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), as a part of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in the inflammatory process of heterogeneous cardiac disorders. However, the role of ILC2 in regulating sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that autophagic flux blockage exacerbated inflammatory response and cardiac dysfunction, which was associated with mortality of sepsis. Using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse sepsis model, we observed an expansion of ILC2s in the septic heart. Furthermore, IL4 derived from ILC2 mitigated cardiac inflammatory responses and improved cardiac function during sepsis. Additionally, IL4 enhanced LAMP2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2) expression through STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation to stabilize lysosomal homeostasis and rescue the impaired autophagic flux during sepsis. Notably, LAMP2 was preferentially bound to FLOT2 (flotillin 2) after IL4 exposure, and the interaction enhanced autophagosome-lysosome fusion in cardiac endothelial cells. Loss of FLOT2 reversed the regulatory effects of LAMP2 on autophagy mediated by IL4, leading to autophagosome accumulation and suppressed autophagosome clearance. Conclusively, these findings provide novel insights that ILC2 regulates incomplete autophagic flux to protect septic heart and expand our understanding of immunoregulation for sepsis.<b>Abbreviation</b>: ACTB: actin beta; ACTN: actinin, alpha; ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; ANXA5/annexin V: annexin A5; AO: acridine orange; BECN1/Beclin1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CKM: creatine kinase, muscle; CKB: creatine kinase, brain; CLP: cecal ligation and puncture; CO: cardiac output; CQ: chloroquine; CTS: cathepsin; DAPI: 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EC: endothelial cell; EF: ejection fraction; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FLOT: flotillin; FS: fractional shortening; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GATA3: GATA binding protein 3; GLB1/β-Gal: galactosidase, beta 1; HCMEC: human cardiac microvascular endothelial cell; IL: interleukin; ILC: innate lymphoid cell; IL1RL1/ST2: interleukin 1 receptor-like 1; IL4c: IL4 complex; IL7R/CD127: interleukin 7 receptor; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; LAMP: lysosomal-associated membrane protein; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LMP: lysosome membrane permeabilization; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LVEDd: left ventricular end-diastole diameter; LVEDV: left ventricular end-diastole volume; LVESd: left ventricular end-systolic diameter; LVESV: left ventricular end-systole volume; MAN: mannosidase alpha; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MS: mass spectrometry; PECAM1/CD31: platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; PTPRC/CD45: protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C; RORC/RORγt: RAR related orphan receptor gamma; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TBX21/T-bet: T-box 21; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; THY1/CD90.2: thymus cell antigen 1, theta; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-translocating ATPase; VIM: vimentin.
40066517	Precise Control Over Crystallization Kinetics by Combining Nucleating Agents and Plasticizers for 20.1% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells.	Obtaining controllable active layer morphology plays a significant role in boosting the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a quaternary strategy, which incorporates polymer donor D18-Cl and small molecule acceptor AITC into the host D18:N3, is employed to precisely modulate crystallization kinetics for favorable morphology evolution within the active layer. In situ spectroscopic measurements during film-formation demonstrate that while D18-Cl works as a nucleator to promote aggregation of D18 and foster donor/acceptor intermixing, AITC has exactly the opposite impact on aggregation of N3 and intermixing kinetics of donor and acceptor, working as a plasticizer. The mutually compensational effect of the dual-guests, as a result, enables synergistic control over fibrillar networks, multi-length scale morphology, and vertical phase distribution, leading to optimized 3D morphology for greatly enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transfer, suppressed charge recombination, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, the quaternary OSCs based on D18:D18-Cl:N3:AITC achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, which represents one of the highest efficiencies for single-junction OSCs. This work presents an effective strategy to precisely regulate crystallization kinetics toward advanced morphology control for high-performance OSCs.
40066513	Stacking Pressure Modulated Deposition and Dissolution of Zinc Anode.	Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are emerging as a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage, offering enhanced safety and low costs. Nevertheless, the disordered growth of zinc dendrites has resulted in low coulombic efficiency and the dangers of short circuits, limiting the commercialization of ZIBs. In this study, a planar growth of zinc along the (002) direction is achieved by regulating the moderate initial stacking pressure during cell cycling and facilitating a larger zinc deposition particle size. The pivotal role of stacking pressure on the zinc nucleation, growth, and dissolution processes is elucidated with in situ pressure X-ray diffraction (XRD), time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMs), and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). By adjusting the staking pressure from 20 to 300 kPa, the battery cycle time increased 5 times. This work highlights the opportunity to precisely manipulate metal deposition/dissolution with stacking pressure for long-cycle life batteries.

Given the complexity of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) and their overlapping symptoms with other conditions, an accurate diagnosis necessitates a thorough examination, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Consequently, innovative diagnostic tools are required to increase TMD diagnosis efficiency and precision. Therefore, the purpose of this umbrella review was to examine the existing evidence about the usefulness of artificial intelligence (AI) in TMD diagnosis.
40066509	Harnessing Lithiophilic Hetero-Interfacial Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries with Low Negative/Positive Capacity Ratios.	Lithium (Li) metal batteries hold great promise for next-generation energy storage due to their high energy density. However, their application is hindered by uncontrollable Li plating/stripping, leading to limited cycle life, especially under practical conditions with a low negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratio. Here, it is demonstrated that stable cycling of low N/P ratio Li metal batteries can be realized by harnessing hetero-interfacial redox chemistry to regulate Li nucleation and deposition behavior. It is shown that replacing pure Li metal with intercalated Li in graphite facilitates the formation of an increasingly lithiophilic heterointerface upon discharge, which homogenizes Li deposition during subsequent charge, resulting in highly reversible Li plating/stripping with minimal active Li loss under lean Li conditions. This enables Li metal cells with a Li/graphite hybrid anode to demonstrate remarkable improvements in cycling life, even with an N/P ratio as low as 0.4, compared to those with a pure Li metal anode. This strategy provides new insights into the role of hetero-interfacial chemistry in constructing highly reversible composite anodes for high-energy and long-cycling Li metal batteries.
40066501	FLOT1 Is a Novel Serum Biomarker of Ovarian Cancer Targeted by N6-methyladenosine Modification Inhibition.	Ovarian cancer (OC) is a deadly disease and lacks a precise marker for diagnosis worldwide. Our previous work has shown the overexpression of flotillin-1 (FLOT1) in OC tissue. To improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, we evaluated the serum level of FLOT1 in OC patients and found that the serum concentration of FLOT1 as well as CA125 was significantly increased in patients with OC compared with healthy control (p < 0.01) and those with benign tumors (p < 0.05). The detection rate (above the upper limit of a cut-off value) of FLOT1 and CA125 was 77.78% and 72.22%, respectively, in patients with OC, which was increased to 88.89% in combination. The elevation of FLOT1 was confirmed in the serum of nude mice after the implantation of human OC cells. A high level of FLOT1 protein in the serum was positively correlated with the overexpression of FLOT1 protein in OC tissues. Furthermore, the level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of FLOT1 mRNA was significantly high in OC cells compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells, leading to an increase in FLOT1 mRNA expression. Application of a methylation inhibitor, 3-deazaadenosine, decreased FLOT1 mRNA expression in OC cells and suppressed tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that FLOT1 is a novel serum biomarker of OC and can be targeted by m<sup>6</sup>A modification inhibition. These data highlight the potential application of FLOT1 as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target for patients with OC.

This study aimed to explore the neurogenesis status in the LES among achalasia patients.
40066492	Geometric Design of Interface Structures and Electrolyte Solvation Chemistry for Fast Charging Lithium-Ion Batteries.	The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li<sup>+</sup> ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li<sup>+</sup> ions during fast-charging of Li-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile-based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li<sup>+</sup> ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN-containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li<sup>+</sup> ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 °C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.
40066488	Tailoring Self-Catalytic N─Co Bonds into Heterostructure Architectures: Deciphering Polytellurides Conversion Mechanism Toward Ultralong-Lifespan Potassium Ion Storage.	Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion-diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (K<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub>). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe<sub>2</sub> composite equipped with a self-catalytic center (N-CoTe<sub>2</sub>/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low-tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self-catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N-CoTe<sub>2</sub>/LTTC provides a short-range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K<sup>+</sup> diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N─Co bonds self-catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for K<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub> under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N-CoTe<sub>2</sub>/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong‑lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te-based anodes. Finally, the N-CoTe<sub>2</sub>/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of K<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub> and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong-lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.
40066486	A Comprehensive Review of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Management of Ulcerative Colitis.	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, and urgency during defecation. While the primary site of involvement is the colon, UC can extend to encompass the entire rectum and colon. The causes and development mechanisms of UC are still not well understood; nonetheless, it is currently held that factors including environmental influences, genetic predispositions, intestinal mucosal integrity, gut microbiota composition, and immune dysregulation contribute to its development. Dysregulated immune responses are pivotal in the pathophysiology of UC, and these aberrant responses are considered key contributors to the disease onset. In patients with UC, immune cells become hyperactive and erroneously target normal intestinal tissue, resulting in inflammatory cascades and damage to the intestinal mucosa. The therapeutic strategies currently employed for UC include immunosuppressive agents such as aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. However, these treatments often prove costly and carry significant adverse effects - imposing a considerable burden on patients. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has attracted worldwide attention because of its multi-target approach, minimal side effects, cost-effectiveness, and favorable efficacy profiles. In this review, the ways in which TCM modulates inflammatory responses in the treatment of ulcerative colitis have been outlined. Research into TCM modalities for modulating inflammatory pathways in the treatment of UC, which has yielded promising advancements, including individual herbs, herbal formulations, and their derivatives, has been summarized. TCM has been utilized to treat UC and the immune system plays a key role in regulating intestinal homeostasis. It is imperative to facilitate large-scale evidence-based medical research and promote the clinical application of TCM in the management of UC.
40066485	Highly Stable, Excellent Foliar Adhesion and Anti-Photodegradation Nucleic Acid-Peptide Coacervates for Broad Agrochemicals Delivery.	Agrochemicals play a pivotal role in the management of pests and diseases and the way agrochemicals are utilized exerts significant impacts on the environment. Ensuring rational application and improving utilization rates of agrochemicals are major demands in developing green delivery systems. Herein, a model of nucleic acid-peptide coacervate (NPC) for agrochemical delivery is presented, which is formed by mixing negatively charged single-stranded DNAs with positively charged poly-L-lysine. The NPC microsystem exhibits broad loading capacities for various types of agrochemicals. Furthermore, the NPCs demonstrate remarkable protection against photodegradation for photosensitive agrochemicals. In the foliar interactions, the NPCs exhibit excellent wetting performances and foliar adhesion on hydrophobic cabbage leaves and wheat leaves infected with powdery mildew to facilitate direct spaying in practical applications. Subsequently, the NPC microsystem is stabilized against coalescence by a charged comb polymer. Then, the NPC loaded with emamectin benzoates (EBs) exhibited significantly higher insecticidal activity compared to free EBs. This enhanced efficacy can be attributed to the higher insect uptake efficiency of the NPC formulation, as evidenced by fluorescent imaging of mosquito larvae. This coacervate model provides a new biocompatible and highly efficient system for future agrochemical delivery that actively contributes to eco-friendly and sustainable agriculture.
40066478	Metaproteomic Profiling of the Secretome of a Granule-forming Ca. Accumulibacter Enrichment.	Extracellular proteins are supposed to play crucial roles in the formation and structure of biofilms and aggregates. However, often little is known about these proteins, in particular for microbial communities. Here, we use two advanced metaproteomic approaches to study the extracellular proteome in a granular Candidatus Accumulibacter enrichment as a proxy for microbial communities that form solid microbial granules, such as those used in biological wastewater treatment. Limited proteolysis of whole granules and metaproteome isolation from the culture's supernatant successfully classified over 50% of the identified protein biomass to be secreted. Moreover, structural and sequence-based classification identified 387 proteins, corresponding to over 50% of the secreted protein biomass, with characteristics that could aid the formation of aggregates, including filamentous, beta-barrel containing, and cell surface proteins. While various of these aggregate-forming proteins originated from Ca. Accumulibacter, some proteins associated with other taxa. This suggests that not only a range of different proteins but also multiple organisms contribute to granular biofilm formation. Therefore, the obtained extracellular metaproteome data from the granular Ca. Accumulibacter enrichment provides a resource for exploring proteins that potentially support the formation and stability of granular biofilms, whereas the demonstrated approaches can be applied to explore biofilms of microbial communities in general.
40066473	Galvanic Cell Bipolar Microneedle Patches for Reversing Photoaging Wrinkles.	Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major factor in the development of skin photoaging wrinkles. While current treatments can slow the progression of photoaging, it is very difficult to achieve complete reversal. This study introduces galvanic cell microneedle (GCMN) patches with magnesium-containing bipolar electrodes. These patches operate through a galvanic cell mechanism, generating microcurrents and releasing hydrogen gas and magnesium ions via a redox reaction. The combination of hydrogen's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, microcurrent-induced stimulation of cell migration, and magnesium's promotion of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 anti-inflammatory polarization synergistically works to reverse photoaging wrinkles and rejuvenate the skin. Furthermore, this work examines how GCMNs may influence the transforming growth factor-β/Smad (TGF-β/Smad) pathway. This approach shows promise for advancing research and development in the field of medical cosmetology.
40066467	Effect of Capsular Tension Ring on Refractive and Morphological Outcomes in Pseudoexfoliative Eyes.	To evaluate the effect on anterior chamber depth (ACD) and postoperative refractive prediction error (PE) of capsular tension ring (CTR) implantation during phacoemulsification in pseudoexfoliative (PEX) eyes.
40066456	Influence of gut microbial metabolites on tumor immunotherapy: mechanisms and potential natural products.	In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, individual differences in efficacy have been observed in clinical practice. There is increasing evidence that gut microbial metabolites influence the efficacy of distal tumor immunotherapy via the gut-liver axis, the gut-brain axis and the gut-breast axis, a process that may involve modulating the expression of immune cells and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we systematically explore the relationship between gut microbial metabolites and tumor immunotherapy, and examine the corresponding natural products and their mechanisms of action. The in-depth exploration of this research area will provide new ideas and strategies to enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy and mitigate adverse effects.
40066455	Identification and functional characterization of T-cell exhaustion-associated lncRNA AL031775.1 in osteosarcoma: a novel therapeutic target.	Osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone malignancy predominantly affecting children and adolescents, presents significant therapeutic challenges with a 5-year survival rate below 30% in metastatic cases. T-cell exhaustion, characterized by the overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules, contributes to osteosarcoma progression and immune evasion. Although targeting these inhibitory pathways has shown potential in restoring T-cell activity, the molecular regulators of T-cell depletion in osteosarcoma are poorly understood.
40066454	Integrated multiomics analysis and machine learning refine neutrophil extracellular trap-related molecular subtypes and prognostic models for acute myeloid leukemia.	Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play pivotal roles in various pathological processes. The formation of NETs is impaired in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which can result in immunodeficiency and increased susceptibility to infection.
40066453	Bioinformatics analysis reveals novel tumor antigens and immune subtypes of skin cutaneous melanoma contributing to mRNA vaccine development.	Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a common malignant skin cancer with high mortality and recurrence rates. Although the mRNA vaccine is a promising strategy for cancer treatment, its application against SKCM remains confusing. In this study, we employed computational bioinformatics analysis to explore SKCM-associated antigens for an mRNA vaccine and suitable populations for vaccination.
40066452	Neutrophil extracellular traps and macrophage activation contibute to thrombosis and post-covid syndrome in SARS-CoV-2 infection.	SARS-CoV-2 infection activates macrophages and induces the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Excess NETs is linked to inflammatory and thrombotic complications observed in COVID-19.
40066451	The role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification during macrophage metabolic reprogramming in human diseases and animal models.	Macrophage metabolic reprogramming refers to the process by which macrophages adjust their physiological pathways to meet survival and functional demands in different immune microenvironments. This involves a range of metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and cholesterol transport. By modulating the expression and activity of key enzymes and molecules within these pathways, macrophages can make the transition between pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes, thereby linking metabolic reprogramming to inflammatory responses and the progression of several diseases, such as atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and acute lung injury (ALI). N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification has emerged as a critical regulatory mechanism during macrophage metabolic reprogramming, broadly affecting RNA stability, translation, and degradation. Therapeutic strategies targeting m<sup>6</sup>A modification can regulate the onset of metabolic diseases by influencing macrophage metabolic changes, for instance, small molecule inhibitors of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) can affect glucose metabolism and inhibit IBD. This review systematically explores recent findings on the role and molecular mechanisms of m<sup>6</sup>A modification during macrophage metabolic reprogramming in human diseases and animal models, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.
40066448	BLIMP-1-dependent differentiation of T follicular helper cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory type 1 cells.	T-regulatory-type-1 (TR1) cells are a subset of interleukin-10-producing but Foxp3<sup>-</sup> Treg cells that arise in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. We have shown that systemic delivery of autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NP) triggers the formation of large pools of disease-suppressing Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells from cognate T-follicular helper (TFH) cell precursors. Here we show that, upon treatment withdrawal, these Foxp3<sup>-</sup> TR1 cells spontaneously differentiate into a novel immunoregulatory Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subset that inherits epigenetic and transcriptional hallmarks of their precursors, including clonotypic T-cell receptors, and is distinct from other Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg subsets. Whereas the transcription factor BLIMP-1 is dispensable for development of conventional Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, it is necessary for development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 cells. In a model of central nervous system autoimmunity, abrogation of BLIMP-1 or IL-10 expression in the Foxp3<sup>-</sup> and/or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> TR1 subsets inhibits their development or anti-encephalitogenic activity. Thus, the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway results in the generation of two distinct autoimmune disease-suppressing, IL-10-producing TR1 subsets that are distinguished by the expression of Foxp3 and Foxp3 target genes.
40066447	Case Report: Complete response to four cycles of camrelizumab in a PD-L1 negative patient with advanced oral squamous cancer.	Immunotherapy has brought better survival benefits in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). However, owing to the lack of relevant biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of this treatment, it often has to be maintained. Here we report on a patient with stage IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue who developed an unresectable lesion in the neck after surgery and radical chemoradiotherapy. After four cycles of intermittent immunotherapy with camrelizumab, complete response (CR) was achieved. Next-generation sequencing showed that the TP53/FANCA/FAT1 gene mutations and negative PD-L1 expression were involved. The patient has been followed up for 4 years without R/M. This situation has not been reported previously, suggesting that some patients can benefit from short-term immunotherapy and even achieve CR; moreover, there may be more molecular markers to be discovered that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy. We can conduct in-depth research on relevant molecular markers, formulate personalized immunotherapy strategies and plans, and facilitate the development of new precision treatment strategies for HNSCC.
40066446	Exercise boost after surgery improves survival in model of metastatic breast cancer.	Despite advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment of the primary tumor, metastatic breast cancer tumors remain largely incurable, and their growth is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. There is therefore a critical need to identify ways to reduce metastatic tumor burden and increase breast cancer patient survival. While surgery and pharmacological treatments are the cornerstones of breast cancer intervention, epidemiological data suggests that physical activity can lower the risk of breast cancer development, improve adjuvant treatment tolerance, reduce the risk of disease recurrence and lower breast cancer-related death.
40066444	The changes of NLRs family members in the brain of AD mouse model and AD patients.	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is primarily characterized by progressive neuron loss and memory impairment. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are crucial for immune regulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recently, NLRs have been identified as important contributors to neuroinflammation, thus presenting a potential approach for reducing inflammation and slowing AD progression.
40066443	Unveiling SSR4: a promising biomarker in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) represents a frequent cancer with a poor prognosis. Altered glucose metabolism contributes factor to ESCC progression. In our previous study, signal sequence receptor subunit delta (SSR4) was included in an ESCC prognostic model; however, the mechanisms underlying SSR4 implication in ESCC remain ambiguous. Accordingly, we aim to determine the interconnection between SSR4 expression and clinical characteristics of ESCC.
40066442	A comprehensive prognostic and immunological implications of Gremlin 1 in lung adenocarcinoma.	Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a prevalent form of lung cancer globally, known for its high invasiveness, metastatic potential, and notable heterogeneity, particularly in its response to immunotherapy. Gremlin 1 (GREM1) is implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis in multiple cancers. However, GREM1's specific role in LUAD remains unclear. This study systematically examines GREM1 expression in LUAD and its association with tumor progression, immune microenvironment, and prognosis.
40066440	In-depth analysis of the safety of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors.	In recent years, the rapid progress in oncology, immunology, and molecular biology has dramatically advanced cancer immunotherapy, particularly CAR-T cell therapy. This innovative approach involves engineering a patient's T cells to express receptors that specifically target tumor antigens, enhancing their ability to identify and eliminate cancer cells. However, the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors is often hampered by the challenging tumor microenvironment (TME). The complex TME includes dense stroma that obstructs T cell infiltration, abnormal blood vessel structures leading to hypoxia, and an acidic pH, all of which hinder CAR-T cell function. Additionally, the presence of immunosuppressive factors in the TME reduces the efficacy of CAR-T cells, making successful targeting of tumors more difficult. The safety of CAR-T therapy has gained interest, especially CAR-T therapy has shown considerable effectiveness in various cancers, with notable results in multiple myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, among others. Nonetheless, CAR-T cell therapy is associated with several adverse reactions primarily driven by heightened levels of proinflammatory cytokines. These reactions include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (CANS), and organ toxicity, often leading to serious complications. CRS, characterized by systemic inflammation due to cytokine release, can escalate to severe organ dysfunction. It typically occurs within the first week post-infusion, correlating with CAR-T cell expansion and often presents with fever and hypotension. Meanwhile, CANS encompasses neurological issues ranging from mild symptoms to severe seizures, possibly exacerbated by CRS. Organ toxicity can also arise from CAR-T therapy, with potential damage affecting the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, and lungs, often tied to shared antigens found in both tumor and healthy tissues. Moreover, long-term effects like cytokine-associated hematotoxicity (CAHT) and secondary malignancies represent significant concerns that could affect the patient's quality of life post-treatment. The long-term adverse effects and challenges in treating solid tumors underscore the need for ongoing research. Strategies to improve CAR-T cell efficacy, minimize adverse reactions, and enhance patient safety are critical. Future explorations could include designing CAR-T cells to better navigate the TME, identifying specific target antigen profiles to minimize off-target damage, and developing adjunct therapies to mitigate cytokine-related toxicity. Continued monitoring for long-term effects will also be paramount in improving patient outcomes and maintaining their quality of life. Overall, while CAR-T therapy holds great promise, it must be administered with careful consideration of potential side effects and rigorous management strategies to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy.
40066439	Tissue-resident memory T cells in urinary tract diseases.	Tissue-resident memory T (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells are a specialized subset of memory T cells that permanently reside in non-lymphoid tissues, providing localized and long-lasting immune protection. In the urinary tract, T<sub>RM</sub> cells play critical roles in defending against infections, mediating tumor immunity, and influencing the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic potential is immense, with promising avenues for vaccine development, enhanced cancer immunotherapy, and targeted treatments for chronic inflammation. However, challenges remain in harnessing their protective roles while minimizing their pathological effects, particularly in immunosuppressive or inflammatory microenvironments. This review explores the diverse roles of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in urinary tract diseases, including infections, cancer, and chronic inflammation, and discusses therapeutic strategies and future directions for leveraging T<sub>RM</sub> cells to improve clinical outcomes. By advancing our understanding of T<sub>RM</sub> cell biology, we can develop innovative interventions that balance their immune-protective and regulatory functions.
40066413	Papillary Carcinoma in Thyroglossal Cyst: A Case Report with Comprehensive Review of Treatment Modalities.	Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common form of congenital neck cysts. The incidence of thyroid papillary carcinoma in thyroglossal duct cyst is less than 1%. In most cases, the diagnosis is made postoperatively. We present a 52-year-old male with sonographically confirmed thyroglossal duct cyst with a large dystrophic calcification in the midline just cranial to the thyroid isthmus, which showed suspicious atypical cells in fine needle aspiration cytology. However, clinically and by contrast enhanced computed tomography neck, it was free from its adjacent tissues with no lymph node involvement. Various treatment modalities were reviewed to formulate a plan of treatment for further management of the patient. Some studies considered near total thyroidectomy as treatment of choice, whereas others categorised the patients into groups according to the risk factors involved and suggested Sistrunk's operation with follow up as the treatment modality in the low-risk group. Present case belonged to low-risk group and so underwent Sistrunk's operation. Histopathology revealed lesion to be encapsulated papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient has been on regular follow- up for the last 3 months with no radiological or clinical recurrence.
40066409	Expression of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in Nasal Polyp: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	Nasal polyp (NP) is a pathological benign mass that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. This lesion is occasionally associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which is named chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) indicates abnormal cell proliferation which may help assess the nasopharyngeal lesions and upper airway cancers. This study aimed to examine the PCNA expression in NP tissue. This study was conducted under the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A thorough search using relevant keywords was performed on the electronic database to identify studies examining the PCNA expression in NP. Meta-analysis on pooled single group proportion and means of PCNA expression was conducted by the metamean and metaprop functions in R software (version 4.4.0). Quality assessment was done according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Ten articles were included in this study. The PCNA expression in NP was higher than in normal nasal mucosa (NNM), while its expression in NP was lower than in inverted papilloma (IP). The mean percentage of PCNA expression in NP was 15.73% (95%-CI[2.87-28.58]) with considerable heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 97%[96-98%],<i>p</i>-value < 0.01). Based on a cutoff staining (> 5%), 64% of NP samples were PCNA-positive (95%-CI[42-81%]) with high heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 76%[47-89%], <i>p</i>-value < 0.01). NP tissue has a relatively high expression of the PCNA oncoprotein based on the immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Although more than half of NP samples were positive for PCNA, still the mean expression of this marker in NP was lower than in IP tissue.
40066404	Do The Inflammatory Cells In The Blood And Tissues Have Predictive And Prognostic Value In Benign, Premalignant And Malignant Lesions Of The Larynx?	The aim of our study is to investigate the predictive and prognostic value of inflammatory cells in blood and tissues in laryngeal lesions.
40066398	Laryngeal Neuroendocrine Carcinoma.	Neuroendocrine tumours of the larynx are extremely rare, though they make up only 1% of tumours in this region with the most common site being the supraglottis. On exhaustive research on PubMed, there are only a few prior cases of neuroendocrine carcinoma of subglottis published in the literature.
40066396	Bilateral Primary Central Nervous System's Lymphoma of Cerebellopontine Angles: A Case Report.	Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) mostly occurs in supratentorial regions. Our patient underwent surgery because of headaches and pain and sensorineural hearing loss in his right ear and bilateral extra axial CPA mass in MRI. Histopathology reveals diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma.
40066395	Anatomical Variations in Nasal Cavities and Paranasal Sinuses on Computed Tomography in Chronic Rhinosinusitis: Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment.	Chronic rhinosinusitis is a prevalent condition characterized by inflammation of the nasal and paranasal sinus cavities, significantly impacting quality of life and healthcare utilization. Computed tomography imaging is vital in assessing anatomical variations that may contribute to chronic rhinosinusitis pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify anatomical variations in the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses using CT imaging and explore their relationship with sinus mucosal abnormalities. 154 chronic rhinosinusitis patients were recruited. The study revealed a high prevalence of anatomical variations, with deviated nasal septum being the most common (71.4%), followed by Agger nasi cell (66.2%), spur formation (51.3%), ICA into the sphenoid sinus (44.8%) and Concha bullosa (34.4%). Most anatomical variations are commonly found on both sides. Significant correlations were found between some variations and sinusitis involvement on the same side. However, no significant correlations were observed between angles of septal deviation and CRS incidence. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing anatomical variations in CRS management to mitigate risks and improve treatment outcomes. Further research, including a comparison group of patients without CRS, would provide a comprehensive understanding of the anatomical variations observed in the study.
40066387	Clinico-Pathological Predictors Affecting Lymph Node Status in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	To analyze the correlation of age, gender, subsite, and histopathological factors such as tumour grade, depth of invasion (DOI), lymphovascular invasion(LVI), perineural invasion(PNI), bone invasion and worst pattern of invasion(WPOI) with cervical lymph node metastasis(LNM), extranodal extension(ENE), lymph node ratio(LNR), number of positive nodes(+ veN) and T stage in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We conducted a retrospective study on cases with OSCC of all stages and any designated anatomical subsite of the oral cavity, who reported to us from the year 2018-2023, and underwent curative-intent surgery with or without appropriate adjuvant treatment. Various clinic-pathological parameters were recorded and their correlation with lymph node metastasis, lymph node ratio(LNR), number of positive nodes(+ veN), extranodal extension(ENE) and T stage was analyzed. A total of 301 patients with a mean of 43.94 ± 11.23 years were enrolled in the study, out of which 86% were males and 14%were females. Tumour grade, DOI, LVI, PNI, medullary bone invasion were found to be predictors of LNM, LNR and + veN, All these histopathological parameters excluding tumor grade had a significant association with ENE as well, and excluding LVI, all of them had a significant association with T stage. Histopathological parameters have a major role to play in determining the lymph node status in OSCC patients.
40066386	Allergen Immunotherapy in Autoimmune Terrain: A Case Study.	Allergen immunotherapy (AIT), or specific immunotherapy (SIT), is an effective treatment for inducing immune tolerance to specific allergens. It is widely used for allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and Hymenoptera venom allergies, with recent applications to food allergies and atopic dermatitis. Despite its benefits, the use of SIT in patients with autoimmune diseases is controversial due to concerns about its potential to induce or exacerbate autoimmune conditions. This report examines a case of autoimmune hypothyroidism developing during AIT and the management decisions involved. A 26-year-old female with a history of moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis and childhood asthma presented with severe malaise, weakness, and fatigue over the past three months. She had a family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The patient had been on AIT for six months and was using intranasal fluticasone furoate nasal spray daily. Initial laboratory investigations prior to AIT showed normal thyroid function. Three months into AIT, she developed hypothyroidism, confirmed by elevated TSH levels and positive anti-TPO antibodies. A causality assessment suggested a "possible" link between AIT and hypothyroidism. However, a risk-benefit analysis favored the continuation of AIT along with the initiation of L-thyroxine therapy. After six months of thyroid hormone replacement, her TSH levels normalized, and her allergic rhinitis symptoms significantly improved. This case underscores the complexity of managing coexisting allergic and autoimmune conditions. The decision to continue AIT, despite the onset of hypothyroidism, was based on a thorough risk-benefit analysis, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment plans. Understanding the immunological mechanisms, particularly the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, is crucial. Neutrophils play a significant role as both effectors and modulators of immune responses. The clinical pharmacologist's recommendation was informed by these factors and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy. The continuation of AIT was justified by its benefits in managing allergic rhinitis and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone therapy. This case highlights the importance of personalized medicine and continuous monitoring in treatment decisions for patients with coexisting conditions.
40066379	The Diagnosis and Management of a Ewing's Sarcoma of the Pterygopalatine fossa in a 5-year-old girl.	Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is a small round cell tumor that mainly involves the skeleton, with an incidence of 2.93 per million. It is responsible for 4-10% of all bone tumors, with long bones and pelvis being the most frequently observed locations, whereas it affects the skull in only about 1-4% of cases. After osteosarcoma, ES is the most frequently observed bony primary malignant tumour in children. It more frequently regards adolescents or young adults. It is rarely diagnosed below 5 years of age or after the age of 30. ES rarely occurs in the head and neck district and, when it occurs, the jaw and skull base are the two most frequently involved locations. Clinically, head and neck ES does not show any pathognomonic finding, with the most frequent signs and symptoms usually due to the mass effect of the neoplasm. The aim of this paradigmatic case report is to present and discuss the diagnosis and management of a rare case of ES of the right pterygo-palatine region in a 5-year-old girl, that had been previously misdiagnosed and managed as a dental abscess.
40066375	Optimizing the commercial manufacturing of tisagenlecleucel for patients in Japan: A 4-year experiential journey.	Tisagenlecleucel, an autologous CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, was approved in Japan, in March 2019 for patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukamia and r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and in August 2022 for patients with r/r follicular lymphoma. Post-approval, a key goal has been to upscale and continuously improve manufacturing and shipment success rates (MSR and SSR, respectively) in the commercial setting to meet the needs of patients worldwide, including in Japan. Herein, we report accrued experience from a 4-year journey of commercial tisagenlecleucel manufacturing process optimization for patients in Japan.
40066374	Bioactive and degradable collagen-based three-dimensional scaffold encapsulated with adipose mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes improved diabetic wound healing.	A diabetic wound is the most frequent form of chronic wound. Because diabetic wounds have multiple factors contributing to their development, the best treatments involve using a combination of approaches. Herein we assessed whether bioactive and degradable bioengineered micro-porous collagen-based three-dimensional scaffold (CTS) encapsulated with adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs)-derived exosomes could accelerate the wound healing process in diabetic rats. Diabetic animals were assigned to the control group, CTS group, Exo group, and CTS+Exo group. Tissue samples were collected on days 7, 14, and 21 for evaluations including stereological, molecular, and tensiometrical assessments. The findings showed that in the treatment groups, there was a notably increase in wound closure rate, total volumes of newly formed epidermis and dermis, numerical densities of fibroblasts and blood vessels, collagen density, and biomechanical parameters than the control group, with the most noticeable changes seen in the CTS+Exo group. Additionally, there was a notably increase in the transcript of miRNA-146a, TGF-β, bFGF, and VEGF genes in the treatment groups than the control group, with the highest expression observed in the CTS+Exo group. In the CTS+Exo group, there was a much greater decrease in TNF-α and IL-1β expression, as well as in the number of neutrophils, compared to the other groups. These results validated that the combination of CTS and ASCs-derived exosomes has a greater effect on improving diabetic wound healing.
40066372	Application of Ultrasound Localization Microscopy in Evaluating the Type 2 Diabetes Progression.	Type 2 diabetes is considered as a chronic inflammatory disease in which the dense microvasculature reorganizes with disease progression and is highly correlated with β cell mass and islet function. In this study, we constructed rat models of type 2 diabetes and used ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) imaging to noninvasively map the pancreatic microvasculature at microscopy resolution in vivo to reflect β cell loss and islet function deterioration, and evaluate the efficacy after anti-cytokine immunotherapy. It was unveiled that ULM morphological and hemodynamic parameters have a strong link with β cell loss and deterioration of pancreatic islet function. This correlation aligns with the observed pathological alterations in the microvessels of islet and demonstrated that ULM can effectively mirror the functionality of β cells during rapid fluctuations in blood glucose levels by observing changes in mean velocity. Furthermore, it was revealed that treatment with anti-cytokine immunotherapy enhances the function and health of β cells by restoring the microvascular environment. Remarkable improvements in vessel morphology (measured by fractal dimension) and hemodynamics (indicated by mean velocity and vessel density) were noted following the anti-cytokine immunotherapy, signifying a significant enhancement at the treatment's conclusion (<i>P</i> < 0.05). These observations suggested that ULM technology holds promise as a visible and efficient tool for monitoring the effectiveness of anti-cytokine immunotherapy in managing type 2 diabetes. Pancreatic microvessel-based ULM may serve as a novel noninvasive method to assess β cells, providing a valuable clinical tool for tracking the progression of type 2 diabetes.
40066367	Expanding the Ingredient Basket in Aquaculture: Growth Performance and Feed Utilization of Australian Hybrid Abalone (<i>Haliotis laevigata × H. rubra</i>) Fed Methanotrophic Single Cell Protein.	There is growing interest in the use of single cell proteins (SCPs) derived from methanotrophic bacteria for inclusion in aquafeed to reduce reliance on other, potentially less sustainable proteins. This two-part experiment aimed to investigate first (i) the dose effect of replacing soy protein concentrate with SCP in Australian hybrid abalone diets (<i>Haliotis laevigata Haliotis rubra</i>) and second, (ii) the potential for improved palatability of the SCP by using commercially produced liquid protein hydrolysate (PH). This was assessed in a 2 × 2 factorial experimental design. The diets were formulated to be iso-proteic (~40% crude protein as fed) and iso-energetic (~18 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup> as fed). The diets (SCP 0%, SCP 5%, SCP 10%, SCP 20%, SCP 0% + PH, and SCP 20% + PH) were fed to the abalone (~9.25 g initial weight) once daily in the evening for 94 days to apparent satiation. The growth performance and feed utilization of abalone fed with up to 10% SCP was comparable to the control; however, there was a significant reduction in most parameters at the highest inclusion of 20%. In the second experiment, there was a decline in measured protein and energy retention in the abalone fed 20% SCP, with a concomitantly lower apparent biological value. Positively, there were significant improvements in the apparent digestibility of the diet at the 20% SCP inclusion. There was no significant impact of using the PH on growth performance or feed intake. No effects were observed on the digestive enzyme activity (<i>α</i>-amylase, lipase, and trypsin) examined among the treatments. Considering these results collectively, the maximum recommended inclusion of methanotrophic SCP meal should be 10% for hybrid abalone. Reasons for the decline in performance at the highest inclusion may be related to palatability; however, this remains to be fully confirmed.
40066361	There and turn back again: the application of phage serine integrases in eukaryotic systems.	Serine integrases (Ints) have gained prominence and have been extensively used in Synthetic Biology due to their ability to modify DNA sequences. Ints are recombinases encoded by the phage genome and have been used to unidirectionally catalyze an insertion, excision, or inversion of a specific DNA sequence between the two attachment sites (<i>att</i>) <i>attB</i> (bacterial attachment site) and <i>attP</i> (phage attachment site). The entire process is highly specific and accurate; therefore, Ints are widely used in genetic engineering and have been extensively studied due to their unique site-specific recombination properties and potential genome editing applications. Furthermore, new recombinational factors (RDFs) and their determinants are constantly being discovered, underlining the need to update progress in research involving Ints in eukaryotic cells. In this way, this review aims to provide an overview of Ints in eukaryotic cells and highlight how Ints can be used in innovative ways to advance genetic engineering applications in health, agriculture, and environmental sciences.

40066359	Hydrogel and scalp/skin conductivities impact dose from tumor treating fields.	Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are delivered by transducer arrays applied to scalp or body surface for treatment of multiple malignancies. Dermatologic complications are thought to be related to hydrogel situated between the electrodes and scalp or skin to facilitate electric field penetration. High intensity of TTFields on these surfaces may also be a contributing factor. We explored conductivity changes in the hydrogel and skin to improve TTFields coverage and penetration.
40066352	Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of hub genes in ischemic heart failure and atrial fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) frequently coexist and mutually influence each other.

Hence, comprehending their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic targets are urgently needed.
40066340	Asiatic acid in anticancer effects: emerging roles and mechanisms.	Medicinal plants are crucial in the comprehensive treatment of anti-tumor with the advantages of high efficacy, low toxicity, multiple pathways and multi-targets synergy, leading to be a focal point of study for many oncologists. Identifying effective monomer components with anti-tumor properties from medicinal plants has long been a crucial focus in the study and development of traditional Chinese medicine. This endeavor has significant research value and promising possibilities for further advancement. Asiatic Acid (AA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid derived from <i>Centella asiatica</i> (L.) Urb, is used in traditional Chinese medicine and has been shown to have anti-tumor properties on a range of tumor types. The present study assessed the anti-tumor properties of AA from five different perspectives: inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, inhibiting invasion and metastasis, regulating cell autophagy, enhancing the resistance of tumor cells to drugs, and minimizing adverse side effects.
40066336	Ferroptosis, pathogenesis and therapy in AS co-depression disease.	Atherosclerosis (AS)-related cardiovascular disease and depression are often comorbid, with patients with cardiovascular disease facing an increased risk of depression, which worsens AS. Both diseases are characterized by oxidative stress and lipid metabolism disorders. Ferroptosis, a form of cell death characterized by iron overload and harmful lipid peroxide accumulation, is found in various diseases, including AS and depression. Consistent with the iron deposition and lipid peroxidation (LPO) that characterize the ferroptosis mechanism, disturbances in iron and lipid metabolism are also crucial pathogenic mechanisms in AS and depression. The comorbid mechanisms are complex, posing challenges for clinical treatment. Chinese herbs hold significant potential owing to their multi-target pharmacological effects. Therefore, this review aims to investigate iron overload, LPO, and ferroptosis across various cell types, the shared pathogenesis of AS and depression with ferroptosis, and research on Chinese herbal medicine targeting ferroptosis in the treatment of anti-AS co-depression. This provides a comprehensive understanding of AS co-depression disease from the perspective of ferroptosis.
40066335	Gold complex QB1561 suppresses drug-resistant cancer cells by inhibiting TrxR and mitochondrial respiratory function.	Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is one of the leading reasons that cause the failures of cancer treatment. Novel agents that may reverse MDR and neutralize drug-resistant cancer cells are highly desirable for clinical practice. The targeting of cellular redox homeostasis and/or mitochondria-mediated energy metabolism are promising strategies for the suppression of drug-resistant cancer cells. Based on the structure of mono-gold(I) complex auranofin (AF), a drug candidate under clinical trials for cancer, we synthesized a new dual-gold(I) complex QB1561 and tested if it can inhibit drug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We also investigated if QB1561 could inhibit thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a well-known target of AF and other gold complexes, and assessed its impact on mitochondrial respiration.
40066333	Cepharanthine hydrochloride: a novel ferroptosis-inducing agent for prostate cancer treatment.	Ferroptosis is an intracellular iron-dependent cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. Increasing evidence indicated that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in suppressing tumors, thus providing new opportunities for cancer therapy. The drug cepharanthine, commonly used to treat leukopenia, has been discovered to function as an anticancer agent to multiple types of cancer via diverse mechanisms. However, the effect of cepharanthine on prostate cancer remains unclear.
40066330	Potential mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine intervention in gastric cancer: targeted regulation of autophagy.	Gastric cancer (GC) is a prevalent malignant tumor that originates from the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa, predominantly in the form of adenocarcinoma. Extensive research has confirmed the significant role of autophagy in the initiation, progression, and chemoresistance of GC. The potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to exert anti-tumor effects by modulating autophagy has been demonstrated, particularly in the context of GC prevention and treatment. Natural products (NPs) have great therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of GC by targeting autophagy-related genes and signaling pathways to intervene in the biological behaviors of gastric cancer cells such as proliferation, metastasis, invasion and death. This article describes the molecular mechanisms and key markers of tumor autophagy, the signaling pathways involved in GC-associated autophagy (PI3K/AKT/mTOR, AMPK, MAPK, p53), and summarizes the mechanism of autophagy and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection in GC, how autophagy interacts with apoptotic and iron-death processes and the wide-ranging influences that these factors play in the process. Finally, this paper systematically summarizes the natural compounds of terpenoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, saponins, and polysaccharides that modulate autophagy-related signaling pathways and potential targets for the treatment of GC, and evaluates the toxic effects of NPs, providing a more compelling rationale and direction for GC therapy.
40066329	Intestinal current measurement detects age-dependent differences in CFTR function in rectal epithelium.	Intestinal current measurement (ICM) provides a sensitive bioassay for assessment of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function in rectal biopsies <i>ex vivo</i> and is used as a diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis (CF). Furthermore, ICM was shown to be sensitive to detect pharmacological rescue of CFTR function by CFTR modulators in people with CF carrying responsive <i>CFTR</i> mutations. Results from clinical trials of CFTR modulators across age groups indicate that CFTR function in the sweat duct may be age-dependent with children reaching higher levels than adults. However, little is known about age dependency of CFTR function in the intestinal epithelium.

40066325	Optimizing Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Therapy via Ultrasound-Enhanced Piezocatalysis for Targeted Chemodrug Release.	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is known for its high malignancy, limited clinical treatment options, and poor chemotherapy outcomes. Although some advancements have been made using nanotechnology-based chemotherapy for TNBC treatment, the controlled and on-demand release of chemotherapeutic drugs at the tumor site remains a challenge.
40066322	Biomimetic Self-Oxygenated Immunoliposome for Cancer-Targeted Photodynamic Immunotherapy.	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy with significant clinical application potential for tumor treatment. However, the tumor hypoxia and limited efficacy against tumor metastasis present significant limitations in the clinical application of PDT. To alleviate tumor hypoxia for PDT against tumor growth and metastasis, we developed a self-oxygenated immunoliposome by encapsulating the catalase (CAT) within the liposome cavity and loading the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and immunoadjuvant MPLA in the lipid bilayer of the immunoliposome (CAT@LP-Ce6-A). Subsequently, we fused it with the cancer cell membrane (CCM) to create the hybrid immunoliposome (CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A). The in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of CAT@LP-CCM-Ce6-A-based photodynamic immunotherapy (PDIT) was evaluated.
40066321	Successful Management of Infective Endocarditis Complicated by Pheochromocytoma: A Case Report.	Pheochromocytomas present with paroxysmal hypertension due to a sudden release of catecholamines stimulated by radiological contrast media, surgery, or anesthetic agents. This often complicates the maintenance of patient hemodynamics during surgery. A 55-year-old man with a high fever was admitted to a hospital. Laboratory blood tests revealed elevated white blood cell and C-reactive protein levels. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed moderate aortic regurgitation, along with aortic valve vegetation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cerebral embolisms, whereas computed tomography showed a left adrenal incidentaloma. Further examinations showed high levels of plasma-free metanephrine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline in the blood and metanephrines in the urine. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy revealed ligand accumulation in the tumor at 6 and 24 h after injection. Based on these results, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed. Doxazosin was promptly administered, and its dosage was escalated. Despite ongoing antimicrobial therapy, transesophageal echocardiography did not reveal any reduction in the size of the vegetation. Hence, the patient underwent surgical treatment. A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was initially performed. The patient's blood pressure increased with insufflation and manipulation around the tumor but dropped immediately after the adrenal tumor was resected. Following the adrenalectomy, a cardiopulmonary bypass was established. The bicuspid aortic valve leaflets along with the vegetation were completely resected. Subsequently, a mechanical aortic valve was implanted. Inotropic agents were completely weaned off within two days after surgery. A pathological examination confirmed the adrenal incidentaloma to be pheochromocytoma. One-stage surgery with adrenalectomy before cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass may be an effective strategy for patients with pheochromocytomas diagnosed with infective endocarditis. In addition, it can reduce the risk of complications with pheochromocytoma by managing the patient's systemic condition as much as possible before cardiac surgery.
40066318	Nedd4L signaling contributes to carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis in female mice and is associated with enteric dysbacteriosis.	Liver fibrosis is characterized by hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and collagen overproduction, but its pathogenesis remains largely unknown. This study aimed to uncover the role of neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (Nedd4L) signaling in liver fibrosis and its relationship with gut microbiota.
40066315	<i>Cellulophaga algicola</i> alginate lyase and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Psl glycoside hydrolase inhibit biofilm formation by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> CF2843 on three-dimensional aggregates of lung epithelial cells.	<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that produces a biofilm containing the polysaccharides, alginate, Psl, and Pel, and causes chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients. Others and we have previously explored the use of alginate lyases in inhibiting <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilm formation on plastic and lung epithelial cell monolayers. We now employ a more physiologically representative model system, i.e., three-dimensional aggregates of A549 lung epithelial cells cultured under conditions of microgravity in a rotary cell culture system to mimic the natural lung environment, and a previously isolated clinical strain, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> CF2843 that we engineered by transposon-mediated integration to express Green Fluorescent Protein and for which we also report the complete genome sequence. Immunostaining and lectin binding studies indicated that the three-dimensional cell aggregates harbored sialylated and fucosylated epitopes as well as Muc1, Muc5Ac, and β-catenin on their surfaces, suggestive of mucin secretion and the presence of tight junctions, hallmark features of lung epithelial tissue. Using this validated model system with confocal microscopy and viable bacterial counts as readouts, we demonstrated that <i>Cellulophaga algicola</i> alginate lyase and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Psl glycoside hydrolase, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Pel glycoside hydrolase, inhibit biofilm formation by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> on three-dimensional lung epithelial cell aggregates.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) central nervous system infection is typically observed in immunocompromised patients, and there is a lack of studies involving large samples of non-immunocompromised individuals. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 108 non-immunocompromised patients diagnosed with VZV central nervous system infection.
40066303	The effect of Zexie decoction on vestibular and auditory function in DDAVP-induced endolymphatic hydrops of Guinea pigs.	To investigate the effects of Zexie decoction on vestibular and auditory function in guinea pigs with endolymphatic hydrolysis induced by desmopressin. Methods: Sixty guinea pigs were randomly and evenly divided into four groups, each group has 15 guinea pigs: normal control group, DDAVP group, DDAVP modeling combined with Zexie Decoction group, and DDAVP combined with Double Zexie group. At 7 and 14 days, bone-conducted cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential tests, auditory brainstem responses, and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions were conducted on each group of guinea pigs to evaluate their vestibular and auditory function quantitatively. After functional testing, the outer hair cells were observed by scanning electron microscope. On day 14, one guinea pig was randomly selected from both the normal control group and DDAVP group to verify the successful establishment of the model using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the inner ear.

40066259	Autophagy: regulating the seesaw of bone-fat balance.	The interrelationship between bone and fat can be described as a seesaw in bone homeostasis, in which both osteogenesis and adipogenesis occur in a delicate balance. Osteoblasts and adipocytes share a common origin and play key roles in osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Bone-fat balance indicates osteogenesis and adipogenesis keeps a balance for concordant distribution of trabecular bone and bone marrow adipose tissue in bone, thereby leading to the balance between bone metabolism and lipid metabolism. Bone-fat balance is crucial for metabolic health. When disrupted by various factors, this balance can lead to several bone-related metabolic diseases and systemic disorders, such as obesity, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. Recent research highlights the role of autophagy dysfunction in these metabolic conditions. Restoring autophagic function can help restore metabolic homeostasis and re-establish the bone-fat balance. The current review explores the factors that regulate bone-fat balance, the consequences of imbalance under pathological conditions, and the potential of autophagy modulation as a therapeutic approach. Overall, it can be concluded that targeting autophagy presents a promising strategy for treating metabolic disorders and restoring bone-fat balance.
40066258	Implications of draxin in neurological disorders.	Axon guidance proteins not only play a role in the formation of proper neural circuits but also have other important functions, such as cell survival, migration, and proliferation in the brain. Therefore, mutations in the genes encoding these proteins frequently cause various types of neurological disorders, including psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. We previously identified an axon guidance protein, draxin, that is essential for the development of several neural circuits and cell survival in the brain. Recently, the deletion of the <i>draxin</i> gene was identified in an inbred BTBR T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup>/J (BTBR/J) mouse, which is a widely used model of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), suggesting that <i>draxin</i> deletion is a genetic factor for ASD-like characteristics in BTBR/J mice. In this review, I summarize the neuroanatomical abnormalities in <i>draxin</i> knockout mice by comparing them to BTBR/J mice and discuss the possible contributions of draxin to anatomical and behavioral phenotypes in BTBR/J mice.

40066256	Artificial plasticenta: how polystyrene nanoplastics affect <i>in-vitro</i> cultured human trophoblast cells.	In the human placenta, we have detected the MPs by Raman microspectroscopy analysis and, for the first time, with transmission electron microscopy. MPs fragments have been localized in different compartments of placental tissue, free in the cytoplasm and within organelles like lysosomes. Moreover, their presence has been correlated with ultrastructural alterations of some cell organelles, typical of metabolic stress, mainly dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and numerous swollen electrodense mitochondria, as well as signs derived from involuting organelles. As a result, we have speculated that microplastics in the placenta could be responsible for pathological traits activation such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation causing long-term effects on the health of the mother and child. To demonstrate the cytotoxicity of PS-NPs on the placenta and confirm the <i>in vivo</i> results, we performed <i>in vitro</i> experiments on a trophoblast human cell line, the HTR8/SVneo cells.
40066251	Exploring the underlying molecular connections: a bioinformatics approach to link melanoma and Parkinson's disease.	Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, and Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, have been epidemiologically linked, showing a positive association that suggests a shared etiology. This association implies that individuals with one condition may have an increased risk of developing the other. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in both PD and melanoma to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may contribute to the pathophysiological overlap between these two conditions.
40066231	The Role of Yes-Associated Protein in Inflammatory Diseases and Cancer.	Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays a central role in the Hippo pathway, primarily governing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its significance extends to tumorigenesis and inflammatory conditions, impacting disease initiation and progression. Given the increasing relevance of YAP in inflammatory disorders and cancer, this study aims to elucidate its pathological regulatory functions in these contexts. Specifically, we aim to investigate the involvement and molecular mechanisms of YAP in various inflammatory diseases and cancers. We particularly focus on how YAP activation, whether through Hippo-dependent or independent pathways, triggers the release of inflammation and inflammatory mediators in respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive inflammatory conditions. In cancer, YAP not only promotes tumor cell proliferation and differentiation but also modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby fostering tumor metastasis and progression. Additionally, we provide an overview of current YAP-targeted therapies. By emphasizing YAP's role in inflammatory diseases and cancer, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the protein's pivotal involvement in disease processes, elucidate the intricate pathological mechanisms of related diseases, and contribute to future drug development strategies targeting YAP.
40066230	Sleep Disorders: Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Interventions.	Sleep disorder significantly disrupts the quality of life for patients. Although it is clinically acknowledged, the fundamental neuropathological mechanisms are still not understood. Recent preclinical research has been directed toward understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the sleep deprivation and sleep/wake dysregulation. Sleep disorder is linked to changes in the structure and function of the neural basis of cognition. We reviewed the neural circuits related to sleep disorders, along with alterations in connectivity and brain region functions, based on advancements in electrophysiology and optogenetic/chemogenetic techniques. We subsequently outline the cellular and molecular modifications linked to sleep disorders in preclinical studies, primarily involving changes in neuronal metabolism, electrophysiological activity, synaptic plasticity, and glial cells. Correspondingly, on the basis of the crosstalk between the brain and peripheral organs, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the involvement of celiac disease and hepatic disease in the pathogenesis of sleep disorders. In this review, we mainly discussed the pathogenesis at molecular, cellular, and neural circuit levels that contribute to sleep disorder. The review also covered potential strategies for treating sleep disorders and future research avenues.
40066229	Pulmonary Hypertension: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Studies.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) stands as a tumor paradigm cardiovascular disease marked by hyperproliferation of cells and vascular remodeling, culminating in heart failure. Complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms collectively contribute to the disruption of pulmonary vascular homeostasis. In recent years, advancements in research technology have identified numerous gene deletions and mutations, in addition to <i>bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2</i>, that are closely associated with the vascular remodeling process in PH. Additionally, epigenetic modifications such as RNA methylation, DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs have been shown to precisely regulate PH molecular networks in a cell-type-specific manner, emerging as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review summarizes and analyzes the roles and molecular mechanisms of currently identified genes and epigenetic factors in PH, emphasizing the pivotal role of long ncRNAs in its regulation. Additionally, it examines current clinical and preclinical therapies for PH targeting these genes and epigenetic factors and explores potential new treatment strategies.
40066228	<i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> Promotes the Growth and Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer by Activating E-Cadherin/Krüppel-Like Factor 4/Integrin α5 Signaling in a Calcium-Dependent Manner.	Gut microbiota and integrins are known to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether they interact has been unclear. Here, we provided evidence that <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> upregulated integrin α5 (ITGA5) in CRC in both human patients and murine models. Knocking down <i>ITGA5</i> in CRC cells weakened the ability of <i>F. nucleatum</i> to stimulate their malignant characteristics. <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which in turn promoted interaction between E-cadherin and Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), resulting in KLF4 phosphorylation and translocation in the nucleus, where it induced <i>ITGA5</i> transcription and activated the downstream signaling. Knocking down E-cadherin or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> with BAPTA-AM antagonized the impact of <i>F. nucleatum</i> on KLF4, whereas knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> antagonized the bacteria's oncogenic role. Knocking down <i>KLF4</i> or <i>ITGA5</i> attenuated <i>F. nucleatum-</i>induced growth of patient-derived organoids, subcutaneous xenografts, and orthotopic tumors, as well as liver metastasis in nude mice. Integrin α5 antibody antagonized the oncogenic role of <i>F. nucleatum</i> in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that <i>F. nucleatum</i> promotes the growth and metastasis of CRC by activating E-cadherin/KLF4/integrin α5 signaling in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner.
