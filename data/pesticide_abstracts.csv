40066485	Highly Stable, Excellent Foliar Adhesion and Anti-Photodegradation Nucleic Acid-Peptide Coacervates for Broad Agrochemicals Delivery.	Agrochemicals play a pivotal role in the management of pests and diseases and the way agrochemicals are utilized exerts significant impacts on the environment. Ensuring rational application and improving utilization rates of agrochemicals are major demands in developing green delivery systems. Herein, a model of nucleic acid-peptide coacervate (NPC) for agrochemical delivery is presented, which is formed by mixing negatively charged single-stranded DNAs with positively charged poly-L-lysine. The NPC microsystem exhibits broad loading capacities for various types of agrochemicals. Furthermore, the NPCs demonstrate remarkable protection against photodegradation for photosensitive agrochemicals. In the foliar interactions, the NPCs exhibit excellent wetting performances and foliar adhesion on hydrophobic cabbage leaves and wheat leaves infected with powdery mildew to facilitate direct spaying in practical applications. Subsequently, the NPC microsystem is stabilized against coalescence by a charged comb polymer. Then, the NPC loaded with emamectin benzoates (EBs) exhibited significantly higher insecticidal activity compared to free EBs. This enhanced efficacy can be attributed to the higher insect uptake efficiency of the NPC formulation, as evidenced by fluorescent imaging of mosquito larvae. This coacervate model provides a new biocompatible and highly efficient system for future agrochemical delivery that actively contributes to eco-friendly and sustainable agriculture.
40066208	Assessment of fall-back MRLs for revoked CXLs previously implemented in the EU legislation.	In the 55th meeting of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR meeting) held in June 2024 and the subsequent 47th meeting of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) (November 2024), in total 111 Codex MRLs (CXLs) for 16 active substances (a.s.) were revoked. In accordance with Article 43 of Regulation (EC) 396/2005, EFSA was requested by the European Commission to identify the revoked CXLs which had been previously taken over in the EU MRL legislation (Regulation (EC) No 396/2005) and, if possible, propose fall-back maximum residue levels (MRLs) to replace the revoked CXLs. Based on the detailed assessment and taking into account the information provided by Member States, EFSA proposed fall-back MRLs for carbofuran in cotton seed and fluopyram/wheat. Risk management discussions are recommended to decide on the appropriate fall-back option for cyantraniliprole in soya beans. For difenoconazole, EFSA proposed to postpone the decision on a possible fall-back MRL, pending the outcome of the ongoing review of EU MRLs. For imazapyr/wheat and cyantraniliprole/beans and eggs, the existing MRLs will be replaced by new CXLs. The revocation of the other CXLs does not trigger a modification of the existing EU MRLs.
40066046	Antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of alpha-silver tungstate nanoparticles.	The growing global threat posed by microorganisms resistant to conventional antimicrobials underscores the urgent need for novel agents to control infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of alpha-silver tungstate (α-Ag<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by the ultrasonic method. The NPs were characterized, and their antimicrobial activity was assessed against <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> using the broth microdilution method, determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected by fluorescence using the CM-H₂DCFDA probe. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using murine L929 fibroblasts by MTT assay. Cell viability of both microorganisms and L929 fibroblasts was further assessed using Confocal Laser Scanning Fluorescence Microscopy (CLSM). For <i>C. albicans</i>, the MIC was 3.90 μg/mL, and the MFC was 7.81 μg/mL. For <i>S. aureus</i>, the MIC and MBC were both 62.50 μg/mL, while <i>E. coli</i> exhibited MIC and MBC values of 0.48 μg/mL. The biocompatibility assay revealed a significant reduction in cell viability at concentrations starting from 15.62 μg/mL. CLSM images corroborated the results from both microbiological and biocompatibility assays. Additionally, ROS production was detected in all three microorganisms upon exposure to the NPs, confirming their antimicrobial mechanism. In conclusion, α-Ag₂WO₄ NPs effectively inactivated <i>C. albicans</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, and <i>E. coli</i>. However, a higher concentration was required to inhibit <i>S. aureus</i> compared to <i>E. coli</i> and <i>C. albicans</i>. The biocompatibility assay revealed concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects. These findings highlight the potential of α-Ag<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> NPs as antimicrobial agents and suggest further research into their efficacy against biofilms, optimization of their biocompatibility, and the application of these nanomaterials in the incorporation and coating of materials used in biomedical and dental devices.
40065631	Genome Mining and Antagonism of Stenotrophomonas geniculata MK-1, Against Peanut Foliage Fungus Diseases.	Stenotrophomonas geniculata, a bacterium, has been recognized as an eco-friendly substitute for chemical fungicides in managing peanut foliar diseases, web blotch, and early leaf spot. Core genome and pan-genome analysis identified that strain MK-1 belongs to Stenotrophomonas geniculata, and nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis confirmed that strain belongs to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The research revealed that S. geniculata MK-1 had a notable antagonistic impact on Peyronellaea arachidicola and Cercospora arachidicola and demonstrated a biocontrol efficacy of over 95% against peanut early leaf spot and web blotch disease. The nonredundant protein sequences (NR) database identified 4324 annotations related to S. geniculata, with 2682 genes similar to strain MK-1. The COG database categorized 3041 annotations into 22 functional groups, and 33 distinct metabolic pathways associated with 1851 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations. Most genes linked with metabolism are found in S. geniculata, with 380 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 44 genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database identified 194 annotations are linked to non-ribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites. The Pathogen-Host Interactions (PHI) database showed reduced virulence in strain MK-1, while unaffected pathogenicity protein counts were 52. The MK-1 strain can produce antifungal siderophores secondary metabolites, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and siderophores.
40065412	Efficacy of a novel chewable tablet (Credelio Quattro<sup>™</sup>) containing lotilaner, moxidectin, praziquantel, and pyrantel for the treatment and control of Echinococcus multilocularis and E. granulosus infections in dogs.	While generally harmless to dogs, the cestode species Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis have significant zoonotic importance, causing cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis in humans, respectively. Regular deworming is essential to treat intestinal cestode infections in dogs and to reduce environmental egg contamination and thus the subsequent zoonotic risk of infection to intermediate hosts and humans. The studies described here evaluated the efficacy of a new novel chewable tablet combination containing lotilaner, moxidectin, praziquantel and pyrantel (Credelio Quattro, Elanco Animal Health) against E. granulosus and E. multilocularis infections in dogs.
40065246	Epigallocatechin -3- gallate mitigates diazinon neurotoxicity via suppression of pro-inflammatory genes and upregulation of antioxidant pathways.	Diazinon is a commonly used organophosphate (OP) insecticide especially in developing countries for the control of insect pests, however, exposure to its toxic impact especially in humans and other non-target species remains an important public health concern. The study aimed to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin -3- gallate (EGCG), abundant in green tea plants on neurobehavioural, biochemical, and pathological changes in the brain of male Wistar rats following exposure to diazinon toxicity. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were acclimatized for seven days and subsequently randomly assigned into six treatment groups as follows: Group I: Control group (0.2 mL distilled water); Group II: Diazinon at 3 mg/kg (1% LD50); Group III: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (50 mg/kg, ~ 2% of LD50); Group IV: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (100 mg/kg, ~ 5% of LD50); Group V: EGCG (50 mg/kg) and Group VI: EGCG (100 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally once daily for 14 days. Neurobehavioural studies, biomarkers of oxidative stress, histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) were performed. Diazinon alone impaired recognition memory, increased oxidative stress markers and altered antioxidant defense in the brain. It upregulated TNF-α and IL-6 genes and repressed GPx 4 gene expressions. It was also associated with increased GFAP, Tau, and α-SN immunoreactivity. Microscopic examination revealed loss of Purkinje and hippocampal cells in brain. Co-treatment with EGCG however improved cognition, lowered oxidative stress markers, improved antioxidant status and suppressed TNF-α and IL-6. In conclusion, findings from this study demonstrated that EGCG offered protection against diazinon-induced neurotoxicity. Hence, natural sources of epigallocatechin -3- gallate such as fruits and vegetables could offer immense benefits by protecting against oxidative stress and inflammation in neurodegenerative disease conditions.Clinical trial number Not applicable.
40064929	Robust Fe-N<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> single atom sites for efficient PMS activation and enhanced Fe<sup>IV</sup> = O reactivity.	The microenvironment regulation of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> single atom catalysts (SACs) critically governs peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Although conventional heteroatom substitution in primary coordination enhances activity, it disrupts Fe-N<sub>4</sub> symmetry and compromises stability. Herein, we propose oxygen doping in the secondary coordination shell to construct Fe-N<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> SAC, which amplifies the localized electric field while preserving the pristine coordination symmetry, thus trading off its activity and stability. This approach suppresses Fe-N bond structural deformation (bond amplitude reduced from 0.875-3.175 Å to 0.925-2.975 Å) during PMS activation by lowering Fe center electron density to strengthen Fe-N bond, achieving extended catalytic durability (>240 h). Simultaneously, the weakened coordination field lowers the Fe=O σ* orbital energy, promoting electrophilic σ-attack of high-valent iron-oxo towards bisphenol A, and increasing its degradation rate by 41.6-fold. This work demonstrates secondary coordination engineering as a viable strategy to resolve the activity-stability trade-off in SAC design, offering promising perspectives for developing environmental catalysts.
40064926	Assessment of organophosphate pesticides in soils and vegetables from agricultural areas of Delta Central District, Nigeria.	The application of agrochemicals such as organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) has several benefits in agriculture but also poses great risks to the environment and human well-being. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the concentrations, distribution pattern, relationships, potential risks and sources of OPPs in agricultural soils and vegetables from Delta Central District (DCD) of Nigeria to provide useful information for pollution history, establishment of pollution control measures and risk management. Fourteen OPPs were determined in the soil and vegetables using a gas chromatograph-mass selective detector (GC-MSD). The ∑14 OPPs concentrations varied from 5.29 to 419 ng g<sup>-1</sup> for soil and 0.69 to 130 ng g<sup>-1</sup> for vegetables. On average, pirimiphos methyl (23.8 ng g<sup>-1</sup>) and diazinone (4.74 ng g<sup>-1</sup>) were the dominant OPPs in soils and vegetables respectively. The cumulative ecological risk assessed using the toxicity-exposure-ratio (TER) and risk quotient (RQ) approaches revealed that there was a high risk of OPPs to soil organisms. The increasing order of OPPs toxicity to the soil organisms was chlorpyriphos < fenitrothion < diazinone < pirimiphos methyl while the cumulative human health risk suggested there was adverse non-carcinogenic risk for children but not for adults exposed to OPPs in these agricultural soils and vegetables.
40064833	Advances in biosynthesis of chiral amide herbicides and the key enzymes: dimethenamid-P and S-metolachlor as case studies.	Chiral amide herbicides represent a significant class of agrochemicals, widely used for effective weed control. Prominent examples include S-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P, both of which share the intermediate (S)-1-methoxy-2-propylamine, a key structural component in their synthesis. Developing green and sustainable methods for producing this intermediate is crucial for enhancing the environmental and economic feasibility of herbicide manufacturing. Biosynthesis, with its advantages in sustainability and efficiency, has emerged as a pivotal approach in pesticide production. This review explores the classification and current development status of chiral amide herbicides, including their varieties and applications in the agricultural market. It outlines the synthesis pathways for S-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P, covering both chemical and biosynthetic routes. The review also highlights the functional properties of the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of (S)-1-methoxy-2-propylamine, focusing on the potential for enzyme engineering and creation to optimize these pathways. The challenges and future development directions for amide herbicides are discussed, with an emphasis on overcoming synthetic and ecological barriers.
40064749	Far-red light-driven photoautotrophy of chlorophyll f-producing cyanobacterium without red-shifted phycobilisome core complex.	Chlorophyll (Chl) f production expands oxygenic photosynthesis of some cyanobacteria into the far-red light (FRL) region through reconstructed FRL-allophycocyanin (APC) cores and Chl f-containing photosystems. Presently, a unicellular cyanobacterium was isolated for studying FRL photoacclimation (FaRLiP) and classified as a new species Altericista leshanensis. It uses additional Chl f and FRL-APC cores, with retained white light (WL)-phycobiliproteins to thrive FRL conditions. Marker-less deletion of FaRLiP-apcE2 gene was constructed using CRISPR-Cpf1 system. This genetic manipulation has no significant effects on the expression of genes in the FaRLiP gene cluster, including adjacent apc genes under FRL conditions. The function-loss mutant cells cannot assemble FRL-APC cores, and show the decreased growth rate and Chl f production under FRL conditions. Interestingly, the expression levels of phycocyanin (PC) subunits (cpc) and photosystem II D1 proteins (psbA2) are significantly increased in mutant cells under FRL conditions. These results suggest that FRL acclimation in the mutant cells has a different photosynthetic apparatus due to the lack of FRL-APC cores. The alternative strategy of FaRLiP provides additional evidence of flexible pathways towards the potential application of Chl f and associated biotechnology.
40064669	Occurrence, Removal, and Ecological and Human Health Risk Assessment of 18 Endocrine Disrupting Compounds in Wastewater Treatment Plants in Nanjing, China.	This study analyzed the characteristics of 18 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) detected in four wastewater treatment plants in Nanjing, China. The removal efficiency, ecological and health risks of EDCs were evaluated. The results showed that EDCs were detected to different degrees, with prednisone as the main contributor, and the total concentrations of EDCs ranged from 532.89 to 8535.88 ng/L and 14.98 to 128.91 ng/L, respectively. Most of the EDCs were significantly decreased after secondary treatment, with removal efficiencies ranging from 9.7% to 100%. The ecological risk assessment showed that trenbolone and norethindrone had the highest risk quotients and posed a high risk to aquatic organisms. The health risk evaluation suggested that the health risk values in the cases of adult drinking water route, children's drinking water route, and adult exposure route were all less than 1, indicating that EDCs did not pose significant non-carcinogenic health hazards to humans.
40064439	Reshaped local microbiology metabolism by raw tea according to pile fermentation in the dark tea.	Traditionally, the mechanism of dark tea quality formation has centered on microorganisms, with quality regulated by manipulating microorganisms and their fermentation environment. Nevertheless, raw teas, the natural selective medium of microbial community, was completely ignored in the formation of dark tea unique flavors.
40064349	Distribution and Accumulation Dynamics of Fungicide Azoxystrobin in the Soil-Plant System.	Azoxystrobin is a widely used fungicide belonging to the strobilurin group, primarily employed to control a range of fungal diseases in crops, including pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). As a systemic pesticide, it effectively inhibits mitochondrial respiration in fungi, thereby preventing their growth and spread. However, concerns have emerged regarding its environmental persistence and potential bioaccumulation in soil-plant systems. This study conducted a field study and utilized HPLC-MS/MS for sample analysis, investigating the distribution and accumulation dynamics of azoxystrobin in the soil-plant system, with a focus on its behavior in different soil depths and plant tissues. The results show that pesticide concentration in the shoots remained consistently low throughout the observation period. In contrast, the concentration in roots gradually increased over time, with a peak observed in the top soil around the 10th day (16.56 mg/kg), followed by a rapid decrease to 1.44 mg/kg by the 14th day after application. The pesticide concentration in the subsurface soil remained relatively stable, reaching 0.91 mg/kg by the 35th day. The percentage distribution of pesticides in different parts of the system was as follows: top soil > subsurface soil > roots > shoots. The biological concentration factor (BCF) was greater than 1 during the early and middle-late growth stages, and both the biological accumulation coefficient (BAC) and translocation factor (TF) remained consistently below 1. This study highlights the role of the top soil as a primary pesticide reservoir and suggests limited translocation efficiency from roots to shoots. This pattern of accumulation could have significant implications for environmental health by indicating potential risks of pesticide persistence in the soil, emphasizing the need for further research on optimizing agricultural practices to mitigate pesticide accumulation in the environment.
40064255	Pesticide-fertilizer synergistic alginate-based hydrogel for enhanced pesticide retention and nutrient optimization against apple Valsa canker.	The prevalence of apple Valsa canker (AVC) poses a significant threat to the vitality of apple trees, jeopardizing the progress of the apple industry. Current strategies have proven inadequate in managing the disease effectively due to challenges such as extended duration and frequent relapses, especially low-adhesion vertical target. Herein, we introduce a pesticide-fertilizer synergistic alginate-based hydrogel (P&F-Gel) to enhance long-term pesticide retention and offer nutrient supplementation without labor-intensive practices. By sequentially spraying a suspension concentrate with sodium alginate (SA) as thickening agent, followed by a cross-linked fertilizer (CCF) dominated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and other nutrient, rapid in-situ gelation is achieved on the low-adhesion vertical xylem surface. P&F-Gel demonstrates strong in-situ adhesion, long-term retention, and flush resistance, with temperature-triggered pesticide release making it suitable for field applications in humid and warm climates where AVC often breaks out. Additionally, P&F-Gel exhibits superior antifungal efficacy in vitro and in orchard, due to its capacity to isolate oxygen and inhibit fungal proliferation. Overall, our P&F-Gel represents the first use of a hydrogel strategy in trunk treatment, which provided a possibility to control AVC without intensive labor and protect apple trees from recurrence for over 6 months, paving the way for modern sustainable agriculture.
40063867	Impact of mass drug administration with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole for lymphatic filariasis on hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis infections in Papua New Guinea.	Persons with lymphatic filariasis (LF) are often co-infected with soil-transmitted helminths. A single co-administered dose of ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (IDA) is recommended by WHO for mass drug administration (MDA) for LF instead of diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (DA) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). We compared the effectiveness of a single round of MDA with IDA or DA on hookworm and strongyloidiasis in PNG.
40063805	Sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to multiple <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> traits in transgenic maize.	Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.
40063644	Leishmaniasis in deployed military populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Leishmaniasis affects military personnel deployed to endemic areas following exposure to sand flies infected with the protozoa Leishmania. This systematic review and meta-analysis of data specific to military populations aims to identify knowledge gaps to mitigate sand fly exposure and Leishmania transmission during deployments. The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023463687). Random-effects meta-analyses and narrative synthesis were performed. Thirty-six studies were included, most of which reported on cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), showing a mean cumulative incidence of 10% (95% CI: 5-16), suggesting higher rates in the Eastern Mediterranean region (14% [95% CI: 12-16]) compared to the African region (8%) and American region (9%). Asymptomatic Leishmania infection had a cumulative incidence of 11% (95% CI: 6-17), with higher rates in Eastern Mediterranean countries (20% [95% CI: 14-25]). Diagnosis involved parasitological, serological, and molecular methods, with L. (L) mexicana and L. (V.) braziliensis identified as the predominant CL pathogens in deployed troops in the Americas. Visceral leishmaniasis cases were less frequent, all reported from the Eastern Mediterranean and associated with the Leishmania donovani/infantum complex; whereas CL cases in the Old World were due predominantly to L. major and L. tropica. Regular use of long-lasting insecticidal nets to mitigate sand fly exposure demonstrated high potential effectiveness than other reported personal protective measures (PPMs) which yielded mixed or inconclusive results. In summary, the systematic review revealed the substantial variability between study designs and statistical integrity. There is need for more consistent and robustly designed studies including well-define controls and replication. Future studies would be advised to explore the long-term effectiveness and practicality of PPMs, both individually and in combination, across diverse deployment settings.
40063614	Genome-wide association analysis of Septoria tritici blotch for adult plant resistance in elite bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L) genotypes.	Septoria tritici blotch (STB) is a predominant foliar disease of wheat, caused by the pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. This disease can lead to substantial yield losses warranting control by using expensive fungicides. One effective method of STB control is the utilization of resistant wheat varieties. In this particular study, a panel comprising of 186 bread wheat genotypes was assessed for their adult plant resistance (APR) to STB. Field trials were conducted across five environments in Ethiopia during the 2022 and 2023 growing seasons under natural infestation conditions. The association panel was genotyped using 20K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. To determine the relationship between genetic markers and STB resistance, a mixed linear model (MLM) analysis was performed using the statgen GWAS R software package. Heritability estimates for STB resistance ranged from 0.39 to 0.95, underscoring the genetic variability and the potential for selection. The study identified 52 marker-trait associations (MTAs) for STB resistance at maturity (SDSM) and 62 MTAs at heading (SDSH). Chromosome 5A contains a high concentration of MTAs that confer resistance to STB, hosting multiple significant MTAs, including four consistently associated markers ('Kukri_c10033_724', 'RAC875_rep_c116420_103', 'TG0019', and 'RAC875_c30566_230'). Additionally, chromosomes 1B, 2B, 5B, and 7A were found to harbor important MTAs, contributing to resistance across various environments. Notably, two QTLs, qtSTB23 (5A) and qtSTB38 (7B), exhibited stability across multiple environments, making them robust candidates for breeding programs. Furthermore, novel resistance loci on chromosome 2A were discovered, offering new opportunities for enhancing resistance. Therefore, these findings provide an opportunity for improving STB resistance through gene stacking using marker-assisted selection (MAS).
40063342	Evaluation of in vivo fish and amphibian endocrine test guideline assays: current status and future needs.	Endocrine pathways are crucial in regulating physiological functions in organisms, including growth and development, metabolism, tissue function, and reproduction. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with normal hormonal function and lead to adverse effects in organisms and/or their offspring. As a result, regulatory testing and assessment requirements have been implemented to identify and regulate EDCs-defined by the World Health Organization as chemicals that alter the function of an endocrine system and cause "subsequent adverse effects in an intact organism, its progeny, or (sub)populations" - although the approaches taken for assessment vary worldwide. As such, the current typical ecotoxicological assessment paradigm for EDCs involves initial testing for endocrine activity using in vitro and lower-tier in vivo assays, followed by higher-tier in vivo testing which can provide additional endocrine mechanistic data and establishes any consequent adversity. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among other entities, have validated and adopted standardized in vivo test guidelines for mammals, fish, and amphibians. These tests can be challenging and take months to perform, and many require the use of large numbers of laboratory animals. This paper summarizes the current state of the science for evaluating the endocrine disrupting potential of chemicals in fish and amphibians using in vivo test guideline assays across the estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and steroidogenesis modalities. Current challenges associated with conducting and interpreting the in vivo assays are discussed. Opportunities and potential next steps to strengthen this growing area of testing are explored, including potential to inform development and application of new approach methodologies and thereby reduce reliance on using laboratory animals.
40063328	Broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of linalool: supporting its pharmacological use in chronic wound infections by pathogens within the ESKAPE group and polymicrobial biofilms.	Chronic wound infections are caused by biofilm forming opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. The persistence of infection, co-infecting pathogens and prolonged use of antibiotics promote antibiotic resistance hampering healing process due to increased inflammation. Hence, we tested the broad range antibacterial activity of linalool, a bioactive monoterpene commonly present in many essential oils having anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities to target different opportunistic pathogens commonly found in the chronic wound. We included some of the common pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, to study the broad range antimicrobial efficacy of linalool. The in vitro effect of linalool on biofilm was quantified in pre-treatment, post-treatment, repetitive treatment, and polymicrobial biofilm scenarios. Time-kill and XTT (2,3-bis [2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2 H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) assays were performed to confirm the efficacy of linalool against wound infections, and these results were further validated using simulated wound exudates medium (WEM) which mimics the wound environment. The mechanism of bactericidal action was determined using assays for membrane integrity and oxidative stress. The results indicated the broad range antimicrobial activity of linalool with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 2.5 to 5 µL/mL against E. coli, A. baumannii, E. faecalis, S. aureus, and K. pneumoniae, while for P. aeruginosa the MIC was 20 µL/mL. Linalool was most effective against E. coli, E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and S. aureus, and could inhibit the growth and biofilm by more than 90% and 80%, respectively, at 5 µL/mL. The XTT assay confirmed the MIC results, showing a significant reduction in the metabolic activity of the pathogens (p < 0.001). In the simulated WEM similar response of the bacteria to linalool treatment was observed. At 5 to 20 µL/mL concentrations, linalool significantly inhibited the polymicrobial biofilm consisting of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and S. aureus in two species combinations. The mechanism of bactericidal action was associated with the increased reactive oxygen species production and disruption in the membrane integrity leading to release of cellular content. The anti-inflammatory activity of linalool, assessed using the albumin denaturation method showed significant activity at the tested concentrations. In conclusion, the findings suggest the therapeutic potential of linalool in treating biofilm associated chronic wound infections due to its versatile broad spectrum activity.
40063176	Alleviation of glyphosate-induced toxicity by Horseradish tree (Moringa oleifera) Leaf extract and phytase in Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) highlighting the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities.	The danger posed by waterborne toxicity from herbicides endangers the aquatic ecosystem. Using dietary medicinal herbs is a useful approach to mitigate the effects of herbicide toxicity on aquatic animals. This study attempts to examine the consequences and potential mechanisms behind the dietary addition of horseradish tree (Moringa oleifera) leaf extract (MOLE) with the help of phytase addition to check the overall growth performance, biochemical changes, histological alteration, and gene expression in normal and after glyphosate challenge in Nile tilapia. A total number of 135 Nile tilapia fish (7.93 ± 0.03 g) were randomly assigned into three groups each in triplicate. The first group is the control group and fed basal diet; the second group supplied with MOLE (200 mg of extract/kg), and the third group was supplied with MOLE (200 mg /kg), and phytase (0.2g/ kg) for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, each experimental group was divided into two subgroups to be unchallenged and challenged with glyphosate (30 mg/L of water). The results declared significant enhancements (P < 0.05) in Weight Gain Percent (WG%), Specific growth rate (SGR), and Protein efficiency ratio (PER) and reducing feed conversion ratio (FCR) with up-regulating hepatic gh, igf1,myogenine, intestinal ghrelin and NPY in fish groups fed MOLE and phytase compared with the control group. Moreover, improving the hepatic antioxidant capacity while down-regulating hepatic igf1bp, myostatin. Interstingly, MOLE and phytase lightened glyphosate-induced biochemical alterations, antioxidants, apoptosis, and inflammation-associated genes compared to the glyphosate-challenged group. Interestingly, UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis recognized 16 compounds encompasing two glucosinolates, three flavonoids, one phenolic and three alkaloids in addition to four fatty acids, a terpenoid, one phytate and an aromatic glycoside. These components might be accountable for the potential effects exerted by MOLE. Therefore, the current study suggests that dietary supplementation to MOLE and phytase can be used as substitute feed supplements in sustainable farming of Nile tilapia to defend against glyphosate challenges and enhance growth, antioxidant capacity, exerting anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects under normal health conditions or post glyphosate challenge.
40062997	Polyoxometalates for the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxide and its derivatives: from novel structures to functional applications.	Nitrogen oxide and its derivatives, including nitroaromatic hydrocarbons and various other nitro compounds, are commonly used in industrial applications such as synthesizing drugs, dyes, pesticides, and explosives. However, these compounds are also highly toxic to the environment. Their long-term accumulation can significantly affect air and water quality and disrupt ecosystems. Thus, efficiently converting these harmful compounds into more valuable products through catalytic processes is an urgent challenge in chemical catalysis. In this regard, polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as promising inorganic molecular catalysts for the reduction of nitrogen oxide and its derivatives. Their unique structure, excellent redox properties, and versatile catalytic abilities contribute to their effectiveness.

40062965	Toxicokinetics for organ-on-chip devices.	Organ-on-chip (OOC) devices are an emerging New Approach Method in both pharmacology and toxicology. Such devices use heterotypic combinations of human cells in a micro-fabricated device to mimic <i>in vivo</i> conditions and better predict organ-specific toxicological responses in humans. One drawback of these devices is that they are often made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a polymer known to interact with hydrophobic chemicals. Due to this interaction, the actual dose experienced by cells inside OOC devices can differ strongly from the nominal dose. To account for these effects, we have developed a comprehensive model to characterize chemical-PDMS interactions, including partitioning into and diffusion through PDMS. We use these methods to characterize PDMS interactions for 24 chemicals, ranging from fluorescent dyes to persistent organic pollutants to organophosphate pesticides. We further show that these methods return physical interaction parameters that can be used to accurately predict time-dependent doses under continuous-flow conditions, as would be present in an OOC device. These results demonstrate the validity of the methods and model across geometries and flow rates.

40062902	Development of Metal-Organic Framework-Based Emamectin Benzoate Nanopesticides for Effective Control of <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>.	Pine wilt disease is caused by <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i> invasion and has a great impact on global pine resources. Injection of emamectin benzoate (EB) into pine trunks is an effective way to control <i>B. xylophilus</i>. However, EB has limited aqueous solubility, easily photodissociates, and its long-term use causes resistance problems. In this study, the metal-organic framework material ZIF-8 was prepared, and EB was loaded onto ZIF-8 through physical adsorption, resulting in a pH-responsive EB@ZIF-8 nanopesticide with a high drug loading rate (36.04%). Simulated release experiments of EB@ZIF-8 under different pH conditions showed a cumulative release of 64.43% within 10 h at pH 5.0, which increased as the pH decreased, compared to conditions at pH 7.0 and 9.0. EB@ZIF-8 showed positive insecticidal activity in a laboratory biological test (LC<sub>50</sub> = 52.503 mg/L). In addition, 7 days after trunk injection in <i>Pinus massoniana</i>, EB residuals were detected in all parts of the branches, with the lowest residue level being 73.39 mg/kg. The proportion of the EB residue in the lower, middle, and upper branches of <i>P. massoniana</i> gradually increased, reaching 43.92% at 28 days after trunk injection, indicating that EB was distributed evenly in the tree. Therefore, EB@ZIF-8 had good morphology, structure, and pH-responsive release performance. EB@ZIF-8 also exhibited a high nematocidal ability due to its smaller particle size and rapid transport in <i>P. massoniana</i>. This study provides a new approach for the development of highly effective EB preparations, improvement of pesticide utilization, and <i>B. xylophilus</i> control.
40062488	Sensitivity to Boscalid and Trifloxystrobin and Fitness of <i>Corynespora cassiicola</i> Associated with <i>CcSdh</i> & <i>CcCytb</i> in Cucumber.	The extensive use of succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) and quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) has led to the development of resistance in <i>Corynespora cassiicola</i>, which causes corynespora leaf spot (CLS) in cucumber. In this study, the sensitivity and the resistance phenotypes to SDHIs and QoIs were monitored, and the fitness of <i>C. cassiicola</i> carrying <i>CcSdh</i> & <i>CcCytb</i> mutations was measured. The average 50% effective suppressive concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values of <i>C. cassiicola</i> to boscalid from 2019 to 2021 ranged from 6.65 to 24.16 μg/mL, while the average EC<sub>50</sub> values of <i>C. cassiicola</i> to trifloxystrobin from 2007 to 2021 ranged from 105.11 to 462.02 μg/mL. Ten fungicide resistance phenotypes and 19 resistance genotypes were found. The D-D95E&Cytb-G143A and B-H278L&Cytb-G143A mutants presented increased fitness, while the B-H278Y&Cytb-G143A mutant showed significant fitness costs, and the other mutants presented no or slight fitness costs. These findings provide a basis for the formulation of resistance management strategies of CLS.
40062477	Molecular Insights into Pharmacological Mechanism of Insect Kir Channels and the Toxicity of Kir Inhibitors on Hemipteran Insects.	Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) play a key role in regulating various physiological processes. However, the structural and pharmacological mechanisms of insect Kir channels remain unclear. In this study, we show that coexpression of different Kir subunits in the same tissue did not affect the rectification properties of strongly rectifying Kir. The Kir inhibitor VU041, along with the insecticide flonicamid and its metabolite flumetnicam, were tested for their inhibitory effects on the homotetrameric Kir1 and Kir2 channels. Both Kir1 and Kir2 channels from the two insect species showed similar pharmacological responses to VU041, flonicamid, and flumetnicam. However, VU041 demonstrated significantly higher inhibitory activity than both insecticides across all four Kir channels, while flumetnicam exhibited the weakest inhibition. Molecular docking analyses indicate that the binding site of VU041 is not the same as that of flonicamid, and flumetnicam. flonicamid, and flumetnicam have binding sites similar to the ATP binding sites in cytoplasmic region of human Kir6.2, whereas VU041 is located in the pore of the ion channel, and serves as a pore blocker that inhibits Kir channels. Mutation analysis confirmed the essential roles of these residues in channel function and binding affinity. Finally, the toxicities of the three inhibitors were evaluated in <i>N. lugens</i> and <i>M. persicae</i>. VU041, a potent inhibitor of the insect Kir channel, showed lower toxicity compared to the other two inhibitors, whereas flumethoxan, which is less active on the Kir1 channel, showed higher toxicity, probably related to the different bioavailability of the different compounds. These findings suggest that the potential of targeting Kir channels as insecticidal strategies requires further evaluation.
40062248	A systematic review of deep learning techniques for apple leaf diseases classification and detection.	Agriculture sustains populations and provides livelihoods, contributing to socioeconomic growth. Apples are one of the most popular fruits and contains various antioxidants that reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Additionally, they are low in calories, making them a healthy snack option for all ages. However, several factors can adversely affect apple production. These issues include diseases that drastically lower yield and quality and cause farmers to lose millions of dollars. To minimize yield loss and economic effects, it is essential to diagnose apple leaf diseases accurately and promptly. This allows targeted pesticide and insecticide use. However, farmers find it difficult to distinguish between different apple leaf diseases since their symptoms are quite similar. Computer vision applications have become an effective tool in recent years for handling these issues. They can provide accurate disease detection and classification through massive image datasets. This research analyzes and evaluates datasets, deep learning methods and frameworks built for apple leaf disease detection and classification. A systematic analysis of 45 articles published between 2016 and 2024 was conducted to evaluate the latest developments, approaches, and research needs in this area.
40062144	From Nature to Emergency: Cardiac Complications Following the Consumption of Unwashed Fruit.	<i>Ziziphus spina-Christi</i> (Sidr) is widely used for its medicinal and nutritional properties, with documented pharmacological effects such as antidiabetic, sedative, and antihypertensive activities. However, its consumption, especially in unregulated settings, can pose significant health risks due to potential toxicity and contamination with pesticides. We report the case of a 25-year-old male who presented with severe abdominal pain radiating to the chest, profound bradycardia (heart rate in the 20s), hypotension (systolic blood pressure in the 50s), and autonomic symptoms after ingesting unwashed <i>Z. spina-Christi</i> fruit. Initial investigations revealed Mobitz type I second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, transient ST depression, and elevated troponin levels, raising suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, comprehensive cardiac evaluations, including CT coronary angiography and cardiac MRI, excluded ischemic and structural cardiac causes. A detailed history revealed the ingestion of unwashed fruit, suggesting toxicity exacerbated by pesticide exposure. The patient responded well to supportive care, including atropine, and was discharged on the fourth day with a complete resolution of symptoms. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge posed by toxic ingestions mimicking ACS. Although it is not clear if <i>Z. spina-Christi</i> induced cardiotoxic effects at higher doses, the pesticide contamination could have also contributed to cardiotoxicity. Clinicians should consider toxicological etiologies in patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms, especially when linked to potential exposures. Early recognition and prompt management are critical for favorable outcomes.
40060804	A Comparative Analysis of Cockroach and Mosquito, Octopamine Receptor Homologues Produced Using Chimera, Swiss-Model, and AlphaFold Molecular Modeling Tools.	Homology modeling can help bridge the gap between missing 3D structures and available primary sequences of protein. More environmentally friendlier insecticides against domestic nuisance can target the octopamine receptor proteins, only expressed in invertebrates. Herein, octopamine receptor homologues from <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, which do not have tertiary structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), were built using homology modeling and evaluated with various molecular modeling tools. AlphaFold models (AFM), which use artificial intelligence from DeepMind, showed structural validity when superimposed on Swiss-Model models (SMM) for both insect octopamine receptor species. The UCSF Chimera and Modeler models (CMM) did not match those by AlphaFold and Swiss-Model irrespective of the insect species receptor model compared. The greatest discrepancy between any two structures resulted between AFM and CMM with only 21.46% similarity and 14.92% similarity between backbone αCs of their superimposed 3D structures, respectively, for cockroach and mosquito, yet their primary sequences are highly identical. The highest sequence identity for superimposed 3D structures occurred between AFM and SMM of cockroach at 75%, and their corresponding mosquito sequence at 35.12% just surpassed the threshold of pairwise structural validity set above 30%. The local model quality obtained from ProSA web server ranks AFM above SMM and CMM in that order, even though all models had good <i>z</i>-scores. Ramachandran plot paints a different picture where the CMM have a higher percentage of residues in the accepted zone and AFM have a few residues in the wrong places. However, the data from VADAR statistics show that AFM models are more thermodynamically stable with lower fraction of buried amino acids or charges. Docking studies conducted on UCSF Chimera software showed similarity in active site residues for AFM and SMM involved in a number of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. These include residues GLU202, LEU102, ASP95, and ASP105 for cockroach models and residues VAL24 and LEU174 for mosquito models. The active site of all protein models contains some identical residues found in bound complexes including GLU, LEU, APS, and SER, which happen to be in different positions. ANOVA analysis revealed no significant difference in docking energies, an indication that even when active site residues are different, they still conserve the essential qualities needed for binding. Thus, despite the differences in structures, based on validation evaluation, such differences are unlikely to affect binding with octopamine. However, for studies where the quaternary structure of a protein is crucial, the AFM that preserves the full quaternary structure is recommendable.
40060723	Temporal Variation in Bacterial Community Characteristics Shaped by Habitat in a Reservoir Buffer Strip in China.	Habitat and temporal variation can both influence microbial community dynamics, although their relative importance in reservoir buffer zones with complex hydrology regimes and dramatically altered environments remains controversial. To elucidate this, we investigated spatiotemporal variation in soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes from the flooding period to the dry period (April and June, respectively) using high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing in three habitats (abandoned cropland, grassland, and woodland) within the Chushandian Reservoir's buffer strip, China. The results showed that habitat was more important than temporal variation in shaping soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes in the reservoir buffer zone. Bacterial communities responded to temporal variation both in terms of species composition and function; temporal variation affected bacterial communities mostly by altering the abundance of shared species and by causing the resurgence or extinction of specific taxa within the same habitat. The main driver of these changes was the resilience capacity of habitats to the changing moisture environment. The magnitude and underlying mechanisms of the changes in bacterial community diversity and ecological processes differed markedly between the three habitats, owing mostly to the characteristics of their vegetation, thus the allocation ratios of different habitat vegetation types and landscape diversity should pay attention for the reservoir buffer zone management, improving the integrated ecological benefits of the reservoir ecosystem from a multiscale.
40060593	Reference Library for Suspect Non-targeted Screening of Environmental Toxicants Using Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry.	As our health is affected by the xenobiotic chemicals we are exposed to, it is important to rapidly assess these molecules both in the environment and our bodies. Targeted analytical methods coupling either gas or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS or LC-MS) are commonly utilized in current exposure assessments. While these methods are accepted as the gold standard for exposure analyses, they often require multiple sample preparation steps and more than 30 minutes per sample. This throughput limitation is a critical gap for exposure assessments and has resulted in an evolving interest in using ion mobility spectrometry and MS (IMS-MS) for non-targeted studies. IMS-MS is a unique technique due to its rapid analytical capabilities (millisecond scanning) and detection of a wide range of chemicals based on unique collision cross section (CCS) and mass-to-charge ( <i>m/z</i> ) values. To increase the availability of IMS-MS information for exposure studies, here we utilized drift tube IMS-MS to evaluate 4,685 xenobiotic chemical standards from the Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) program including pesticides, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). In the analyses, 3,993 [M+H] <sup>+</sup> , [M+Na] <sup>+</sup> , [M-H] <sup>-</sup> and [M+] <sup>+</sup> ion types were observed with high confidence and reproducibility (≤1% error intra-laboratory and ≤2% inter-laboratory) from 2,140 unique chemicals. These values were then assembled into an openly available multidimensional database and uploaded to PubChem to enable rapid IMS-MS suspect screening for a wide range of environmental contaminants, faster response time in environmental exposure assessments, and assessments of xenobiotic-disease connections.
40060473	Deletion of core septin gene <i>aspB</i> in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> results in fungicidal activity of caspofungin.	Septins are a family of GTP-binding proteins found in many eukaryotic lineages. Although highly conserved throughout many eukaryotes, their functions vary across species. In <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> , the etiological agent of invasive aspergillosis, septins participate in a variety of processes such as cell wall organization of conidia, septation, and response to cell wall stress. Previous studies determined that the Δ <i>aspB</i> strain had a greater sensitivity to anti-cell wall drugs, especially the echinocandin caspofungin, yet mechanisms behind this augmented sensitivity are unknown. We performed cell viability staining of the deletion strains post-caspofungin exposure and found that the Δ <i>aspA</i> , Δ <i>aspB</i> , and Δ <i>aspC</i> strains have significantly lower cell viability. Concomitant with the reduced viability, deletion strains are more susceptible to caspofungin on solid media. These results indicate that the septin cytoskeleton is important for <i>A. fumigatus</i> survival in the presence of caspofungin. Due to the potential of improved therapeutic outcome, we followed up using a neutropenic murine model of invasive aspergillosis. Animals infected with the Δ <i>aspB</i> strain and treated with caspofungin showed improved survival compared to the animals infected with <i>akuB</i> <sup>KU80</sup> wild-type or complemented strains. Additionally, histological analysis showed reduced fungal burden and inflammation in the Δ <i>aspB</i> infected, caspofungin-treated group. Affinity purification coupled with quantitative proteomics identified proteins involved in the septin-dependent response to caspofungin, includng four candidate interactors involved in cell wall stress response. Deletion of these candidate genes resulted in increased susceptibility to caspofungin and moderately reduced viability post-drug exposure. Taken together, these data suggest that septin AspB contributes to the fungistatic response to caspofungin.
40060289	Biofilm-mediated bioremediation of xenobiotics and heavy metals: a comprehensive review of microbial ecology, molecular mechanisms, and emerging biotechnological applications.	Environmental pollution, driven by rapid industrialization and urbanization, has emerged as a critical global challenge in the twenty-first century. This comprehensive review explores the potential of bacterial biofilms in bioremediation, focusing on their ability to degrade and transform a wide array of pollutants, including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), oil spills, pesticides, and emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and microplastics. The unique structural and functional characteristics of biofilms, including their extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, enhanced genetic exchange, and metabolic cooperation, contribute to their superior pollutant degradation capabilities compared to planktonic bacteria. Recent advancements in biofilm-mediated bioremediation include the application of genetically engineered microorganisms, nanoparticle-biofilm interactions, and innovative biofilm reactor designs. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has shown promise in enhancing the degradative capabilities of biofilm-forming bacteria while integrating nanoparticles with bacterial biofilms demonstrates significant improvements in pollutant degradation efficiency. As global pollution rises, biofilm-based bioremediation emerges as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to address diverse contaminants. This review signifies the need for further research to optimize these techniques and harness their full potential in addressing pressing environmental challenges.
40060111	Integrating AI detection and language models for real-time pest management in Tomato cultivation.	Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> L.) cultivation is crucial globally due to its nutritional and economic value. However, the crop faces significant threats from various pests, including <i>Tuta absoluta</i>, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>, and <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i>, among others. These pests not only reduce yield but also increase production costs due to the heavy reliance on pesticides. Traditional pest detection methods are labor-intensive and prone to errors, necessitating the exploration of advanced techniques. This study aims to enhance pest detection in tomato cultivation using AI-based detection and language models. Specifically, it integrates YOLOv8 for detection and segmentation tasks and ChatGPT-4 for generating detailed, actionable insights on the detected pests. YOLOv8 was chosen for its superior performance in agricultural pest detection, capable of processing large volumes of data in real-time with high accuracy. The methodology involved training the YOLOv8 model with images of various pests and plant damage. The model achieved a precision of 98.91%, recall of 98.98%, mAP50 of 98.75%, and mAP50-95 of 97.72% for detection tasks. For segmentation tasks, precision was 97.47%, recall 98.81%, mAP50 99.38%, and mAP50-95 95.99%. These metrics demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods, indicating the model's effectiveness. The integration of ChatGPT-4 further enhances the system by providing detailed explanations and recommendations based on detected pests. This approach facilitates real-time expert consultation, making pest management accessible to untrained producers, especially in remote areas. The study's results underscore the potential of combining AI-based detection and language models to revolutionize agricultural practices. Future research should focus on training these models with domain-specific data to improve accuracy and reliability. Additionally, addressing the computational limitations of personal devices will be crucial for broader adoption. This integration promises to democratize information access, promoting a more resilient, informed, and environmentally conscious approach to farming.
40059747	Structurally modified carbon nanotubes as twisted fibers towards electrochemical detection of environmentally hazardous cartap.	Pesticides such as cartap play a crucial role in agriculture, as they are extensively used in controlling pests in crops like sugarcane, rice and vegetables. However, their excessive usage poses major threats to human health, causing neurotoxicity and respiratory disorders. In addition, they harm aquatic ecosystems by disrupting biodiversity. Consequently, effective detection and remediation are essential to minimize their adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem. For this purpose, an electrochemical method was used for the simultaneous detection and degradation of the under-reported insecticide cartap. In this work, vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays were grown and converted into fibers <i>via</i> simple mechanical spinning and used as a flexible electrode material for cartap electro-oxidation. The fabricated electrode exhibited excellent performance towards sensing and remediation without any surface modification. The fiber-based electrode showed a wide linear range, a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.575 mM, high sensitivity (7.98 μA cm<sup>-2</sup> mM<sup>-1</sup>), reproducibility, and excellent electrocatalytic activity. The multi-functionality of this electrode was attributed to its unique properties like flexibility, compatibility with various media (aqueous and organic), cost-effectiveness, and seamless integration with membranes, making these fibers promising candidates for on-site facile detection and long-term degradation of cartap.
40059727	Engineering Two-Dimensional-Copper Phenolic Nanosheet from CuO Nanosphere for Enhanced Peroxidase Activity in Smartphone-Based Thiophanate-Methyl Detection via Analyte-Inhibition Mechanism.	Optical sensors based on nanozymes have shown great promise for the rapid and sensitive detection of pesticide residues in environmental and food samples. However, their applicability is often limited by a lack of selectivity due to nonspecific enzyme inhibition. Therefore, we developed a colorimetric sensing platform specifically tailored to detect the agricultural fungicide thiophanate-methyl (TpM), leveraging its unique inhibitory effect on nanozyme activity. The symmetric ethylenediamine- and bisthiourea-like groups in TpM exhibit a strong affinity for metal sites, leading to a reduction in the catalytic performance. Thus, we designed a novel copper oxide nanosphere (CuO)-derived 2D copper phenolic nanosheet (2D-CuPNS) with enhanced peroxidase-like activity. This nanosheet facilitates the oxidation of TMB through OH radical generation via a Fenton-like reaction involving Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Cu<sup>+</sup> and -C═C- bonds on the nanozyme surface. Notably, the activity of 2D-CuPNS was selectively and significantly inhibited by TpM due to a specific interaction while remaining unaffected by other pesticides. The 2D-CuPNS exhibited strong affinities for TMB and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, with <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values of 0.07 and 2.0 mM, respectively. As a result, the proposed sensor demonstrated high specificity for TpM detection, with a linear range of 0.5-15 μM and a low detection limit of 0.09 μM. A smartphone-assisted rapid detection method was also developed utilizing RGB values from the chromogenic reaction. Furthermore, by immobilization of the 2D-CuPNS and TMB substrate onto standard filter paper, ready-to-use paper-based TpM sensors were created. This study introduces a novel nanozyme inhibition approach for the selective detection of TpM in environmental and food samples, providing a versatile and practical sensing solution.
40059629	Genetic diversity in the IIS6 domain of voltage gated sodium channel gene among Aedes aegypti populations from different geographical regions in India.	This study provides critical insights into the genetic diversity of the IIS6 domain of the Voltage Gated Sodium Channel (VGSC) gene in Aedes aegypti populations across various regions in India, focusing on two mutations: S989P and V1016G. Samples were collected from seven different cities across the country, including Dibrugarh, Kolkata, Berhampur, Bhopal, Bengaluru, Ghaziabad, and Aurangabad. The IIS6 domain was amplified and sequenced, revealing that the V1016G mutation was found at a higher frequency compared to the S989P mutation. The S989P mutation was most prevalent in Berhampur, followed by Bengaluru, while the V1016G mutation showed high frequencies in Dibrugarh, followed by Berhampur. Additionally, the study identified intron polymorphisms within the VGSC gene, with the type A intron being relatively rare. However, the type A intron was observed in samples harbouring both mutant and wild alleles for both mutations. The regional variation in the frequencies of these mutations indicates complex evolutionary dynamics potentially influenced by local environmental factors and insecticide application practices. Interestingly, the high frequency of these alleles also correlated with the genetic structure of the mosquito populations, suggesting that gene flow might be playing a role in spreading these mutations. Regular monitoring of these mutations could serve as important indicators in assessing the status of resistance to pyrethroids and guide nationwide mosquito control efforts. This research underscores the necessity for localised vector control strategies and continuous genetic surveillance to manage insecticide resistance effectively.
40059550	Development of a Pesticide Labeling Literacy Scale for Thai Rice Farmers: Item Generation and Content Validity Testing.	Occupational exposure to pesticides in rice cultivation poses health risks, exacerbated by factors contributing to the improper use of pesticides. One significant factor is the limited literacy skills of farmers, hindering their ability to read and comprehend pesticide labels. Research in this area is limited by the lack of an acceptable method for measuring pesticide labeling literacy.
40059268	The oligosaccharyltransferase subunit PsSTT3A regulates N-glycosylation and is critical for development and virulence of Phytophthora sojae.	In eukaryotes, N-glycosylation is a complex, multistep process in which the core subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase, Staurosporine and Temperature Sensitive 3A (STT3A), plays a critical role in the catalytic activity of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. We found that the PsSTT3A gene plays a critical role in the viability of Phytophthora sojae (P. sojae). Furthermore, full PsSTT3A function was crucial to mycelial growth, sporangium production, zoospore production, and pathogenicity, as determined by gene silencing experiments. PsSTT3A is, itself, a highly N-glycosylated protein with six consensus NXS/T (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) motifs and one novel NS motif. However, the N-glycosylation sites on PsSTT3A that are required to support the development and virulence of P. sojae have been uncertain. Here, we demonstrated that glycosylation of site N593 is essential for normal mycelial growth and virulence in P. sojae. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis was disrupted by the mutation of N593. N593A mutations reduced the stability of the elicitin PsSOJ2A, an N-glycoprotein, in gene replacement transformations. Our study reveals the functional significance of N-glycosylation of PsSTT3A in the development and infection cycles of P. sojae, demonstrating that targeting of PsSTT3A may be a promising strategy for developing new mode of action fungicides.
40059115	Evaluation of soybean germplasms for resistance to stay-green syndrome.	Stay-green syndrome (SGS) resistant germplasms serve as the cornerstone for soybean improvement. A comprehensive assessment was conducted on a panel of 1553 germplasms to evaluate their resistance to SGS through natural inoculation. Over a three-year period, one landrace, ZaoShuHeiDou, emerged as resilient to SGS, displaying a significantly reduced risk of SGS (p < 0.05) compared to its counterparts. The broad-sense heritability of SGS resistance was 0.86. Notably, landraces demonstrated a substantially lower incidence of SGS compared to improved cultivars. Furthermore, the severity of SGS correlated with several key traits pertinent to soybean improvement efforts. In field trials, the application of insecticides effectively mitigated SGS severity, whereas the use of organic fertilizers and soil sterilization had no discernible impact. A total of 83 DNA samples were successfully amplified from SGS-afflicted plants using specific primers for soybean stay-green associated virus (SoSGV), and a SoSGV LCU-1 strain was isolated. The qPCR analysis confirmed a positive correlation between SGS severity and the relative SoSGV copy number in afflicted plants. The findings of this study lay a solid foundation for the development of SGS-resistant cultivars and the exploration of underlying resistance mechanisms.
40059061	Rate of herbicide resistant weed development: A Canadian Prairie case study.	Genetically modified crop adoption in Canada has been the key driver in removing tillage as the lead form of weed control, due to increased weed control efficiency. Land use has transitioned from the use of summerfallow to continuous cropping, predominantly involving zero or minimum tillage practices. Prairie crop rotations have diversified away from mainly cereals to include three-year rotations of cereals, pulses, and oilseeds. Total herbicide volume applied has increased as crop production acres increased, but the rate of herbicide active ingredient applied per hectare has declined. Diverse crop rotations allow for weed control using herbicides with different modes of action, reducing selection pressure for resistant weed development. Herbicide-resistant weeds are an important concern for farmers, as the loss of key herbicides would make weed control exceedingly more difficult. The objective of this case study is to examine herbicide resistance weed development in the Canadian Prairies and to identify changes in resistance development following GM crop adoption.
40058903	Characteristic flavor compounds in soy protein isolate and their correlation with sensory attributes.	A molecular sensory analysis of soy protein isolate (SPI) was conducted using headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS/O), along with flavor recombination and omission experiments. Twenty-six odor-active compounds were identified, with hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, (E)-2-nonenal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal as characteristic flavor compounds contributing to grain husk, grassy, raw bean, tofu, oil oxidation, and soy milk flavors. The identification of these compounds in the olfactory references, combined with descriptive sensory analysis under varying concentrations, revealed a significant correlation between sensory attributes and the composition and concentration (p < 0.05). Grassy and raw bean were associated with all compounds; grain husk was linked to hexanal, heptanal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal; tofu was associated with octanal, nonanal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal; oil oxidation was related to hexanal, octanal, nonanal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal; and soy milk was correlated with hexanal, nonanal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal. Flavor intensity generally increased with compound concentration. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the subsequent flavor enhancement of soy protein products.
40058743	Mitigating pesticide risk on bee pollinators and angiosperm biodiversity in the Ndop wetlands: A conservation approach.	This study aimed to assess the risk of pesticides on bee pollinators and propose strategies to conserve entomophilous angiosperm species in the Ndop wetlands. Results showed that the applied pesticide doses were often excessive, increasing the exposure toxicity ratios (ETR). Among the pesticides, insecticides posed the highest risk to bee pollinators, with Emamectin benzoate (ETR=591.4) presenting the highest risk, followed by imidacloprid (ETR=517.5), fipronil (ETR=496.4), chlorpyrifos (ETR=240.7), and cypermethrin (ETR=131). Lambda-cyhalothrin (ETR=50.53) posed a possible risk. The study found that imidacloprid, fipronil, and chlorpyrifos posed definite risks through dietary exposure, while Emamectin benzoate, fipronil, and cypermethrin posed risks through direct contact. Approximately 46.03% of angiosperms are anemophilous while 53% are entomophilous with bee pollinators facilitating the pollination of nearly 90% of the entomophilous species. To mitigate pesticide risks and for conservation purposes, farmers should refrain from applying pesticides during blooming and peak pollinator activity times, particularly midday.
40058615	MEK1 inhibition ameliorates mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis induced by deltamethrin in mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells.	Deltamethrin (DM), a widely used pyrethroid insecticide, has been increasingly recognized as a risk factor for neurodegeneration. However, the underlying mechanism is still far from clear. In this study, we investigated whether MEK1 is involved in DM-induced neurotoxicity and mediated mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. In mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells model, DM (2,10,50 μM) dose-dependently increased apoptotic cells rate and impaired mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as significantly upregulated of apoptotic related proteins Bax, cytochrome c (Cyt-c) and Caspase-3 were observed. RNA-sequencing analysis further revealed that the MEK/ERK signal pathway was remarkably enriched and activated after DM exposure. In particularly, upregulation of MEK1, other than ERK1/2, was detected at both transcriptional and translational levels. Inhibition of MEK1 can effectively result in the recovery of mitochondrial morphology and MMP in DM-treated HT22 cells. And that further alleviated apoptosis by reversing the overexpression of Bax, Cyt-c and Caspase-3. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the critical role of MEK1 in regulating mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis induced by DM, providing a novel understanding of the neurotoxicity of DM.
40058553	Chronic exposure to tebuconazole impairs offspring growth and survival in farmland birds: an experiment in captive house sparrows.	European farmland bird populations have declined by over 60% in 40 years, with the use of pesticides suspected to be one of the main causes of this decline. However, it remains difficult to test the impact of these pesticides in field studies due to confounding environmental variables that can also affect avian wildlife (e.g., food resources, habitat fragmentation and alteration). Triazoles are a family of fungicides that are ubiquitous in agro-ecosystems due to their use on a wide range of crops. Triazoles are suspected to affect non-target avian species by disrupting key physiological mechanisms and by detrimentally affecting their reproduction. In this captive study, we experimentally investigated the effect of the most commonly used triazole fungicides (i.e., tebuconazole) on the reproduction of an avian species representative of farmlands, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). We examined the impacts of tebuconazole at realistic concentrations (550 μg.L<sup>-1</sup> in drinking water to achieve ∼ 60 pg.g<sup>-1</sup> in plasma of sparrows) under controlled conditions on multiple indicators of breeding performance (clutch size, hatching success, chick growth and survival). We found that chronic exposure to tebuconazole (9 months, including the breeding period) significantly altered the reproduction of sparrows. Although clutch size and hatching success were not affected by tebuconazole, chicks from the exposed group showed reduced growth and a higher mortality rate. Interestingly, these effects were exacerbated in female chicks, highlighting a sex-dependent effect of tebuconazole on sparrow offspring. This study demonstrates that tebuconazole can be detrimental to the reproduction of farmland birds. Further studies are now required to distinguish the direct effects of tebuconazole (toxic and sublethal effects on the developing chick/embryo) from the indirect ones (alteration of egg quality and parental care).
40058441	TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber incorporating hydrophobic TA-HBPSi nanoparticles aerogels for efficient adsorption of fungicides in water.	Fungicide contamination is a critical environmental issue, and the effective removal of fungicide residues from aquatic environments has attracted significant attention from researchers. In this study, the synthesized hyperbranched polysiloxane (TA-HBPSi) was grafted onto TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNF) to fabricate a novel aerogel material (TA-HBPSi@TOCNF) with the aim of enhancing the sorption efficiency of fungicide. The equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity of TA-HBPSi@TOCNF for imazalil (8.04 mg/g) was significantly higher compared to other fungicides, including prochloraz (6.43 mg/g), thiophanate-methyl (4.12 mg/g), carbendazim (0.16 mg/g), and thiabendazole (0.04 mg/g). In the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, the equilibrium adsorption capacity for imazalil increased from 8.04 mg/g to 9.61 mg/g, while the adsorption capacity for Cd<sup>2+</sup> increased from 0.26 mg/g to 0.88 mg/g. Quantum chemical calculations were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level. The energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ΔE(<sub>HOMO-LUMO</sub>)) for various adsorption mechanisms indicated that electrostatic interactions were the dominant driving force for adsorption, followed by π-π electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions and hydrophobic interactions. The developed aerogel demonstrated effective multi-component separation capabilities without inducing secondary environmental pollution, highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for practical water purification applications.
40058304	Nationwide prediction of pesticide residual levels in soil: Implications on the resulting risk and prioritization framework.	Pesticides are widely accumulated in agricultural soils in China under successive applications, causing negative impacts on non-target species and environmental qualities. However, a nationwide overview of the residual levels of pesticides in soil, and the ecological risks to non-target soil species are lacking. In this study, we calculated geographically gridded concentrations of 107 pesticide active ingredients (AIs) in soils in China based on the Computational Pesticide Input (CPI) model and further assessed the ecological risks to soil biota. In the end, we proposed an integrated usage-impact model to identify prioritize control pesticides based on the usage, risk and persistence of pesticides. Pesticide concentrations were calculated in a range from 0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to over 185 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Glyphosate is the most prevalent pesticide that exists in most locations. The ecological risks were mostly assessed as medium risk, with extreme high- and high risk found in 1 % and 21 % of soils. Supervision and management of azoxystrbin, boscalid, butachlor and chlorpyrifos need to be prioritized. The results of this study provide guidance to local governments for the designation more accurate risk mitigation strategies across regions.
40058301	Community-level effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide on the metabolism of freshwater microorganisms.	This study provides an ecotoxicological assessment of the effects of the neonicotinoid dinotefuran on freshwater microorganisms. Epilithic biofilm was sampled from a small stream and exposed to dinotefuran for 14 days in Biolog EcoPlates. In general, we found that a concentration of 0.100 mg l<sup>-1</sup> of dinotefuran induced the microorganism community to catabolise carbon sources faster. However, catabolic activity varied depending on the type of carbon source. Catabolism increased for Putrescine (+4673 %), Serine (+376 %), Galacturonic Acid (+206 %), Pyruvic Acid Methyl Ester (+177 %), and Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (+113 %); and decreased for Arginine (-59 %), Asparagine (-26 %), and Mannitol (-21 %). This is the first study in which EcoPlates have been used to investigate the effects of dinotefuran on freshwater epilithic biofilm at an environmentally realistic concentration.
40058209	Caddisfly emergence is substantially affected by the combined exposure of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, natural organic matter and UV irradiation.	Nanoparticles serve various industrial and domestic purposes which is reflected in their steadily increasing production and ultimate release into the environment. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles pose due to their high production volume and their photoactive properties a potential environmental risk. Here we assessed their impact in combination with UV and natural organic matter (NOM) at field relevant intensities on the emergence dynamics and quality of the aquatic insect Chaetopteryx villosa (Insecta: Trichoptera) employing a factorial test design. While UV alone and the combination of TiO<sub>2</sub> with UV or NOM reduced emergence by 50 %, the combination of all three factors (i.e., TiO<sub>2</sub> x UV x NOM) caused an even stronger effect (i.e., reduction by 70 %). Following a similar pattern, the time until 50 % of the larvae emerged was, depending on the treatment, delayed by at least 5.9 and up to 16.4 days. In contrast, the nutritious quality of adult C. villosa, characterized in terms of energy reserves and fatty acid profiles, was hardly affected. Nonetheless, the substantial impact in emergence dynamics was at the same magnitude as reported for highly toxic chemicals, such as insecticides. Consequently, (photoactive) nanoparticles may be of similar environmental concern, particularly under joint exposure with further environmental factors (i.e., UV and NOM). Moreover, and in the light of the central ecological role of aquatic insects at the interface between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, the present study points towards far-reaching consequences for the riparian food web and the productivity of this meta-ecosystem.
40058200	A novel framework for industrial pesticide effluent assessment: Integrating chemical screening, multi-endpoint responses and literature-based validation.	Industrial pesticide effluents pose substantial risks to aquatic ecosystems, yet comprehensive understanding of their toxicological impacts remains limited. This study presents an integrated approach to evaluate the ecological risks of pesticide manufacturing effluents through chemical screening and multi-endpoints biological responses. Using zebrafish embryos as a model organism, we demonstrated that effluent discharge point (EDP) sample induced 100 % mortality, while diluted samples exhibited significant developmental toxicity, cardiovascular injury, immunosuppression, and behavioral alterations. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying these toxic responses. Through chemical screening and targeted quantification, we identified three predominant azole fungicides - propiconazole (2.11 μg/L), hexaconazole (13.3 μg/L), and tebuconazole (18.66 μg/L) - that exhibited synergistic toxicity. Notably, our innovative meta-analysis framework based on literature data validated the toxicological profiles of detected compounds, providing an efficient alternative to conventional bioassays. This study establishes a comprehensive framework for assessing industrial effluent toxicity and demonstrates the value of integrating chemical analysis with biological responses for environmental risk assessment.
40057536	Potent targeted larvicidal activities of marine-derived Bacillus sp. bacterial extracts on mosquito vectors.	Mosquito vector-borne diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity across the globe. Current vector control strategies mainly rely on chemical insecticides, but their incessant usage has resulted in the development of resistance. Insecticidal agents of microbial origin have proven as good alternative tools for vector control of mosquito. In the present study, we examined larvicidal activities of the extracts from culture supernatants of marine bacteria (extracts) against major mosquito vectors from India. Out of 55 tested marine bacterial extracts, 12 extracts caused 90-100% mortality at 250 ppm in Anopheles stephensi larvae. Furthermore, NIO 707 and 706 were found to be significantly effective against Aedes aegypti larvae and field collected larvae of An. subpictus, respectively. Some of the extracts (NIO 701, 707 and 710) demonstrated significant reduction in egg hatching of An. stephensi; while all the tested extracts were able to significantly reduce egg hatching in An. culicifacies. Additionally, we observed that any of the effective extracts did not show any detrimental activity against malaria parasite (Plasmodium falciparum). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the effective extracts belonged to Bacillus sp.; however, bacteria from Enterococcus genera was a peculiar finding of our study. Altogether, our data underscores the importance of exploration of marine bacteria from Indian peninsula for their larvicidal activities and further undertaking mechanistic approach to develop novel bio-larvicides.
40057515	Larval spongy moth transcriptomic response to ingestion of broad-versus narrow-spectrum insecticidal Chromobacterium species.	The PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> strain of Chromobacterium subtsugae was the first insecticidal bacterium to be registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use in crop protection applications since approval for Bacillus thuringiensis was granted in 1961. C. subtsugae, a Gram-negative betaproteobacterium, exhibits oral toxicity against a broad range of important insects, including dipteran, coleopteran, lepidopteran, and at least some hemipteran and tetranychidan pests. Chromobacterium sphagni is a closely related bacterium exhibiting a distinctly narrower activity spectrum than that of C. subtsugae: it is toxic to lepidopteran, but not dipteran or coleopteran pest insects. The molecular mode of activity for either species is not well characterized at present, and it remains unclear whether these bacterial species affect insects similarly, notwithstanding their close evolutionary relatedness. In this study, synchronized third-instar larvae of the destructive lepidopteran forest pest, Lymantria dispar dispar (European spongy moth), were separately fed with cultures of C. subtsugae strain PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> or C. sphagni strain 14B-1<sup>T</sup> and sampled after 24 h post infection. Gene expression levels in healthy reference versus treated insects were independently compared at the whole-insect and midgut-only tissue levels to characterize host-specific transcriptional responses to intoxication. Treatment induced up-regulation of such antimicrobial peptides as attacin and cecropin, of two cytochrome P450-encoding genes, and of gelsolin, a molecule involved in actin organization. Some differentially expressed genes were novel or uncharacterized, hence future work with lepidopteran species will be necessary to understand insect physiological responses to Chromobacterium infection.
40057353	The impact of training on satisfaction and anxiety levels in stroke patients receiving warfarin treatment.	Due to the narrow therapeutic range of warfarin, patients require close monitoring. This study aimed to examine the effects of training provided to stroke patients receiving warfarin treatment on their perception of satisfaction and state of anxiety.
40057165	PRELIMINARY VEGETATION-BASED EVALUATION OF SEMI-VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (SVOCs) USING PINE SPECIES: TOWARDS POLLUTION DATA COMPARABILITY.	Pine needles are suitable biomonitors of airborne semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). However, the various pine species, each with unique distribution and ecological traits, may differ in their ability to retain pollutants. The SVOC uptake capacities between different vegetation species remain largely unknown, and this study seeks to address this gap. By establishing comparable SVOC retention levels, different species could be used interchangeably, strengthening the data consistency across studies and clarifying diverse pollution cycles. Four SVOC classes - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) - were analyzed in pine needle samples from various species in 12 sites in Portugal, Spain, the UK and Romania, to explore interspecies pollutant correlations. In general, the SVOC levels found were indicative of the urban fingerprint as expected, despite of the tree species. Although it was not intended to define a clear uptake trend for all species, statistically significant relationships (p<0.05) were found in the most sampled ones (P. pinaster, P. pinea, P. sylvestris) for the total concentration of the SVOCs families for some individual compounds, especially the most volatile. These links appear to be transversal to land use (urban, background/remote), the different climate regimes of the sampled areas, and even the inherent variability of vegetation, allowing for cross-national/land use data to be compared. To enhance the scope of future studies, the spatial and temporal increase of sampling campaigns is needed, although the selection of the appropriate sites can be challenging.
40057161	Exposure to polystyrene microplastics with different functional groups: Implications for blood pressure and heart.	The association between microplastics (MPs) exposure and cardiovascular disease is largely unknown. It is still unclear what effects MPs exposure have on blood pressure and how it affects the heart. As MPs age, their surfaces undergo modifications that may alter how the MPs interact with cells, which may affect the extent of their toxic effects. Here, we used three different surface functional-group polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs), and exposed 5-week-old SD rats to them over 42 days. Compared with the control group, the mean blood pressure of the MPs exposed rats increased by 22-40%. Exposure to PS-MPs caused oxidative damage to the heart, and induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. More interestingly, MPs modified by functional groups induced enhanced adverse effects than unmodified PS-MPs, with amino-modified PS-MPs exhibiting more significant blood pressure elevation and myocardial hypertrophy. Proteomic analysis of cardiac differential proteins focused on factor XII activation, negative regulation of proteolysis, collectively pointed to the downregulation of kininogen. We demonstrated that MPs exposure induced ERK activation, the down-regulation of bradykinin, and inhibition of the downstream nitric oxide signaling pathway. This study demonstrates the different effects of MPs with different functional groups on blood pressure elevation and myocardial hypertrophy, and sheds light on the mechanisms responsible for microplastic-induced cardiovascular toxicity.
40057072	Function of chitinase in Penicillium ochrochloron Q-3-1 and its insecticidal and antifungal mechanism and biological control against citrus pests and diseases.	The biocontrol potential strain of Penicillium ochrochloron Q-3-1 was isolated from Hepialus armoricanus larvae. However, the insecticidal and antifungal mechanisms of Q-3-1 are still unclear. Eleven chitinase genes (Poch1-Poch11) were isolated for functional identification. During Q-3-1 infection, Poch1, Poch2, and Poch11 were upregulated in Galleria mellonella, whereas Poch4, Poch6, and Poch11 were upregulated in Diaphorina citri. Chitinase activity was determined based on the expression of the chitinase genes in an in vitro prokaryotic expression system and an analysis of the p-nitrophenol (pNP) degradation ability of recombinant chitinase. They exhibit excellent degradation activities for chitin, citrus pectin, D-cellobiose, and G. mellonella epidermis. The exonuclease activity of Poch1 can effectively degrade insect chitin and pectin. The insect chitin utilization rate of Poch11 is higher than that of pectin, and it can randomly degrade different pNP substrates. In addition, the present study found that exogenous chitinase proteins showed significant antagonistic ability against citrus pathogens. The special antifungal and insecticidal character of Q-3-1 may lead to its potential application in agriculture as a biological control agent.
40056919	Mapping the global prevalence, incidence, and mortality of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria, 2000-22: a spatial and temporal modelling study.	Malaria remains a leading cause of illness and death globally, with countries in sub-Saharan Africa bearing a disproportionate burden. Global high-resolution maps of malaria prevalence, incidence, and mortality are crucial for tracking spatially heterogeneous progress against the disease and to inform strategic malaria control efforts. We present the latest such maps, the first since 2019, which cover the years 2000-22. The maps are accompanied by administrative-level summaries and include estimated COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts on malaria burden.
40056864	Unlocking the potential of Eudrilus eugeniae in mitigating the pollution risk of pesticides and heavy metals: Fostering machine learning tactics to optimize environmental health.	Agro-industrial waste management remains a critical challenge in sustainable development, particularly due to contamination with heterogeneous micropollutants such as heavy metals (HMs), pesticides, and polyphenols. This study explores an innovative vermistabilization approach using pineapple pomace (PP) to enhance the bioremediation of paper mill sludge (PMS) facilitated by Eudrilus eugeniae. The research demonstrates that the contrasting pH profiles of PMS (a highly alkaline substrate) and PP (a highly acidic substrate) have significantly contributed to nutrient enhancement and stabilization of end products for the mixed feedstock treatments (PP and PMS-based feedstocks) compared to the feedstock treatments in isolations. Results demonstrated a 2.1 fold increase in earthworm population density, and 4-5 fold reduction in organic carbon content confirming its effectiveness of biostabilization in a heterogeneous feed mixture. Vermicomposting enhanced nutrient availability (N, P, K) and microbial metabolic activity by 3-5 folds. Amongst tested ratios, PP + PMS + cowdung (CD) (1:2:1) achieved optimal remediation, reducing HMs (Cd, Pb, Zn, Hg, Ni, Cu, Cr), pesticides (chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, carbofuran), and polyphenols by 8-9 folds. Integration of Artificial Neural Networks coupled with Sobol sensitivity analysis also identified PP + PMS + CD(1:2:1) as the most effective combination in minimizing potential health risks. Furthermore, Taylor plot analysis determined the best-fit model for predicting health risks associated with various PP and PMS-based complex systems. The findings underscored the potential of utilizing PP along with PMS based feedstock for mitigating pollutants whilst simultaneously enhancing nutrient recovery during vermicomposting. Thus, the machine learning techniques could facilitate the optimization of feedstock compositions, advancing large-scale vermistabilization as a sustainable strategy for agro-industrial waste management.
40056814	Organophosphate pesticides and their potential in the change of microbial population and frequency of antibiotic resistance genes in aquatic environments.	Heavy metals (HMs) and pesticides disrupt aquatic biodiversity and microbial communities, contributing to antibiotic resistance via cross-resistance and co-selection mechanisms. This study investigates the relationship between organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), HMs, microbial diversity, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in eight lakes and wetlands. Microbial communities were analyzed via metagenomics methods, and data were processed using CLC Genomics Workbench 22. ARGs, including tetA, tetB, qnrA, qnrS, CIT, Fox, KPC, CTX-M1, DHA, GES, OXA, IMP, VEB, NDM1, SHV, TEM, CTX-M, PER, and MOX, were identified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Element concentrations and pesticide were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. The results indicate that environmental elements and pesticides significantly influence microbial diversity. Proteobacteria (Gamma, Beta, Alpha) dominate over other bacteria in all locations. β-Lactamase resistance genes have a significant positive correlations with the concentrations of boron, iron, lithium, magnesium, sodium, and phosphorus (P-value<0.05). Positive correlations between phosphorus, iron, and beta-lactamase genes suggest that higher concentrations of these elements may increase resistance likelihood by promoting resistant bacterial growth or facilitating gene transfer. Additionally, tetA and tetB exhibited a significant positive correlation with parathion concentration. The results showed that OPs and HMs increase antibiotic resistance by causing gene mutations, altering gene expression, and promoting horizontal gene transfer, resulting in multidrug-resistant strains. This highlights the need for monitoring these pollutants as they affect microbial diversity and accelerate antibiotic resistance. Targeted measures, such as bioremediation and pollution control, are essential to mitigate risks to the environment and public health.
40056554	Bioaccumulation of PCBs and OCPs in Antarctic phytoplankton and zooplankton: Insights into bioconcentration and biomagnification in Fildes Bay.	This study was conducted at Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, from November 30th, 2019, to January 30th, 2020. We determined the concentrations of Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in phytoplankton, and zooplankton. The most abundant compounds found were hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in phytoplankton and γ-HCH in zooplankton. We estimated the bioconcentration factors (BCF<sub>PHYTO</sub>) for phytoplankton and zooplankton (BCF<sub>ZOO</sub>), as well as biomagnification factors (BMF) across trophic levels. Our findings indicate that BCF values were generally higher for compounds with a higher degree of chlorination, and noticeable biomagnification of these contaminants was observed, emphasizing the enhancement of contaminant concentrations from phytoplankton to zooplankton. This biomagnification varied depending on the specific compound and environmental conditions. Throughout the study period, the factors influencing bioconcentration and biomagnification were closely correlated with the seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton biomass, which were affected by local conditions such as slower S and SE winds. These events enhanced the concentration of chlorophyll-a and POPs, influencing their transfer across trophic levels. Our study underscores the complex interplay between biotic and abiotic factors in determining the fate of these persistent pollutants in a rapidly changing polar environment. These findings highlight the need for continuing ongoing monitoring to understand the long-term impacts of environmental changes on the distribution and behavior of hazardous substances in remote regions like Antarctica.
40056550	Prenatal exposure to organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and risk of testicular germ cell cancer later in life.	Exposure to environmental chemicals during fetal development may increase the risk of testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC), but few studies have tested the hypothesis. We focused on organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), previously investigated in relation to other male reproductive health outcomes.
40056504	Antioxidant defense response mediated by DAF-16 attenuates toxicity of herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on Caenorhabditis elegans.	Glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are widely used herbicides in agriculture for weed elimination. These unused glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are discharged into environmental water, soil, and even in the food chain cycle, which greatly threatens ecosystems and human health. However, the toxicological mechanism of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms remains largely unknown. To investigate the toxic effects of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans which is directly exposed to various pesticides in the soil was selected as the object of study. In this study, our results showed that the locomotion, growth, reproduction, and lethality of C. elegans exposed to different concentrations of a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are suppressed. Exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium increases the production of reactive oxygen species, accelerating senescence and shortening the lifespan of C. elegans. The exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium activates antioxidant defense responses mediated by DAF-16 and autophagy mediated by SKN-1. Our research provides a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying antioxidant defense response-mediated detoxification of pesticide residues in soil non-target organisms.
40056347	Global research trends on the human exposome: a bibliometric analysis (2005-2024).	Exposome represents one of the most pressing issues in the environmental science research field. However, a comprehensive summary of worldwide human exposome research is lacking. We aimed to explore the bibliometric characteristics of scientific publications on the human exposome. A bibliometric analysis of human exposome publications from 2005 to December 2024 was conducted using the Web of Science in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Trends/hotspots were investigated with keyword frequency, co-occurrence, and thematic map. Sex disparities in terms of publications and citations were examined. From 2005 to 2024, 931 publications were published in 363 journals and written by 4529 authors from 72 countries. The number of publications tripled during the last 5 years. Publications written by females (51% as first authors and 34% as last authors) were cited fewer times (13,674) than publications written by males (22,361). Human exposome studies mainly focused on air pollution, metabolomics, chemicals (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), endocrine-disrupting chemicals, pesticides), early-life exposure, biomarkers, microbiome, omics, cancer, and reproductive disorders. Social and built environment factors, occupational exposure, multi-exposure, digital exposure (e.g., screen use), climate change, and late-life exposure received less attention. Our results uncovered high-impact countries, institutions, journals, references, authors, and key human exposome research trends/hotspots. The use of digital exposome technologies (e.g., sensors, and wearables) and data science (e.g., artificial intelligence) has blossomed to overcome challenges and could provide valuable knowledge toward precision prevention. Exposome risk scores represent a promising research avenue.
40056346	Acaricides in agriculture: balancing livestock health and environmental well-being in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya.	Extensive use of chemicals in food production, although useful, has profound implications. Acaricides, extensively used to control ticks and mites in livestock farming, can leave harmful residues that pose risks to unintended organisms such as plants, insects, people, and other animals. Thus, limiting non-target exposure to acaricides is critical. This study is aimed at assessing acaricide knowledge, use, and disposal methods among farmers and agrochemical dealers in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya, which is well-known for livestock farming. A purposive survey of stakeholders, including 100 farmers and 45 agrochemical shop attendants, revealed concerning practices. The findings revealed insufficient personal protection during acaricide application, with a minority of responders using gloves (33%), safety goggles (0%), masks (42%), or overalls (51%) for agrochemical dealers and gloves (8%), overalls (48%), safety goggles (2%), and masks (28%) for farmers. Furthermore, used acaricide containers and residues were not properly disposed of after spraying, potentially contaminating water sources, soil, and plants. Insects, particularly bees and house flies, were spotted consuming leftovers from unprotected disposal sites, entering food webs. Furthermore, animal drying sections in spraying regions included grass, allowing animals to ingest residues. Recommendations include improved acaricide monitoring and management by extension field staff and educating farmers and pesticide dealers about health concerns, proper disposal techniques, and the importance of wearing personal protective equipment. A regulation requiring agrochemical dealers to sell acaricides together with protective gear is recommended to limit dangers effectively.
40056341	Shikonin Ameliorates Rotenone-Induced Neurotoxicity Through Inhibition of Apoptosis via IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT Pathway in a Parkinson's Disease-Associated SH-SY5Y Cell Model.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder caused by several genetics and environmental factors. Rotenone a pesticide with mitotoxicity causes cytosolic proteopathy resulting in PD-associated apoptosis and modulations in cell survival pathways. Shikonin, a naphthoquinone compound extracted from the Lithospermum erythrorhizon herb, was investigated in this study for its neuroprotective properties and underlying molecular mechanisms against rotenone-induced cellular apoptosis and survival in SH-SY5Y cells. The molecular docking analysis of apoptotic proteins against Shikonin revealed that they showed a binding affinity with BAD. Shikonin effectively countered the loss of cell viability induced by rotenone, rescued annexin-positive apoptotic cells, and dose-dependently suppressed the generation of reactive oxygen species. Pre-treatment with Shikonin prevented the morphological aberrations like shrining of neurites leading to decreased LDH leakage and NO release caused due to the rotenone treatment. The α-synucleinopathy is a prime hallmark of PD, Shikonin mitigated the rotenone-induced aggregation of α-synuclein as seen from confocal imaging. Furthermore, Shikonin treatment reversed the rotenone-induced excessive production of reactive oxygen species, activation of caspases (-8 and -3), and mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by the restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels. Western blot and qPCR analysis revealed that Shikonin heightened the IGF1R/PI3K/AKT signaling associated with cell survival while concurrently downregulating rotenone-induced intrinsic apoptotic pathways. These findings underscore Shikonin as a promising candidate to prevent the onset of pesticide-induced Parkinson's disease and potentially other oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative disorders.
40056242	Non-transgenic RNAi strategies for sustainable plant viral disease control: a review.	Viruses are a major cause of plant disease with an estimated annual economic impact of over $30 billion. They account for nearly 50% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and re-emerging plant diseases worldwide. To confer resistance against these diseases RNA interference (RNAi) technology can be employed. Designing silencing molecules like dsRNA homologous to the viral genome has been the most common non-transgenic method to induce RNAi mediated resistance in plants. dsRNAs are carefully tailored and produced considering factors such as the type of virus, target genomic region, dsRNA size, and method of application to maximise their efficiency. With the advent of new technologies like nano-platforms, a sustainable carrier can be developed to deliver these molecules, enhancing their stability and its bioavailability. This innovative technology faces regulatory debates globally and lacks legislation for commercialisation. But this is an eco-friendly alternative to conventional pesticides that can revolutionize the future of plant viral disease management, providing a bio-safe and an evergreen solution.
40056241	First-principles studies of the SCl<sub>2</sub> adsorption on the doped boron phosphide monolayer.	Sulfur dichloride (SCl<sub>2</sub>) molecules form a harmful substance; however, it is widely used in the industry as insecticide and in organic synthesis. In contact with water, these molecules produce other toxic and corrosive gases. Therefore, it is important to remove them from the environment. In this work, we have studied the boron phosphide (BP) monolayer (ML) doped with metal atoms to be considered as a sensor material for the detection of sulfur dichloride (SCl<sub>2</sub>) molecules. Studies are done by applying the density functional theory (DFT) according to the PWscf code of the Quantum ESPRESSO, using the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method within the framework of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE parameterization. The results obtained indicate weak interactions between the SCl<sub>2</sub> molecule and the pristine BP monolayer. However, after metal-doping (with atoms of: Ga, In, N and As) the interactions between the SCl<sub>2</sub> molecule and the ML was increased, as expected. Parameters such as the adsorption energy (E<sub>ad</sub>), work function (Ф), Bandgaps (E<sub>g</sub>), recovery time (τ), electronegativity (χ) and chemical potential (μ) have been analyzed. The results suggest that the metal-doped BP monolayer may be a promising sensing material for gas sensor devices to detect SCl<sub>2</sub> molecules.
40056226	Condensed low-dose total skin electron beam therapy for mycosis fungoides: an institutional retrospective review and subgroup analysis of patients with large cell transformation.	Low-dose total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) is an effective treatment option for mycosis fungoides (MF) with proven palliative effects and reduced toxicity. Presented is an institutional analysis of survival/response rate and quality of life for MF patients with subgroup analysis of those possessing pathologic large cell transformation (LCT). This is a single institutional retrospective review of patients with mycosis fungicides treated from 2014 to 2023 with low-dose TSEBT. All patients received 12 Gy in 6 fractions every other day with the modified Stanford technique, with boosts to shadowed sites between treatments, completed in 2 weeks. Outcomes evaluated included clinical response, duration of and time to response, patient-reported quality of life, and physician-scored disease burden. Forty-six patients were included in the study, 28 male and 18 female, with a median age 66.5 (range 32.7-90.6). Stage IB was most common at the time of TSEBT (41.3%). Median follow up was 44.5 months. The overall response rate was 91.3% (52.2% partial response, 19.6% complete and near complete response). The median duration of response was 8.2 months (range, 6.1-28.7), and the median time to best response was 3.5 months (range, 2.7-5.6). Quality of life (QOL) and disease burden continued to show significant benefit after TSEBT (p<0.001). In a subgroup analysis, 18 patients (39.1%) were found to have large cell transformation (LCT) at diagnosis. LCT was associated with higher presenting stage prior to TSEBT (p=0.016) and a better response to treatment (p=0.040). However, median duration of response was only 7.4 months in the patients with LCT vs. 39.4 months in the patients without (p=0.003). Condensed Low-dose TSEBT is a convenient treatment with favorable clinical outcomes and low toxicities in patients with mycosis fungoides. Patients with LCT may have shorter duration of treatment response. Further studies are warranted to validate this finding.
40056168	Exploiting TRP channel diversity in insects: a pathway to next-generation pest management.	Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels, a diverse family of over 30 ion channel subtypes, are pivotal in regulating sensory perception, thermoregulation, and feeding in insects. In Drosophila melanogaster, 13 TRP channels have been identified, while Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae possess 11 and 10, respectively, showcasing evolutionary adaptations to their ecological niches. This review explores recent advancements in understanding the structure, classification, and physiological functions of TRP channels, emphasizing their evolutionary divergence across Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera. Key TRP subfamilies, such as TRPA, TRPC, TRPM, TRPV, TRPN, and TRPP, are discussed, highlighting their roles in chemo-sensation, gustation, and stress responses. Examples include TRPA1's involvement in thermal sensing and TRPV's role in osmoregulation, critical for insect survival under fluctuating environmental conditions. The review highlights the potential of TRP channels as targets for pest control, focusing on TRP-specific insecticides like pymetrozine, afidopyrifen, and flonicamid, which impact feeding and sensory pathways. RNA interference (RNAi) techniques targeting TRP genes are highlighted as promising tools for innovative pest management. TRP channels' role in mediating thermal tolerance is particularly significant in the context of climate change, where variable temperatures challenge pest dynamics and agricultural sustainability. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for developing climate-resilient pest control strategies. The review also evaluates methodologies used in TRP channel studies, including genomic, transcriptomic, and functional assays, alongside behavioural analyses. Despite progress, challenges remain in studying TRP channels in non-model insects and elucidating their regulation. Future research should integrate multidisciplinary approaches to fully harness TRP channels for sustainable pest management.
40055830	Transposable elements in genomic architecture of Monilinia fungal phytopathogens and TE-driven DMI-resistance adaptation.	Fungicide resistance poses a significant challenge to plant disease management and influences the evolutionary dynamics of fungal pathogens. Besides being important phytopathogens, Monilinia species have become a model for discovering many fundamental questions related to fungal pathosystems. In this study, DMI-propiconazole sensitivity was investigated in view of transposable element (TE) dynamics in M. fructicola and M. laxa.
40055789	Intestinal myiasis caused by Clogmia albipunctata in Nepal: a case report.	Intestinal myiasis is a type of myiasis resulting from the accidental consumption of Clogmia albipunctata larvae. This type of myiasis generally displays symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention and discomfort, loss of appetite, weight loss, and intermittent diarrhea. It is a rare form of myiasis with relatively scarce literature in Nepal.
40054833	NAM-based analysis of contaminant short-term organ toxicity in HepaRG and RPTEC/TERT1 cells.	New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), including cell culture and multi-level omics analyses, are promising alternatives to animal testing. To become useable for risk assessment purposes they have to be applicable for different substance groups. One important group of substances is food contaminants, including synthetic chemicals, such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and natural compounds, such as mycotoxins and pyrrolizidine alkaloids. We tested five known contaminants affecting the liver and/or the kidney - PFOS, PFOA, Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AB<sub>1</sub>), lasiocarpine (Las), and cadmium chloride - using HepaRG and RPTEC/TERT1 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations for 36 and 72h. Our NAM-based testing protocol included marker protein analysis for cellular functions and targeted transcriptomics followed by bioinformatics pathway analysis. The effects observed were compared with established in vivo results. Protein analysis indicated various affected pathways in HepaRG cells, with generally fewer effects in RPTEC/TERT1 cells. The strongest transcriptional impact was noted for Las in HepaRG cells. This study demonstrated the test protocol's applicability across different substances, revealing significant differences between HepaRG and RPTEC/TERT1 cell lines. RPTEC/TERT1 cells, while expressing renal-specific CYP enzymes, were less suitable for detecting effects of substances requiring hepatic metabolic activation, like Las and AB<sub>1</sub>. Our data supports the concept of specific pathway toxicity, with pathway analysis enabling the prediction of effects based on mechanism rather than target organ. Employing multiple omics techniques provided comprehensive insights into various compound effects, including steatosis, reactive oxygen species production and DNA damage, highlighting the potential of an extended omics approach for advancing toxicological assessments.
40054824	Discovery of multi-chitinase inhibitors cinnamyl thiazolidinone compounds as candidates for insect growth regulators via ligand-based optimization strategies.	Chitinases are recognized as potential targets to develop novel insecticides to control lepidopteran pests. However, the design and development of effective multi-chitinase inhibitors remains a huge challenge. Based on the backgrounds, in this study, we designed and synthesized a series of cinnamyl-thiazolidinedione compounds as potential inhibitors against OfChtI, OfChtII and OfChi-h, for the first time, by integrating strategies including fragment replacement, 3D QSAR-guided design, and bioelectronic isosteric replacement. Among all synthesized compounds, those displayed substantial activities against three chitinases, such as 5f and 9m, simultaneously demonstrated significant larvicidal activities and growth regulation effects against various lepidopteran pests. Inhibition mechanism studies indicated that the π interactions, hydrophobic stacking, and electrostatic interactions between cinnamyl-thiazolidinone compounds and the conserved aromatic tryptophan and phenylalanine residues, as well as the polar asparagine residues in three chitinases, were crucial for their interactions. Furthermore, the qPCR experiment suggested that cinnamyl-thiazolidinone compounds could regulate the chitin metabolism pathway of Ostrinia furnacalis in vivo. This study provides the first successful example of developing novel multi-chitinase inhibitors through ligand-based optimization strategies, offering promising candidates for controlling lepidopteran pests.
40054780	Protective effects of Lavandula stoechas and Thymus numidicus essential oils against deltamethrin-induced hematological and biochemical toxicity in female rabbits.	Recent studies have shown that essential oils (EOs) extracted from medicinal and aromatic plants have herbicidal and/or insecticidal properties, helping to mitigate the toxicity experienced by living organisms exposed to pesticides. Moreover, the primary compounds isolated from these EOs also have the potential to reduce pesticide-induced damage. The present work aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Thymus numidicus (TNEO) and Lavandula stoechas (LSEO) against Deltamethrin-induced toxicity in female rabbits. The results obtained by GC/MS analysis showed that monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes were the main components of the EOs extracted from the aerial parts of Thymus numidicus and Lavandula stoechas. The use of the pesticide Deltamethrin caused significant damage to the liver and kidneys (p < 0.05), together with blood disorders, signs of restlessness and tremors. However, females treated with TNEO showed better tolerance than the group treated with LSEO. The combination of both oils showed more pronounced protective effects. This suggests a potential synergistic effect in reducing deltamethrin-induced toxicity.
40054662	Planktonic versus colony growth of Bacillus thuringiensis affects gene expression in vitro and infectivity against an insect host, Galleria mellonella.	The entomopathogenic bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, can complete its life cycle in environments of varying densities like insects, cadavers and soil. The stationary growth phase of the bacterial lifecycle includes virulent, necrotrophic and sporulation stages, which are under the control of pleotropic regulators of quorum sensing. In addition to insecticidal Cry-toxins, B. thuringiensis can generate quorum-dependent virulence factors. Herein, we investigated the development of B. thuringiensis under conditions of planktonic and colony growth. Using an insect host, namely Galleria mellonella larvae, we observed distinct virulence profiles and differential expression of quorum regulatory genes between B. thuringiensis from liquid planktonic growth and those colonies on a solid surface/medium.
40054562	Bioavailability assessment of propiconazole to Limnobium laevigatum and zebrafish (Danio rerio) in aquatic microcosms.	Residues of the triazole fungicide propiconazole (PCZ) in the environment can easily enter aquatic ecosystems through various pathways and accumulate in sediments, thus threatening ecosystem stability. The method of using passive sampling techniques to measure the freely dissolved concentration (C<sub>free</sub>) of pollutants in aquatic environments for assessing their bioavailability has been widely utilized in environmental risk assessments. This study employs oleic acid-embedded cellulose acetate membrane (OECAM) as a tool to determine the C<sub>free</sub> of PCZ in water. By establishing sediment spiking concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg in an aquatic microcosm, the distribution and bioaccumulation of PCZ in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the aquatic plant Limnobium laevigatum (L. laevigatum) were examined over a 7-day period. During the experimental period, the concentrations of PCZ in the water for the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg treatment groups remained approximately 0.9 μg/L and 10.0 μg/L, respectively. After 7 days, the PCZ content in the sediments decreased by 22.74% and 14.94%, respectively. In both zebrafish and L. laevigatum, the concentration of PCZ initially increased and then gradually stabilized, with both species exhibiting moderate accumulation ability for PCZ. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) for zebrafish in the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg treatment groups ranged from 9.25 to 13.96 and 7.84-16.05, respectively, while those for L. laevigatum ranged from 28.17 to 31.40 and 23.01-36.11, respectively. By the end of the 7-day experiment, the total PCZ content in both treatment groups decreased by an average of 17.51%. Among them, L. laevigatum contributed significantly, highlighting its potential in accelerating the removal of PCZ from aquatic ecosystems.
40054561	Occurrence of Current-Use Pesticides in Sediment Cores from Lakes and Peatlands in Pristine Mountain Areas of Brazilian National Parks.	This study assessed the occurrence of current-use pesticides in sediment cores from six lakes and peatlands in high-altitude (1,952-2,374 meters) pristine areas within two southeastern Brazilian National Parks: Itatiaia National Park (IT-NP) and Serra dos Órgãos National Park (SO-NP). We sampled three sediment cores from lakes at IT-NP and three from peatlands at SO-NP, totaling 60 subsamples. Among the 38 current-use pesticides assessed, 17 were found in at least one sample, with 14 - including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and acaricides - identified in both parks. The most frequently detected pesticides were carbendazim and carbaryl (75-95%), followed by acetochlor, chlorpyrifos, diuron, metolachlor and tebuconazole (40-70%) and, to a lesser extent, terbuthylazine and malathion (10-30%). The organophosphates disulfoton (6.83 ± 20.18 ng g<sup>-1</sup> dry weight) and chlorpyrifos (4.34 ± 6.81 ng g<sup>-1</sup> dw) registered the highest concentrations across all compounds in the sediment layers, with chlorpyrifos showing the greatest relative abundance (65.9 - 92.8%) in four out of six sites. Risk characterization results revealed highest risk quotient (RQ) values (416-14,589) for chlorpyrifos, indicating potential ecological risks. High RQs were also obtained for acetochlor (5.76 - 94.6), carbaryl (0.4 - 4.08), carbendazim (0.09 - 3.46), diazinon (2048), disulfoton (34-569), diuron (1.45 - 35.0) and malathion (10.94). These results highlight the threat posed by long-range pesticide transport to pristine areas at National Parks. Urgent regulatory measures are needed to mitigate their impact and safeguard these ecosystems from degradation.
40054558	Assessing heavy metal pollution levels and associated ecological risks in peatland areas in the Mekong Delta region.	Heavy metal (HM) pollution in soils and sediment is a significant concern, yet its levels and ecological risks in peatland areas remain unexplored. This study evaluates these aspects in three peatland regions of the Long An province in Vietnam. Comparisons of HM concentrations in peatland sediments from Tan Thanh, Thanh Hoa, and Duc Hue provinces in the study locations revealed highest values in the Tan Thanh region. Specifically, Cu and Ni were found in sediments at levels two to three times higher than the threshold effects level (TEL) and the effects range median (ERL) guidelines. The main sources of HM pollution in the study area are predicted to include the production and use of fertilizers and pesticides, metal surface processing, mechanical engineering and electronics manufacturing, and chemical plants. Further, positive correlations between HM concentrations and factors such as pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and clay-silt ratio in the sediments were identified through Spearman correlation analysis. The results obtained from the correlation analysis were further corroborated by Bayesian network analysis, which was also applied in this study. In addition, the contamination factor (CF) index indicated that Ni has a pollution level of "moderate degree" in Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and "considerable degree" in Tan Thanh (CF = 3.2), whereas, Cu has a pollution level of "moderate degree" in both Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and Tan Thanh (CF = 2.4). The modified degree of contamination (mCd) ranked the areas as Tan Thanh > Thanh Hoa > Duc Hue, with mCd indexes of 1.3, 0.7, and 0.4, respectively. The potential ecological risk index (RI) indicated a "low risk" level, with an average RI of 35.6 across all sites. These findings address knowledge gaps in HM pollution in peatlands but also contribute to the development of strategies for the protection of peatlands.
40054557	A gut bacterial supplement for Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) enhances host tolerance to nitenpyram: Insight from microbiota-gut-brain axis.	The widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides has severely impacted honey bees, driving population declines. Gut microbiota are increasingly recognized for their role in mitigating pesticide toxicity. This study evaluated the ability of Gilliamella sp. G0441, a core microbiome member of the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana), to confer resistance to the toxicity of a neonicotinoid nitenpyram. Newly emerged Asian honey bees were first colonized with gut microbiota in the source colony, then divided into four treatments: SS (fed sucrose solution throughout), SN (fed sucrose solution, then exposed to nitenpyram), GS (fed Gilliamella, then sucrose solution), and GN (fed Gilliamella, then exposed to nitenpyram), and their responses-mortality, food consumption, body weight, and sucrose sensitivity-were assessed. The protective effects of Gilliamella administration on the host were further validated using a microbiota-free bee model. Gilliamella supplementation significantly mitigated nitenpyram-induced appetite suppression, weight loss, impaired learning, and gut microbiota disruption. Mechanistic analyses revealed that nitenpyram disrupted brain metabolism via the intestinal MAPK pathway, reducing ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. Prophylactic Gilliamella treatment reversed these effects, restored metabolic balance, and modulated esterase E4 expression, enhancing pesticide resistance. This study underscores Gilliamella's vital role in honey bee resilience to neonicotinoids, offering insights into the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) as a pathway for enhancing pesticide tolerance and ecological health.
40054360	Localized nutrient management practices enhance the environmental-economic sustainability in potato production of China.	Potatoes, as the fourth most important staple crop in China, play a crucial role in ensuring national food security. However, potato production is heavily reliant on inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, leading to significant environmental challenges that compromise the sustainability of this production. A systematic evaluation of the current state of potato production sustainability in China and its potential for improvement is an urgent scientific issue that needs to be addressed. This study employs emergy sustainability index (ESI), energy return on investment (EROI), energy efficiency cost (EEC), and energy exchange ratio (EnER) methods to assess the environmental and economic aspects of potato production at the county level in China. Results indicate that, in 2015, the average ESI, EROI, EEC, and EnER for potato production in China were 1.37 (0.1-5.4), 2.21 (0.18-7.44), 0.06 (0.01-0.48) $/MJ, and 13.52 (2.68-112.40) MJ/$, respectively, with considerable spatial heterogeneity at the county level. Regions with higher sustainability in potato production are primarily concentrated in the northwest, which is also China's main potato-growing area. The random forest analysis identified yield, phosphorus, and nitrogen fertilizers as key factors influencing the sustainability of potato production. Regionally differentiated fertilizer management strategies led to a 43% and 35% increase in ESI and EROI, respectively, while EEC and EnER decreased by 50% and 47%. This study systematically explores the relationship between the environmental and economic dimensions of potato production from an energy perspective and proposes optimized management strategies for synergistic environmental-economic development. It provides methodological support and scientific guidance for promoting sustainable potato production and offers insights for global potato sustainability systems.
40054354	Assessment of the mechanism of combined toxicity of imidacloprid and triadimefon to Secale cereale L. seedlings under freeze-thaw cycle conditions.	Freeze-thaw (FT) cycles significantly stress crops in Northeast China, exacerbated by pesticide overuse, particularly affecting vulnerable seedlings during these periods. This study investigates the physiological responses of Secale cereale L. seedlings to the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) and the fungicide triadimefon (T) under simulated FT conditions. Our findings reveal that both pesticides impair photosynthesis in FT environments, resulting in increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and relative conductivity (RC). Furthermore, exposure to IMI and T enhances the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), while decreasing reduced glutathione (GSH) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels. Notably, combined stress resulted in significant increases of 80.26%, 16.36%, and 87.7% in RC, SOD, and POD activities, respectively, alongside substantial decreases of 65.87%, 46.34%, 63.74%, and 63.78% in net photosynthesis rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs), and water-use efficiency (WUE) in rye seedlings. Molecular docking analyses indicate that IMI and T interact with the active sites of SOD, POD, and APX through hydrogen bonding, compromising membrane integrity and inducing oxidative stress. While Secale cereale L. seedlings exhibit some resistance to IMI and T, FT conditions reduce this resilience. Correlation analysis reveals significant interactions between FT and pesticide stress on seedling physiology, suggesting that the concurrent use of IMI and T should be minimized in FT-prone areas. This study provides new insights into the pathways and mechanisms underlying the combined toxicity of IMI and T, offering a basis for assessing their environmental impacts on crops in regions susceptible to freeze-thaw cycles.
40054342	Interpretation of ecotoxicity tests using Enchytraeus albidus: Weight of soil characteristics in conditions of diffuse pollution.	One way to evaluate the impact of chemical substances released in the ecosystems is the use of terrestrial organisms in ecotoxicological bioassays. Enchytraeus albidus (Oligochaeta) is a species commonly used in such standardized bioassays aiming at identifying biological responses as life traits (survival and reproduction) using artificial spiked soils or in situ contaminated soils. However, in the latter case, it is known that other factors such as soil characteristics may affect the responses in E. albidus. We hypothesized that, in cases of low diffuse pollution, soil characteristics are major confounding factors that interfere with the interpretation of life trait responses in bioassays when their influence outweighs that of the diffuse pollution itself. To evaluate these confounding factors, 20 soils were collected from a low-contamination area encompassing diverse landscapes (urban, peri-urban, and rural) that exhibited gradients in pedological characteristics, biological parameters, and organic and inorganic contaminant levels, all within the range of classical values considered optimal for reproduction. E. albidus individuals were exposed to each soil sample, and survival and reproduction were monitored as life traits. Soil clustering and multifactorial analysis were employed to identify the confounding factors. Regardless of the life trait, low and sublethal contamination was rarely an explanatory factor for the responses of E. albidus. Survival was unaffected by soil characteristics or diffuse pollution. In contrast, reproduction was significantly and positively associated with soil pH and the levels of exchangeable sodium, calcium carbonate, molybdenum, PAHs, and insecticides, while it was negatively influenced by aluminum and exchangeable manganese. These findings suggest that studies conducted under conditions of diffuse, sublethal contamination should consider multiple natural soil characteristics in ecotoxicological bioassays to enable meaningful comparisons.
40054312	Assessing the environmental impacts of engineering and agrochemical pollution in a historically-eutrophic estuary: The Mondego case (W Portugal).	The Mondego Estuary (W Portugal) experienced a process of eutrophication in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, making it one of the most impacted systems in southern Europe. To examine its recent environmental evolution, sedimentary records were analyzed from a multiproxy approach, involving biotic, sedimentological, geochemical, physical, and radionuclide data. Results evidenced the transformation of the estuary due to anthropogenic cumulative impacts. The closure of the upstream branch triggered rapid 'continentalization' in the southern arm, altering the hydrosedimentary regime and favoring eutrophication. However, the middle and lower sectors exhibited stronger marine influences. Foraminiferal biota responded effectively to management interventions to improve hydrodynamics, while showing no discernible ecotoxicological responses to agricultural discharges. Pesticide accumulations patterns are shaped by natural and anthropogenic factors, with strong agrochemical fingerprints in the upper and lower sectors. The topmost 20-cm layer of sediments contain high pesticide concentrations and microplastics, posing challenges for future management and pollutant mitigation.
40054289	Stir bar sorptive extraction TDU-GC-QToF-HRMS for screening 230 pesticides in waters surrounding banana plantations in Costa Rica through community engagement.	"The Gems of Water" citizens' engagement activity united the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission with the Costa Rican based NGO Coral Conservation to screen for pesticides in local rivers using wide-screening technology. Citizens used stir bar sorptive extraction to collect and extract samples from three rivers and two wells in the south Caribbean region of Costa Rica, an area known for export-based banana agriculture. The advanced wide-screening method provided by the JRC Water Laboratory enabled the assessment of 230 agrochemicals. While the JRC supplied the technical equipment and protocols, the pesticide screening to be investigated and the monitoring scheme were co-designed with Coral Conservation group members, a local NGO. The pilot study collected new data on pesticide occurrence and their toxicity in the local tropical environment, complementing on-going studies in the region. The study found 23 pesticides, the majority of which are fungicides registered for use in banana cultivation (azoxystrobin, difenoconazole, fluopyram, thiabendazole). Cumulative pesticide concentrations ranged from 5.3 ng/L in the upper catchment of the Estrella River (E-a) to 954.9 ng/L in the lower catchment of the Sixaola River (S-c), where the highest individual compound concentration was also recorded for fungicide azoxystrobin (425.0 ng/L). At the sampling sites along the Carbon River and in the lower catchment of the Sixaola River, compounds fenamiphos, fenpropathrin and azoxystrobin were the main responsible for the elevated toxic units (Toxic Units >0.01) for crustacean daphnia magna. Beyond highlighting the link between agrochemical occurrences in surface waters and surrounding land use, the citizens' engagement aspect promotes alternative water quality monitoring methods, raising awareness and scientific literacy in local communities and underscoring the value of bottom-up approaches.
40054280	Groundwater pollution management with source remediation and composite geomembrane cut-off wall: An analytical model and field investigation.	This study proposes a two-dimensional analytical model for contaminant migration through the composite GMB cut-off wall (CGCW) and aquifer system considering the effects of the leakage and source remediation. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol's method is conducted to investigate the key impacts of contaminant distribution and degradation rate in the source, cut-off wall retardation factor and Darcy velocity in CGCW. The results show that the performance of the CGCW significantly is controlled by the leakage. The peak contaminant concentration at the outlet of CGCW for large leakage (10<sup>-8</sup> m/s) can be 77.1 times larger than that for small leakage (10<sup>-11</sup> m/s), with a performance deterioration of 98.7 %. Additionally, the performance of the CGCW can be significantly enhanced by the source remediation technique. The CGCW will not be broken through when contaminant source degradation rate is larger than 2.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup> /s. Increasing the cut-off wall retardation factors (> 14.7) and decreasing the standard deviation of contaminant source distribution (< 0.1) can also improve the CGCW performance. Moreover, the analytical model coupled with the genetic algorithm is used for the CGCW leakage detection and performance prediction at an abandoned pesticide site based on the monitoring data. Accurate leakage detections in the field (with errors of < 5 m) can be achieved through the analytical solution, which is validated by the non-destructive high-voltage technique. The analytical solution can be an easy-to-use tool for the design, installation and construction of the CGCW at polluted sites.
40054240	Scarcity of pesticide data in New Zealand with a focus on neonicotinoids: A review.	Since Europe's 2018 neonicotinoid ban on outdoor use of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, there has been growing political, scientific, and public interest in further understanding the impact of neonicotinoids on bees and the environment. Here, we assessed the trends in pesticide use in New Zealand, with a particular focus on neonicotinoids, to aid discussion on their use and associated risks. Obtaining data on annual trends in pesticide quantities is challenging, as there is no central collection of pesticide data across the agrichemical or regulatory sectors in New Zealand. Consequently, the true scale and frequency of pesticide usage, including neonicotinoids, remain largely unknown. The difference in neonicotinoid use patterns between New Zealand, where 45 % of forage brassicas (annual planting) and pastures (infrequent planting) are grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds, and northern hemisphere countries, where 56 % to over 90 % of annual food crops rely on neonicotinoid-treated seeds, indicates a lower overall neonicotinoid use in New Zealand. This difference underscores the need for region-specific approaches to pesticide management and regulation. Although residues can persist and migrate in the soil, current regulations only consider the risk of foliar spray to protect honey bees, overlooking the potential risks to native bees, which primarily live underground, as well as wider lethal and sublethal impacts of residues on non-target organisms. The lack of publicly accessible pesticide data limits scientific research on non-target and environmental effects, and the absence of readily available substitutes for neonicotinoids is the key challenge to be overcome in order to better manage the impact of these pesticides on New Zealand ecosystems.
40054238	Sublethal pesticide exposure decreases mating and disrupts chemical signaling in a beneficial pollinator.	Pesticides provide vital protection against insect pests and the diseases they vector but are simultaneously implicated in the drastic worldwide decline of beneficial insect populations. Convincing evidence suggests that even sublethal pesticide exposure has detrimental effects on both individual- and colony-level traits, but the mechanisms mediating these effects remained poorly understood. Here, we use bumble bees to examine how sublethal exposure to pesticides affects mating, a key life history event shared by nearly all insects, and whether these impacts are mediated via impaired sexual communication. In insects, mate location and copulation are primarily regulated through chemical signals and rely on both the production and perception of semiochemicals. We show through behavioral bioassays that mating success is reduced in bumble bee gynes after exposure to field-relevant sublethal doses of imidacloprid, and that this effect is likely mediated through a disruption of both the production and perception of semiochemicals. Semiochemical production was altered in gyne and male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), but not in exocrine glands where sex pheromones are presumably produced (i.e., gyne mandibular glands and male labial glands). Male responsiveness to gyne mandibular gland secretion was reduced, but not the queen responsiveness to the male labial secretion. In addition, pesticide exposure reduced queen fat body lipid stores and male sperm quality. Overall, the exposure to imidacloprid affected the fitness and CHCs of both sexes and the antennal responses of males to gynes. Together, our findings identify disruption of chemical signaling as the mechanism through which sublethal pesticide exposure reduces mating success.
40054200	Self-luminescent dual-ligand metal-organic framework based electrochemiluminescence probes for organophosphorus pesticides determination.	In this study, a signal amplification strategy was developed, which tris (2, 2'-bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) (Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup>) was incorporated as a guest molecule into the preparation system of lanthanide-based metal-organic framework (MOF). This strategy relied on strong electrostatic interactions and coordination competition to influence the growth process of the MOF, resulting in the firm immobilization of Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup> within the MOF structure. The spatial confinement effect of the MOF effectively improved the efficiency of electron transfer in the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction. The constructed ECL aptasensor using this MOF exhibited excellent performance, with limits of detection (LODs) for four organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), phorate, profenofos, isocarbophos and omethoate, as low as 0.0482 ng/mL, 0.0093 ng/mL, 0.0085 ng/mL, and 0.0893 ng/mL, respectively. This work has paved the way for a clever strategy of immobilizing Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup> molecules and amplifying signals, expanding the application of dual-ligand MOF, which provides valuable insights for future biosensor design.
40054159	Effect of temperature on the physiology and phytoremediation capacity of Spirodela polyrhiza exposed to atrazine and S-metolachlor.	Environmental toxicity of pesticides to aquatic plants can vary with temperature, as temperature affects plant metabolic processes. We exposed the globally distributed duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza to environmentally relevant concentrations (40 µg/L) of atrazine and S-metolachlor at temperatures typical of surface freshwater in temperate zones (10, 15, and 21 °C). Our objective was to assess the effects of low temperatures and herbicide concentration, and their interactions, on growth, photosynthesis, pigments, antioxidant enzymes, and phytoremediation capacity. Lower temperatures (10 °C) intensified the adverse effects of both herbicides on the quantum yield of photosystem II in S. polyrhiza, with photosynthesis being a more sensitive endpoint than biomass growth rate. Both in the control and herbicide treatments, plants exposed to 10 °C exhibited lower concentrations of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) and reduced ascorbate peroxidase activity, which may have contributed to the intensified negative effects on photosynthesis at this temperature. The removal of S-metolachlor was lower at 10 and 15 °C (3-8 %) compared to 21 °C (17 %), while no difference was observed between the three tested temperatures for atrazine (2-8 %). Our findings suggest that conducting pesticide toxicity tests at around 25 °C may underestimate the contaminants' inhibitory effects on aquatic plants during colder seasons and in temperate regions. Additionally, lower temperatures pose a challenge to the effectiveness of atrazine and S-metolachlor phytoremediation in aquatic environments.
40053875	Reduced Honeybee Pollen Foraging under Neonicotinoid Exposure: Exploring Reproducible Individual and Colony Level Effects in the Field Using AI and Simulation.	Honeybees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) are important pollinators. Their foraging behaviors are essential to colony sustainability. Sublethal exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids can significantly disrupt these behaviors, in particular pollen foraging. We investigated the effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on honeybee foraging, at both individual and colony levels, by integrating field experiments with artificial intelligence (AI)-based monitoring technology and mechanistic simulations using the BEEHAVE model. Our results replicated previous findings, which showed that imidacloprid selectively reduces pollen foraging at the colony level, with minimal impact on nectar foraging. Individually marked exposed honeybees exhibited prolonged pollen foraging trips, reduced pollen foraging frequency, and instances of drifting pollen foraging trips, likely due to impaired cognitive functions and altered metabolism. These behavioral changes at the individual level corroborated the previous model predictions derived from BEEHAVE, which highlights the value of combining experimental and simulation approaches to disentangle underlying mechanisms through which sublethal effects on individual foragers scale up to impact colony dynamics. Our findings have implications for future pesticide risk assessment, as we provide a robust feeding study design for evaluating pesticide effects on honeybee colonies and foraging in real landscapes, which could improve the realism of higher-tier ecological risk assessment.

GXNU-DY2-12 cultured in the rice medium. The new structure was analysed by NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and X-ray single crystal diffractometer. Compound <b>1</b> showed potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) - inhibiting activity and its IC<sub>50</sub> value was 1.02 μM. Notably, it demonstrated remarkable insecticidal efficacy against <i>Diaphorina citri Kuwayama</i>, achieving a mortality rate of 88% under standardised bioassay conditions.
40053730	Characterizing Public Sentiments and Drug Interactions in the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Social Media: Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis.	While the COVID-19 pandemic has induced massive discussion of available medications on social media, traditional studies focused only on limited aspects, such as public opinions, and endured reporting biases, inefficiency, and long collection times.
40053680	New Isoxazoline Cyclopropyl-Picolinamide Derivatives as Potential Insecticides.	Isoxazoline insecticides exhibit broad-spectrum insecticidal activity against insect pests. However, the high toxicity to honeybees limits their application in pest management. To explore reducing the toxicity of isoxazoline derivatives to bees, a series of new isoxazoline cyclopropyl-picolinamide derivatives were designed and synthesized. Bioassays revealed that <b>FSA37</b> showed excellent insecticidal activity against <i>Plutella xylostella</i>, <i>Spodoptera litura</i>, and <i>Spodoptera exigua</i>, with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.077, 0.104, and 0.198 mg/L, respectively. These results surpass those of fluxametamide, which displayed LC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.605, 0.853, and 1.254 mg/L. Furthermore, <b>FSA37</b> exhibited notable insecticidal activity against <i>Solenopsis invicta</i>. Importantly, bee toxicity studies indicated that <b>FSA37</b> possesses significantly lower acute oral toxicity compared to fluralaner and fluxametamide. Quantum chemical calculations and molecular docking studies suggest that the cyclopropyl-picolinamide fragment may be crucial for both biological activity and the safety of nontarget organisms. In conclusion, <b>FSA37</b> represents a promising candidate for a highly effective and environmentally friendly insecticide.
40053670	Discovery of Novel Isoxazoline Derivatives Containing Pyrazolamide Fragment as Insecticidal Candidates.	Lepidopteran species cause significant harm to agricultural yields and food quality. In this study, a series of innovative isoxazoline derivatives incorporating pyrazolamide moieties were carefully designed and synthesized as potential insecticidal agents. Among these, compound <b>F16</b> demonstrated an LC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.01 mg/L against <i>Plutella xylostella</i>, surpassing that of the lead compound fluxametamide (LC<sub>50</sub> = 0.15 mg/L). Furthermore, <b>F16</b> exhibited broad-spectrum insecticidal activity against <i>Pyrausta nubilalis</i>, <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i>, <i>Chilo suppressalis</i>, <i>Aphis craccivora</i>, and <i>Sogatella furcifera</i>. Notably, <b>F16</b> possessed low toxicity against <i>Danio rerio</i>, whereas fluxametamide displayed moderate toxicity. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis demonstrated that the potent insecticidal activity of <b>F16</b> is likely mediated by its specific interactions with γ-GABA receptors primarily through the formation of hydrogen bonds with key residues. Density functional theory calculations and molecular electrostatic potentials were also performed to gain insights into the insecticidal behavior of <b>F16</b>. These findings suggest that <b>F16</b> is a promising candidate for further investigation as a novel pesticide.
40053570	Natural occurrence of semicarbazide in heather honey.	Regulatory bodies aim to protect consumers from harmful substances. The use of certain antibiotics is prohibited in food-producing animals in the EU due to their potential detrimental effects on humans. Among these are nitrofuran antibiotics, which degrade rapidly so that their metabolites are used as markers in screening for their illegal use. The use of one metabolite, semicarbazide (SEM), as a marker for detecting the antibiotic nitrofurazone, has been criticized due to the many pathways it can be formed by and its natural occurrence in some food items. A recent change in the reference point of action (RPA) for SEM, as stated in Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/1871, due to a reassessment of sensitivity of the analyses, poses a problem for the export of heather honey in Norway. Norwegian heather honey seems to exceed the lowered RPA in numerous cases. Here we show that Norwegian heather honey samples, but not polyfloral 'summer' honey samples from the same hives, contain SEM. The simplest explanation for the demonstrated pattern is a natural source of SEM in heather honey, not the use of a banned antibiotic. Based on our results, we propose that an exception to the EU regulation should be added, exempting heather honey derived from <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> unless other nitrofurans or their metabolites are found together with SEM.
40053147	Fluorescent aptasensor for detection of Salmonella typhimurium using boric acid-functionalized terbium metal-organic framework and magnetic nanoparticles.	A fluorescent detection platform was designed using boric acid-functionalized terbium metal-organic framework (BA-Tb-MOF) and carboxyl-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to identify Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) bacteria. Firstly, carboxyl-modified Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>MNPs were coated with specific aptamer (Apt-MNPs) as the capture probe for S. typhimurium. Then, the Apt-MNPs were added to the bacterial suspension to facilitate the targeted binding. Subsequently, the fluorescent probe (BA-Tb-MOF) was introduced into this solution. The BA-Tb-MOF was strongly attached to the bacterial surface through interactions between BA and glycolipids on the bacterial cell walls, forming a stable complex. As the bacterial concentration increased, the fluorescence intensity of the solution progressively decreased due to the binding and removal of bacteria-Apt-MNPs/BA-Tb-MOF complexes through magnetic separation. Under optimum conditions, the concentration of S. typhimurium and the fluorescence intensity showed an inverse linear relationship within the range of 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL, and the detection limit was 4 CFU/mL. The developed sensor showed high specificity against several other pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. The developed fluorescence platform also successfully detected the S. typhimurium in drinking water and egg samples with satisfactory recoveries (83-98%). This strategy can be investigated further for the detection of S. typhimurium and other pathogens in food and clinical samples.
40053133	A comprehensive evaluation of Naftifine's efficacy and safety in treating dermatophyte infections; systematic review and meta-analysis.	Dermatophyte infections, including tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea corporis (ringworm), and tinea cruris (jock itch), are widespread fungal infections that significantly impact global health and quality of life. Naftifine, an allylamine antifungal agent, is noted for its potent fungicidal activity, targeting fungal cell membranes by inhibiting squalene epoxidase. Additionally, Naftifine has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, enhancing its therapeutic potential. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of Naftifine in treating tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and tinea cruris, focusing on clinical outcomes, cure rates, and adverse effects to provide a thorough understanding of its effectiveness in managing these infections. This meta-analysis followed the PRISMA guidelines and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing naftifine's efficacy and safety in treating tinea pedis, corporis, and cruris. A systematic search was conducted in major databases from inception until February 9th, 2024. Eligible studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria, and data were extracted and analyzed using RevMan software. Seven multicenter RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Naftifine demonstrated superior efficacy compared to vehicle control in terms of complete cure rate (RR = 5.83, 95% CI [3.73 to 9.10]) with no significant heterogeneity (I2 = 0%), clinical improvement [RR = 1.55, 95% CI (1.21-2.00)], and treatment effectiveness [RR = 3.93, 95% CI (2.44-6.33)] for tinea pedis. Similarly, for tinea corporis and cruris, Naftifine demonstrated significant efficacy compared to vehicle control regarding complete cure rate, mycological cure rate, clinical improvement, and treatment effectiveness. However, there was no significant difference in adverse events between Naftifine and the vehicle across all three conditions. Naftifine is an effective topical treatment for tinea pedis, corporis, and cruris, with a favorable safety profile with no significant difference in adverse events compared to the vehicle.
40053044	Essential oils on the control of postharvest diseases of papaya.	Papaya is susceptible to fungal deterioration and the use of essential oils (EOs) emerges as a promising alternative to fungicides, which causes environmental and human health problems. To evaluate the antifungal activity of essential oils and their major constituents in controlling papaya pathogens, the following in vitro assessments were conducted: I) screening of seven EOs regarding the antifungal activity; II) determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the most promising EOs; III) analysis of chemical composition of the most effective oils; and IV) evaluation of the antifungal potential of the major constituents both individually or in combination. The results showed that the EOs of cinnamon bark, oregano, clove basil, and rosemary pepper exhibited high antifungal activity against all studied fungi, with MIC values from 0.50 to 2.00 μL mL-1. The major constituents found in oregano EO were carvacrol, ρ-cymene, and thymol; in cinnamon bark EO, cinnamaldehyde, o-methoxy, and cinnamyl; in rosemary pepper EO, thymol, ρ-cymene, and caryophyllene; and in clove basil EO, eugenol, ρ-cymene, and caryophyllene. Regarding the antifungal activity of the EO constituents, the mixture of the three major demonstrated greater efficiency against the studied fungi. Using constituents represents an alternative for controlling postharvest diseases in papaya.
40052866	The impact of adverse weather events on cockroaches and flies, and the possible effects on disease.	Climate change is associated with an increase in adverse weather events such as heatwaves, drought, hurricanes and typhoons, floods and wildfires. These extreme weather events can disrupt public health infrastructure and can be detrimental to hygiene and sanitation practices, leading to knock-on effects on populations of vectors associated with disease transmission. Both the frequency and intensity of climate-related adverse weather events are predicted to increase, likely resulting in changes to vector dynamics and vector-human interactions, leading to an increased risk of disease transmission. Yet, a gap exists in our knowledge of the impact of these events on hygiene and associated pest-borne diseases. A growing body of research connects two groups of pests (domestic flies and cockroaches) that are linked with poor hygiene and sanitary conditions to mechanical disease transmission. We present a review of these specific vectors' population biology and behaviour, links with hygiene and sanitation and how pest populations and public health could be affected by adverse weather events. There is evidence that increased temperatures, extreme rainfall and flooding events are most likely to be associated with increased fly and cockroach populations and changes in the behaviour or activity of these insects, which could exacerbate the risks of disease transmission. Warmer temperatures accelerate their rates of reproduction, while heavy rainfall and flooding disrupt their habitats, driving them indoors. Other factors like habitat destruction, breakdown in healthcare system infrastructure, population displacement and altered pesticide use following an extreme weather event are predicted to influence insect populations and provide opportunities for increased human -pest contact. We highlight research gaps and provide recommendations for the improvement of current domestic and professional pest control products and strategies that might be employed to mitigate the impacts of adverse weather events on hygiene-related pests in a changing world.
40052667	Evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of combination therapy with 1% ivermectin solution in moderate to severe rosacea: a cohort study.	<b>Introduction.</b> Rosacea is a common chronic dermatological disease that negatively affects the quality of life of patients.<b>Hypothesis.</b> Combination therapy with 1% ivermectin solution alongside systemic treatment methods is more effective in reducing the severity of moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea symptoms compared with traditional treatment methods alone.<b>Aim.</b> This study is aimed at finding new approaches to the treatment of moderate and severe forms of rosacea.<b>Methodology.</b> This research compared the main group receiving ivermectin with a control group getting conventional treatment to assess the safety and efficacy of 1% ivermectin combination therapy in 70 individuals with moderate to severe rosacea. At weeks 2, 4 and 8, the dynamics of clinical symptoms were evaluated using a 4-point scale.<b>Results.</b> The use of combination therapy with ivermectin led to a more pronounced improvement in the clinical picture. Already at week 4, a 48-54% decrease in symptoms was recorded in the main group, while in the control group, it was only by 25-30%. By week 8, an almost complete reduction of the main manifestations was observed in the main group (78-88% decrease). Regression analysis confirmed that combination therapy with ivermectin was a key factor determining a more substantial clinical improvement, regardless of age, gender and the initial severity of the patient's condition. In addition, a much more pronounced decrease in the number of Demodex ticks was recorded in the main group. The effectiveness of combination therapy with ivermectin did not depend on the demographic or clinical characteristics of patients, which makes it a universal method of treating rosacea. No serious side effects have been reported in any patient receiving combination therapy, which indicates its safety.<b>Conclusion.</b> This approach can be a valuable addition to existing strategies for the treatment of this chronic dermatological disease.
40052623	The miRNA-275 Targeting RpABCG23L is Involved in Pyrethroid Resistance in the Bird Cherry-Oat Aphid, a Serious Agricultural Pest.	<i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> is a global agricultural pest which had developed resistance to different insecticides. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter plays an important role in insecticide resistance. However, ABC transporters' role and regulatory mechanism in mediating <i>R. padi</i> 's response to pyrethroids are unclear. In this study, we found that <i>RpABCG23L</i> was significantly overexpressed in the pyrethroid-resistant strains of <i>R. padi</i>. Knockdown of <i>RpABCG23L</i> significantly increased the susceptibility of <i>R. padi</i> to lambda-cyhalothrin and bifenthrin. Luciferase reporter gene analysis showed that miR-275 binds to the <i>RpABCG23L</i> coding region and down-regulates its expression. Injection of miR-275 mimics significantly reduced <i>RpABCG23L</i> expression and increased <i>R. padi</i> susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin and bifenthrin, while miR-275 inhibitor injection enhanced <i>RpABCG23L</i> expression and increased tolerance to both insecticides. The results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the mechanism of miRNA-mediated pyrethroid resistance, and open up a new way for the development of miRNA-based biopesticides.

40052247	Preimaginal development of Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) in brackish water gives rise to adult mosquitoes with thicker cuticles and greater insecticide resistance.	Aedes aegypti L. and Aedes albopictus Skuse mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), the principal vectors of many human arboviral diseases, lay eggs and undergo preimaginal development in fresh water. They have recently been shown to also develop in brackish water in coastal areas. Previous findings showed that Ae. aegypti larvae developing in brackish water possessed thicker cuticles and greater larvicide resistance than larvae developing in fresh water. The present study compared cuticle ultrastructure, resistance to adulticides, and the activities of adulticide detoxifying enzymes in female mosquitoes emerging from fresh and brackish water-developing Ae. aegypti preimaginal stages. The results showed that brackish water-derived females possessed significantly thicker tarsal and abdominal cuticles compared to fresh water-derived females. Brackish water-derived Ae. aegypti females were also significantly more resistant to three different types of pyrethroids and malathion compared to fresh water-derived females. Corresponding reversal of cuticle changes and adulticide resistance when preimaginal salinity was reversed showed that preimaginal salinity determined both procuticle structure and adulticide resistance in brackish water-derived females. Compared with fresh water-derived Ae. aegypti females, brackish water-derived females had similar activities of the adulticide-detoxifying enzyme families of esterases and glutathione S-transferases and a modest increase in the activity of monooxygenases, all of which were lower than the threshold values attributed to resistance in field populations of Ae. aegypti. Reduced permeability of the thicker and remodelled cuticles in brackish water-derived Ae. aegypti females to adulticides is proposed to be mainly responsible for their greater resistance to different types of adulticides. Greater salinity tolerance of preimaginal stages, adult cuticle changes and higher larvicide and adulticide resistance are inherited properties of brackish water-developing Ae. aegypti that reverse in a few generations after transfer to fresh water. This is compatible with a role for epigenetic changes in the adaptation of Ae. aegypti to brackish water. Greater resistance of salinity-tolerant Ae. aegypti to adulticides and larvicides poses a hitherto unappreciated problem for controlling arboviral diseases, with attendant implications also for other mosquito-borne diseases.
40051538	Assessing trends in non-coverage bias in mobile phone surveys for estimating insecticide-treated net coverage: a cross-sectional analysis in Tanzania, 2007-2017.	Monitoring insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage and use generally relies on household surveys which occur on a relatively infrequent basis. Because indicators of coverage are used to forecast the need for ITNs and aid in planning ITN distribution campaigns, higher frequency monitoring could be helpful to guide programme strategies. The use of mobile phone-based survey (MPS) strategies in low-income and middle-income countries has emerged as a rapid and comparatively inexpensive complement to large-scale population-based household surveys, considering the dramatic growth trend of mobile phone ownership.
40051450	Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance pyraclostrobin.	The conclusions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authorities of the rapporteur Member State Germany and co-rapporteur Member State Hungary for the pesticide active substance pyraclostrobin and the assessment of applications for maximum residue levels (MRLs) are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of pyraclostrobin as a fungicide and plant growth regulator on cereals (wheat, barley, oats, rye, triticale), maize (forage and grain) and potatoes. MRLs were assessed in sweet corn and fish. The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment and the proposed MRLs, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are reported where identified.
40050133	Removing autumn leaves in residential yards reduces the spring emergence of overwintering insects.	Seasonal fallen leaf removal is a common landscaping practice in urban ecosystems. Yet, we have little understanding of the practice's impact on overwintering arboreal arthropods that may use the habitat seasonally. To assess this yearly disturbance, we removed or retained fallen leaves in low and high-maintenance areas of pesticide-free residential yards in Maryland, USA. We recorded all individuals of 5 key aboveground arthropod taxa emerging over the following spring seasons and tracked environmental variables like belowground temperatures. Overall, leaf removal decreased the abundance of emerging arthropods by 17 %, with some taxa more negatively affected (moths and butterflies-45 %; beetles-24 %, spiders-up to 67 %) than others (flies, parasitic wasps). We further examined the impact of leaf removal on diversity and composition using two taxa important to land managers: (1) moths and butterflies as herbivores and pollinators and (2) solitary parasitic and predatory wasps as natural enemies of pests. Removing leaves reduced the diversity of moths and butterflies by about 40 %, changing community composition by decreasing the number of species that feed internally in leaves as larvae, overwinter as larvae, or overwinter in senesced leaves. Removal also altered beneficial parasitic wasp community composition, but not family diversity, with the most significant adverse effect on wasps in Eulophidae, a family specializing in parasitizing leaf-mining insects. Lastly, we used path analysis to explore how environmental variables around the overwintering site mediate moth and butterfly emergence patterns. While leaf removal led to more variation in spring soil temperatures, higher emergence was directly tied to greater leaf biomass and higher mean soil temperatures in high-maintenance yard areas with low canopy cover. Overall, a management strategy of retaining fallen leaves in yards may conserve insect biodiversity and associated services, increasing the ecological value of residential landscapes across two levels of management intensity.
40050071	Simultaneous Determination of Hormones in Botanical Dietary Supplements With Supramolecular Solvent-Based Extraction by HPLC-MS/MS.	Dietary supplements typically contain either natural products or synthetic chemicals. While botanical dietary supplements are often thought to be more natural and safer, they could still contain potentially harmful ingredients. Despite the detection of sex hormones in plants and soil, it is still worth examining if products made from plants contain them. In this study, simultaneous determination of 14 kinds of sex hormones in botanical dietary supplements was conducted by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). A suitable sample pretreatment method is expected to extract and purify the sample in a single step when detected by HPLC-MS/MS, enabling it to be directly injected into the instrument. Herein, supramolecular solvent (SUPRAS), composed of n-hexanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and water, was employed to extract hormones from botanical dietary supplements. The effect of various parameters, including the composition of the supramolecular solvents, their dosage, and vortex time, on extraction efficiency was investigated. The results demonstrated that the 14 compounds exhibited excellent linearity over the concentration range of 0.5-100 µg·L<sup>-1</sup>, with determination coefficients exceeding 0.99. Recoveries were assessed at three levels using spiked samples, ranging from 75.6% to 115.8%, with relative standard deviations between 0.8% and 9.7%. This method was successfully applied to determine 14 sex hormones in botanical dietary supplements. Progesterone was detected in one sample at a concentration of 64 µg·kg<sup>-1</sup>. The SUPRAS method coupled with HPLC-MS/MS, was proved to be efficient, easy-to-operate, and sensitive for determining sex hormones in botanical dietary supplements.
40050030	Field-evolved resistance in Phthorimaea absoluta to abamectin: genetic foundations, female-linked traits, and cross-resistance pattern.	Phthorimaea absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) poses a significant challenge in tomato cultivation owing to its increasing resistance to various insecticide classes. This study aimed to characterize the resistance of a field-collected P. absoluta population to abamectin, focusing on its genetic aspects and cross-resistance with other chemical groups, and monitoring the frequency of resistance in other populations.
40050013	Evaluating the biocontrol potential and whole genome sequencing of Pseudomonas fluorescens HT1: a promising agent against southern blight in Coptis chinensis.	Southern blight, caused by Sclerotium rolfsii, poses a formidable threat to the cultivation of Coptis chinensis, especially affecting both yield and crop quality. Given the environmental harm associated with chemical fungicides, microbial antagonists are emerging as a viable solution for plant disease management. This study aimed to identify bacterial strains with antagonistic properties against southern blight in Coptis chinensis and to evaluate their biocontrol capabilities.
40049996	Monitoring of resistance or susceptibility of Amblyomma mixtum (Acari: Ixodidae) to synthetic acaricides from Mexico.	In Mexico, a substantial challenge within cattle industry pertains to the widespread occurrence of Rhipicephalus microplus and Amblyomma mixtum infestation. Various acaricides compounds have been developed to manage these ticks infestation; however, their improper and frequent application has contributed to the emergence of resistant tick strains. However, there is a paucity of data specifically regarding the acaricide resistance status of A. mixtum. For this reason, the aim of this study was to monitor the susceptibility or resistance of A. mixtum to principal synthetic chemical acaricides used in control programme of A.mixtum and identify potential risk factors associated with A. mixtum resistant to ixodicides. Fully engorged adult female A. mixtum ticks were collected from cattle in twenty ranches. Larval packet test (LPT) and larval immersion test (LIT) were performed using discriminating doses (d.d) of ixodicides. The formulations tested were a Phenylpyrazole (fipronil), Organophosphates (coumaphos), Formamidine (amitraz) Synthetic Pyrethroids (cypermethrin) and Macrocyclic Lactones (ivermectin). The resulting phenotype was categorized as either resistant, probable resistant, or susceptible. A strain of A. mixtum collected from a cattle farm in the municipality of Las Choapas exhibited resistance to multiple acaricides, demonstrating diverse mortality levels at the d.d: fipronil (65.3 %), coumaphos (54.3 %), amitraz (52.4 %), and cypermethrin (35.5 %); except for ivermectin, where probable resistance was observed (90.8 %). A total of 50 % (10/20) of A. mixtum strains collected were resistant at least one acaricide evaluated. Furthermore, the strains of A. mixtum evaluated showed a higher frequency of resistance to amitraz. Also, only three strains assessed were susceptible to all acaricides tested. This crucial information will refine strategies for the effective control of ectoparasites.
40049910	Saponins in soil, their degradation and effect on soil enzymatic activities.	Saponins can be potential candidates for the development of safe biopesticides, due to their widely acknowledged insecticidal, fungicidal and nematicidal activity, but information on their effects on soil biological properties is still limited. This study aimed to investigate the short-term fate of saponins from Medicago sativa in soil and their dose-effect relationship with microbial biomass and selected enzyme activities in soils with different origin, physical and chemical properties. Microbial degradation of total saponins ranged from 46 % to 91 %, according to soil characteristics, within 28 days from their incorporation into the soil. Both saponin glycosidic chains and triterpenic aglycones were also microbially degraded, though by dynamics changing among the different soils. In all soils, M. sativa saponins significantly reduced microbial biomass at rates of 10 and 20 mg saponin mixture per g of soil. Microbial enzymatic activities were less affected as indicating an adaptive response of soil microbial communities to the presence of saponins.
40049501	pH-responsive nanoparticles for oral delivery of RNAi for sustained protection against Spodoptera exigua.	To enhance the RNAi efficiency of dsRNA against the Spodoptera exigua through a feeding method, we developed a pH-responsive nanoparticle, chitosan-polyethylene glycol-carboxyl (CS-PEG-COOH). This nanoparticle enhances RNAi efficiency by improving dsRNA stability in the midgut of S. exigua and can intelligently release dsRNA under alkaline conditions. Firstly, the CS-PEG-COOH carrier was prepared via cross-linking reactions, and the mass ratio of dsRNA to CS-PEG-COOH was obtained using electrophoretic mobility. The carrier composite materials were then characterized using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Zeta potential analysis. The stability and delivery efficiency of the dsRNA/CS-PEG-COOH complex were then verified using electrophoretic mobility and fluorescence labeling methods. Finally, the RNAi efficiency and synergistic mechanism of the complex were analyzed using feeding methods and RNA-seq. The results show that CS-PEG-COOH (40.16 nm size, + 6.44 mV charge) forms a clustered complex with dsRNA through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. CS-PEG-COOH significantly enhancing the stability and delivery efficiency of dsRNA in the midgut of S. exigua. Additionally, at pH > 8, dsRNA could be released from dsRNA/CS-PEG-COOH. The RNAi results showed that, dsRNA/CS-PEG-COOH could effectively inhibit the expression of the Acetylcholinesterase (Ace1 + Ace2) gene (65 %), and led to significantly increase mortality (51.82 %), a prolonged developmental period (25 %) and reduced egg production (22.02 %). The physiological and molecular synergistic mechanisms were revealed by RNA-seq analysis. The CS-PEG-COOH-loaded dsACE1 + dsACE2 led to down-regulation of genes related to drug metabolism, hormone synthesis, and stratum corneum biosynthesis, which inhibited insect growth and development. Overall, We developed an appropriate delivery method for dsRNA application in Lepidoptera, providing a basis for developing RNA pesticides with high efficiency and environmental safety.
40049439	Chlorpyrifos-oxon results in autophagic flux dysfunction contributing to neuronal apoptosis via a ROS/AMPK/CHOP activation pathway.	Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used organophosphate (OP) pesticide in agriculture and sanitation, known to elicit neurotoxic effects. Chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO), a metabolite of CPF, is the primary neurotoxic agent, yet its mechanisms are less understood. In this study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of CPO-induced neurotoxicity. CPO exposure significantly induced cytotoxicity in Neuro-2a cells, alongside the activation of apoptosis, as evidenced by an increase in the apoptotic cell population, caspase-3 activity, and cleavage of caspaspe-3, -7, and PARP proteins. Furthermore, defective autophagy was observed in CPO-treated Neuro-2a cells, indicated by increased expression of Beclin-1, Atg5, LC3-II, and p62 proteins. 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, suppressed CPO-activated LC3-II and apoptotic marker proteins expression, but not p62. In contrast, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1, autophagic flux inhibitors, potentiated the CPO-induced elevation of LC3-II, p62, and cleaved caspase-3 and -7 protein levels. CPO exposure also upregulated CHOP protein expression. Transfection with CHOP-specific siRNA markedly reduced CHOP protein expression, autophagic flux dysfunction, and apoptosis. Additionally, CPO exposure significantly increased AMPKα phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), but not the AMPK inhibitor Compound C, effectively attenuated the CPO-induced ROS generation in neuronal cells, which was accompanied by the prevention of AMPKα activation, downstream CHOP expression, autophagic flux dysfunction, and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that CPO-induced neurotoxicity arises from autophagic flux dysfunction, contributing to apoptosis via the ROS-activated AMPK pathway, which regulates CHOP expression, ultimately leading to neuronal cell death. Targeting the ROS/AMPK/CHOP axis may offer a promising intervention to against CPO-induced neurotoxicity.
40049387	INTERPRETABLE MACHINE LEARNING UNVEILS KEY PREDICTORS AND DEFAULT VALUES IN AN EXPANDED DATABASE OF HUMAN IN VITRO DERMAL ABSORPTION STUDIES WITH PESTICIDES.	The skin is the main route of exposure to plant protection products for operators, workers, residents, and bystanders. Assessing dermal absorption is key for evaluating pesticide exposure. The initial approach to risk assessment involves using default dermal absorption values or applying read-across data from experimental results from different formulations. In this way, to support non-dietary pesticide risk assessment focused but not limited to Brazil, this project evaluated 759 GLP-compliant in vitro human skin dermal absorption studies covering 25 formulation types and 248 active substances at multiple concentrations using interpretable machine learning techniques. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees - BART method indicated that Log Pow and molecular weight have the highest importance when predicting dermal absorption; both parameters exhibit moderate interaction uncertainty within each other and with formulation groups water-based and organic-solvent based and with tested form (concentrates or dilutions). The default values for each formulation group were determined using the upper bound of a non-parametric confidence interval for a specified quantile, with calculations conducted via bootstrapping methods; the proposed values correspond to the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile: for concentrates, 10% for organic-solvent based, 4% for water-based and 3% for solid formulations. For dilutions, 42% for organic-solvent based, 37% for water-based and 39% for solid formulations. Organic-solvent based dermal absorption values from experimental data can be used as conservative surrogates for solid and water-based formulations. When no experimental data is available for higher spray dilutions of a given formulation type, a pro-rated correction is proposed to a 2 to 5-fold concentration difference, limited to the respective formulation group default value.
40049307	Contaminant-driven midgut histological damage in bees and other aculeate Hymenoptera: A quantitative review.	We present a review about histological sub-lethal effects due to anthropogenic contaminants on the midgut of bees and other aculeate hymenopterans. Contaminant types, damage types, and methodology were extracted and summarized from 74 published articles, and then quantitatively analyzed. We found that the Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) is by far the most widely used model. Contaminants have largely been tested under laboratory conditions, particularly insecticides and fungicides. Tissue-level damage (e.g., degradation of epithelium and of peritrophic membrane) were often detected together with cell-level damage (e.g., cell vacuolisation, karyorrhexis). Descriptive statistics and mixed models suggested that herbicides may cause a specific mix of alterations with an overall lower severity compared with other pesticides, while the combined use of light and electron microscopy seemed to detect more damage types. We claim for efforts to reduce biases in future studies on such histological effects, allowing their clearer use as markers of human activities.
40049250	Is there a link between exposure to pesticides and antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria isolated from Thai farmers?	The organophosphate pesticides have the potential to impact microbial diversity, but their influence on antibiotic resistance (AR) in bacteria remains understudied.
40049237	Antisense DNA acaricide targeting pre-rRNA of two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae as efficacy-enhancing agent of fungus Metarhizium robertsii.	Two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the most dangerous pests in the world and one of the most pesticide-resistant species ever. Complex biological preparations are of great interest for the acaricide market because they do not poison ecosystems and do not bioaccumulate in food products, simultaneously, pests more slowly develop resistance to complex preparations. In this study we applied complex bioformulation composed of 11-mer antisense oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide acaricide or DNA acaricide) Tur-3 and fungus Metarhizium robertsii for T. urticae control. We discovered that joint contact application of DNA acaricide and fungus M. robertsii significantly attenuates reproduction rate of the mite. Our results indicate that DNA acaricide Tur-3 and fungus M. robertsii act synergistically and lead to a significant 7-times elevated mortality rate and a reduction of 80% in the mite fecundity. Oligonucleotide acaricide Tur-3 causes 2.5-fold reduction of expression of the target pre-rRNA of T. urticae and suppresses the activity of key players of detoxifying enzymes of its defense system (phenoloxidase, esterase, glutathione-S-transferase), on average, by 2-3 fold. Oligonucleotide acaricide Tur-3 interferes with protein biosynthesis causing decrease in production of defense system enzymes of the pest. Obviously, attenuation of defense system enhances fungal infection or/and fungus produces a variety of enzymes that degrade the integument structure of the pest, aiding the penetration of oligonucleotide acaricide Tur-3. This research article is the first evidence of successful application of oligonucleotide acaricide together with fungus M. robertsii for efficient T. urticae control. Combined application of oligonucleotide acaricides based on conservative antisense sequences of rDNAs of pests and fungi is a potent and selective approach for eco-friendly plant protection.
40049114	Comprehensive ecological risk assessment method for multi-pesticide pollution in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, China.	Pesticide residues and their accumulation in marine environments pose potential threats to the ecosystem balance and human health. Assessment of pesticide residue levels and ecological risks in marine waters is insufficient. Therefore, we conducted a quantitative analysis of four different categories of pesticides in the surface waters of the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea in China. A comprehensive ecological risk assessment framework was constructed based on the importance of ecosystem services, utilizing the risk quotient (RQ) and entropy weighting methods to evaluate the multi-pesticide ecological risks in the study area. Thirteen pesticides were detected in the surface waters, with total concentration levels ranging from 8.18 to 80.60 ng/L, and the herbicide Atrazine and insecticide Imidacloprid were found at the highest levels. Concentration levels were higher in the Bohai Sea than in the Yellow Sea, and the highest area was mainly located on the coast of Shandong Province, China. The ecological risk of multi-pesticide pollution was the highest in the coastal regions of Shandong and was associated with Atrazine and Acetamiprid. Source analysis suggested that triazine herbicide and neonicotinoid insecticides are predominantly land-sourced, whereas sulfonylurea herbicides are primarily atmospheric. This study provides valuable support for formulating relevant environmental protection policies and measures.
40048801	A progress report in advancements of heterocyclic compounds as novel antimalarial agents over the last 5 years.	Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, remains a significant global health challenge, especially in tropical and subtropical regions where the disease is endemic. The complex Plasmodium lifecycle, involving stages in both the liver and bloodstream, leads to symptoms such as high fever, anemia, and, in severe cases, life-threatening complications, particularly P. falciparum infections. While historical treatments such as quinine and modern therapies such as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been effective, the growing issue of drug and insecticide resistance undermines these efforts. This resistance has spurred the need for new antimalarial drugs and strategies. Among the promising areas of research are heterocyclic compounds, which, due to their diverse and versatile chemical structures, are being investigated for their ability to disrupt the Plasmodium lifecycle. These compounds have potential as novel therapeutic agents that could enhance current treatment options. Understanding the mechanisms underlying drug resistance and advancing these therapeutic innovations are crucial for maintaining effective malaria control and treatment, highlighting the importance of on-going research in this field.
40048645	Counterion Lewis Acidity Determines the Rate of Hexafluorophosphate Hydrolysis in Nonaqueous Battery Electrolytes.	The decomposition of LiPF<sub>6</sub> in nonaqueous battery electrolytes is a well-studied, deleterious process that leads to hydrofluoric acid (HF) driven transition metal dissolution at the positive electrode and gas production (H<sub>2</sub>) at the anode, often attributed to the inherent moisture sensitivity of the hexafluorophosphate anion. In this work, we use in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to demonstrate that the rate of PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup> hydrolysis significantly decreases in Na and K systems, where the Lewis acidity of the cation dictates the rate of decomposition according to Li<sup>+</sup> > Na<sup>+</sup> > K<sup>+</sup>. Despite the remarkable stability of Na and K electrolytes, we show that they are still susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of protons, which can catalyze the breakdown of PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup>, indicating that these chemistries are not immune from decomposition when paired with solvent/cathode combinations that generate H<sup>+</sup> at high voltage. Quantitative in situ multinuclear and multidimensional NMR of decomposed electrolytes shows that after long-term degradation, these systems contain HF, HPO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>F as well as a variety of defluorinated byproducts, such as organophosphates and phosphonates, that are structurally similar to herbicides/insecticides and may pose health and environmental risks. Taken together, these results have important implications for Na- and K-ion batteries where hazardous and harmful byproducts like HF, soluble transition metals, organophosphates, and phosphonates can be greatly reduced through cell design. Our results also suggest that next-generation chemistries present a pathway to safer batteries that contain lower quantities of flammable gases, like H<sub>2</sub>, if properly engineered.
40048640	Design, Synthesis, and Herbicidal Activity of Biaryl-Pyridazinone/Phthalimide Derivatives as Novel Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase Inhibitors.	In this study, a series of biaryl-pyridazinone/phthalimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as novel protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) inhibitors. Herbicidal activity and crop safety assessments revealed that some compounds exhibited excellent herbicidal activity and crop safety profiles. For instance, at 37.5 g ai/ha, compound <b>7m</b> inhibited <i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i> (<i>AR</i>), <i>Abutilon theophrasti</i> (<i>AT</i>), <i>Medicago sativa</i> (<i>MS</i>), <i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i> (<i>EC</i>), and <i>Digitaria sanguinalis</i> (<i>DS</i>) with 90% to 100% efficacy, comparable to the commercial herbicide saflufenacil (SAF). Compound <b>7m</b> still showed effective weed control against the test broadleaf weeds at a lower dose of 9.375 g ai/ha. Additionally, <b>7m</b> demonstrated excellent safety for wheat and corn at dosages up to 150 g ai/ha. <i>In vitro</i> experiments revealed that the representative compounds exhibited significant inhibitory activity against <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> PPO (<i>At</i>PPO). Molecular docking of <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> PPO (<i>Nt</i>PPO) and <b>7m</b> showed significant hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and π-alkyl interactions between <b>7m</b> and residues, such as Cys-177, Thr-176, Arg-98, Phe-392, and Leu-372. Furthermore, <b>7m</b> caused a notable reduction in chlorophyll (Chl) content in weeds. <b>7m</b> is a promising candidate for the development of novel herbicides.
40048639	Chemical targeting of prolyl-tRNA synthetase stalls ovarian development and kills malaria vectors.	Along with rising resistance to antimalarials, the emergence of insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquito species also remains a serious concern. Here, we reveal two potent compounds that show larvicidal and endectocidal activity against malaria vectors, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi, respectively.
40048438	Akt3 links mitochondrial function to the regulation of Aurora B and mitotic fidelity.	Akt3 is a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis in the endothelium. Akt3 depletion results in mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, and decreased angiogenesis. Here we link mitochondrial homeostasis with mitotic fidelity-depletion of Akt3 results in the missegregation of chromosomes as visualized by multinucleation and micronuclei formation. We have connected Akt3 to Aurora B, a significant player in chromosome segregation. Akt3 localizes to the nucleus, where it associates with and regulates WDR12. During mitosis, WDR12 is localized to the dividing chromosomes, and its depletion results in a similar mitotic phenotype to Akt3 depletion. WDR12 associates with Aurora B, both of which are downregulated under conditions of Akt3 depletion. We used the model oxidant paraquat to induce mitochondrial dysfunction to test whether the Akt3-dependent effect on mitochondrial homeostasis is linked to mitotic function. Paraquat treatment also causes chromosome missegregation by inhibiting the expression of Akt3, WDR12, and Aurora B. The inhibition of ROS rescued both the mitotic fidelity and the expression of Akt3 and Aurora B. Akt3 directly phosphorylates the major nuclear export protein CRM-1, causing an increase in its expression, resulting in the inhibition of PGC-1 nuclear localization, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The Akt3/Aurora B pathway is also dependent on CRM-1. CRM-1 overexpression resulted in chromosome missegregation and downregulation of Aurora B similar to that of Akt3 depletion. Akt3 null hearts at midgestation (E14.5), a stage in which proliferation is occurring, have decreased Aurora B expression, increased CRM-1 expression, decreased proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Akt3 null hearts are smaller and have a thinner compact cell layer than age-matched wild-type mice. Akt3 null tissue has dysmorphic nuclear structures, suggesting mitotic catastrophe. Our findings show that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by paraquat or Akt3 depletion results in a CRM-1-dependent disruption of Aurora B and mitotic fidelity.
40047941	Beyond the pink: uncovering the secrets of pink pigmented facultative methylotrophs.	Pink Pigmented Facultative Methylotrophs (PPFMs) belong to a diverse group of methylotrophic bacteria predominantly in the genus Methylobacterium, and are known for their beneficial interactions with plants. They can use single-carbon compounds, such as methanol, formate, formaldehyde and methyl amines as well as various multi-carbon substrates as sources of carbon and energy. PPFMs are characterized by their distinctive pink pigmentation and are commonly found in the phyllosphere, where they play a major role in promoting plant growth through various mechanisms; These mechanisms include the production of phytohormones, enhancing nutrient acquisition, mitigating abiotic stresses and providing biocontrol of phytopathogens. Due to their eco-friendly nature PPFMs are viewed as promising alternatives to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in green agriculture. Furthermore, the ecological significance of PPFMs extends beyond their direct interactions with host plants. They also contribute to the resilience of ecosystems by participating in the cycling of nutrients in the environment. As the importance of the plant microbiome in agriculture becomes more recognized, the potential of PPFMs to support sustainable farming practices and contribute to environmental health is increasingly evident. This underscores their relevance in addressing global agricultural challenges.
40047596	Modeling the Reaction Process for the Synthesis of Ethyl Chrysanthemate from Ethyl Diazoacetate in a Micro-Flow Platform.	Ethyl diazoacetate can react with 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene to yield ethyl chrysanthemumate, an important raw material for synthesizing various pesticides. In conventional conditions, this cyclopropanation process suffers from low efficiency and yield due to ethyl diazoacetate. This demands more understanding of the catalytic process from the mechanism and modeling to find a solution. In this work, we set up a micro-flow platform to carefully study the kinetic characteristics of the cyclopropanation reaction of ethyl diazoacetate catalyzed by a complex of copper stearate and phenylhydrazine. Through a reasonable simplification of the reaction network, we established a reaction kinetic model with good prediction capacity within a wide range of operating conditions. It provides a basis for guiding the development of efficient conversion processes and condition optimization.
40047355	Ultrabithorax regulates Leptinotarsa decemlineata wing development along with insulin and ecdysteroid signaling pathways.	Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Colorado potato beetle, CPB) is a notorious pest of potatoes. Its hardened forewings, known as elytra, protect the hindwings and the abdomen against enemies and chemical pesticides. Ubx plays a crucial role in differentiating insect wings, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Our research showed that Ubx is highly expressed in the T3 thoracic segment (T3) and appendages, while Ubx is absent in the forewings. RNA interference for Ubx resulted in the dorsal plate of the T3 being shifted toward the T2, hindwings were sheathed from the membranous in adults, and forewings were curling. The hindwing development-related genes downstream of Ubx, including LdDpp, LdIro, LdVg, LdWg, and LdASH, were significantly up-regulated in Ubx-inhibited insects compared with the control, by 2.40, 1.88, 1.81, 1.89, and 2.81 times, respectively. After feeding 20-hydrosyecdysone (20E), the forewing was flatter and more stretched than the control, leading to increased wing area, which indicates Ubx regulation is associated with the feedback of ecdysteroids. The expression levels of 3 ecdysteroid receptor genes EcR, EcRA, and EcRB were significantly lower in knocking down LdUbx insects than the control and was able to be recovered by 20E feeding, suggesting that ecdysteroid is associated with LdUbx-regulated wing development. Cosilencing LdUbx and LdAkt genes significantly inhibited the growth of forewings and hindwings, reducing the area of the wings. Together, our findings suggested that LdUbx regulates wing development along with ecdysteroid and insulin-like peptide signaling pathways, which provides a novel molecular mechanism of wing development and differentiation in insects.
40047252	Comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomics and metabolomics reveal the changes induced by nano-selenium and melatonin in Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. Huizao.	Jujube (Zizyphus jujuba), belonging to the Rhamnaceae, contains various bioactive components including flavonoids and polysaccharides. In our previous study, jujube quality was improved by application of nano-selenium (Nano-Se) and melatonin; however, little research has been conducted on the induced molecular mechanisms. Zizyphus jujuba cv. Huizao was used as experimental materials to compare and analyze the transcriptomics and metabolomics mechanisms.
40047200	Computational Molecular Docking Analysis of Linalool Enantiomers Interaction With Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1): Insights Into Potential Binding Mechanisms and Affinity.	Molecular docking analysis of linalool interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) provides valuable insights into the potential binding mechanisms and affinity of this interaction. Linalool, a naturally occurring terpene alcohol, has been the subject of increasing interest due to its diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. MAPK1 is a crucial signaling protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Using MOE software, we conducted a stereoisomer analysis of (R)- and (S)-linalool in our study. After docking, the ligand was ranked according to their binding energy and the best lead compound was selected based on the highest binding energy. The results showed that the S-linalool isomer showed superior anticancer activity, while the R-linalool molecule showed less activity. This interaction could provide insights into linalool's potential therapeutic applications, highlighting its diverse pharmacological properties.
40047173	Household storm damage limits use of and access to insecticide treated bednets in Mozambique.	Cyclone Idai was one of the most destructive cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere. Malaria prevention is not part of cyclone response, but housing damage has been shown to increase malaria risk.
40046651	Sustainable control of the bird cherry-oat aphid (<i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> L.) in northwestern Ontario using <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> delivered by bumblebees.	<i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> is one of the main vectors of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), which affects the grain yield of oats. Several biological control strategies have been studied to control this pest, one of which is Bee Vectoring Technology (BVT) using bumblebees. We tested the efficacy of <i>Beauveria bassiana</i>, as vectored by bumblebees, and a direct spray application of neem (a natural bio-insecticide derived from the <i>Azadirachta indica</i> tree) on aphids. An assessment of the pest's impact on the plots surveyed in northwestern Ontario revealed incidence rates of 80%. The use of bumblebees as a dispersal agent of <i>B. bassiana</i> significantly reduced the aphid population (0.542 ± 0.147b) compared to the untreated control (0.125 ± 0.069a). The application of diluted neem also showed a reduction in the aphid population (0.708 ± 0.221a). Although the products used controlled the pests, they had no effect on the aphid's natural enemy, the ladybug. Therefore, the dissemination of <i>B. bassiana</i> by the bumblebee <i>Bombus impatiens</i> leads to a decrease in the vector <i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> population and consequently reduces the severity of barley yellow dwarf disease in oat fields.
40045945	Understanding interactive effects between habitat configuration and pesticide use for pollination: towards better informed landscape management.	The restoration of natural landscape elements is a frequently adopted pathway to improve wild pollinator abundance, diversity, and their pollination services in intensively used agricultural landscapes. However, pollinators in the intended refuges can become exposed to agrochemicals when foraging in surrounding agricultural fields. In order to effectively design pollinator conservation measures such as habitat restoration or pesticide reduction schemes, the effect of land use configuration on pesticide exposure and pollination service requires further investigation.
40045847	Copper-Mediated Direct Trifluoromethylation of Trichloromethyl Alkanes.	CF<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>2</sub>-containing compounds are of significant synthetic value but are typically synthesized from environmentally harmful hydrochlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Herein, we report the use of a well-defined Cu(I) complex, [(bpy)Cu(CF<sub>3</sub>)], as an efficient trifluoromethylating reagent for the direct trifluoromethylation of trichloroalkanes under mild conditions, affording CF<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>2</sub>-containing products with excellent chemoselectivity. This protocol also enabled the gram-scale synthesis of cyhalothric acid ester, which is a key intermediate in the production of pyrethroid pesticides.
40045824	Nanoparticles alter locust development and behaviour.	Locusts, among the world's most destructive migratory pests, threaten food security by devastating crops and pastures. Conventional chemical insecticides pose environmental and health risks, highlighting the need for sustainable alternatives. We demonstrate the efficacy of nickel ferrite (NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles (36 ± 10 nm), as a safe, cost-effective insecticide for locust management. These NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles disrupt locust development by impairing blastokinesis and growth, thus resulting in malformed nymphs with compacted abdomens and disorganised body structures - primarily arising from significantly lower heart rates (30 bpm for control <i>vs.</i> 20 bpm for embryos exposed to NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and changes to end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions. Adult locusts retained ingested nanoparticles in their coelomic cavities, which could potentially be used as traceable markers for swarm tracking. Additionally, the nanoparticles were recoverable from soil with over 90% efficiency, minimising potential ecological impact. Our research therefore offers an innovative nanotechnology-based solution for sustainable and effective locust management.
40045648	[Determination of cycloxaprid and paichongding residues in foods of plant origin by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].	Neonicotinoid insecticides play an important role in the prevention and control of pests in crops, such as rice, wheat, corn, and vegetables, because of their broad spectrum, high efficiency, low toxicity, and low residue formation. However, their widespread use poses potential threats to the environment and human health. Cycloxaprid and paichongding are two new classes of neonicotinoid insecticides. The National Food Safety Standard Maximum Residue Limits for Pesticides in Foods (GB 2763) specifies the maximum residue limits for paichongding and cycloxaprid in rice, brown rice, wheat, and cabbage. However, the established limits are only temporary. In addition, no detection standards have yet been specified, and no relevant standards have been established in China. Therefore, establishing a method for analyzing cycloxaprid and paichongding residues in food is of particular importance. In this study, an optimized method was established to determine the residues of cycloxaprid and two noncorresponding isomers of paichongding in plant foods using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The chromatographic conditions, matrix extraction methods for dried fruits and tea, and amounts of the purification materials C<sub>18</sub>, PSA, GCB, and anhydrous magnesium sulfate were optimized. The pesticides were extracted using an acetonitrile solution and separated from water with the addition of sodium chloride. The samples were centrifuged at 5000 r/min for 5 min, after which 1.00 mL of the supernatant was purified using 150 mg of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, 25 mg of C<sub>18</sub>, 25 mg of PSA, and 10 mg of GCB. Cycloxaprid and paichongding were separated on a ACQUITY UPLC BEH C<sub>18</sub> chromatographic column (100 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) via gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution containing 5 mmol/L ammonium formate-acetonitrile as the mobile phase, and detected in electrospray positive ionization mode coupled with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Quantitative analysis was performed using an external standard method. Cycloxaprid and paichongding demonstrated good linear relationships within their respective concentration ranges, and the corresponding correlation coefficients were all above 0.99. The limits of detection (<i>S/N</i>=3) and quantification were 0.05 μg/kg and 0.01 mg/kg, respectively, which meet the requirements specified in GB 2763-2021 and GB 2763.1-2022. The established method was used to validate the recoveries of cycloxaprid and paichongding spiked in foods of plant origin, such as paddy, brown rice, wheat, rice, peanut, raisin, cabbage, lettuce, green bean, tomato, potato, shiitake mushroom, apple, citrus, and tea substrates, at three levels. The spiked levels covered the limit levels specified in GB 2763-2021 and GB 2763.1-2022. The mean recoveries of the target substances added to the 15 substrates at concentrations of 1, 2, and 10 times the LOQ or the limit values specified in GB 2763-2021 and GB 2763.1-2022 were distributed between 78% and 110%, and the RSDs were within the range of 0-12.8%. One hundred batches of fruit and vegetable samples were analyzed using the developed method, and the results showed that the selected samples were not contaminated with either cycloxaprid or paichongding. The proposed method is simple, sensitive, and universal, and has wide coverage. Thus, it can be used as a confirmatory and quantitative detection method for epoxidine and piperidine in foods of plant origin.
40045385	Morphofunctional characteristics of flight-related traits in deltamethrin-resistant and susceptible Triatoma infestans (Klug, 1834) of the Argentinean Chaco.	Chagas disease, transmitted by triatomine bugs, is a major vector-borne parasitic disease in Latin America. Triatoma infestans, the principal vector in the Southern Cone, is primarily controlled through residual insecticide spraying. However, resistance to pyrethroids, especially in Northern Argentina and Southern Bolivia, has emerged. Resistant T. infestans populations exhibit reduced fitness, including impacts on reproductive success and dispersal capacity. This study investigates the flight potential and morphological changes in T. infestans populations with varying levels of insecticide resistance, hypothesizing that resistance may induce morphological changes in wing and head structures related to dispersal.
40045377	Prevalence and determinants of insecticide-treated net ownership among women of reproductive age in Nigeria: a mixed-effect insight from the 2021 malaria indicator survey.	Malaria continues to be a significant public health issue in Nigeria, which bears the highest burden of the disease globally. This study examined the prevalence and determinants of insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership among women of reproductive age in Nigeria.
40045023	Genomic and morphological features of an Amazonian Bacillus thuringiensis with mosquito larvicidal activity.	The occurrence of mosquito-borne diseases is increasing, and their geographical range is expanding due to climate change. New control measures are urgently needed to combat these debilitating and, in some cases, fatal diseases. Bacteria of the genus Bacillus are of interest due to the production of bioactive compounds, including those useful for insect control. The discovery and characterization of new species of Bacillus with mosquito larvicidal activity may offer opportunities to develop new products for vector control. In this study, we evaluated larvicidal activity, described morphological characteristics, and sequenced and analyzed the genome of a bacterial strain (GD02.13) isolated from the Amazon region. The metabolites produced by GD02.13 are as effective in killing Aedes aegypti larvae as the commercial product Natular™ DT (Spinosad). Furthermore, the morphological characteristics of the GD02.13 spores and crystal inclusions resemble those previously described for B. thuringiensis. A phylogenetic analysis based on 443 single-copy orthologs indicated that the bacterial strain GD02.13 belongs to the Bacillus thuringiensis species. Its genome, which was assembled and has a size of 6.6 Mb, contains 16 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and genes encoding insecticidal proteins, predicted based on sequence similarity. The data obtained in this study support the development of new insecticide products based on the strain GD02.13 of B. thuringiensis.
40044941	Structural basis for the activation of plant bunyavirus replication machinery and its dual-targeted inhibition by ribavirin.	Despite the discovery of plant viruses as a new class of pathogens over a century ago, the structure of plant virus replication machinery and antiviral pesticide remains lacking. Here we report five cryogenic electron microscopy structures of a ~330-kDa RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from a devastating plant bunyavirus, tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV), including the apo, viral-RNA-bound, base analogue ribavirin-bound and ribavirin-triphosphate-bound states. They reveal that a flexible loop of RdRp's motif F functions as 'sensor' to perceive viral RNA and further acts as an 'adaptor' to promote the formation of a complete catalytic centre. A ten-base RNA 'hook' structure is sufficient to trigger major conformational changes and activate RdRp. Chemical screening showed that ribavirin is effective against TSWV, and structural data revealed that ribavirin disrupts both hook-binding and catalytic core formation, locking polymerase in its inactive state. This work provides structural insights into the mechanisms of plant bunyavirus RdRp activation and its dual-targeted site inhibition, facilitating the development of pesticides against plant viruses.
40044912	Valorization of Agricultural Residues to Valuable Products: A Circular Bioeconomy Approach.	Intensive agricultural production generates a lot of residues yearly, exhausting and depleting the soils and accumulating pesticides and mineral fertilizers. Although introducing the no-till technologies is related to the reduction of tillage, leaving most of the plant residues on the field and decreasing fertigation, the global crop residues are estimated to be 2800 million tons per year. They could be successfully utilized via several approaches integrated into the circular bioeconomy concept. Thus, stopping the existing vicious circle of digging most of the primary materials such as fossil fuels, the vast application of chemical fertilizers, gaining increased or restored biodiversity, capturing CO<sub>2</sub> into the soils and enhancing the organic content, having cleaner underground waters, soils and crop production, and finally improved quality of life. The transformation of these residues into value-added products faces various technological and commercialization difficulties that limit their fuller utilization. In the present chapter, we aim to describe the production of agricultural residues in the EU and present their properties and technologies for biological valorization. In addition, the potential risks associated with the micro- and nano-plastics content of agricultural residues are discussed.
40044609	Disease epidemics and species interactions: A manipulation of seasonal establishment of fungal diseases in an old field.	Many disease epidemics recur seasonally, and such seasonal epidemics can be shaped by species interactions among parasites, pathogens, or other microbes. Field experiments are a classic approach for understanding species interactions but are rarely used to study seasonal epidemics. Our research objective was to help fill this gap by manipulating the seasonal timing of the establishment of infectious diseases while tracking epidemics and other ecological responses. To do this, we conducted a multiyear field experiment in an old field in the Piedmont of North Carolina, USA, dominated by the grass species tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb). Darbysh). In the field, tall fescue experienced seasonal epidemics of multiple foliar fungal diseases: anthracnose in spring, brown patch in mid-summer, and crown rust in late summer to fall. In a fully randomized design, we applied four fungicide treatments to replicate plots of intact vegetation in specific seasons to manipulate the timing of disease epidemics. One treatment was designed to delay the establishment of anthracnose until mid-summer, and another to delay the establishment of both anthracnose and brown patch until fall. In a third treatment, fungicide was applied year-round, and, in a fourth treatment, fungicide was never applied. The experiment comprised 64 plots, each 2 m × 2 m, surveyed from May 2017 to February 2020. Here, we report a dataset documenting responses in the community structure of both plants and foliar fungi. To track disease prevalence in the host population across seasons and years, this dataset includes monthly leaf-level observations of the disease status of over 100,000 leaves. To quantify transmission and investigate within-host pathogen interactions, we longitudinally surveyed disease status in host individuals of known age at least weekly over two growing seasons. Finally, the dataset includes annual data on infection prevalence of the systemic fungal endophyte Epichloë coenophiala, community-level aboveground plant biomass, and plant community cover. These data can be used for meta-analyses, comparisons, and syntheses across systems as ecologists seek to predict and mechanistically understand seasonal disease epidemics. There are no copyrights on the dataset, and we request that users of this dataset cite this paper in all publications resulting from its use.
40044425	Toxic effects of eight azole fungicides on the growth, photosynthetic activity, and oxidative stress of Raphidocelis subcapitata.	This study investigates the 96 hr toxicity and physiological effects of eight azole fungicides on Raphidocelis subcapitata (R. subcapitata). The findings revealed significant differences in toxicity levels among these fungicides, with the hierarchy of toxicity as follows: difenoconazole ≈ tetraconazole ≈ fuberidazole > metconazole > terrazole ≈ triflumizole > flutriafol > hymexazol. Increased concentrations of azole fungicides corresponded with decreased cellular activity and inhibited algal growth, highlighting the concentration-dependent nature of toxicity. The toxicological mechanisms involved include reduced levels of chlorophyll (Chla, Chlb) and carotenoids, disrupting the photosynthetic process. Additionally, exposure to these fungicides resulted in decreased total protein levels, increased reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and elevated activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. Consequently, there was a significant rise in apoptosis rates among algal cells. These findings provide important insights for assessing the ecological impact of azole fungicides on aquatic ecosystems and aquatic life.

40044155	[Production and biological activity of the triazine derivatives: focusing on antibiotics produced by bacteria].	Heterocyclic triazines and their derivatives have excellent biological activity and have been used as herbicides and anticancer drugs. A large number of derivatives were synthesized and their biological activity was investigated. Some bacteria synthesize the triazine derivatives such as Nostocine A, Toxoflavin, and Fluviol from GTP using enzymes similar to those in the synthesis pathway of Riboflavin (vitamin B2). These triazine derivatives show antibiotic activity. In particular, research on Toxoflavin has progressed as a toxin produced by bacteria that cause seedling rot and rice grain blight in rice. It has recently been revealed that Fluviol, which is produced by bacteria, acts to suppress the growth of pathogenic bacteria. This review will focus on triazine derivatives produced by bacteria.
40043969	Ureases in nature: Multifaceted roles and implications for plant and human health - A review.	Urease, a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia, plays a pivotal role in nitrogen metabolism across diverse organisms. While essential for survival, its unregulated activity is implicated in numerous pathologies, including peptic ulcers, nephropathy, and gastric cancer, as well as agricultural challenges such as soil ammonium depletion and reduced nitrogen-use efficiency. Beyond its canonical enzymatic function, urease engages in protein-protein interactions with bioactive counterparts like jaburetox, canatoxin, and soyuretox plant-derived proteins with insecticidal, antifungal, and membranolytic properties. Exploring the relationship between ureases and these proteins, along with their mechanistic synergies, presents novel opportunities to develop targeted inhibitors for urease-related diseases while unlocking broader therapeutic and biotechnological applications. This review delves into the dual roles of ureases in plants and humans, bridging the gap between their ureolytic and non-ureolytic activities. We highlight recent advances in the design of urease inhibitors, which have emerged as critical tools for managing pathologies such as Helicobacter pylori-induced ulcers and urease-mediated kidney stone formation. These inhibitors also hold transformative potential in agriculture, where they mitigate nitrogen loss by stabilizing urea fertilizers, thereby enhancing crop yields and reducing environmental pollution. Furthermore, their utility extends to industrial biotechnology, including biofilm disruption and wastewater treatment, where urease inhibition prevents microbially induced corrosion and ammonia toxicity. The collected information is anticipated to offer insightful guidance and effective strategies for developing novel potent and safe urease inhibitors in the future.
40043660	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochloride pesticides (OCPs) in sediment from the Beibu Gulf, China: Occurrence, spatial-temporal distribution, source, historical variation and ecological risks.	This study comprehensively analyzed 11 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 16 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in 87 surface sediment samples collected across two seasons and in a sediment core from the Beibu Gulf, China. Overall, only a limited number and low concentrations of PCBs and OCPs were detected. In surface sediments, ΣPCBs concentrations were higher in summer (mean: 0.27 ± 0.37 ng/g dw) compared to winter (mean: 0.07 ± 0.06 ng/g dw), while ΣOCPs showed no significant seasonal variation (summer, mean: 0.19 ± 0.19 ng/g dw; winter, mean: 0.17 ± 0.07 ng/g dw). 4,4'-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB 28), 2,3,5,6-Tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 65) and p,p'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were the most predominant contaminants, with average concentrations accounting for >90 % of the ΣPCBs and ΣOCPs, respectively. Spatial distribution revealed higher ΣPCBs concentrations in the southern Beibu Gulf compared to other areas. Industrial productions, shipping activities, as well as ocean current transport appear to be key sources of PCBs in studied region, while the aerobic degradation of residual DDT likely explains the widespread presence of DDE. In sediment core, both ΣPCBs and ΣOCPs exhibited parabolic variation trends along the sediment core depth, reflecting historical use in the Beibu Gulf, with recent declines in new inputs. Risk assessments indicated that PCBs and OCPs in Beibu Gulf sediments pose minimal ecological risks. These findings offer valuable scientific insights to support future research on typical organic pollutants in the Beibu Gulf.
40043501	Paternal fenvalerate exposure causes depressive-like behaviour by altering Grb10 gene DNA methylation in adolescent offspring.	Fenvalerate, a typical pyrethroid pesticide, is a neurological toxicant. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of paternal exposure to fenvalerate on depressive-like behaviours in adolescent offspring. Depression-like behavior was determined by Sucrose Preference Test (SPT), Tail Suspension Test (TST) and Forced Swimming Test (FST) in adolescent offspring. The level of dopamine was reduced in the midbrain of fenvalerate-exposed adolescent offspring. Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), a rate limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, was significantly reduced in the midbrain of adolescent offspring exposed to fenvalerate. And Th was decreased in the midbrain and hindbrain of fetuses exposed to fenvalerate. Transcriptome analysis revealed growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10) was decreased in the fetal hindbrain exposed to fenvalerate. Grb10 mRNA and protein were reduced in the fetal hindbrain exposed to fenvalerate. Interestingly, in vitro experiments, Th was reduced by si-Grb10. Conversely, Th was increased by oe-Grb10. Mechanistically, the 5mC content of Grb10 gene at one CpG fragment was reduced in the fetal hindbrain exposed to fenvalerate. And the 5mC content of Grb10 gene at eighteen CpG sites was decreased in paternal sperm exposed to fenvalerate. In summary, paternal fenvalerate exposure causes depressive-like behavior by altering DNA methylation of Grb10 gene in the sperm.
40043018	Unprecedented Alkylation of the Catalytic Histidine in the Aging of Cholinesterases after Inhibition by Organophosphorus Pesticides.	Organophosphorus (OP) compounds pose a serious risk to human health by covalently modifying acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Currently approved oxime therapeutics can reactivate OP-inhibited AChE and BChE, despite significant limitations. The OP-inhibited enzymes undergo a secondary <i>O</i>-dealkylation event, known as aging, for which no currently approved therapeutics are effective as treatments. Many decades of research have studied the aging mechanism in AChE and BChE. It has previously been accepted that aging occurs via a spontaneous <i>O</i>-dealkylation event, by loss of a carbocation or by water hydrolysis of the OP-adducted serine residue. Here, we present a novel mechanism of aging in which the catalytic histidine acts as a nucleophile to induce aging and, as a result, becomes alkylated after exposure to methyl paraoxon (MP) and other pesticides. Using bottom-up proteomics, we identify that upon aging of MP-inhibited AChE and BChE, a methyl transfer occurs from the phosphylated serine residue to the catalytic histidine residue. The extent of histidine methylation is pH-dependent as less methylation is observed at lower pH, while increased methylation is observed at higher pH. At near physiological pH (7.5), the ratio of <i>N</i>-MeHis/His is 3:1 for AChE and 1.3:1 for BChE after 24 h. When other OP compounds were also tested for histidine modification, ethyl paraoxon was shown to result in ethylation of the catalytic histidine; however, when the alkoxy group was branched in the case of an isopropoxy group present in diisopropyl fluorophosphate, no alkylation of histidine was observed. Recent advances in the development of quinone methide precursors show promise in the recovery of OP-aged AChE. In this work, we discuss the importance of this novel aging mechanism and its impact on the recoverability of OP-aged AChE or BChE as it appears that the histidine modification limits the overall recovery of active AChE.
40042976	Fast Screening Libraries of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPRs) for Insecticidal Activity.	Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) are ubiquitous among soil bacteria and aid in many growth-related functions for plants.

40042937	Discovery of <i>N</i>-Phenylphthalimides Containing Ether Moiety as Potential Protoporphyrinogen IX Oxidase Inhibitors.	The discovery of novel protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) inhibitors has become a key focus in herbicide development. To explore new PPO inhibitors, a series of <i>N</i>-phenylphthalimide derivatives with ether moieties were designed and successfully synthesized. Among these, compound <b>B18</b> (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 10.3 nM) exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on <i>Nt</i>PPO, outperforming flumiclorac-pentyl (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 46.3 nM) and flumioxazin (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 52.0 nM). It is noted that compounds <b>A3</b>, <b>B18</b>, <b>B19</b>, and <b>B20</b> showed broad-spectrum herbicidal activity against the tested weeds at 75 g a.i./ha. In addition, results of molecular simulation and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that compound <b>B18</b> possessed not only a robust hydrogen bond with Arg98 of <i>Nt</i>PPO but also superior chemical reactivity, electrostatic field, and strong polarity. Therefore, compound <b>B18</b> may be regarded as a promising lead compound for the development of high-efficiency PPO inhibitors.
40042570	Expanding the functional landscape of microbial entomopathogens in agriculture beyond pest management.	Microbial entomopathogens that include fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes have long been valued for their role in biological control of insect pests. However, recent research highlights their expanded applications beyond pest management. Entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium spp. are increasingly recognized for their potential as biocontrol agents in integrated pest management systems. These fungi exhibit not only direct insecticidal effects but also secondary metabolites that contribute to plant disease suppression, thereby enhancing crop health and yield. Bacterial entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis, as the most widely used biopesticide, has also demonstrated potency not only against insects but also as systemic resistance inducer, thereby boosting plant immunity against pathogens. Moreover, entomopathogens are emerging as growth promoters and biostimulants, enhancing crop vigor through nutrient uptake and root development. This review consolidates current knowledge on the mechanisms of action of microbial entomopathogens against pests as well as current understanding on its other plant-beneficial traits. It also discusses their environmental impact and potential integration into sustainable agricultural practices. This comprehensive exploration underscores the transformative potential of microbial entomopathogens in shaping future strategies for holistic crop health management including pest management in agriculture.

The key enzymatic features of these materials include activities similar to oxidase, peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. In this review, initially, several common synthesis methods of MXenes are presented, emphasizing their significant role as nanozymes in constructing efficient sensors. Subsequently, several common applications of MXene nanozymes in food safety analysis are delved into, including the detection of bacteria, mycotoxins, antibiotic residues, and pesticide residues, along with their applications in different electrochemical and optical biosensors. In addition, the gap, limitation, and future perspective of these novel nanozymes in food safety are highlighted.
40042057	Insight into the Underlying Molecular Toxic Mechanisms of Cyantraniliprole and Broflanilide against Different Targets with Glutathione Transferase Phi8 from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.	As two typical kinds of diamide insecticides, cyantraniliprole and broflanilide are characterized by diverse target receptors and completely distinctive regulation mechanisms. However, the systematical evaluation of oxidative damage on plants induced by cyantraniliprole and broflanilide still remains elusive. In this study, the toxic effects were investigated in the biochemical and physiological aspects using <i>At</i>GSTF8 as a biomarker. First, cyantraniliprole not only brought about much more detrimental impacts on the growth status of plant seedlings but also resulted in a significant upregulation of <i>At</i>GSTF8 gene expression compared to broflanilide. Then, the glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase activities of <i>At</i>GSTF8 decreased greatly with treatment of these two diamide insecticides. Moreover, biolayer interferometry analysis confirmed the interactions of both cyantraniliprole and broflanilide with <i>At</i>GSTF8, especially for cyantraniliprole with stronger binding affinity, which conformed to the molecular docking results. At last, even more adverse effects on the structural conformations of <i>At</i>GSTF8 upon binding with cyantraniliprole were observed.
40041960	Co-exposure to a honeybee pathogen and an insecticide: synergistic effects in a new solitary bee host but not in <i>Apis mellifera</i>.	Pesticides and pathogens are major drivers of bee declines. However, their potential interactions are poorly understood, especially for non-<i>Apis</i> bees. This study assessed the combined effects of infestation by the honeybee pathogen <i>Vairimorpha ceranae</i> and chronic exposure to the insecticide flupyradifurone on <i>Osmia bicornis</i> and <i>Apis mellifera</i>. We investigated whether <i>V. ceranae</i> could reproduce in a new solitary bee host (<i>O. bicornis</i>) and assessed sublethal and lethal effects of the pathogen and the pesticide, alone and in combination. We also analysed the interactive effects of the combined exposure on <i>V. ceranae</i> proliferation and bee survival in the two bee species. Newly emerged bees were orally infected with 100 000 spores of <i>V. ceranae</i> and then exposed ad libitum to flupyradifurone at field-realistic concentrations. We showed, for the first time to our knowledge, that <i>V. ceranae</i> can replicate in the midgut of <i>O. bicornis</i>, causing histological damage, impaired phototactic response, reduced food consumption and decreased longevity. The pathogen-pesticide combination caused a synergistic effect in <i>O. bicornis,</i> leading to an abrupt survival decline. In <i>A. mellifera</i>, <i>V. ceranae</i> and flupyradifurone showed antagonistic survival effects, but the pesticide promoted pathogen proliferation. Our results warn against the potential effects of pathogen spillover and multiple stressor exposure on non-<i>Apis</i> bees.
40041041	Design and validation of a low-cost sugar-feeder for resource-poor insectaries.	The emergence of insecticide resistance in insects has led researchers to develop new control tools so that historic gains made in reducing disease transmission are not lost. Attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) are a vector control tool being widely trialled to target insects that feed on plant sugars and blood. We designed a field-friendly, economical and more environmentally responsible sugar feeder for maintaining mosquito colonies and screening potential ATSB candidates.
40040532	Multiple Stressors Simplify Freshwater Food Webs.	Globally, freshwater ecosystems are threatened by multiple stressors, yet our knowledge of how they interact to affect food web structure remains scant. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a large-scale mesocosm experiment to quantify the single and combined effects of three common anthropogenic stressors: warming, increased nutrient loading, and insecticide pollution, on the network structure of shallow lake food webs. We identified both antagonistic and synergistic interactive effects depending on whether the stressors affected negative or positive feedback loops, respectively. Overall, multiple stressors simplified the food web, elongated energy transfer pathways, and shifted biomass distribution from benthic to more pelagic pathways. This increased the risk of a regime shift from a clear-water state dominated by submerged macrophytes to a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton. Our novel results highlight how multiple anthropogenic stressors can interactively disrupt food webs, with implications for understanding and managing aquatic ecosystems in a changing world.
40040492	Discovery of <i>N</i>-((2-Arylthiazol-4-yl)methyl)oxazole-5-carboxamide Derivatives as SDHi for Fungicidal Candidates.	A series of oxazole-5-carboxamide derivatives were designed as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitors and synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for their fungicidal activities. Among these compounds, <b>SEZA18</b> and <b>SEZC7</b> displayed 0.17 and 0.50 mg/L EC<sub>50</sub> values against <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i> in vitro, respectively, whose anti-<i>M. grisea</i> activities were closed to prochloraz (0.15 mg/L) and surpassed hymexazol (45.5 mg/L). Moreover, <b>SEZA18</b> and <b>SEZC7</b> exhibited 45.3 and 49.5% protective effects against <i>M. grisea</i> at the dose of 200 mg/L <i>in vivo,</i> whose preventive effects were about double times less than that of azoxystrobin (93%). In addition, <b>SEZA14</b> possessed an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.33 mg/L against <i>Penicillium digitatum</i> in vitro and showed 77.9% prevention effects from <i>P. digitatum</i> at the dose of 100 mg/L in a potted experiment, whose fungicidal activity was comparable to that of boscalid (75.5%). <b>SEZC7</b> demonstrated SDH inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 16.6 μM), exhibiting activity levels similar to those of boscalid (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.9 μM). Molecular docking results further revealed that <b>SEZA14</b>, <b>SEZA18</b>, <b>SEZC7</b>, and boscalid possessed a mode of action similar to that of SDH. Transcriptome analysis suggested that <b>C7</b> interfered with the energy metabolism by inhibiting SDH activity, thereby affecting cellular sugar metabolism processes of <i>M. grisea</i>. In summary, our finding gave SDH inhibitors featuring novel structures, which provided a potential candidate for the management of plant pathogenic fungi.
40040370	Optimal use of insecticide against the small brown planthopper, <i>Laodelphax striatellus</i>, effectively reduces the damage caused by Rice stripe virus.	Rice stripe virus disease is one of the most devastating diseases of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in East Asia. The causal virus, Rice stripe virus (RSV), is persistently transmitted by the small brown planthopper (<i>Laodelphax striatellus</i>, SBPH). Since there is no effective treatment once rice plants are infected with RSV, it is crucial to prevent RSV infection in rice to minimize the damage. This study evaluated the effect of SBPH control with insecticides applied to the nursery box at transplanting and/or sprayed in the field on RSV infection and yield loss. We found that insecticide application either to nursery boxes or in the field reduced the percentage of diseased plants, the magnitude of damage in diseased plants, and yield loss. The combination of nursery box and field insecticide applications was the most effective at controlling the disease as it provided seamless control of SBPH from transplanting to the initial panicle formation stage. The study results offer a detailed description of the process by which chemical control of SBPH reduces damage caused by RSV. We expect these findings to be useful in developing an integrated pest management system for RSV.
40040185	Integrating Microfluidics and Deep Learning to Investigate Entomopathogenic Nematode Responses to Host Cues.	Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are effective biocontrol agents, reducing pesticide impact on health and the environment. Understanding their physiology and ethology is crucial for optimizing their application. This study offers innovative insights about Steinernema carpocapsae EPN behavior, contributing to the interdisciplinary field of engineering, biology, and entomology. The proposed hybrid approach combines microfluidics, deep learning, and optical flow. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model discerned EPNs in the presence of stimuli within a specially designed microfluidic arena, highlighting motor behavior differences. At the video level, the CNN model accurately discriminated a context characterized by host-borne cues, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.938, precision of 1, and f1-score of 0.933. Integrating optical flow analysis unveiled a significant difference in motor activity, adding novel information on their dynamic responses. EPNs showed an increased activity in stimulus presence. This comprehensive approach advances our capability to detect and comprehend the responses of EPN to host stimuli for more precise and targeted biocontrol strategies.
40039709	Optimizing Warfarin Dosing Using Contextual Bandit: An Offline Policy Learning and Evaluation Method.	Warfarin, an anticoagulant medication, is formulated to prevent and address conditions associated with abnormal blood clotting, making it one of the most prescribed drugs globally. However, determining the suitable dosage remains challenging due to individual response variations, and prescribing an incorrect dosage may lead to severe consequences. Contextual bandit and reinforcement learning have shown promise in addressing this issue. Given the wide availability of observational data and safety concerns of decision-making in healthcare, we focused on using exclusively observational data from historical policies as demonstrations to derive new policies; we utilized offline policy learning and evaluation in a contextual bandit setting to establish the optimal personalized dosage strategy. Our learned policies surpassed these baseline approaches without genotype inputs, even when given a suboptimal demonstration, showcasing promising application potential.
40038831	Computational histology reveals that concomitant application of insect repellent with sunscreen impairs UV protection in an ex vivo human skin model.	Histological alterations such as nuclear abnormalities are sensitive biomarkers associated with diseases, tissue injury and environmental insults. While visual inspection and human interpretation of histology images are useful for initial characterization, such low-throughput procedures suffer from inherent limitations in terms of reliability, objectivity and reproducibility. Artificial intelligence and digital morphometry offer unprecedented opportunities to quickly and accurately assess nuclear morphotypes in relation to tissue damage including skin injury.

40037896	Haloalkane dehalogenases other than LinB can contribute to the γ-hexachlorocyclohexane utilization.	Haloalkane dehalogenases (HLDs) convert halogenated compounds to corresponding alcohols by a simple hydrolytic mechanism. Although many bacterial strains possess HLDs or HLD homologues, LinB is the only HLD known to be involved in the utilization of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH), a man-made chlorinated pesticide. In this study, to gain insight into the functional evolution of HLDs toward the γ-HCH utilization, the linB gene in γ-HCH-degrading Sphingobium japonicum strain UT26 was replaced by 7 other HLD or HLD homologous genes, including 3 putative ancestral enzymes. Interestingly, strains carrying genes for DmmA from marine metagenome or Rluc_anc, an ancestor of Renilla-luciferin 2-monooxygenase (Rluc) and LinB, produced 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone from γ-HCH, which are indicators of LinB activity, and grew in minimal medium supplied with γ-HCH as a sole carbon source. These results indicated that other HLDs in addition to LinB can play roles in the γ-HCH utilization.
40037601	Cultivating resilience: assessing commercial strawberry cultivars for chilli thrips management in Florida strawberries.	Strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne (Rosales: Rosaceae), is an important specialty crop in Florida, generating about $500 million in annual revenue. An invasive insect, chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), has emerged as a major strawberry pest, causing considerable yield and revenue loss in recent years. Pesticide application is the leading control option but is not always recommended due to resistance development. Host plant resistance (HPR) can be a novel option to manage S. dorsalis sustainably. Four commercial cultivars, 'Florida Brilliance', 'Florida Medallion FL16.30-128', 'Sweet Sensation 'Florida127', and 'Florida Pearl FL16.78-109', were evaluated for their performance in the 2021-2022 field season under the natural population of S. dorsalis. In 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, 3 more cultivars, 'Strawberry Festival', 'Florida Radiance', and 'Florida Beauty', were added to this list. Twenty bare-root strawberry transplants were planted in each field plot, and each cultivar was replicated 8 times in a randomized complete block design. Damage on trifoliate, number of adults and larval S. dorsalis on trifoliate, number of flowers, and marketable fruit yield were assessed for each cultivar. Results revealed that 'Florida Pearl 109' had the highest insect count and damage index of all 3 year. 'Strawberry Festival' also showed the same trend after its introduction in the second year. 'Florida Brilliance' and 'Sweet Sensation' had the lowest damage index, lowest adult insect count, and higher marketable yield compared to 'Florida Pearl 109' and 'Strawberry Festival'. Therefore, utilizing resistant cultivars can be an effective tool for managing S. dorsalis in the field.
40037586	Effects of realistic pesticide mixtures on the springtail Folsomia candida.	The application of multiple pesticides over the last decades has resulted in their frequent and in some cases long-term presence in soils as complex mixtures. This work assessed the toxicity of realistic pesticide mixtures observed in 11 case study sites to the springtail Folsomia candida. Each mixture was composed of 5 pesticides (as active substances or metabolites), chosen based on their occurrence in soil and expected risk to soil invertebrates. Reproduction tests were conducted in natural agricultural soil, and the springtails were exposed to 3 concentrations of the selected pesticides: the median environmental concentration (MEC), the predicted environmental concentration (PEC), and 5 times PEC (5PEC). No significant effect was observed at MEC exposure in any case study sites, however, effects on reproduction, adult survival, and adult size were observed at PEC and 5PEC exposures on 5 case study sites. Risk quotients (RQ) of individual pesticides were calculated by dividing the exposure concentrations (MEC, PEC, and 5PEC) by the NOEC values from the literature, and the sum of the 5 pesticides was calculated as ∑RQ in each case study site. The toxicity at PEC exposure was higher than expected based on the ∑RQ in two case study sites, indicating a possible synergistic mixture effect. This work provides new information on the effects of realistic pesticide mixtures. Further research is required to clarify whether the current risk assessment of individual pesticides adequately protects soil species from exposure to multiple pesticide residues that may occur in even more complex mixtures.
40037548	Embryonic exposure to valproic acid and neonicotinoid deteriorates the hyperpolarizing GABA shift and impairs long-term potentiation of excitatory transmission in the local circuit of intermediate medial mesopallium of chick telencephalon.	Embryonic exposure to valproic acid and imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) impairs filial imprinting in hatchlings, and the deteriorating effects of valproic acid are mitigated by post-hatch injection of bumetanide, a blocker of the chloride intruder Na-K-2Cl cotransporter 1. Here, we report that these exposures depolarized the reversal potential of local GABAergic transmission in the neurons of the intermediate medial mesopallium, the pallial region critical for imprinting. Furthermore, exposure increased field excitatory post-synaptic potentials in pre-tetanus recordings and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) by low-frequency tetanic stimulation. Bath-applied bumetanide rescued the impaired LTP in the valproic acid slices, whereas VU0463271, a blocker of the chloride extruder KCC2, suppressed LTP in the control slices, suggesting that hyperpolarizing GABA action is necessary for the potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission. Whereas a steep increase in the gene expression of KCC2 appeared compared to NKCC1 during the peri-hatch development, significant differences were not found between valproic acid and control post-hatch chicks in these genes. Instead, both valproic acid and imidacloprid downregulated several transcriptional regulators (FOS, NR4A1, and NR4A2) and upregulated the RNA component of signal recognition particles (RN7SL1). Despite different chemical actions, valproic acid and imidacloprid could cause common neuronal effects that lead to impaired imprinting.
40037191	Few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> co-assembly with GO to optimize defect channels and stability of GO membranes for high-performance organic-inorganic separation.	The selective separation of organic compounds and inorganic salts is essential for wastewater recycling in fine chemical industries such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Membrane separation technology offers a promising solution. However, conventional organic membranes often face challenges related to precise separation and solvent resistance. While graphene oxide (GO) membranes exhibit excellent solvent resistance, their separation performance and structural stability require further improvement. In this study, we developed a GO/few-layer molybdenum disulfide (FLMoS<sub>2</sub>) membrane via co-assembly. The optimized GO/FLMoS<sub>2</sub> membrane demonstrated a water permeability of 28.4 LMH/bar, approximately four times higher than conventional GO membranes, and achieved a separation factor exceeding 900 for organic/inorganic mixtures-among the highest reported for two-dimensional (2D) membranes. Comprehensive characterization, including low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), revealed that this superior performance was attributed to controlled defect channels, enhanced interlayer cross-linking, and the intrinsic rigidity of FLMoS<sub>2</sub>, which provided high structural stability and minimal swelling. Moreover, mechanical strength assessments, including critical destructive load force and nanoindentation tests, confirmed significant improvement in structural robustness. As a result, the GO/FLMoS<sub>2</sub> membrane maintained stable water permeability and separation efficiency over 100 hours of continuous operation and six chemical cleaning cycles, demonstrating its potential for sustainable wastewater treatment and resource recovery.
40037080	Exposure to thiazole pesticides disrupts pathogens and undermines keystone status of rare taxa within bacterial ecological networks.	Considering the sensitivity of rare microbial taxa to environmental disturbances and their critical roles in ecosystems, it is essential to investigate how soil microbial communities (particularly rare microbes) respond to pesticide exposure. In this study, we found that thiazole pesticides significantly reduced the severity of potato common scab and effectively disrupted the pathogen's cell membrane integrity. Notably, hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that the rare microbial taxa in potato geocaulosphere soil constitute key clusters influencing disease incidence. Within bacterial molecular ecological networks, nodes corresponding to these rare taxa generally exhibited higher degrees compared to those of more abundant taxa. However, pesticide exposure reduced the number of keystone nodes and substantially weakened the hub status of rare bacterial taxa in these networks. These findings suggest that, although thiazole pesticides effectively eradicate pathogens, they may also pose a non-negligible potential risk to rare taxa in agricultural ecosystems.
40037043	Processing factors of pesticide residues in durum wheat milling fractions and pasta.	A total of 242 processing factors (Pf) were determined for 34 pesticides studied in milling products (flour, semolina, bran, middlings, fine bran), in refined and wholemeal pasta. The durum wheat cv Platone was grown in the field and was treated with formulations containing acetamiprid, λ-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, benzovindiflupyr, and prothioconazole, at dosages 5 times higher than the label. Part of the untreated wheat was fortified in the laboratory with a mixture of 31 pesticides (organophosphates, organochlorines, pyrethroids, and others) at spiking levels of 1.8-3.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Pilot plants were used to simulate industrial milling and pasta-making processes. Pesticide residues, determined using the QuEChERS method with LC/GC-MS/MS techniques, resulted low in flour, semolina, and pasta (Pf < 1) but high in bran and middlings (Pf = 1.9-6.8). Careful selection of the wheat quality for bran and wholemeal foods is necessary to protect human and animal health.
40037024	Pesticide fate under varying cropping systems and soil depths: A study using leaching experiments and inverse modelling.	Current pesticide leaching risk assessments overlook critical site-specific factors such as soil depth and agricultural practices. Relying on transport parameters from databases or manufacturer studies, often based on limited soil types, can lead to inaccurate contamination risk estimates and ineffective protection of groundwater resources. In this study, the fate of eight pesticides of concern for groundwater was investigated under three cropping systems and three soil depths. Leaching experiments were carried out in undisturbed columns from a loamy agricultural soil and mass balances were realized. Inverse dual-porosity modelling using Hydrus 1-D was then performed to adjust mobility parameters. The results reveal that different soil properties and structure between soil depths have a more substantial impact on pesticide leaching behaviour than the cropping systems. Significant differences in pesticide transport and retention are observed between soil horizons, illustrating the inadequacy of using surface parameters for the entire soil profile, which can lead to underestimation of groundwater contamination. Our analysis indicates that root architecture, soil properties and surface tillage can affect pesticide leaching dynamics. While short-term differences between cropping systems were limited, these factors could be important for long-term effects. The experimental transport parameters showed discrepancies with established databases, where higher adsorption and degradation could underestimate pesticide leaching and metabolites production. This study highlights the need to adapt transport parameter values for all pesticides of concern to site-specific conditions. In addition, accurate risk assessment requires advanced modelling techniques that take into account soil depth variability and local conditions to improve water protection decision-making. Future research should focus on long-term monitoring of the effects of sustainable agricultural practices on pesticide behaviour over several seasons and for a range of soil types. Special emphasis should be placed on the role of metabolites in environmental contamination.
40036967	Investigation of Nanoflow Liquid Chromatography High-Resolution MS (nanoLC-HRMS) for the Analysis of Veterinary Drug Residues in Fish and Shrimp.	A wide-scope screening method for veterinary drugs and other contaminants in aquaculture products using LC high resolution MS (HRMS) was developed previously. Using nanoflow LC could significantly increase the sensitivity of this method.
40036830	Potential of repurposed agricultural ingredients in propylene glycol emulsions as oral toxicants for control of adult mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae).	Mosquito control operations have limited options available for adult mosquito reduction. Untapped alternatives exist in adjacent pest-management industries, but translation and validation for various technologies is still ongoing. The attractive targeted sugar bait (ATSB) strategy is a formulation platform that is amenable to toxicants not otherwise widely used for adult mosquito control techniques and equipment. To find fast-acting, effective toxicants for ATSB, choice assays were conducted using fipronil, spinosyn, dinotefuran, clothianidin, imidacloprid, bifenazate, indoxacarb, abamectin, and λ-cyhalothrin against Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culcidae) as a model system. Active ingredients were emulsified in propylene glycol, a secondary toxicant and formulation aid in ATSB, and sucrose solution. Treatments were presented in tandem with unadulterated 10% sucrose in all assays. In both 24-h mortality and fecal droplet analysis, indoxacarb was ingested similarly as often as the sugar water-only control group and yielded the overall lowest mortality. Imidacloprid, λ-cyhalothrin, and abamectin were all readily ingested, and in some cases the fecal droplet analysis indicated bias towards consumption of the treated sugar solutions. Mortality in the first 24 h was over 95% for the aforementioned toxicants, supporting that they both kill in limited time and have a suitable palatability or repellency response profile with mosquitoes. But imidacloprid and λ-cyhalothrin (resistance) and imidacloprid (pollinators) have roadblocks for use in ATSB because of potential nontarget impact to pollinators and prevalent insecticide resistance issues. However, abamectin appears to be a promising ingredient for future ATSB formulations to establish quick vector interruption and improve insecticide class variety for resistance management.
40036643	Molecular Mechanism of λ-Cyhalothrin Detoxification by a Delta-Class Glutathione S-Transferase (PxGSTD3) from <i>Plutella xylostella</i>.	The diamondback moth (<i>Plutella xylostella</i>) exhibits significant resistance to commonly used insecticides including λ-cyhalothrin. Delta-class glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are crucial detoxification enzymes involved in insecticide detoxification and resistance. We demonstrate that <i>PxGSTD3</i> is associated with the resistance to λ-cyhalothrin and contributes to λ-cyhalothrin detoxification. The transcription of <i>PxGSTD3</i> was rapidly upregulated in response to λ-cyhalothrin exposure, and the recombinant protein exhibited significant metabolic activity against λ-cyhalothrin. Further investigation using computer-aided drug design revealed the binding and metabolic mechanism of PxGSTD3 toward λ-cyhalothrin. The results showed that λ-cyhalothrin binds to an active pocket through noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. Residues Arg36, Tyr115, and Phe119 were found to have a critical impact on the binding and metabolism of λ-cyhalothrin by PxGSTD3. These findings provide valuable insights into the metabolic role of GST in detoxifying insecticides and offer theoretical guidance for the design of novel pyrethroid-based insecticides.
40036624	Monitoring insecticide resistance and target-site mutations in field populations of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in China.	The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a notorious invasive pest, has been widely monitored for insecticide resistance. Since its invasion of China in late 2018, early to mid-stage monitoring of resistance is particularly crucial to inform effective control strategies. Resistance ratios (RRs) derived from bioassays offer valuable insights into the overall resistance levels of field populations, while the detection of resistance allele frequencies helps uncover the potential causes of resistance variation. In this study, we established a baseline of susceptibility in third-instar larvae to 7 insecticides using a laboratory strain Xinzheng2019 and assessed the resistance levels of 9 populations collected from central and southern China between 2022 and 2023. Compared to the susceptible Xinzheng2019 strain, 2 field populations showed low-level resistance (RR = 5-10) to indoxacarb, and one exhibited low-level resistance to chlorantraniliprole. Minor resistance (RR = 3-5) was observed in 2 populations to lambda-cyhalothrin, 5 to indoxacarb, and 5 to chlorantraniliprole. All populations remained susceptible (RR < 3) to spinetoram, emamectin benzoate, chlorfenapyr, and lufenuron. Molecular analysis of 11 mutation sites across 3 key resistance-related genes (Ace-1, GluCl, and voltage-gated sodium channel [VGSC]) revealed that 52.1% of all tested samples carried either homozygous or heterozygous resistance alleles at the F290V locus of the Ace-1 gene, while no resistance mutations were detected at other sites. Our findings offer valuable insights into the insecticide resistance status of S. frugiperda field populations in China and provide guidance for effective chemical insecticide use.
40036620	Machine-learning approach facilitates prediction of whitefly spatiotemporal dynamics in a plant canopy.	Plant-specific insect scouting and prediction are still challenging in most crop systems. In this article, a machine-learning algorithm is proposed to predict populations during whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci, Hemiptera; Gennadius Aleyrodidae) scouting and aid in determining the population distribution of adult whiteflies in cotton plant canopies. The study investigated the main location of adult whiteflies relative to plant nodes (stem points where leaves or branches emerge), population variation within and between canopies, whitefly density variability across fields, the impact of dense nodes on overall canopy populations, and the feasibility of using machine learning for prediction. Daily scouting was conducted on 64 non-pesticide cotton plants, focusing on all leaves of a node with the highest whitefly counts. A linear mixed-effect model assessed distribution over time, and machine-learning model selection identified a suitable forecasting model for the entire canopy whitefly population. Findings showed that the top 3 to 5 nodes are key habitats, with a single node potentially accounting for 44.4% of the full canopy whitefly population. The Bagging Ensemble Artificial Neural Network Regression model accurately predicted canopy populations (R² = 85.57), with consistency between actual and predicted counts (P-value > 0.05). Strategic sampling of the top nodes could estimate overall plant populations when taking a few samples or transects across a field. The suggested machine-learning model could be integrated into computing devices and automated sensors to predict real-time whitefly population density within the entire plant canopy during scouting operations.
40036334	PWC tool to estimate pesticide soil concentrations for risk assessment of non-target soil organisms.	In Brazil, as of 2024, regulatory authorities are discussing establishing new guidelines for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of Plant Protection Products (PPPs) for non-target soil organisms. A critical aspect of this process is exposure estimates of non-target soil organisms to PPPs. The present work investigates the potential application of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) modeling platform to estimate the Predicted Environmental Concentration in the soil (PECSOIL) as an option for exposure assessments. The objective of this exercise is to investigate the practicability and adaptability of PWC within the framework of a tiered risk assessment approach in Brazil. The PWC PECSOIL values were compared with two soil residue kinetics models: the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive PECSOIL Calculator and ESCAPE. As a validation step, PWC PECSOIL estimates were compared with measured soil residue data from two Brazilian locations. The impact of location-specific local data-soil physical-chemical properties, meteorological data, application methods, and crop parameters-on PECSOIL is also discussed, especially parameters which are inherent to PWC but absent in other soil kinetics calculators. Based on this work, we found the PWC model useful for soil exposure determination, especially when it becomes necessary to refine the exposure estimates using locally relevant conditions to bring more realism to the evaluation process.
40036312	Assessing pyrethroid resistance mechanisms in individual Culex tarsalis (Diptera: Culicidae).	The evolution of pyrethroid insecticide resistance in Culex tarsalis Coquillett, a vector for West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses, is a growing concern in Northern California. Common mechanisms of resistance include the target-site mutation, kdr, and increased levels of detoxification enzymes, such as mixed-function oxidases, GSTs, and esterases. The goal of this study was to compare the prevalence of kdr mutations (L1014F and L1014S) and detoxification enzymes between pyrethroid susceptible and resistant Cx. tarsalis individuals. Individual mosquitoes, categorized by resistance status from permethrin bottle bioassays, were prepared for both molecular and enzymatic testing by separating the legs of a mosquito from the remaining body. Legs were used to test for the presence of kdr mutations, while the bodies were used to test for the activity of detoxification enzymes. The number of phenylalanine (F) alleles present at the kdr target-site as well as levels of GST were increased in mosquitoes that survived the bottle bioassay compared to those that were knocked down. Individuals with 2 F alleles and an active GST level greater than or equal to 0.052 µg/ml showed a higher survival rate than either mechanism independently demonstrating resistance to pyrethroids in Cx. tarsalis is likely the result of multiple resistance mechanisms acting collectively. Further work is needed to determine the interplay of multiple resistance mechanisms to achieve phenotype resistance in this mosquito species.
40036185	Effects of soybean fields on the health of Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in the Chaco ecoregion.	Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are important pollinators for natural and cultivated species. Due to their high sensitivity to stressors, they are also valuable indicators of environmental changes and agricultural management practices. In this study, we compared the performance and incidence of pesticides over sentinel hives within forest remnants with those within linear forest fragments (LFF) surrounded by soybean fields under conventional management. Sentinel hives in LFF showed some signs of deterioration, such as colony collapse, low numbers of brood frames, and pesticide occurrences, but honey production and the number of adult bees were similar to hives in the forest. Soybean pollen was scarce in honey and absent in bee bread, suggesting that bees may be relying more on wild plant species. We detected 5 pesticides (azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, and coumaphos) in hives both at forests and LFF in pollen, bee bodies, and wax; pesticides in honey were detected in old sentinel hives (2 yr of exposition to agricultural conventional management). Only 2 of the 5 pesticides were applied in one of the farms under study, highlighting the importance of considering landscape-scale agricultural management. Our results indicate that conventional agriculture of soybean/maize primarily affected the performance of beehives, and pesticides were detected in honey only after long exposure to hives. Beekeeping in soybean fields in the Chaco could be feasible if cautions were followed, such as the conservation of forest fragments and key plant species, appropriate pesticide schedules, coordinated applications among farms, and linear forest remnants improvements.
40036018	Pyridaben as a novel fungicide against <i>Sphaerotheca fuliginea</i>, the causal agent of cucumber powdery mildew.	Pyridaben is a novel broad-spectrum insecticide and acaricide that is effective against thrips, mites, aphids and leafhoppers. We accidentally discovered that pyridaben was able to prevent cucumber powdery mildew. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects and underlying mechanisms of pyridaben against <i>Sphaerotheca fuliginea</i>. Pyridaben effectively inhibited the spore germination and mycelial growth of <i>S. fuliginea</i> with IC<sub>50</sub> of 10.83 mg/L and 18.28 mg/L, respectively. The spore germination, mycelial growth, and secondary spore formation of <i>S. fuliginea</i> was severely hindered on cucumber leaves treated with pyridaben at 20 mg/L. SEM revealed that the mycelia growing on pyridaben-treated cucumber leaves were much finer than that growing on untreated leaves. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that pyridaben had a significant impact on the ribosomal function and energy metabolism of the powdery mildew pathogen, restricting its normal physiological activities. In field experiments, the efficacies of pyridaben reached 76.48% in Zhejiang province and 78.40% in Shandong province at the rate of 225 g a.i./ha after two applications, which were comparable to the commercialized fungicides. These results suggest pyridaben is not only an insecticide but also an effective fungicide with the potential for further application in preventing and controlling cucumber powdery mildew.
40036017	Flutriafol Drench Provides Season-long Protection of Boxwood Plantings Pre-infected by <i>Calonectria pseudonaviculata</i> in the Mid-Atlantic.	Flutriafol drench application on March 7 without and with additional applications at 8- and 20-week intervals all consistently protected boxwood plantings pre-infected by Calonectria pseudonaviculata in two gardens in Richmond, Virginia through November 21. All drench applications were dosed at 2 ml product with 42% flutriafol and delivered in 250 ml solution per 30.5-cm shrub height in both gardens. While providing season-long protection, this drench dose also resulted in significant phytotoxicity on 30.5-cm tall 'Justin Brouwers' boxwood but not on English and common boxwood, which were 1.4 and 1.1 m tall, respectively. Once the phytotoxicity issue is resolved, only a single drench per year may suffice to protect boxwood plantings in the Mid-Atlantic, which would substantially cut the labor cost and minimize the health impacts commonly associated with current fungicide foliar sprays.
40035918	Characterization of plant growth-promoting endophytic fungi from Aegle marmelos Corr. and their role in growth enhancement and yield in rice.	Plant growth-promoting endophytes (PGPE) are microorganisms which reside in plant tissues and are beneficial to the host in plant growth promotion and pathogen resistance. They are the eco-friendly and sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This study aimed to analyze the plant growth-promoting properties of the five endophytic fungal strains from the medicinal plant Aegle marmelos Corr. and evaluate their effects on Oryza sativa plants. Firstly, endophytes were isolated from the different parts of A. marmelos and identified by ITS sequencing. Phosphate solubilization ability was checked in Pikovskaya's agar medium, IAA secretion was measured by the Salkowski colourimetric method, and ACC deaminase activity was checked by Penrose's method. Four endophytic fungal strains with promising PGP activities were inoculated into rice seeds to check their growth promotion in rice. The strain Purpureocillium lilacinum (AMR2) enhanced the seed vigour of rice seeds and demonstrated excellent root colonization ability. Periconia byssoides (AML2) and Medicopsis romeroi (AMS3) were the most effective plant growth-promoting agents, leading to both crop yield improvement and enhanced plant morphological growth due to their great ability to solubilize inorganic phosphate, ACC deaminase activity and production of IAA and Gibberellin A3 (GA3). These endophytic strains could serve as microbial inoculants to enhance crop production, offering an eco-friendly alternative.
40035488	Metabolomics as a Tool for Unraveling the Impact of Enantioselectivity in Cellular Metabolism.	Metabolomics is an emerging interdisciplinary field focused on the comprehensive analysis of all metabolites within biological samples, making it valuable for areas such as drug development, and environmental analysis. Many compounds, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals that have been extensively studied by metabolomics are chiral. The intrinsic chirality of biological targets can lead to a selective recognition of enantiomers resulting in distinct pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and/or toxicological profiles (enantioselectivity). Given that metabolomics captures an instant snapshot of an organism's metabolic state, it serves as a powerful tool to investigate chiral compounds and understand enantioselective effects. Herein, a systematic compilation of scientific literature was performed and 48 enantioselectivity studies using metabolomics were selected. These studies revealed an increasing focus on chiral pesticides (77%), the use of animal models (59%), reliance on LC-MS techniques (52%), and predominantly untargeted approaches (83%). Enantioselective effects were described in most studies. This review describes significant advances in this emerging field and highlights the use of metabolomics to unravel the role of stereochemistry in cellular metabolism by the examination of enantiomer-specific metabolic effects. Furthermore, it elucidates enantioselectivity mechanism that can be further applied to other groups of chiral compounds.
40035150	Precise genome editing of Dense and Erect Panicle 1 promotes rice sheath blight resistance and yield production in japonica rice.	The primary goals of crop breeding are to enhance yield and improve disease resistance. However, the "trade-off" mechanism, in which signalling pathways for resistance and yield are antagonistically regulated, poses challenges for achieving both simultaneously. Previously, we demonstrated that knock-out mutants of the Dense and Erect Panicle 1 (DEP1) gene can significantly enhance rice resistance to sheath blight (ShB), and we mapped DEP1's association with panicle length. In this study, we discovered that dep1 mutants significantly reduced rice yield. Nonetheless, truncated DEP1 was able to achieve both ShB resistance and yield increase in japonica rice. To further explore the function of truncated DEP1 in promoting yield and ShB resistance, we generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing mutants, including a full-length deletion mutant of DEP1, named dep1, and a truncated version, dep1-cys. Upon inoculation with Rhizoctonia solani, the dep1-cys mutant demonstrated stronger ShB resistance than the dep1 mutant. Additionally, dep1-cys increased yield per plant, whereas dep1 reduced it. Compared to the full DEP1 protein, the truncated DEP1 (dep1-cys) demonstrated a decreased interaction affinity with IDD14 and increased affinity with IDD10, which are known to positively and negatively regulate ShB resistance through the activation of PIN1a and ETR2, respectively. The dep1-cys mutant exhibited higher PIN1a and lower ETR2 expression than wild-type plants, suggesting that dep1-cys modulated IDD14 and IDD10 interactions to regulate PIN1a and ETR2, thereby enhancing ShB resistance. Overall, these data indicate that precise genome editing of DEP1 could simultaneously improve both ShB resistance and yield, effectively mitigating trade-off regulation in rice.
40035012	Residue determination and decline pattern of abamectin and fenpyroximate in okra fruits: a prelude to risk assessment.	This study developed and validated an LC-MS/MS analytical method for determining abamectin and fenpyroximate residues in okra fruits. The method optimization focused on chromatographic separation and ionization conditions, adding formic acid and ammonium formate to enhance ionization efficiency and signal sensitivity. Validation was performed according to SANTE guidelines, demonstrating good selectivity, linearity (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> > 0.998), precision, recovery, and minimal matrix effects (14.6% for abamectin and 5.2% for fenpyroximate). The limit of detection (LOD) was set at 0.0006 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for abamectin and 0.0002 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for fenpyroximate, while the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.002 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.001 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Precision was within acceptable limits, with intra-day RSD of 11.4% for abamectin and 7.6% for fenpyroximate. Recovery ranged from 84.2% to 98.6%, meeting the acceptable 70-120% range. Persistence studies indicated that abamectin and fenpyroximate residues dissipated over time, with half-lives of 2.3 and 2.45 days, respectively. The pre-harvest interval (PHI) required for residues to fall below the maximum residue limit (MRL) was estimated to be 2.6 days for abamectin and 6.9 days for fenpyroximate. The risk quotient was assessed based on the Egyptian adult consumers' consumption of okra, ensuring a negligible risk.
40035006	Metal oxides and their composites for the remediation of organic pesticides: advanced photocatalytic and adsorptive solutions.	Metal oxide nanoparticles and their composites have garnered significant attention in water treatment and environmental cleanup due to their unique physicochemical properties. These materials exhibit distinct crystalline structures, tunable morphologies, large surface areas, versatile surface chemistry, and widespread availability. These features make nanostructured metal oxides and their composites highly effective for the selective removal of organic pollutants from the environment, either by adsorption or photodegradation. This article focuses on recent advances, challenges, and opportunities in the use of metal oxides and their composites for the targeted removal of organic contaminants, including insecticides, phenolic compounds, organic dyes, and similar pollutants. The discussion encompasses a broad range of metal oxides and their composites, highlighting their diverse structural, crystallographic, and morphological characteristics that influence their adsorption and photocatalytic performance. Emphasis is placed on the photocatalytic and adsorptive capabilities of these materials, including their photo-stimulation properties and mechanisms. Metal oxides are highlighted as outstanding photocatalysts due to their high photodegradation efficiency, cost-effective synthesis methods, and optimized bandgap engineering. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers exploring the photocatalytic and adsorptive applications of metal oxide-based materials, particularly in the remediation of hazardous organic pollutants such as pesticides.
40034871	Thiamethoxam at environmentally relevant concentrations induces neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae through binding with multiple receptors.	Thiamethoxam (THM) is one of the most widely used insecticides globally, which was designed to selectively target nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the insect nervous system and is generally considered safe for non-targeted organisms. However, increasing evidence has demonstrated its neurotoxicity in aquatic organisms, though the underlying mechanisms, especially at environmentally relevant concentrations, remain largely unclear. In this study, the swimming distance of zebrafish was significantly shortened by 14.06%-21.64% after exposure to THM at 10-1000 ng/L. This behavioral impairment may result from the damage to nervous and visual systems, as confirmed by notable apoptosis, histological analysis of the eyes, and differential expression of numerous genes. Molecular docking and biomarkers assays found that THM can bind with nAChR and multiple hormone receptors, with binding energies varying from -3.75 to -6.74 kcal/mol. Consequently, the concentrations of a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) and related hormones (cortisol, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) were significantly affected. Further investigations using a weighted gene correlation network and metabolomics suggest that THM may enter the cell via endocytosis and bind with multiple hormone receptors, potentially activating the MAPK signaling pathway. This activation may disrupt purine and pyrimidine metabolism in the cell nucleus, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis and neurotoxicity. This study reveals that THM, even at environmentally relevant concentrations, poses neurological risks to zebrafish and underscore the need for urgent attention to the ecological impacts of THM in aquatic environments.
40034316	Nanopesticides for managing primary and secondary stored product pests: Current status and future directions.	The preservation of agricultural commodities during storage is critical for ensuring food security and minimizing post-harvest losses. Both primary storage pests such as <i>Callosobruchus maculatus</i>, <i>Callosobruchus chinensis</i>, <i>Sitophilus weevils</i>, <i>Rhyzopertha dominica</i>, and <i>Trogoderma granarium</i>, and secondary storage pests like <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> cause significant damage to stored products, resulting in substantial economic losses. Traditional pest control methods, including chemical insecticides, face limitations due to environmental concerns and pest resistance. Consequently, nanoparticle-based insecticides are being extensively suggested as a promising alternative. This review analyzes the available literature on the efficacy of nanoparticles (NPs) against primary and some secondary storage pests. Green synthesis methods using plant extracts and other biological sources are highlighted for the production of environmentally friendly NPs. Studies demonstrate that NPs of alumina, carbon, silica, silver, copper, zinc oxide, nickel oxide, titanium dioxide, nano zeolite, as well as chitosan and polymers exhibit significant insecticidal activity against a variety of pests, in some cases surpassing mortality rates caused by traditional insecticides at recommended dosages. Structural, biochemical and molecular studies reveal that NPs induce oxidative stress, disrupt cellular homeostasis, and cause structural damage in pests. Histopathological evaluations indicate specific organ-related toxicity, emphasizing the need for comprehensive biosafety assessments. Additionally, the integration of NPs with conventional insecticides shows enhanced pest control efficiency, although challenges remain in standardizing synthesis methods and evaluating long-term environmental impacts. This review highlights the potential of NPs in sustainable pest management and underlines the importance of ongoing research to optimize specific formulations for specific groups of pests and ensure safety.
40034099	Thiamethoxam Exposure Impairs Oocyte Maturation via Induction of Lipid Metabolism and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions in Porcine.	Neonicotinoid insecticides (NEOs) are the most widely used pesticides in modern agriculture, and there are residues in the environment and food. Thiamethoxam (TMX) has been proven to destroy the ovarian homeostasis of mice in vivo and reduce the development of porcine oocytes in vitro. However, whether TMX can interfere with porcine oocyte maturation and its potential mechanism remains unknown. This study indicated that TMX affects the expansion of cumulus cells, destroys the balance of lipid metabolism, and damages mitochondrial function. TMX treatment decreased the expression of genes related to cumulus cell expansion, lipid synthesis and mitochondrial synthesis. Collectively, results confirm that TMX exposure can damage oocyte maturation and produce reproductive toxicity by inducing lipid metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in porcine.
40033930	<i>UvCYP503</i> is required for stress response and pathogenicity in <i>Ustilaginoidea virens</i>.	The fungus <i>Ustilaginoidea virens</i>, which impacts rice spikes, causes rice false smut (RFS), a significant prevalent disease in rice cultivation regions globally. Cytochrome <i>P450</i> genes are known to be involved in secondary metabolism and pathogenesis in various species, but studies on <i>CYP450</i> genes in <i>U. virens</i> are limited. In this research, a <i>P450</i> family gene, <i>CYP503</i>, was found up-regulated during invasion stage of <i>U. virens</i>. Observation of fluorescence indicated that UvCYP503-GFP is situated within cytoplasm of hyphae. Disruption of <i>CYP503</i> led to decreased hyphal development, conidiation, and pathogenicity. Additional RNA-seq assay revealed that <i>UvCYP503</i> affects the transcript of genes associated with pathogenicity, various stress responses, and other <i>CYP450</i> genes. In alignment with RNA-seq results, compared with wild-type, Δ<i>Uvcyp503</i> mutants showed increased sensitivity to cell wall stresses, but reduced sensitivity to osmotic and hyperosmotic stressors. Moreover, Δ<i>Uvcyp503</i> mutants exhibited decreased sensitivity to the fungicides difenoconazole and tebuconazole. This study represents a phenome-based functional analysis of a <i>CYP503</i> gene in <i>U. virens</i> and provides valuable genetic resources for further research in filamentous fungi and other plant pathogens.
40033688	Effect of carbon chain length of cationic surfactants on regulating droplet behavior on peanut leaves.	Droplet rebound on superhydrophobic leaves during pesticide application significantly increases pesticide waste and decreases application efficiency. An appropriate surfactant is crucial for suppressing droplet rebound and enhancing wetting and spreading on leaf surfaces.
40033647	gma-miR828a Negatively Regulates Resistance to Tea Leaf Spot Caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae Through Targeting the CsMYB28-CsRPP13 Module.	Leaf spot caused by the fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae severely affects the quality and production of tea (Camellia sinensis) in plantations across southwestern China. Currently, no effective control measures are available, and the damage to tea leaves is also exacerbated by a lack of understanding regarding the epidemiology of the disease. Previous studies have suggested that gma-miR828a is differentially expressed during L. theobromae infection and may target and cleave the mRNA of CsMYB28. In this study, we characterised CsMYB28 as encoding a transcription factor (TF) that localises to the nucleus, cell membrane, and cytoplasm. This gene was found to be differentially and spatiotemporally expressed in leaf tissues following L. theobromae infection of leaves of the tea plant. Altered CsMYB28 expression, achieved by transient overexpression or stable genetic transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana, or transient silencing using antisense oligonucleotides (AsODN) in the tea plant, indicated that CsMYB28 contributes to resistance against L. theobromae. Using DNA affinity purification sequencing, yeast one-hybrid, and dual-luciferase assays, we also identified that CsMYB28 bound to the AATTAATT motif of CsRPP13, thereby activating the expression of CsRPP13. Additionally, degradome sequencing, β-glucuronidase (GUS) assays, and RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends revealed that miR828a cleaved CsMYB28 mRNA, negatively regulating its expression. The results from transient overexpression and stable transformation studies, combined with AsODN-mediated silencing in the tea plant, suggested that miR828a plays a negative regulatory role in modulating the response of the tea plant to L. theobromae infection. This study demonstrates that the miR828a-CsMYB28-CsRPP13 mediates the response of the tea plant to L. theobromae infection.
40033574	Design, synthesis and biological activity evaluation of novel imidazo[5,1-b]thiazole derivatives containing a pyrazole ring based on the intermediate derivatization method.	A substantial amount of empirical research indicates that the development of novel pesticides through the intermediate derivatization method can significantly enhance the success rate of new pesticide creation while reducing research and development costs. In response to this demand, a series of novel derivatives containing pyrazole imidazo[5,1-b]thiazole were synthesized by the intermediate derivatization method to modify the imine skeleton, which was found to have good antifungal activity in a previous work, and subjecting it to intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction.
40033284	Impact of dual active ingredients long-lasting insecticidal nets on the genetic structure of insecticide resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae in Southern Benin.	Insecticide resistance amongst vector populations is a major challenge, exacerbated by the continued use of the same active ingredients. The present study assessed the impact of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) bi-treated with chlorfenapyr-alphacypermethrin (PY-CFP LLIN) or pyriproxyfen-alphacypermethrin (PY-PPF LLIN) on the genetic structure of resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae in 60 clusters divided into three arms from three districts in southern Benin.
40032875	Synergistic effects of herbicides and gibberellic acid on wheat yield and quality.	Gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) is commercially applied to stimulate the growth and productivity of various agricultural crops. However, its impact on the yield and chemical properties of wheat under weed stress is still unclear. In this investigation, the influence of weed control (sulfosulfuron (sulfo-s), florasulam 7.5% + flumetsulam 10% (derby), pyroxsulam (pallas), and untreated check) and GA<sub>3</sub> (0, 100, and 200 mg/L) treatments on the narrow-leaved weed (i.e., Avena fatua L.) and broad-leaved weeds as well as yield and chemical properties of wheat (cv. Sakha 94) was explored. The findings showed that the wheat plants were infested by seven weed species. Such weeds were notably controlled using herbicidal treatments, particularly annual sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.) (94.1 and 92.0%) and field binder (Convolvulus arvensis L.) (91.5 and 93.6%) were very highly susceptible to pallas herbicide in both seasons. Likened to control group, the application of GA<sub>3</sub> (especially at 200 mg/L) or pallas herbicide observably decreased the dry weight of wild oat (Avena fatua L.) and broad-leaved weeds, which contributed positively to the increase of plant height, No. of spikelet's/spike, 1000-grain weight, and grain yield (P < 0.05) in both seasons. Moreover, spraying of sulfo-s herbicide maximized spike length of wheat plants (16.0 cm) in the 2<sup>nd</sup> season, whereas plots treated with derby had the highest spike weight (7.64 and 7.17 g) and No. of grains/spike (62.0 and 58.8) in two seasons. Furthermore, the maximal grain yield was recorded following the synergistic spraying of pallas and GA<sub>3</sub> at 200 mg/L (7278 kg/ha in the 1st season) as well as sulfo-s and GA<sub>3</sub> at 200 mg/L (6935 kg/ha in the 2nd season). Relative to control, significant increases in protein (by 46.99 and 50.47%) and nitrogen content (by 46.93 and 50.54%) were also noticed after the use of derby and 200 mg/L GA<sub>3</sub> in 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> season, respectively (P < 0.05), implying the improvement in the quality of wheat grains. Most remarkably, Pearson's correlation demonstrated that the reduction in Avena fatua L. and broad-leaved weeds was accountable strongly for 66 to 96% of the enhancement in yield and chemical properties of wheat under the application of herbicides and GA<sub>3</sub> treatments. The current findings may be very relevant in guiding farmers in the selection of suitable agronomic treatments (i.e., herbicides and GA<sub>3</sub>) that may maximize wheat yield and quality.
40032465	Residual behaviors and health risk assessment of dinotefuran, flonicamid, and their metabolites during apple growth, storage, and processing.	Understanding the fate of dinotefuran, flonicamid, and their metabolites is crucial for accurate dietary exposure assessment and human health. The dissipation and removal of dinotefuran, flonicamid, and their metabolites from apple cultivation to consumer's plate were studied. The results of field and storage experiments indicated significant differences in half-life at different doses. And the half-life was shorter in the field than that in storage. During washing, the residues of all target compounds were decreased. Among washing solutions, the PF values of each pesticide gradually decreased with the increasing washing time and washing solution concentration. 2 % NaHCO<sub>3</sub> produced best removal effect after washing 15 min. Various food processing techniques, including peeling, fermentation, clarification, blanching, drying, enzymolysis, and simmering, were used to confirm the most effective way to remove these target compounds. For majority processes, the PF values were < 1, and the peeling and fermentation could obviously reduce pesticide residues. The risk quotients were < 100 %, implying that the risks were acceptable. This study provided a necessary information for the use of pesticides in apple cultivation and improvement of processing technology to ensure food safety.
40032461	Integrative transcriptomic and HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis reveals the influence mechanism of different altitude ecotypes on pulp aroma components and volatile metabolites in strawberry hybrid F<sub>1</sub> and its parents.	Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) is an important horticultural crop and is highly nutritious and valuable. However, several molecular mechanisms on the biosynthesis and metabolism of aroma compounds and the regulatory network that governs aromas remain unknown. This study investigated the influence of different altitude ecotypes on the components of pulp aroma and volatile metabolites in strawberry hybrid F<sub>1</sub> and its parents. "Perilla alcohol" was found to be the major factor that regulated the aroma of strawberry pulp from plants at low altitudes, and "perilla alcohol, linalool, alpha-farnesene and E-2-hexenyl benzoate" were the major factors that regulated the aroma of strawberry pulp from plants at high altitudes. Furthermore, three key candidate genes were identified according to the criteria of |K.i| > 40 and |MM| > 0.90. This study will establish a theoretical foundation for the cultivation of novel varieties of strawberries characterized by superior quality and flavor.
40032454	Assessing the differential responses in normal and inflamed in vitro intestinal models exposed to food contaminants complex mixtures.	The intestinal barrier is crucial for gut health, and its dysfunction can lead to chronic inflammatory conditions. Food contaminants like pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins, heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may worsen these conditions. However, research often overlooks the complex interactions between contaminants and the different cells in the intestine. This study explores the effects of repeated exposure to a mixture of 45 food contaminants on a triculture cell model (Caco-2/HT29-MTX monolayers and THP-1 cells) under normal and inflamed conditions. Two exposure scenarios were tested: a low-level mixture (LOW) reflecting daily diet exposure and a worst-case (WS) scenario. Cytotoxicity, barrier integrity, the expression of inflammation, oxidative stress, and intestinal barrier-related genes, as well as intestinal compounds absorption, were assessed. LOW and WS tested mixtures were confirmed to be non-cytotoxic to the monolayer. The inflamed model was validated with a 23 % reduction in TEER value compared to the normal. The WS mixture caused a maximum TEER decrease of 61 % after repeated exposure. The inflamed model was more vulnerable to contaminants, though the normal also showed significant effects. Gene expression revealed modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress, indicating that even real-life levels of food contaminants exacerbate these responses. The WS mixture induced 6-8 times the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in contaminants absorption between the models, but the absorption patterns align with known data. These findings enhance understanding of the intestinal effects of exposure to food contaminant mixtures in the diet.
40032241	The bacterial symbionts of Entomopathogenic nematodes and their role in symbiosis and pathogenesis.	Entomopathogenic bacteria in the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus are mutualistically associated with entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) Steinernema and Heterorhabditis, respectively. Together they form an insecticidal partnership which has been shown to kill a wide range of insect species. The spectrum of dependence in this symbiotic partnership is diverse, ranging from a tight, obligate relationship to a facultative one. A body of evidence suggests that the reproductive fitness of the nematode-bacterium partnership is tightly associated and interdependent. Furthermore, maintenance of their virulence is also critical to the conversion of the insect host as a suitable environment where this partnership can be perpetuated. Disruption of the symbiotic partnership can have detrimental effects on the fitness of both partners. The nematode-bacterial symbiont-insect partnership represents a model system in ecology and evolutionary biology and amenable to investigate beneficial and antagonistic interactions between invertebrates and microbes. Furthermore, the EPN's bacterial symbionts are also viewed as a model system to study the biosynthesis, structure and function of various natural products. Their ability to produce up to 25 different natural product classes is outstanding among the Morganellaceae. These natural products show biological activity, most likely originating from important functions during the life cycle of both the nematodes and their symbionts. Tools and high throughput technologies have been developed to identify ubiquitous and rare molecules and study their function and assess their potential as novel biological activities. We herein summarize the symbiotic relationship between EPN and their bacterial symbionts, focusing on their fitness and their ability to successfully access and utilize an insect host. We also recapitulate the history of natural products research highlighting recent findings and the synthetic biology approaches that are currently implemented to identify non-natural derivatives from Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus with improved biological activity.
