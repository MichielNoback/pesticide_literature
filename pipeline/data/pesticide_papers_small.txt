29990300	Oxidative stress in triazine pesticide toxicity: a review of the main biomarker findings.	This review article provides a summary of the studies relying on oxidative stress biomarkers (lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes in particular) to investigate the effects of atrazine and terbuthylazine exposure in experimental animals and humans published since 2010. In general, experimental animals showed that atrazine and terbuthylazine exposure mostly affected their antioxidant defences and, to a lesser extent, lipid peroxidation, but the effects varied by the species, sex, age, herbicide concentration, and duration of exposure. Most of the studies involved aquatic organisms as useful and sensitive bio-indicators of environmental pollution and important part of the food chain. In laboratory mice and rats changes in oxidative stress markers were visible only with exposure to high doses of atrazine. Recently, our group reported that low-dose terbuthylazine could also induce oxidative stress in Wistar rats. It is evident that any experimental assessment of pesticide toxic effects should take into account a combination of several oxidative stress and antioxidant defence biomarkers in various tissues and cell compartments. The identified effects in experimental models should then be complemented and validated by epidemiological studies. This is important if we wish to understand the impact of pesticides on human health and to establish safe limits.	1	pesticide
29990732	Toxicity induced by glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides in the zebrafish hepatocyte cell line (ZF-L).	Glyphosate is the active component of many commonly used herbicides; it can reach bodies of water through irrigated rice plantations. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of glyphosate and Roundup® (a glyphosate-based herbicide) in established culture of the zebrafish hepatocyte cell line ZF-L after 24 and 48 h of exposure to concentrations of 650 and 3250 µg/L. We observed a reduction in metabolic activity and lysosomal integrity, and an increase in cell number after 24 h of Roundup® exposure at the highest concentration. An increase in active mitochondria and apoptotic cells was observed following 24 h exposure to glyphosate and Roundup®, while only exposure to Roundup® induced an increase in necrotic cells. Rhodamine B accumulation decreased after 48 h exposure to 650 µg/L of Roundup®; this reduction is indicative of increased activity of ABC pumps. Overall, the present findings highlighted the hazard of glyphosate exposure not only in the commercial formulation but also glyphosate alone, since both can induce damage in the ZF-L cell line primarily through the induction of apoptosis.	1	pesticide
30015122	Glyphosate and atrazine in rainfall and soils in agroproductive areas of the pampas region in Argentina.	The presence in the atmosphere of glyphosate (GLP) and atrazine (ATZ) was investigated-those pesticides dominating the market in Argentina-through rain, as the main climatic phenomenon associated with wet deposition, both through analyzing source-receptor relationships with soil along with the climatic influences that may condition that transport and through estimating the annual deposition on the surface of the Argentine pampas. Rainwater samples (n = 112) were collected throughout each rainfall in urban areas of the pampas having different degrees of land use and with extensive crop production plus subsurface-soil samples (n = 58) from the relevant periurban sites. The herbicides-analyzed by liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-were detected in >80% of the rain samples at median-to-maximum concentrations of 1.24-67.3 μg·L-1 (GLP) and 0.22-26.9 μg·L-1(ATZ), while aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) was detected at 34% (0.75-7.91 μg·L-1). In soils, GLP was more frequently registered (41%; 102-323 μg·kg-1) followed by ATZ (32%; 7-66 μg·kg-1) and then AMPA (22%; 223-732 μg·kg-1). The maximum GLP concentrations quantified in rainwater exceeded the previously reported levels for the USA and Canada. No associations were observed between soil and rainwater concentrations in the same monitoring areas-despite the soil's action as a source, as evidenced through the AMPA present in rainwater. Median GLP concentrations were significantly associated with isohyets, in an increasing gradient from the east to the west-as such in an inverse pattern to that of the annual rainfall volumes; whereas ATZ-rainwater levels exhibited no characteristic spatial configuration. The estimated annual deposition of GLP by rainfall indicated that more than onc source of a herbicide can lead to its presence in the atmosphere and points out the relevance of rainfall's contribution to the surface levels of a pollutant.	1	pesticide
30021322	A survey of multiple pesticide residues in pollen and beebread collected in China.	Honeybees, as major pollinators, make vital contributions to humans and ecosystems. Worryingly, a phenomenon known as honeybee colony losses has been reported in recent years. One of the factors underlying the occurrence of honeybee colony losses is exposure of honey bees to pesticide residues in their food, which cause detrimental sublethal effects and may lead to the collapse of their colonies. In this paper, 189 pollen samples and 226 beebread samples collected from five major beekeeping areas in China were analyzed from spring 2016 to autumn 2017. The most common active ingredient residues found include the insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, fenpropathrin, bifenthrin and chlorpyrifos), the acaricides (coumaphos and fluvalinate) and the fungicides (carbendazim and triadimefon). Our data shows that the residual level of three chemicals (i.e. imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and chlorpyrifos) was higher in pollen than in beebread. Moreover, contamination of pollen and beebread was most serious in spring and in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River Area of China. Our data lay the foundation for the risk assessment of pesticides on honeybees in China.	1	pesticide
30024824	Assessment of boscalid and pyraclostrobin disappearance and behavior following application of effective microorganisms on apples.	The aim of this study is to assess the disappearance of boscalid (IUPAC name: 2-chloro-N-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)phenyl]pyridine-3-carboxamide) and pyraclostrobin (IUPAC name: methyl N-[2-[[1-(4-chlorophenyl)pyrazol-3-yl]oxymethyl]phenyl]-N-methoxycarbamate) residues in apple fruit, and to verify whether an organic fertilizer enriched with strains of antagonistic microorganisms can reduce pesticide residue levels. Field trials were conducted in a commercial orchard on apples of the Gloster variety, during 21 days after the treatment with Bellis 38 WG and the subsequent application of Zumba Plant formulation containing Bacillus spp., Trichoderma spp. and Glomus spp. In control samples, the decrease rate of boscalid and pyraclostrobin residue levels followed an exponential function, described by formulae Rt = 0.2824e-0.071t and Rt = 0.1176e-0.060t, with the coefficient of determination of r2 = 0.8692 and r2 = 0.9268, respectively. These levels dropped to half (t1/2) of their initial values after 9.8 and 11.5 days, respectively. The treatment with Zumba Plant resulted in a reduction in boscalid and pyraclostrobin residue levels by 52% and 41%, respectively. The results of this study are of importance for horticulture sciences and for producers of apples using plant protection products (PPPs).	1	pesticide
30025459	Development and Validation of an Ultra-Sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS Method for Neonicotinoid Analysis in Milk.	A very sensitive ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantitation of the most common neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and thiacloprid) at trace levels in milk. Using fast and selective liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) starting from 0.5 mL of milk, lowest limits of quantitation (LLOQ) equal or lower than 10 pg/mL for all analytes were achieved. Precision and accuracy were evaluated at four different concentrations (5, 10, 500, and 10000 pg/mL) and ranged between 2 and 16% (RSD) and 77-125%, respectively. Extraction recoveries and matrix effects ranged between 64 and 76% and 88-98%, respectively. The method was applied to measure neonicotinoid levels in a series of conventional and organic Swiss milks as well as in human breast milk and commercial powdered milk. More than 90% of the samples tested positive for at least one neonicotinoid. However, all animal samples were far below the maximum residue limits authorized for human consumption with average total neonicotinoid levels of 16.1 ± 13.1 pg/mL. Human breast milks and powdered milks contained similar amounts of neonicotinoids. Taken together, our results demonstrate the high prevalence of neonicotinoids in milk from all origins, albeit at levels considered to be safe for human consumption.	1	pesticide
30032372	Photocatalytic degradation of imidacloprid by Ag-ZnO composite.	The present study focused on exploring the potential of Ag-ZnO composites for complete mineralization of imidacloprid with the aim to sustain the pollutant free safe water supply. The composites were prepared by hydrothermal method and characterized by Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray crystallography (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and band gap measurements. These composites were used to study the UV irradiated degradation of imidacloprid while optimizing the process parameters such as time of UV irradiation, pH of medium, pesticide concentration and composite loading. The results of the study revealed an increase in photodegradation of imidacloprid by Ag-ZnO composites than pure ZnO. Temperature and catalyst loading had a positive effect on degradation efficiency, while an inverse relation was observed between pesticide concentration and degradation. Moreover, no harmful degradation products of imidacloprid were observed in GC-MS analyses that confirmed its complete mineralization.	1	pesticide
30033022	Synthesis and bioactivity of thiazolidin-2-cyanamide derivatives against type III secretion system of Xanthomonas oryzae on rice.	Targeting virulence factors of bacterial without affecting their growth and survival, has been an initiative strategy for the development of novel anti-microbial agents. The type III secretion system (T3SS), one of essential and highly conserved virulence factors in most Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, has been regarded as an effective target that developed new anti-microbial drugs. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most Important bacterial pathogens on rice, which causes leaf blight disease. To discover potential anti-virulence agents against the pathogens, a new series of thiazolidin-2-cyanamide derivatives containing 5-phenyl-2-furan were designed and synthesized. Their structures were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS, and elemental analysis. All the title compounds inhibited the promoter activity of a harpin gene hpa1, significantly, that were further checked for the impact on bacterial growth and on the hypersensitive response (HR) caused by Xoo on non-host tobacco plants. The results indicated that treatment of Xoo with the title compounds II-2, II-3 and II-4 resulted in significantly attenuated HR without affecting bacterial growth or survival. Moreover, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of the Xoo T3SS was suppressed by treatment with the three inhibitors. The mRNA levels of representative genes in the hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) cluster, as well as the regulatory genes hrpG and hrpX, were reduced. Finally, the in vivo test demonstrated that the compounds could reduce the disease symptoms of Xoo on the rice cultivar (Oryza sativa) IR24.	1	pesticide
30075377	Occurrence and distribution of pesticides in precipitation as revealed by targeted screening through GC-MS/MS.	Facing the tough challenge of precise measurement of ever-increasing numbers of organic contaminants in the environment, there is an urgent need for more reliable and cost-effective methodologies. In this study, we developed and validated a screening method for analysis of over 450 pesticides in precipitation using gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was applied to extract target analytes from precipitation. Using this targeted approach, we managed to detect 123 pesticides with maximum retention time shifts below 0.1 min (except for DEET) in 101 precipitation samples collected between October 2015 and March 2017 in Singapore. This is probably the first study to report the measurements of a wide range of pesticides in precipitation. A spectrum of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and their synergists were detected and among them DEET, malathion and carbaryl were the most frequently detected pesticides (detection frequency: 100%, 96% & 67%). The Spearman correlations suggest that some pesticides of different subgroups had significant correlations. It is believed that these finding could shed light on the understanding of the contribution of precipitation to environmental contaminants in water cycle.	1	pesticide
30109197	Multi-residue pesticides analysis in water samples using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC).	India is one of the leading suppliers of agrochemicals and has the largest pesticide industry in Asia. Among various Indian states, Punjab is the primary user of pesticides. Presence of pesticide residue in water and food products of Punjab is well documented. The present study was designed to envisage the level of pesticide contamination in pond water of eleven villages of Amritsar district of Punjab, India. A rapid and concurrent method for the identification and quantification of pesticides in water samples was developed and validated. The method validation parameters exhibited high sensitivity of the developed method and the proficiency for the identification and quantification of pesticide residues in water samples. The RP-HPLC method described here •is a novel method which is applicable for simple, rapid and precise detection of pesticides.•40.02% of water samples were found contaminated with multi-residue pesticides.•carbofuran was the most abundant pesticide which was present in 18.18% samples.	1	pesticide
30125205	Detection and Characterization of QoI-Resistant Phytophthora capsici Causing Pepper Phytophthora Blight in China.	Phytophthora capsici is a highly destructive plant pathogen that has spread worldwide. To date, the quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) azoxystrobin has been the choice of farmers for managing this oomycete. In this study, the sensitivity of 90 P. capsici isolates collected from Yunnan, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Guangdong in southern China to azoxystrobin was assessed based on mycelial growth, sporangia formation, and zoospore discharge. Furthermore, the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene from azoxystrobin-sensitive and -resistant P. capsici isolates was compared to investigate the mechanism of QoI resistance. The high values for effective concentration to inhibit 50% of mycelial growth and large variation factor obtained provide strong support for the existence of azoxystrobin-resistant subpopulations in wild populations. The resistance frequency of P. capsici to azoxystrobin was greater than 40%. Sensitive P. capsici isolates were strongly suppressed on V8 medium plates containing azoxystrobin supplemented with salicylhydroxamic acid at 50 µg ml-1, whereas resistant isolates grew well under these conditions. Multiple alignment analysis revealed a missense mutation in the cytb gene that alters codon 137 (GGA to AGA), causing an amino acid substitution of glycine to arginine (G137R). The fitness of the azoxystrobin-sensitive isolate is similar to that of the G137R mutant. Additionally, the P. capsici isolates used in this study exhibited decreased sensitivity to two other QoI fungicides (pyraclostrobin and famoxadone). Necessary measures should be taken to control this trend of resistance to QoI that has developed in P. capsici in southern China.	1	pesticide
30125850	Pesticides related to land use in watersheds of the Great Lakes basin.	In this study, we evaluated the distribution and concentrations of a range of neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) and other insecticides, fungicides, biocides and selected herbicides in watersheds that drain into the lower Great Lakes in Ontario, Canada. Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) were deployed in 18 watersheds during late May to late June of 2016. Grab samples were also collected in 7 of these watersheds. There was generally good agreement between the time-weighted average concentrations of pesticides estimated from the POCIS and the concentrations detected in grab samples. The NNIs, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and imidacloprid, were present in several watersheds at concentrations that exceeded the Canadian Water Quality Guideline for imidacloprid of 0.23 μg/L. The new generation insecticides, flonicamid and flupyradifurone were also detected in some watersheds, which is the first report of these pesticides in the peer-reviewed literature. Atrazine, 2,4-D, dicamba, carbendazim, thiophanate methyl and several azole-based fungicides were also widely detected. Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) indicated that a high proportion (i.e. >80%) of the watersheds could be discriminated from each other on the basis of the pattern of pesticides detected in surface waters, and the proportion of field crops in the watershed.	1	pesticide
30128723	Characteristics of AccSTIP1 in Apis cerana cerana and its role during oxidative stress responses.	Various environmental stresses, such as heat shock, heavy metals, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and different pesticides, induce a cellular oxidative stress response. The cellular oxidative stress response is usually regulated by heat shock proteins (Hsps) acting as molecular chaperones. Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), one of the most widely studied co-chaperones, functions as an adaptor that directs Hsp90 to Hsp70-client protein complexes. However, the biological functions of STIP1 remain poorly understood in honeybee (Apis cerana cerana). In this study, AccSTIP1 was identified in Apis cerana cerana. AccSTIP1 transcription was found to be induced by heat (42 °C), HgCl2, H2O2 and different pesticides (emamectin benzoate, thiamethoxam, hexythiazox and paraquat) and inhibited by CdCl2, UV and kresoxim-methyl. Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that the expression profiles of AccSTIP1 were consistent with its transcriptional expression levels. The disc diffusion assay showed that chemically competent transetta (DE3) bacteria expressing a recombinant AccSTIP1 protein displayed the smaller death zones than did control bacteria after exposure to paraquat and HgCl2. The DNA nicking assay suggested that recombinant purified AccSTIP1 protected supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA from damage caused by a thiol-dependent mixed-function oxidation (MFO) system. After knocking down AccSTIP1 gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi), the transcript levels of antioxidation-related genes were obviously lower in dsAccSTIP1 honeybees compared with those in the uninjected honeybees. Collectively, these results demonstrated that AccSTIP1 plays an important role in counteracting oxidative stress. This study lays a foundation for revealing the mechanism of AccSTIP1 in the Apis cerana cerana antioxidant system.	1	pesticide
30142450	Glyphosate-based herbicides modulate oxidative stress response in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.	Glyphosate-based formulation is used as non-selective and post-emergent herbicides in urban and rural activities. In view of its recurring applications in agricultural producing countries, the increase of glyphosate concentration in the environment stresses the need to test the adverse effects on non-target organisms and assess the risk of its use. This paper analyzes the toxicological and oxidative stress and modulatory effects of a glyphosate commercial formulation (glyphosate F) on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We detected ROS production and enhancement of oxidative stress response in glyphosate F-treated nematodes. Particularly, we found an increased ctl-1 catalase gene expression of a catalase specific activity. In addition, we showed that glyphosate F treatment activated the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, a critical target of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, which modulates the transcription of a broad range of genes involved in stress resistance, reproductive development, dauer formation, and longevity. In summary, the exposure of glyphosate F induces an oxidative imbalance in C. elegans that leads to the DAF-16 activation and consequently to the expression of genes that boost the antioxidant defense system. In this regard, clt-1 gene and catalase activity proved to be excellent biomarkers to develop more sensitive protocols to assess the environmental risk of glyphosate use.	1	pesticide
30145949	Evaluation of the TOM-CAST Forecasting Model in Asparagus for Management of Stemphylium Leaf Spot in Ontario, Canada.	In the last 5 years, asparagus acreage in Canada has increased by over 25%. Stemphylium leaf spot, caused by Stemphylium vesicarium, has emerged as the predominant foliar pathogen of asparagus. Typically, contact fungicides are applied every 14 days; however, regardless of the number of applications, growers are not achieving adequate control of the disease. The TOM-CAST forecasting model is used widely in Michigan asparagus fields, but it has never been assessed for suitability in Ontario or in the popular cultivar, Guelph Millennium. Six field trials were conducted in 2012 and 2013 to evaluate the TOM-CAST forecasting model in two asparagus cultivars. The fungicides chlorothalonil or azoxystrobin/difenoconazole were applied according to the forecasting model or on a 14-day interval. The effectiveness of the forecasting model differed between sites and cultivars. Even though TOM-CAST is used in all cultivars in Michigan, TOM-CAST was not effective on Guelph Millennium. In the cultivar Jersey Giant, however, TOM-CAST with a 20 disease severity value spray interval improved control of Stemphylium leaf spot without increasing the number of sprays, compared with a 14-day treatment. The results in Guelph Millennium differed between sites. At one site, TOM-CAST maintained similar levels of Stemphylium leaf spot, but increased the number of applications, compared with a 14-day application interval. Of more concern, none of the fungicide treatments differed greatly from the untreated control at the other site. Our results show that forecasting models need to be validated locally in asparagus cultivars relevant to production today.	1	pesticide
30174036	Simultaneous determination of ten neonicotinoid insecticides and two metabolites in honey and Royal-jelly by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.	An analytical method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the first simultaneous determination of ten neonicotinoid insecticides (pymetrozine, dinotefuran, nitenpyram, thiamethoxam, flonicamid, imidacloprid, clothianidin, imidaclothiz, acetamiprid, thiacloprid) and two metabolites (4-trifluoromethylnicotinamide and N-desmethylacetamiprid) in honey and royal-jelly. The quantitative detection was performed by LC-MS/MS on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode under positive-ion electrospray ionization. The isotope dilution internal standard method or external standard method was used for quantitation analysis. The limits of quantification (LOQs), calculated as 10 times the standard deviation, were 0.25-5.0 µg kg-1 for ten neonicotinoid insecticides and two metabolites. The average recoveries were in the range of 72.8-106.5%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 13.8%, measured at three concentration levels. The developed method exhibits a high sensitivity and suitable for the simultaneous determination of neonicotinoid insecticides and metabolites in honey and royal-jelly.	1	pesticide
30195392	Mesotrione herbicide does not cause genotoxicity, but modulates the genotoxic effects of Atrazine when assessed in mixture using a plant test system (Allium cepa).	Mesotrione (MES) is an herbicide from the triketone family and has been used as an alternative to Atrazine (ATZ), which was banned in some countries due to its toxicity to non-target organisms. Despite being considered an eco-friendly herbicide, data from the literature about the harmful effects of MES in its pure form and/or in combination with other herbicides is still scarce. Aimed at assessing the potential of MES to induce cell death and DNA damage, seeds of Allium cepa (higher plant, monocotyledon) were exposed to this herbicide, pure and in mixture with ATZ, and the number of dividing cells (cytotoxicity), chromosomal aberrations (CA, genotoxicity) and micronuclei (MN, mutagenicity) were then quantified. The pure MES (1.8 to 460 μg/L) did not show either cytotoxicity or genotoxicity/mutagenicity under the tested conditions. The genotoxicity of ATZ (1.5 to 400 μg/L), previous reported in the literature, was confirmed herein. The assessment of MES + ATZ mixtures (1.8 + 1.5; 7 + 6.25; 30 + 25 μg/L, respectively) showed that MES, at low concentrations, enhance the genotoxicity of ATZ (potentiation), since the significant frequencies of CA and MN were greater than the ones expected in additive effects. Taking together, MES in its pure form seems to be a safe alternative to ATZ regarding the capacity to damage (at cellular and DNA levels) non-target plants (Monocots); however, MES in combination with ATZ appeared to act as a co-mutagen at low concentrations.	1	pesticide
30216815	Field evolved resistance to pyrethroids, neonicotinoids and biopesticides in Dysdercus koenigii (Hemiptera: Pyrrhocoridae) from Punjab, Pakistan.	The red cotton bug, Dysdercus koenigii (Fabricius) is an important emerging economic pest of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum Linnaeus in Pakistan. Insecticides are the primary management tactics to suppress populations of this pest. However, resistance to insecticides evolves due to substantial and repeated applications. The resistance to pyrethroids, neonicotinoids and biopesticides have been evaluated in many pests worldwide, nevertheless lack of information in D. koenigii. Therefore, the aforementioned insecticide resistance in five field populations of D. koenigii collected from Multan, Makhdoom Rashid, Jahanian, Lodhran and Vehari districts of Punjab, Pakistan during 2015-2017 was determined by using seed dip method. Based on the present results, D. koenigii has developed moderate to very high resistance to acetamiprid (RR = 33-433) and imidacloprid (RR = 21-173), low to high resistance to emamectin benzoate (RR = 14-52), and very low to high resistance to spinosad (RR = 4.13-54), compared to the susceptible population. However, all field populations of D. koenigii remained susceptible to deltamethrin (RR = 0.62-2.17) and lambda-cyhalothrin (RR = 0.91-1.97). A rotational use of pyrethroids with provision of other integrated pest management tactics is recommended to manage insecticide resistance in D. koenigii.	1	pesticide
30228990	Insecticide Resistance and Its Intensity in Populations of Malaria Vectors in Colombia.	Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors threatens malaria prevention and control efforts. In Colombia the three primary vectors, Anopheles darlingi, An. nuneztovari s.l., and An. albimanus, have reported insecticide resistance to pyrethroids, organophosphates, carbamates, and DDT; however, the insecticide resistance monitoring is not continuous, and the data on the prevalence of resistance is scarce and geographically limited. We describe the resistance levels and intensity of previously detected resistant populations among primary malaria vectors from the most endemic malaria areas in Colombia. The study was carried out in 10 localities of five states in Colombia. Bioassays were carried out following the methodology of CDC Bottle Bioassay using the discriminating concentration and in order to quantify the intensity the specimens were exposed to 2, 5, and 10X discriminating concentrations. Five insecticides were tested: deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, alpha-cypermethrin, permethrin, and DDT. The results provide evidence of low resistance intensity and resistance highly localized to pyrethroids and DDT in key malaria vectors in Colombia. This may not pose a threat to malaria control yet but frequent monitoring is needed to follow the evolution of insecticide resistance.	1	pesticide
30229068	The assembled transcriptome of the adult horn fly, Haematobia irritans.	The horn fly, Haematobia irritans irritans (Linnaeus, 1758; Diptera: Muscidae), a hematophagous external parasite of cattle, causes considerable economic losses to the livestock industry worldwide. This pest is mainly controlled with insecticides; however, horn fly populations from several countries have developed resistance to many of the products available for their control. In an attempt to better understand the adult horn fly and the development of resistance in natural populations, we used an Illumina paired-end read HiSeq and GAII approach to determine the transcriptomes of untreated control adult females, untreated control adult males, permethrin-treated surviving adult males and permethrin + piperonyl butoxide-treated killed adult males from a Louisiana population of horn flies with a moderate level of pyrethroid resistance. A total of 128,769,829, 127,276,458, 67,653,920, and 64,270,124 quality-filtered Illumina reads were obtained for untreated control adult females, untreated control adult males, permethrin-treated surviving adult males and permethrin + piperonyl butoxide-treated killed adult males, respectively. The de novo assemblies using CLC Genomics Workbench 8.0.1 yielded 15,699, 11,961, 2672, 7278 contigs (≥ 200 nt) for untreated control adult females, untreated control adult males, permethrin-treated surviving adult males and permethrin + piperonyl butoxide-treated killed adult males, respectively. More than 56% of the assembled contigs of each data set had significant hits in the BlastX (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database) (E <0.001). The number of contigs in each data set with InterProScan, GO mapping, Enzyme codes and KEGG pathway annotations were: Untreated Control Adult Females - 10,331, 8770, 2963, 2183; Untreated control adult males - 8392, 7056, 2449, 1765; Permethrin-treated surviving adult males - 1992, 1609, 641, 495; Permethrin + PBO-treated killed adult males - 5561, 4463, 1628, 1211.	1	pesticide
30239593	Evaluation of Dermal Exposure to the Herbicide Alachlor Among Vegetable Farmers in Thailand.	Vegetable farmers applying the herbicide alachlor may be highly exposed through dermal contact when spraying. Dermal patches were attached to 10 locations on the farmers' skin when they mixed and applied alachlor in vegetable farming areas in Thailand. Measurements were made on farmers using either a backpack sprayer with a 2 stroke gasoline motor and fan or a battery operated pump. Forty-seven vegetable farmers in Bungphra subdistrict of Thailand participated in this study. Both motorized and battery pump backpack sprayers wearing long-sleeve shirts had significantly lower alachlor concentrations on the dermal patches under their long-sleeve shirts compared to those who wore only short-sleeve shirts, regardless of the sprayer type. Moreover, sprayers wearing long pants had significantly lower alachlor concentrations on dermal patches placed under the pants on the lower legs than those wearing short pants, regardless of the sprayer type. The highest estimated alachlor exposures were found on the upper legs (median = 9.29 µg/h) for those using a 2 stroke engine/fan backpack sprayer and on the lower legs (2.87 µg/h) for those using the battery operated pump backpack sprayer. The estimated total body alachlor exposures of applicators using the 2 stroke engine/fan backpack sprayer (219.48 µg/h) were significantly higher than those using the battery operated pump backpack sprayer (15.50 µg/h). Using long-sleeve shirts as personal protection reduced alachlor exposures for the arms 97-99% and wearing long pants reduced alachlor exposure to the legs for 81-99%. Thus, training about the protection provided by clothing choices would be one step in improving the health and safety of Thai farmers.	1	pesticide
30245345	Effects of imidacloprid and a neonicotinoid mixture on aquatic invertebrate communities under Mediterranean conditions.	Neonicotinoid insecticides are considered contaminants of concern due to their high toxicity potential to non-target terrestrial and aquatic organisms. In this study we evaluated the sensitivity of aquatic invertebrates to a single application of imidacloprid and an equimolar mixture of five neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, acetamiprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin) using mesocosms under Mediterranean conditions. Cyclopoida, Cloeon dipterum and Chironomini showed the highest sensitivity to neonicotinoids, with calculated NOECs below 0.2 μg/L. The sensitivity of these taxa was found to be higher than that reported in previous studies performed under less warm conditions, proving the high influence of temperature on neonicotinoid toxicity. The short-term responses of the zooplankton and the macroinvertebrate communities to similar imidacloprid and neonicotinoid mixture concentrations were very similar, suggesting that the concentration addition model can be used as a plausible hyphotesis to assess neonicotinoid mixture effects in aquatic ecosystems. Long-term mixture toxicity assessments, however, should consider the fate of the evaluated substances in the environment of concern. As part of this study, we also demonstrated that Species Sensitivity Distributions constructed with chronic laboratory toxicity data and calculated (multi-substance) Potentially Affected Fractions provide an accurate estimation to asssess the ecotoxicologial risks of imidacloprid and neonicotinoid mixtures to aquatic invertebrate species assemblages.	1	pesticide
30251514	[Rapid determination of benzidine, picric acid, carbaryl, atrazine, and deltamethrin in surface water by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].	A method requiring no pre-treatment steps other than filtration, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), has been developed and applied for the rapid determination of benzidine, picric acid, carbaryl, atrazine, and deltamethrin residues in surface water. Water samples were filtered with a 0.2-μ m syringe filter for particle removal and injected directly into the UPLC instrument. The separation was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column utilizing a gradient elution program of methanol (containing 2 mmol/L ammonium acetate) and water (containing 2 mmol/L ammonium acetate) as the mobile phases at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The detection was accomplished by multiple-reaction monitoring scanning in positive/negative ion-switching electrospray ionization mode. Good linearity was observed in the range 0.10-10.0 μ g/L or 1.00-100 μ g/L for different targets with correlation coefficients of 0.996-0.999. The limits of detection (LODs) were 0.01-0.22 μ g/L. The recoveries ranged between 81.4% and 113% at three spiked levels with relative standard deviations (n=6) between 0.84% and 14.0%. The developed method was applied to the analysis of surface waters (river water and reservoir water) from Hangzhou; atrazine and deltamethrin were detected in part of the analyzed samples. This proposed method was characterized by high sensitivity and precision, extensive analytical range, and a high analytical rate, and showed suitability for the analysis of the five named pollutants in surface water.	1	pesticide
30290195	Biological impacts of organophosphates chlorpyrifos and diazinon on development, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and locomotor activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio).	The objectives of this study were to compare the biological responses in developing zebrafish to two organophosphate insecticides, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and diazinon (DZN). Zebrafish embryos were exposed to either solvent control (0.1% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 25.0 μM CPF, as well as one dose of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 μM DZN for 96 h. CPF at 10.0 and 25.0 μM caused 70-80% and 100% mortality in embryos after 96 h exposure, whereas embryos treated with 10.0 and 100.0 μM DZN showed 30-40% and 70-80% lethality. CPF at 10.0 μM significantly decreased cumulative hatching rate, whereas hatching rate was significantly reduced in embryos treated with 100.0 μM DZN. Spinal lordosis was primarily observed in larvae exposed to 1.0 and 10.0 μM CPF, whereas pericardial edema was mainly detected with 10.0 and 100.0 μM DZN exposure. Embryo exposed to 1.0, 10.0 and 25.0 μM CPF exhibited no mitochondrial dysfunction; exposure to 100.0 μM DZN significantly inhibited mitochondrial bioenergetics. To determine if CPF and DZN affected larval activity, dark photokinesis response was assessed in larvae following 7 days exposure to 0.1 and 1.0 μM CPF, as well as to 0.1 1.0, and 10.0 μM DZN. Larvae exposed to 1.0 μM CPF showed hypoactivity, whereas the activity in the dark was not overtly changed in larvae exposed to DZN. In summary, CPF showed higher developmental toxicity compared to DZN. Moreover, based on the types of morphological deformities noted, as well as differences in locomotor activity, we conclude that OPs have unique chemical-specific modes of action that can result in varied biological responses during early development.	1	pesticide
30290855	Use of Magnesium Silicate as a New Type of Adsorbent for Dispersive Solid-Phase Extraction Cleanup of the Quick, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe Method for Pesticides During Analysis of Lager Beer by Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.	Background: Pesticides are applied for pest control during the production of cereal grains used in beer production. Given the risks for consumers, it is important to analyze the pesticide residues. Objective: Quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS)-based methods are very effective, and improvement in the cleanup step is an important approach. Methods: Primary secondary amine (PSA) and magnesium silicate were evaluated for dispersive-solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) cleanup step in extracts provided by the QuEChERS method in combination with GC-tandem MS for the determination of acetamiprid, terburfos, alachlor, ametryn, atrazine, azoxystrobin, carbofuran, carbosulfan, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, difenoconazole, esfenvalerate, flutriafol, thiamethoxam, and parathion-methyl in lager beer. Results: The amount of 50 mg of magnesium silicate was suitable for cleaning up beer extract as an alternative d-SPE material to PSA. The method was validated using beer fortified with pesticides at three concentration levels (0.002, 0.01, and 0.1 μg/mL). Average recoveries ranged from 70 to 123%, with RSDs between 0.3 and 10.5 %. Matrix effects were observed by comparing the slope of matrix-matched standard calibration with that of solvent. The method provided good linearity at the concentration levels of 0.001-2.5 μg/mL. Detection limits ranged from 0.0001 to 0.0007 μg/mL and quantification limits ranged from 0.001 to 0.006 μg/mL. The method was applied to nine beer brands. Conclusions: Results showed that magnesium silicate is an efficient alternative cleanup material to reduce analysis costs while maintaining the method reliability and accuracy. Highlights: Magnesium silicate was effective as adsorbent for d-SPE step in the analysis of pesticides in beer.	1	pesticide
30302567	A needle-like reusable surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrate, and its application to the determination of acetamiprid by combining SERS and thin-layer chromatography.	A micro surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate has been fabricated by electrochemical deposition of dendrite-like gold on carbon fiber needles (Au-CFNs). Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy were used to confirm the presence of the gold nanostructure on the CFNs. This substrate has a Raman scattering enhancement factor as high as 3.3 × 10^7 when using rhodamine 6G as the reporter molecule. The high SERS sensitivity is attributed to the massive hotspots on gold bulges that enhance the local surface plasmon resonance. The Au-CFN substrate was reproduced 10 times after electrochemically wiping off the analytes from the needle-like electrode. The substrate has attractive features such as convenient sampling, low sample dosage, and minimal invasion. It was applied, in combination with thin-layer chromatography, for the determination of acetamiprid on vegetables. The result was more accurate because the sample information of both the surface and the bulk can be obtained at the same time after inserting the tip of this needle substrate into the TLC plate. The limit of detection for acetamiprid is 0.05 μg⋅mL-1 and the linear range is 0.1-10 μg⋅mL-1. Graphical abstract A reusable micro needle-like SERS substrate was fabricated and applied for pesticide residue analysis. The SERS signal of acetamiprid can be acquired on the tip of this micro needle-like Au-CFN substrate. This substrate can be reused for 10 times.	1	pesticide
30308298	Atrazine exposure triggers common carp neutrophil apoptosis via the CYP450s/ROS pathway.	Due to the excessive pursuit of crop yields and the abuse of herbicides, water pollution caused by atrazine (ATR) has become one of the most severe environmental issues threatening the health of fish and aquatic animals. However, no detailed report has been conducted on the mechanisms of ATR immunotoxicity in fish neutrophils. To investigate these mechanism, we exposed peripheral blood neutrophils to 25 μg/ml atrazine for 1, 2, and 3 h. The results showed that ATR induced the mRNA expression of CYPs enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP1C and CYP3A138), which increased the ROS levels, and inhibited the SOD and CAT activities, GSH content and spurred the accumulation of MDA. Additionally, a significant decline in the OXPHOS, Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activities of mitochondria was observed after ATR exposure. Concurrently, ATR activated Caspase3 and induced apoptosis by changing the expression of mitochondrial pathway factors (Bcl-2, BAX, Caspase9) and death receptor pathway major genes (TNF-α, TNFR, Fas, FasL, and Caspase8). The results reported here indicate that the oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage caused by ATR metabolism may play a crucial role in the apoptosis of carp neutrophils, and enrich the immunotoxicological mechanisms of ATR observed in fish.	1	pesticide
30308880	Monitoring of the 17 EU Watch List contaminants of emerging concern in the Ave and the Sousa Rivers.	The occurrence of micropollutants in the environment is a matter of high concern. Some regulations have been published in the last years and a Watch List of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) for European Union monitoring of surface water was launched in the Decision 2015/495, including three estrogens (estrone, E1; 17-β-estradiol, E2; and 17-α-ethinylestradiol, EE2), four pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and the macrolide antibiotics azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin), an anti-oxidant (2,6-ditert-butyl-4-methylphenol, BHT), an UV filter (2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate, EHMC), some pesticides (methiocarb and the neonicotinoids imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and acetamiprid) and two herbicides (oxadiazon and triallate). This study provides the first spatial and seasonal monitoring campaign in the Ave and the Sousa Rivers for the all set of the 17 Watch List CECs (not reported yet for any country), in order to assess their occurrence, distribution, frequency and risk assessment. It also highlights the need of extend the study to other regions and environmental matrices to investigate the occurrence and possible sources of contamination of CECs, aiming to give insights for decision makers to define mitigation strategies for a more sustainable water policy.	1	pesticide
30322427	Comparison of QuEChERS with Traditional Sample Preparation Methods in the Determination of Multiclass Pesticides in Soil.	Background: The increased use of pesticides leads to permanent pollution of soil, and there is a need for continuous monitoring of these agrochemicals in soil. Objective: Three methods for the simultaneous determination of 12 pesticides belonging to eight chemical groups in soil samples were tested and compared based on analytical parameters. Methods: The quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS); traditional solid-liquid extraction (SLE); and Soxhlet extraction were used for soil sample preparation, while detection and quantification of pesticides were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: The tested methods featured good sensitivity, and with the exception for carbofuran (Soxhlet method, LOD = 29 μg/kg), for the rest of the pesticides, the studied LODs were less than 12 μg/kg. Except for simazine and carbofuran, LODs obtained by Soxhlet extraction were lower than values obtained by other two methods, whereas QuEChERS gave lower LODs than the traditional SLE method for all compounds except atrazine and acetochlor. The recoveries obtained applying QuEChERS, traditional SLE, and Soxhlet methods for multiple analyses of soil samples fortified at 10, 75, and 200 μg/kg of each pesticide were in the ranges 54-103, 40-91, and 12-92%, respectively. Except for chlorothalonil, the highest recoveries were obtained by the QuEChERS method. Soxhlet was better than traditional SLE method for chlorothalonil, heptachlor, and aldrin; organophosphorus pesticides (fenitrothion and diazinon) and trifluralin, gave similar recoveries for both methods. All three methods were proven to be repeatable, with RSDs lower than 19%. Conclusions: Although all tested methods showed as satisfactory regarding most analytical parameters, QuEChERS method showed much better results in terms of confidence, indicating that traditional SLE and Soxhlet extraction still need improvements for determination of multiclass pesticides in soil samples.	1	pesticide
30323823	Pesticidal Plant Extracts Improve Yield and Reduce Insect Pests on Legume Crops Without Harming Beneficial Arthropods.	In the fight against arthropod crop pests using plant secondary metabolites, most research has focussed on the identification of bioactive molecules. Several hundred candidate plant species and compounds are now known to have pesticidal properties against a range of arthropod pest species. Despite this growing body of research, few natural products are commercialized for pest management whilst on-farm use of existing botanically-based pesticides remains a small, but growing, component of crop protection practice. Uptake of natural pesticides is at least partly constrained by limited data on the trade-offs of their use on farm. The research presented here assessed the potential trade-offs of using pesticidal plant extracts on legume crop yields and the regulating ecosystem services of natural pests enemies. The application of six established pesticidal plants (Bidens pilosa, Lantana camara, Lippia javanica, Tephrosia vogelii, Tithonia diversifolia, and Vernonia amygdalina) were compared to positive and negative controls for their impact on yields of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) crops and the abundance of key indicator pest and predatory arthropod species. Analysis of field trials showed that pesticidal plant treatments often resulted in crop yields that were comparable to the use of a synthetic pesticide (lambda-cyhalothrin). The best-performing plant species were T. vogelii, T. diversifolia, and L. javanica. The abundance of pests was very low when using the synthetic pesticide, whilst the plant extracts generally had a higher number of pests than the synthetic but lower numbers than observed on the negative controls. Beneficial arthropod numbers were low with synthetic treated crops, whereas the pesticidal plant treatments appeared to have little effect on beneficials when compared to the negative controls. The outcomes of this research suggest that using extracts of pesticidal plants to control pests can be as effective as synthetic insecticides in terms of crop yields while tritrophic effects were reduced, conserving the non-target arthropods that provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and pest regulation. Thus managing crop pests using plant secondary metabolites can be more easily integrated in to agro-ecologically sustainable crop production systems.	1	pesticide
30340276	Occurrence and risk of neonicotinoid insecticides in surface water in a rapidly developing region: Application of polar organic chemical integrative samplers.	Extensive use of neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) worldwide calls for further knowledge on their environmental occurrence and risk. The present study highlighted the need for more research on long-term exposure of NNIs in aquatic environment, which is important but remains elusive. Time weighted average concentrations of five commonly used NNIs in urban waterways of Guangzhou, China were measured using newly developed polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). Acetamiprid (from 18.8 ± 1.9 to 157 ± 31 ng/L; mean ± standard deviation), clothianidin (from 14.8 ± 3.7 to 47.6 ± 10.0 ng/L) and imidacloprid (from 32.9 ± 11.6 to 249 ± 19 ng/L) were detectable in all samples. Thiamethoxam was found at 71.4% of the 21 sampling sites (from not detected to 52.4 ± 9.4 ng/L), while thiacloprid was not detected at any site. Vegetable planting and sewage effluent were the main sources of NNIs in surface water in Guangzhou. Probabilistic environmental exposure distributions were subsequently constructed using the measured concentrations and the exceedances of predicted environmental concentrations of NNI to ecological thresholds were assessed. In Guangzhou, 63.5%, 16.2%, 87.8% and 17.2% of acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, respectively, exceeded an interim chronic threshold of 35 ng/L for NNIs. Further risk assessment and control measures for the use of NNIs are advocated for protecting the integrity of aquatic ecosystems.	1	pesticide
30341475	Spraying pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides can induce outbreaks of Panonychus citri (Trombidiformes: Tetranychidae) in citrus groves.	Panonychus citri (McGregor) (Trombidiformes: Tetranychidae) is one of the main defoliator mites in citrus groves. In Brazil, P. citri was formerly considered a secondary pest, but in recent years, the population levels of this mite have increased in many groves, requiring additional acaricide applications for its control. The population growth of P. citri is associated with the increase in the number of applications of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides to control insect citrus pests. This study assessed the effects of pyrethroid (deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, λ-cyhalothrin) and neonicotinoid (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) insecticides on biological, behavioral and demographic parameters of P. citri. None of the insecticides tested affected larval hatching, but deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, and λ-cyhalothrin reduced the survival of larvae and protonymphs. Deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, and λ-cyhalothrin induced a significant increase in the fecundity of surviving females. Pyrethroids also caused repellency and changed feeding and oviposition preferences. In contrast, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam did not affect the survival of immature stages, but imidacloprid significantly increased fecundity. Imidacloprid and thiamethoxam did not cause any repellent effect or changes in the feeding and oviposition preferences. Based on the demographic parameters, deltamethrin, λ-cyhalothrin, and imidacloprid increased Ro, r, and λ, whereas esfenvalerate and thiamethoxam were similar to the control. Therefore, the use of these insecticides (especially deltamethrin, λ-cyhalothrin, and imidacloprid) requires caution, such as avoiding repeated use of these compounds during the periods of P. citri incidence in citrus groves.	1	pesticide
30350971	Rinsing Tea before Brewing Decreases Pesticide Residues in Tea Infusion.	Rinsing dried tea leaves before brewing is a traditional way of preparing rolled oolong tea in China. This study analyzes how rinsing green, black, and oolong tea before brewing affects the levels of pesticide residues in the tea infusion. Eight representative insecticides of different polarities were tracked, namely, three neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam), two organophosphates (dimethoate and malathion), and three pyrethroids (bifenthrin, β-cypermethrin, and fenvalerate). The results showed that the eight pesticides transferred into the rinse water at rates between 0.2 and 24% after 5, 10, 20, or 30 s. Rinsing tea before brewing reduced the pesticide risk levels by 5-59% in the tea infusion. Five functional components, such as epigallocatechin gallate and caffeine, were reduced by 0-11% in the tea infusion. The results can be used to develop an effective method of rinsing tea before brewing that reduces pesticide exposure risks.	1	pesticide
30352006	Fungicides in red wines produced in South America.	Although recent research has shown that pesticides can remain in wine, there is only legislation regarding the level of pesticides in grapes; no such regulations exist for wine. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the presence of fungicides in 190 wines produced in southern South America, as well as to present a new method for the quantification of dithiocarbamates. The fungicides were analysed by LC-MS/MS and GC/MS using validated methods according to the SANTE recommendations. The results for dithiocarbamates are expressed in mancozeb equivalents and are reported herein for the first time. Of the 190 wines analysed, 40% had residues from at least one fungicide detected above the LOQ, and 16.3% of the wines contained levels of fungicides above the MRL for grapes. The fungicides most commonly found were dithiocarbamates, azoxystrobin, carbendazim, difenoconazole, dimethomorph and cyprodinil. The new method for quantification of dithiocarbamates presented high accuracy (89.8-108.1%) and precision (HorRat values between: 0.5 - 1.1).	1	pesticide
30363107	Cypermethrin resistance and reproductive types in onion thrips, Thrips tabaci (Thysanoptera: Thripidae).	Cypermethrin resistance and reproductive types were examined for T. tabaci strains. Some arrhenotokous and thelytokous strains encoded the sodium channel mutation (T929I) involved in cypermethrin resistance. However, the resistance levels varied to some degree among the strains. A cytochrome P450 inhibitor, piperonyl butoxide, showed different synergistic effects on the strains examined. These results suggest that fundamental and additional levels of cypermethrin resistance in T. tabaci are conferred respectively by reduced sensitivity of the sodium channel and by cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification.	1	pesticide

"We present neonicotinoid concentrations in guttation drops of commonly used maize (Zea mays) cultivars, germinated from seeds coated with active substances (a.s.): i) imidacloprid (IMD), ii) clothianidin (CTN) and iii) thiamethoxam (THM) over two growing seasons. In one variant clothianidin was applied as seed granule. The trial took place at the experimental fields of the Julius Kühn-Institut in Berlin in 2010 and 2011. Data from 2010 are related to a presentation of ""Pesticides in guttation droplets following seed treatment - field studies"" (Schenke et al., 2011) [1] presented at the SETAC North America conference and only some figures were used in the ""Scientific opinion on the science behind the development of a risk assessement of plant protection products on bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp. and solitary bees)"" (EFSA, 2012) [2]. Only parts of the data from 2011 was presented in relation to the ""Exposure of Coccinellidae to guttation droplets on maize seedlings with seed or granule treatment of neonicotinoids"" (Schenke and Heimbach, 2014) [3].

The fungicidal activity of compound 8a against B. cinerea was approximately equal to that of thiabendazole and was twice as active against S. sclerotiorum as was thiabendazole. In addition, compound 9e displayed the most potent inhibitory activity against both fungi and was almost twice as potent as thiabendazole.	1	pesticide
30371799	Identification and Functional Characterization of Two Sigma Glutathione S-Transferase Genes From Bird Cherry-Oat Aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae).	The bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), is an insect pest that persistently attacks wheat crops worldwide. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are important detoxification enzymes that play roles in insecticide resistance. In this study, we identified two GST genes (RpGSTS1 and RpGSTS2) from R. padi. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the genes are associated with the sigma class of insect GSTs. The RpGSTS1 and RpGSTS2 contain nine α-helices and five β-sheets connected by loops, and had 60 and 50% homology with the 3D structure of the Blattella germanica GST5. We tested the toxicity of chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, isoprocarb, sulfoxaflor, and λ-cyhalothrin to R. padi, and found that the toxicity of five insecticides to the aphid varied. The detoxification activity of GSTs and the expression patterns of RpGSTS1 and RpGSTS2 after insecticide treatments were also analyzed. Compared to the control, the GST activity was increased by 23, 18.5, 13, and 11.5% in aphids treated by LC50 concentrations of chlorpyrifos, isoprocarb, imidacloprid, and sulfoxaflor, respectively. Exposure to different chemical insecticides showed different effects on the expression of RpGSTS1 and RpGSTS2. These results indicate that RpGSTS1 and RpGSTS2 have unique biochemical characteristics and may play roles in resistance to insecticides in R. padi.	1	pesticide
30378619	Selective signalling of glyphosate in water using europium luminescence.	A series of four emissive europium complexes has been evaluated for the binding of glyphosate in various aqueous media, including river water and grain extracts. Binding selectivity toward inorganic phosphate and bicarbonate was enhanced by measuring samples at pH 5.9, above the pKa of glyphosate itself. The highest affinity was shown with [Eu·L1], which creates an exocyclic tripicolylamine moiety when one pyridine group dissociates from Eu. Glyphosate was bound selectively over dihydrogenphosphate, glycinate, aminomethylphosphonate and the related herbicide glufosinate. The complex was used to measure glyphosate over the range 5 to 50 μM, in river water and grain extracts.	1	pesticide
30396141	Lambda-cyhalothrin affects swimming activity and physiological responses of Daphnia magna.	λ-cyhalotrin is a pyrethroid pesticide used for protection of crops against various insect pests. Knowledge on behavioural and physiological responses of non-target organisms such as cladocerans is very limited. Daphnia is a sensitive organism commonly used in determination of ecotoxicological risk for various substances introduced to aquatic environment, however the main experimental endpoints used such as mortality or immobilisation may not be sufficient to evaluate subtle alterations in zooplankton. The aim of the present study was to evaluate swimming behaviour and physiological parameters of Daphnia magna exposed to λ-cyhalothrin (Karate Zeon 050 CS) at concentrations of 0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 μg L-1 for 2, 24 and 48 h. The results showed that λ-cyhalothrin affected D. magna swimming behaviour inducing a concentration-dependent inhibition of swimming track density, speed and turning ability. Depression of physiological parameters such as heart rate and thoracic limb activity was also noted. The results suggest that in natural conditions swimming behaviour and physiological endpoints of D. magna may be disturbed by environmental concentrations of λ-cyhalothrin leading to ecological consequences.	1	pesticide
30397935	An investigation of the molecular and biochemical basis underlying chlorantraniliprole-resistant Drosophila strains and their cross-resistance to other insecticides.	Chlorantraniliprole is an anthranilic diamide insecticide that binds to the insect ryanodine receptor (RyR) and induces an uncontrolled release of Ca2+ , resulting in paralysis and ultimately death of the target insects. Recently, it was reported that chlorantraniliprole-resistant diamondback moths, Plutella xylostella Linnaeus, have mutations in their RyR. In this study, we developed two different chlorantraniliprole-resistant Drosophila melanogaster strain. The resistance ratio (RR) of the low-concentration chlorantraniliprole-treated resistant (Low-Res) strain was 2.3, while that of the high-concentration chlorantraniliprole-treated resistant (High-Res) strain was 21.3. The LC 50 of the untreated control (Con) strain was 23.8~25.9 ppm, which was significantly higher than that reported for the susceptible diamondback moth (0.03~0.51 ppm). The high LC 50 of the Con may be because the helix S2 amino acid sequence of D. melanogaster RyR ( DmRyR) is identical to the I4790M mutation of the chlorantraniliprole-resistant diamondback moths, resulting in a lower binding affinity of DmRyR for chlorantraniliprole. Among the tested detoxification enzymes, the activity of esterase was significantly increased in the two Res strains, but glutathione S-transferases and acetylcholinesterase were significantly decreased in the two Res strains. The cross-resistance of the High-Res strain to other insecticides with different modes of actions (MoAs) revealed that the RRs of the neuronal acetylcholine receptor allosteric and competitive modulators were significantly increased, while those of the Na 2+ channel modulators were significantly reduced. Our studies showed that RRs against the same insecticide vary with the treatment concentration, and that RRs against other insecticides with different MoAs can be altered.	1	pesticide
30408860	Neonicotinoid insecticide mixtures: Evaluation of laboratory-based toxicity predictions under semi-controlled field conditions.	Neonicotinoid insecticide mixtures are frequently detected in aquatic environments in agricultural regions. Recent laboratory studies have indicated that neonicotinoid mixtures can elicit greater-than-additive toxicity in sensitive aquatic insects (e.g. Chironomus dilutus). However, this has yet to be validated under field conditions. In this study, we compared the chronic (28- and 56-day) toxicity of three neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam) and their mixtures to natural aquatic insect communities. Using experimental in-situ enclosures (limnocorrals), we exposed wetland insects to single-compounds and binary mixtures at equitoxic concentrations (1 toxic unit under the principle of Concentration Addition). We assessed the composition of all emerged insect taxa and the cumulative Chironomidae emergence and biomass over time. In treated limnocorrals, there were subtle shifts in community composition, with greater mean proportions of emergent Trichoptera and Odonata. Cumulative emergence and biomass increased over time and there was a significant interaction between time and treatment. At 28 days, cumulative Chironomidae emergence and biomass were not significantly different between neonicotinoid treatments and controls. However, cumulative emergence in the imidacloprid, clothianidin, and clothianidin-thiamethoxam treatments were 42%, 20%, and 44% lower than predicted from applied doses. At 56 days, effects on cumulative emergence and biomass were significant for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and the clothianidin-thiamethoxam mixture. Contrary to laboratory predictions, mixtures were not more toxic than single compounds under semi-controlled field settings. Furthermore, only clothianidin significantly shifted sex-ratios towards female-dominated populations. Results showed that the responses of natural Chironomidae populations to neonicotinoids and their mixtures cannot be adequately predicted from laboratory-derived single-species models, and although occasional overdosing may have influenced the magnitude of effects, reductions in Chironomidae emergence and biomass can occur at average neonicotinoid concentrations below some current water quality guidelines. Therefore, neonicotinoid guidelines should be revised to ensure that Chironomidae and other sensitive aquatic insects inhabiting agricultural wetlands are adequately protected.	1	pesticide
30419380	Where has the pollution gone? A survey of organic contaminants in Ho Chi Minh city / Saigon River (Vietnam) bed sediments.	A wide range of persistent organic chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some insecticides, as well as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and some perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were analyzed in 17 bed sediments collected along the Saigon River and at adjacent canal mouths from upstream to downstream in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam). Concentrations were rather low for PAHs, as well as for legacy PCBs and dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane and metabolites (DDTs), or below detection limits for several PFASs and all PBDEs measured. Several insecticides (chlorpyrifos-ethyl, and the pyrethroids cypermethrin and λ-cyhalothrin) displayed rather high concentrations at a few sites within the city. There was no distinct upstream - downstream trend for PAHs, (DDTs) or PCBs. Although adjacent canal sediments tended to be more contaminated than Saigon River sediments, the differences were not significant. Emissions are almost certainly substantial for PAHs, and probably also for other contaminants such as PBDEs and some PFASs. During the dry season, contaminants are presumably stored in the city, either in canals or on urban surfaces. Heavy rainfall during the monsoon period carries away contaminated particle flows into the canals and then the Saigon River. The strong tidal influence in the river channel hinders the accumulation of contaminated particles. Contaminated deposits should accordingly be investigated further downstream in depositional environments, such as the mangrove.	1	pesticide
30439641	A novel optical sensor based on carbon dots embedded molecularly imprinted silica for selective acetamiprid detection.	A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) on silane-doped carbon dots (Si-CDs) has been synthesized as a novel optical sensor for selective detection of acetamiprid (ACT). Highly fluorescence Si-CDs have been first prepared by hydrothermal method. Subsequently, MIP has been formed on the surface of Si-CDs (MIP@Si-CDs) by a sol-gel process. The properties and structure of the Si-CDs and MIP@Si-CD nanocomposites have been characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques. Various parameters, which affect the optical signal, have been optimized. The fluorescence signal of MIP@Si-CDs showed linear response with ACT concentration in the 7-107 nM range with a detection limit of 2 nM and a precision of 2.7% and 3.3% for five replicate detections of 17 and 33 nM ACT under optimal conditions. In addition, the sensor has been satisfactorily utilized for the detection of ACT content in real samples.	1	pesticide
30445137	Dissipation behavior and dietary risk assessment of lambda-cyhalothrin, thiamethoxam and its metabolite clothianidin in apple after open field application.	The dissipation dynamics and residue amounts of lambda-cyhalothrin, thiamethoxam and clothianidin in apple were investigated by using rapid resolution liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (RRLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The developed method performed satisfactory recoveries of 88%-105% and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.01 mg kg-1. The suspension concentrate (SC) formulation of lambda-cyhalothrin and thiamethoxam was applied on apple field in accordance with good agricultural practice (GAP). The half-lives of two pesticides ranged from 7.01 d to 17.3 d and the terminal residues were <0.01-0.21 mg kg-1. Based on the Chinese dietary pattern, the dietary risk of lambda-cyhalothrin and total thiamethoxam were predicted by comparing intake amounts with the toxicological data, namely acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acute reference dose (ARfD). The chronic and acute risk quotients were 0.1080-0.4463 and 0.0008-0.2005, respectively, which showed negligible risk for general consumers. The pre-harvest interval (PHI) of 21 d was suggested for the formulation in compliance with maximum residue limit (MRL) and dietary risk assessment, meanwhile, the MRL of 0.1 mg kg-1 was recommended for thiamethoxam in apple. These results were vital for guiding reasonable usage of two insecticides and for approval of formulation use.	1	pesticide
30447473	An adaptive transgenerational effect of warming but not of pesticide exposure determines how a pesticide and warming interact for antipredator behaviour.	The impact of pesticides on organisms may strongly depend on temperature. While many species will be exposed to pesticides and warming both in the parental and offspring generations, transgenerational effects of pesticides under warming are still poorly studied, particularly for behaviour. We therefore studied the single and combined effects of exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and warming both within and across generations on antipredator behaviour of larvae of the vector mosquito Culex pipiens. Within each generation pesticide exposure and warming reduced the escape diving time, making the larvae more susceptible to predation. Pesticide exposure of the parents did not affect offspring antipredator behaviour. Yet, parental exposure to warming determined how warming and the pesticide interacted in the offspring generation. When parents were reared at 24 °C, warming no longer reduced offspring diving times in the solvent control, suggesting an adaptive transgenerational effect to prepare the offspring to better deal with a higher predation risk under warming. Related to this, the CPF-induced reduction in diving time was stronger at 20 °C than at 24 °C, except in the offspring whose parents had been exposed to 24 °C. This dependency of the widespread interaction between warming and pesticide exposure on an adaptive transgenerational effect of warming is an important finding at the interface of global change ecology and ecotoxicology.	1	pesticide
30454052	Field effectiveness and safety of fluralaner plus moxidectin (Bravecto® Plus) against ticks and fleas: a European randomized, blinded, multicenter field study in naturally-infested client-owned cats.	BACKGROUND: A spot-on formulation containing fluralaner (280 mg/ml) plus moxidectin (14 mg/ml) (Bravecto® Plus) has been developed to provide broad spectrum parasite protection for cats. The effectiveness and safety of this product against ticks and fleas was assessed in a randomized, controlled, 12-week study in client-owned cats in Germany and Spain. METHODS: Eligible households containing at least one cat with at least two fleas and/or two ticks were allocated randomly in a 2:1 ratio to a single treatment with fluralaner plus moxidectin on Day 0, or three 4-weekly treatments with fipronil (Frontline®). Veterinary staff, masked to treatment, completed tick and flea counts on each cat at 14 ± 2 (2 weeks), 28 ± 2 (4 weeks), 56 ± 2 (8 weeks) and 84 ± 2 days (12 weeks) after the initial treatment. RESULTS: In total, 707 cats (257 with ticks) from 332 households (236 with fleas) were included. Ixodes ricinus (78%) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus complex (18%) ticks were the most commonly identified. Tick and flea counts were lower in the fluralaner plus moxidectin group than in the fipronil group throughout the study and the efficacy of fluralaner plus moxidectin exceeded 97 and 98%, respectively. At 12 weeks, 94.1 and 93.3% of cats from the fluralaner plus moxidectin and 92.2 and 60.3% of cats from the fipronil group were free of ticks and fleas, respectively. Fluralaner plus moxidectin was non-inferior to fipronil (P < 0.0001) at all assessments and superior to fipronil at 2 and 8 weeks for the proportion of cats free of ticks (P < 0.0001). Fluralaner plus moxidectin was superior to fipronil for the proportion of both households and cats free of fleas (P < 0.0001). Both products were safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: A single application of fluralaner plus moxidectin spot-on was well tolerated by cats and highly effective for 12 weeks against ticks and fleas. Fluralaner plus moxidectin was non-inferior to fipronil for the proportion of ectoparasite-free and consistently superior to fipronil in controlling fleas.	1	pesticide
30471186	Transcription factor FTZ-F1 and cis-acting elements mediate expression of CYP6BG1 conferring resistance to chlorantraniliprole in Plutella xylostella.	BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification plays an important role in the development of insecticide resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of CYP6BG1 was responsible for permethrin resistance in Plutella xylostella, and our experiments also showed that upregulation of this gene is associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance in P. xylostella. However, the transcriptional regulation involved in the expression of CYP6BG1 remains unknown. To further investigate the regulation of CYP6BG1 expression, the promoters of this gene were cloned and analyzed from one susceptible and four different resistant populations of P. xylostella. RESULTS: First, the promoter region of P. xylostella CYP6BG1 was compared in five populations, and three types of 5'-flanking region were found. Second, the region between -562 and +49 of CYP6BG1 in a field population (TH) of P. xylostella showed the highest promoter activity and could be induced by chlorantraniliprole. Third, the transcriptional factor FTZ-F1, which is an orphan nuclear receptor and binds to the fushi tarazu (ftz) gene, was predicted by the online software Alggen and Jaspar. It was proved to regulate the expression of CYP6BG1 by RNAi. The expression levels of FTZ-F1 and CYP6BG1 could be induced by chlorantraniliprole and were significantly higher in the resistant populations. CONCLUSIONS: These data give a better understanding of the transcriptional regulation of an important insecticide detoxification enzyme gene, and therefore will help in understanding the molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance in P. xylostella. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.	1	pesticide
30478776	Effect of Sub-lethal Doses of Imidacloprid on Learning and Memory Formation of Indigenous Arabian Bee (Apis mellifera jemenitica Ruttner) Adult Foragers.	The indigenous bee race Apis mellifera jemenitica Ruttner of Saudi Arabia can learn and retain memories established by the classical conditioning of proboscis extension response (PER). The insecticide imidacloprid has shown a drastic effect on the olfactory behavior of A. m. jemenitica in the harsh arid climatic conditions of central Saudi Arabia. The oral feeding of single imidacloprid sub-lethal doses (1.0 ng, 0.5 ng, or 0.1 ng) under laboratory conditions significantly impaired associative learning during the 2nd and 3rd conditioning trials compared to control bees (0 ng). The memory tests also revealed significant impairment in memory formation at 1 h, 2 h, and 24 h after conditioning compared to control bees. Even the lowest dose (0.1 ng/bee) can significantly impair the bees' ability to learn and memorize. This impairment effect was dose dependent and increased with increasing doses. The higher dose (1.0 ng) completely impaired the learning but still showed a little memory and reflected the potential recovery of bees from insecticide-induced impairment with the passage of time. To our knowledge, this is the first study in A. m. jemenitica that demonstrated the drastic effect of neonicotinoids on associative learning in indigenous bees. This study further expresses the possible severity of insecticidal exposure to bees in actual field conditions and its effect on the neural functions used in important behavior involved in the foraging of bees.	1	pesticide
30542966	Effects of neonicotinoids on the emergence and composition of chironomids in the Prairie Pothole Region.	The use of neonicotinoid pesticides is widespread throughout agricultural regions, including the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. The occurrence of these pesticides to the abundant adjacent wetlands can result in impacts on nontarget insects, and cascading effects through wetland ecosystems. In the current study, field-based mesocosms were used to investigate the effects of multiple pulses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on the emergence and chironomid community composition, in an effort to simulate episodic rain events to Prairie Pothole Wetlands. Sediments from two local wetlands were placed into the mesocosm tanks and three imidacloprid pulses added, each 1 week apart at nominal concentrations of 0.2, 2.0, and 20 μg/L. Overall, a significant decrease in the emergence of adult chironomids was observed within the 2.0 μg/L and greater concentrations, with the subfamilies Chironominae and Tanypodinae showing a greater sensitivity than the members of the subfamily Orthocladiinae. The chironomid community also had a dose-related response, followed by a recovery of the community composition near the end of the experiment. Our results provide additional evidence that repeated pulses of imidacloprid may have effects on chironomids and other sensitive aquatic insects living within Prairie Pothole Wetlands, resulting in reduced food availability. We stress the need for continued monitoring of US surface waters for neonicotinoid compounds and the continuation of additional experiments looking into the impacts on aquatic communities.	1	pesticide
30583045	Chronic exposure of bumblebees to neonicotinoid imidacloprid suppresses the entire mevalonate pathway and fatty acid synthesis.	Determining the side effects of pesticides on pollinators is an important topic due to the increasing loss of pollinators. We aimed to determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were found in quantities of 0.57 ± 0.22 and 1.95 ± 0.43 ng/g, respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and associated markers. The proteomics results indicate that the consequences of imidacloprid treatment are complex, and the marker changes are associated with metabolic and neurological diseases and olfaction disruption. This study provides important markers and can help to explain the widely held assumptions from biological observations. SIGNIFICANCE: The major finding is that all markers of the mevalonate pathway were substantially downregulated due to the chronic imidacloprid exposure. The disbalance of mevalonate pathway has many important consequences. We suggest the mechanism associated with the novel toxicogenic effect of imidacloprid. The results are helpful to explain that imidacloprid impairs the cognitive functions and possesses the delayed and time cumulative effect.	1	pesticide

30592382	Maternal residential exposure to specific agricultural pesticide active ingredients and birth defects in a 2003-2005 North Carolina birth cohort.	BACKGROUND: Previously we observed elevated odds ratios (ORs) for total pesticide exposure and 10 birth defects: three congenital heart defects and structural defects affecting the gastrointestinal, genitourinary and musculoskeletal systems. This analysis examines association of those defects with exposure to seven commonly applied pesticide active ingredients. METHODS: Cases were live-born singleton infants from the North Carolina Birth Defects Monitoring Program linked to birth records for 2003-2005; noncases served as controls (total n = 304,906). Pesticide active ingredient exposure was assigned using a previously constructed metric based on crops within 500 m of residence, dates of pregnancy, and likely chemical application dates for each pesticide-crop combination. ORs (95% CI) were estimated with logistic regression for categories of exposure compared to unexposed. Models were adjusted for maternal race/ethnicity, age at delivery, education, marital status, and smoking status. RESULTS: Associations varied by birth defect and pesticide combinations. For example, hypospadias was positively associated with exposures to 2,4-D (OR50th to <90th percentile : 1.39 [1.18, 1.64]), mepiquat (OR50th to <90th percentile : 1.10 [0.90, 1.34]), paraquat (OR50th to <90th : 1.14 [0.93, 1.39]), and pendimethalin (OR50th to <90th : 1.21 [1.01, 1.44]), but not S-metolachlor (OR50th to <90th : 1.00 [0.81, 1.22]). Whereas atrial septal defects were positively associated with higher levels of exposure to glyphosate, cyhalothrin, S-metolachlor, mepiquat, and pendimethalin (ORs ranged from 1.22 to 1.35 for 50th to <90th exposures, and 1.72 to 2.09 for >90th exposures); associations with paraquat were null or inconsistent (OR 50th to <90th: 1.05 (0.87, 1.27). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest differing patterns of association for birth defects with residential exposure to seven pesticide active ingredients in North Carolina.	1	pesticide
30597243	A higher efficiency removal of neonicotinoid insecticides by modified cellulose-based complex particle.	Cellulose as an eco-friendly material is extensive in the nature. In this study, modified cellulose-based complex particle (MCCP) was produced through hydrothermal carbonization with methacrylic acid in the stirring and sand bath circumstance. The activated modified carbon-based porous particle (AMCCP) was prepared by treating with potassium hydroxide at high temperature, showing higher efficiency in removing neonicotinoids than MCCP. The AMCCP was fully characterized via scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis showed the prepared AMCCP has smaller aggregated particles with higher surface area than MCCP. The adsorption kinetic and the adsorption isotherm of AMCCP were studied, revealing that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir model correlated with the experimental data better. The maximum adsorption capacity of AMCCP is 142.36 mg/g for acetamiprid. The adsorption process is spontaneous, favorable, and endothermic in nature. After five regeneration time, the adsorption efficiency of the AMCCP is still over 95%.	1	pesticide
30604361	Toxicity and side effects of some insecticides applied in cotton fields on Apis mellifera.	Honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) provides not only bee products of immense value but also render invaluable free service as cross-pollination and propagation of several cultivated and wild species, thereby, maintaining biological diversity. Bee larvae and adults might be killed or suffer various sublethal effects when placed in contact with pollen and nectar contaminated with insecticides. The present work was conducted to investigate the toxicity of seven insecticides on laboratory using oral toxicity test and their side effects on A. mellifera in cotton fields. Results indicated that lambda-cyhalothrin was the most toxic-tested pesticide, recording the lowest LC50 and LC90 values at all tested periods and the lowest LT50 and LT90 at all tested concentrations, followed by abamectin, spinosad, chlorpyrifos, and emamectin benzoate. On the other side, dipel and pyridalyl recording the highest LC50 and LC90 at all tested periods and the highest LT50 and LT90 at all tested concentrations. As for the application of pesticides in cotton fields, the tested pesticides significantly increased the number of dead workers in comparison with control. The tested pesticides significantly decreased bee foraging activities, i.e., number of foraging workers, number of worker collecting nectar, number of worker gathering pollen grains, area of broad workers, and honey bee yields. Dipel and pyridalyl were the most safety pesticides on honey bee workers in laboratory and field, so it could be introduced as a component in IPM programs of cotton pests.	1	pesticide
30611075	Enantioselectivity in endocrine disrupting effects of four cypermethrin enantiomers based on in vitro models.	Cypermethrin (CP) is a kind of chiral pesticides that has been defined as endocrine disrupting chemical. The diversity in bioactivity, toxicity, metabolism, bioaccumulation, and degradation behaviors of CP enantiomers as well as the research deficiency had made the risk assessment of CP enantiomers very complicated. Herein, four CP enantiomers were separated as target chemicals to investigate their enantioselective endocrine disrupting effects. Firstly, dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were adopted to investigate their potential endocrine disrupting effects via various receptors. The expression levels of steroid hormones related genes and hormone secretion levels in H295R cell were measured to verify the results. Results from the reporter gene assay showed that 1R-cis-αS-CP (CP11) exhibited glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and thyroid receptor (TR) antagonistic activity with the RIC20 values of 9.22 × 10-7, 3.33 × 10-7, and 4.47 × 10-7 M, respectively; 1R-trans-αS-CP (CP21) also showed androgen receptor (AR) agonist activity and estrogen receptor (ER) antagonistic activity with the REC20 and RIC20 values were 1.07 × 10-4 M and 4.78 × 10-6 M, respectively. Results of qRT-PCR and hormone measurement also showed that CP11 and CP21 could disturb the expression of steroid hormones related genes and hormone secretion accordingly. Results provided here can help to understand the enantioselective ecological and health risks of CP enantiomers comprehensively and provide constructive guidance for the safe use of chiral pesticides and the invention of green pesticides.	1	pesticide
30612564	The evidence of human exposure to glyphosate: a review.	BACKGROUND: Despite the growing and widespread use of glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide and desiccant, very few studies have evaluated the extent and amount of human exposure. OBJECTIVE: We review documented levels of human exposure among workers in occupational settings and the general population. METHODS: We conducted a review of scientific publications on glyphosate levels in humans; 19 studies were identified, of which five investigated occupational exposure to glyphosate, 11 documented the exposure in general populations, and three reported on both. RESULTS: Eight studies reported urinary levels in 423 occupationally and para-occupationally exposed subjects; 14 studies reported glyphosate levels in various biofluids on 3298 subjects from the general population. Average urinary levels in occupationally exposed subjects varied from 0.26 to 73.5 μg/L; environmental exposure urinary levels ranged from 0.16 to 7.6 μg/L. Only two studies measured temporal trends in exposure, both of which show increasing proportions of individuals with detectable levels of glyphosate in their urine over time. CONCLUSIONS: The current review highlights the paucity of data on glyphosate levels among individuals exposed occupationally, para-occupationally, or environmentally to the herbicide. As such, it is challenging to fully understand the extent of exposure overall and in vulnerable populations such as children. We recommend further work to evaluate exposure across populations and geographic regions, apportion the exposure sources (e.g., occupational, household use, food residues), and understand temporal trends.	1	pesticide
30660036	Ultrasound-assisted emulsification liquid phase microextraction method based on deep eutectic solvent as extraction solvent for determination of five pesticides in traditional Chinese medicine.	A kind of green solvents termed deep eutectic solvent (DES) have been considered alternatives to traditional organic solvents. In this study, a method was developed for determination of five pesticide residues including triadimenol, fipronil, tebuconazole, hexaconazole and diniconazole in five different traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). In the developed method, DES was selected as extraction solvent, ultrasound-assisted emulsification liquid phase microextraction (UA-ELPME) was used for extraction and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a diode array detector (DAD) was used for quantification. In this method, DES was synthesized with choline chloride and phenol at the molar ratio 1:4 using the heating and stirring method. Meanwhile, several important parameters such as volume of DES (650 μL), volume of tetrahydrofuran (THF, 550 μL) and ultrasonic time (30 min) were optimized by using response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite design (CCD). Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection and quantification of method were in the range of 0.02-0.2 μg mL-1 and 0.05-0.5 μg mL-1, respectively. The correlation coefficients (r) of five calibration curves are greater than 0.9996, relative standard deviation (RSD) of precision for this method of five pesticides were lower than 4.7%, and the mean recoveries were in the range of 81.0-92.1%. The present experiment suggests that DESs are efficiently extract solvents in UA-ELPME method for traditional herbal medicines applications.	1	pesticide
30665641	Effect of an eco-friendly o/w emulsion stabilized with amphiphilic sodium alginate derivatives on lambda-cyhalothrin adsorption-desorption on natural soil minerals.	The effects of amphiphilic O/W emulsions, stabilized by the alkyl polyglycoside (APG) or cholesterol-grafted sodium alginate (CSAD)/APG systems, on lambda-cyhalothrin adsorption/desorption mechanisms on natural soil minerals (i.e., illite and kaolinite) were investigated. Sorption and desorption of lambda-cyhalothrin onto soil minerals was studied via batch equilibration to give insight into the adsorption equilibrium, kinetics, and thermodynamics of lambda-cyhalothrin adsorption onto minerals. The results indicate the following: (i) The adsorption processes for the APG system and CSAD/APG system include: rapid adsorption, slow adsorption, and adsorption equilibrium. The adsorption kinetics of pesticide on illite and kaolinite are in accordance with the Ho and McKay model, and the adsorption isotherm conforms to the Freundlich model. In addition, the adsorption processes of pesticide for the two systems on minerals were spontaneous and feasible (ΔG0 < 0), endothermic (ΔH0 > 0), and mainly involved chemical bonding (ΔH0 > 60). (ii) The equilibrium adsorption percentages of the pesticide on illite for the APG system and CSAD/APG system were 42.4% and 64.8%, and the corresponding equilibrium adsorption percentages on kaolinite were 40.8% and 61.8%, respectively. Moreover, the pesticide adsorption rate K2-CSAD/APG was faster than K2-APG, and its adsorption capacity Kf-CSAD/APG was greater than Kf-APG. Meanwhile, the pesticide desorption Kfd in the CSAD/APG system was smaller than that in the APG system. As a result, this eco-friendly O/W emulsion based on amphiphilic sodium alginate derivatives might provide a green pesticide formulation, since it could reduce the amount of lambda-cyhalothrin entering aquatic systems to threaten non-target fish and invertebrate species.	1	pesticide
30666814	Simultaneous photoreduction and Raman spectroscopy of red blood cells to investigate the effects of organophosphate exposure.	Simultaneous photoreduction and Raman spectroscopy with 532 nm laser has been used to study the effects of organophosphate (chlorpyrifos [CPF]) exposure on human red blood cells (RBCs). Since in RBCs, auto-oxidation causes oxidative stress, which, in turn, is balanced by the cellular detoxicants, any possible negative effect of CPF on this balance should results in an increased level of damaged (permanently oxygenated) hemoglobin. Therefore, when 532 nm laser, at a suitable power, was applied to photoreduce the cells, only common oxygenated form of hemoglobin got photoreduced leaving the permanently oxygenated hemoglobin detectable in the Raman spectra simultaneously excited by the same laser. Using the technique effects of CPF to build up oxidative stress on RBCs could be detected at concentrations as low as 10 ppb from a comparison of relative strengths of different Raman bands. Experiments performed using simultaneously exposing the cells, along with CPF, to H2 O2 (oxidative agent) and/or 3-Aminotriazole (inhibitor of anti-oxidant catalase), suggested role of CPF to suppress the cellular anti-oxidant mechanism. Since the high level of damaged hemoglobin produced by the action of CPF (at concentrations >100 ppm) is expected to cause membrane damage, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to identify such damages.Upper panel: Raman spectra of normal, photoreduced CPF exposed and unexposed RBCs. Lower panel: The weak Fe-O2 Raman band for CPF exposed cells shown on the left. The AFM images of unexposed and exposed cells are shown on the right. Scale bar, 2.5 μm.	1	pesticide
30673587	The leucokinin-like peptide receptor from the cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, is localized in the midgut periphery and receptor silencing with validated double-stranded RNAs causes a reproductive fitness cost.	The cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus microplus (Canestrini) (Acari: Ixodidae), is a one-host tick that infests primarily cattle in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. This species transmits deadly cattle pathogens, especially Babesia spp., for which a recombinant vaccine is not available. Therefore, disease control depends on tick vector control. Although R. microplus was eradicated in the USA, tick populations in Mexico and South America have acquired resistance to many of the applied acaricides. Recent acaricide-resistant tick reintroductions detected in the U.S. underscore the need for novel tick control methods. The octopamine and tyramine/octopamine receptors, both G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), are believed to be the main molecular targets of the acaricide amitraz. This provides the proof of principle that investigating tick GPCRs, especially those that are invertebrate-specific, may be a feasible strategy for discovering novel targets and subsequently new anti-tick compounds. The R. microplus leucokinin-like peptide receptor (LKR), also known as the myokinin- or kinin receptor, is such a GPCR. While the receptor was previously characterized in vitro, the function of the leucokinin signaling system in ticks remains unknown. In this work, the LKR was immunolocalized to the periphery of the female midgut and silenced through RNA interference (RNAi) in females. To optimize RNAi experiments, a dual-luciferase system was developed to determine the silencing efficiency of LKR-double stranded RNA (dsRNA) constructs prior to testing those in ticks placed on cattle. This assay identified two effective dsRNAs. Silencing of the LKR with these two validated dsRNA constructs was verified by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) of female tick dissected tissues. Silencing was significant in midguts and carcasses. Silencing caused decreases in weights of egg masses and in the percentages of eggs hatched per egg mass, as well as delays in time to oviposition and egg hatching. A role of the kinin receptor in tick reproduction is apparent.	1	pesticide
30678586	Enhanced Overwintering Survival of Stevia by QoI Fungicides Used for Management of Sclerotium rolfsii.	Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) is a herbaceous perennial under evaluation as a new crop in the southeastern United States. Stem rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii is common in stevia plantings in North Carolina, with symptoms including wilting, root and stem necrosis, and plant death. Fungicide efficacy trials for management of S. rolfsii were conducted over 2 years. Fungicides evaluated included azoxystrobin, flutolanil, and tebuconazole applied at three timings. Azoxystrobin applied to transplants 1 week prior to planting had the lowest area under the disease progress curve values across all trials. Fungicide plots were also used to evaluate overwintering of stevia. End-of-season stand counts were compared with spring emergence counts to quantify overwintering survival. In spring 2015, plots treated with azoxystrobin in 2014 had greater overwintering survival (78%) than other fungicide treatments (38%) and the control (38%). Similar results were obtained at two locations in spring 2016 in plots treated with azoxystrobin or pyraclostrobin in 2015. Successful overwintering of stevia directly impacts the profitability of second- and third-year harvests and enhances the likelihood of long-term establishment of stevia as a viable crop. Future studies will be directed at elucidating the mechanism of the enhanced overwintering survival of plants treated with quinone outside inhibitor fungicides.	1	pesticide
30679494	Effects of Chemical Insecticide Imidacloprid on the Release of C6 Green Leaf Volatiles in Tea Plants (Camellia sinensis).	Chemical insecticides are widely used for pest control worldwide. However, the impact of insecticides on indirect plant defense is seldom reported. Here, using tea plants and the pesticide imidacloprid, effects of chemical insecticides on C6-green leaf volatiles (GLVs) anabolism and release were investigated first time. Compared with the non-treated control plants, the treatment of imidacloprid resulted in the lower release amount of key GLVs: (Z)-3-hexenal, n-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexene-1-ol and (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate. The qPCR analysis revealed a slight higher transcript level of the CsLOX3 gene but a significantly lower transcript level of CsHPL gene. Our results suggest that imidacloprid treatment can have a negative effect on the emission of GLVs due to suppressing the critical GLVs synthesis-related gene, consequently affecting plant indirect defense.	1	pesticide
30682911	Characterization of Resistance to Six Chemical Classes of Site-Specific Fungicides Registered for Gray Mold Control on Strawberry in Spain.	Botrytis cinerea, causal agent of the gray mold disease, is one of the most economically important fungal pathogens of strawberry worldwide. In Spain, as in other parts of the world, management of gray mold control primarily involves the application of fungicides. To determine the fungicide resistance of the Spanish strawberry field population, 367 B. cinerea isolates were examined from one organic and 13 conventional strawberry fields in Huelva (Spain) in 2014 and 2015. The sensitivities of these isolates to six fungicides used for gray mold management in Spain were examined using a spore germination assay based on previously published discriminatory doses. The frequency of resistance to pyraclostrobin, boscalid, cyprodinil, fenhexamid, iprodione, and fludioxonil was 74.6, 64.8, 37.0, 23.7, 14.7, and 0.8%, respectively. The majority of isolates (35.1%) were resistant to three different fungicides classes. Within these isolates, the most prevalent resistance profile (55.8%) was resistance to pyraclostrobin, boscalid, and cyprodinil, followed by the resistance profile (30.2%) of resistance to pyraclostrobin, boscalid, and fenhexamid. One isolate collected in 2015 was resistant to all six fungicide classes. Resistance to boscalid, fenhexamid, iprodione, and pyraclostrobin was found to be caused by amino acid substitutions on target proteins, including H272R/Y in SdhB, F412I/S/V in Erg27, I365 N/S in Bos1, and G143A in Cytb, respectively. The presence of multifungicide resistance phenotypes in B. cinerea isolates from strawberry fields in Spain must be considered in the development of future resistance management practices.	1	pesticide
30682928	Genetic Diversity, Fungicide Sensitivity, and Host Resistance to Ceratocystis fimbriata Infecting Sweetpotato in North Carolina.	Black rot of sweetpotato, caused by Ceratocystis fimbriata, has recently reemerged as a significant threat to sweetpotato production in North Carolina and other states across the United States. This disease has historically been controlled largely through cultural management strategies and, in some cases, fungicide application. The sudden and destructive reemergence of this disease in 2015 created the need for rapidly evaluating disease control strategies. Genetic diversity of current C. fimbriata isolates infecting sweetpotato in North Carolina was assessed using ITS, TEF, and MAT-2 sequences. All 50 tested isolates were confirmed to be of a single mating type, MAT-2, based on PCR amplification. Alignment of ITS, TEF, and MAT-2 sequences revealed all isolates were identical at each locus. Fourteen common sweetpotato cultivars and advanced breeding lines were screened for black rot resistance using two isolates. None of the cultivars were completely resistant to the disease and most were equally susceptible. 'Stokes Purple' and 'Covington' were the least susceptible, but significantly (P < 0.05) differed only from 'Bellevue', the most susceptible cultivar. Sensitivity of 50 C. fimbriata isolates to difenoconazole, fludioxonil, thiabendazole, dicloran, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, fenamidone, and fluazinam was evaluated in vitro. Difenoconazole, thiabendazole, and fluazinam were most effective in reducing mycelia growth. Postharvest fungicide application on black rot-infected roots provided similar results. Low efficacy of dicloran, as well as a range of EC50 values among isolates, suggests potential resistance to this commonly applied fungicide. Results obtained in this study provide current and useful information so that improved recommendations can be made to reduce losses in sweetpotato to black rot.	1	pesticide
30686186	Length of Efficacy for Control of Curly Top in Sugar Beet With Seed and Foliar Insecticides.	Curly top in sugar beet caused by Beet curly top virus (BCTV) is an important yield-limiting disease that can be reduced via neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides. The length of efficacy of these insecticides is poorly understood; therefore, field experiments were conducted with the seed treatment Poncho Beta (clothianidin at 60 g a.i. + beta-cyfluthrin at 8 g a.i. per 100,000 seed) and foliar treatment Asana (esfenvalerate at 55.48 g a.i./ha). A series of four experiments at different locations in the same field were conducted in 2014 and repeated in a neighboring field in 2015, with four treatments (untreated check, Poncho Beta, Asana, and Poncho Beta + Asana) which were arranged in a randomized complete block design with eight replications. To evaluate efficacy, viruliferous (contain BCTV strains) beet leafhoppers were released 8, 9, 10, or 11weeks after planting for each experiment, which corresponded to 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after Asana application. Over both years, in 30 of 32 observation dates for treatments with Poncho Beta and 14 of 16 observation dates for Asana, visual curly top ratings decreased an average of 41 and 24%, respectively, with insecticide treatments compared with the untreated check. Over both years, in eight of eight experiments for treatments with Poncho Beta and six of eight experiments for Asana, root yields increased an average of 39 and 32%, respectively, with treatment compared with the untreated check. Over both years, the Poncho Beta treatments increased estimated recoverable sucrose (ERS) yield by 75% compared with the untreated check for weeks 8 and 9. By week 10, only the Poncho Beta + Asana treatment led to increases in ERS in both years, while the influence of increasing host resistance may have made other treatments more difficult to separate. When considering curly top symptoms, root yield, and ERS among all weeks and years, there was a tendency for the insecticides in the Poncho Beta + Asana treatment to complement each other to improve efficacy.	1	pesticide
30686207	Fungicide and Cultivar Effects on Sudden Death Syndrome and Yield of Soybean.	The effect of fungicides on severity of sudden death syndrome (SDS; caused by Fusarium virguliforme), plant establishment, and soybean yield was evaluated in 12 field experiments conducted in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Ontario in 2013 and 2014. Two soybean cultivars that differed in susceptibility to SDS were planted in fields with a history of SDS or with artificial augmentation of F. virguliforme. Efficacy of seed, in-furrow, and foliar-applied fungicides was assessed. SDS levels varied across locations and years. Fluopyram applied on the seed or in-furrow reduced foliar disease index maximum up to 95% in 5 of the 12 experiments. In three experiments with significant (P < 0.10) treatment effect, fluopyram seed treatment improved yields up to 11% compared with the base seed treatment comprising prothioconazole + penflufen + metalaxyl and clothianidin + Bacillus firmus. Meta-analysis also indicated that the fluopyram seed treatment and in-furrow application were effective at reducing SDS and increasing yield relative to the control; however, the baseline disease influenced the yield and disease response to fungicide treatments. Treatment effect was not significant when disease pressure was low. The concentration of F. virguliforme DNA in soybean roots, measured by a specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, was not different among fungicide treatments in 9 of 10 experiments. Moderately resistant cultivars had less disease than susceptible cultivars, indicating that resistant cultivars in combination with fluopyram seed treatment or in-furrow application could provide effective management of SDS.	1	pesticide
30690381	Emerging contaminants in sediment core from the Iron Gate I Reservoir on the Danube River.	The Iron Gate I Reservoir is the largest impoundment on the Danube River. It retains >50% of the incoming total suspended solids load and the associated organic contaminants. In the sediment core of the Iron Gate I Reservoir we report the presence and fate of four classes of emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, steroids and perfluorinated compounds), predominantly not covered by the EU monitoring programs, but considered as future candidates. Based on contaminant's partitioning behavior in the water/sediment system and the suspected ecotoxicological potential asserted from the literature data, the risk of recorded concentrations for sediment-dwelling organisms was discussed. The high anticipated risk was associated with antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin, and pesticides linuron and carbendazim (banned in the EU, but still approved for use in the investigated area) and malathion. This indicated the need for better control of release of these compounds into the river, and implied their inclusion in future regular monitoring. Higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals and most pesticides and sterols were recorded in the fragment of allochthonous coarser sediment, assumed to have entered the reservoir during a high discharge event. Only one perfluorinated compound was recorded in the upper part of the sediment core. The vertical concentration profiles of pesticides propazine and malathion indicated their uniform source, most likely atmospheric transport and deposition of particles deriving from agricultural land.	1	pesticide
30698848	Agrochemical Mixtures and Amphibians: The Combined Effects of Pesticides and Fertilizer on Stress, Acetylcholinesterase Activity, and Bioaccumulation in a Terrestrial Environment.	Tank mixtures are popular within the agricultural community because they are time- and cost-effective, but field applications leave nontarget organisms at risk of exposure. We explored the effects of a common herbicide (atrazine and alachlor) and fertilizer (urea) tank mixture on juvenile frog corticosterone stress levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and pesticide bioaccumulation. Single agrochemical or tank mixtures were applied to terrestrial microcosms, and then individual Southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephala) juveniles were added to microcosms for an 8-h exposure. Afterward, frogs were transferred to aquatic microcosms for 1 h to monitor corticosterone prior to euthanasia, brain tissues were excised to evaluate AChE, and tissue homogenates were analyzed for pesticide bioconcentation with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Atrazine significantly increased corticosterone in frogs, particularly when combined with alachlor and urea. Atrazine increased AChE and urea decreased AChE, although no interactive effects of chemical combinations were discernible. Relative to their individual treatments, the complete tank mixture with all 3 agrochemicals resulted in 64% greater bioconcentration of atrazine and 54% greater bioconcentration of alachlor in frog tissues. Our results suggest that agrochemical mixtures as well as their active ingredients can lead to altered stress levels and impaired physiological responses in amphibians. An improved understanding of the effects of co-exposure to environmental contaminants in amphibians is important in assessing the ecological risks these compounds pose.

30707840	Exploiting π-π Interactions to Design an Efficient Sorbent for Atrazine Removal from Water.	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes atrazine, a commonly used herbicide, as an endocrine disrupting compound. Excessive use of this agrochemical results in contamination of surface and ground water supplies via agricultural runoff. Efficient removal of atrazine from contaminated water supplies is paramount. Here, the mechanism governing atrazine adsorption in Zr6-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been thoroughly investigated by studying the effects of MOF linkers and topology on atrazine uptake capacity and uptake kinetics. We found that the mesopores of NU-1000 facilitated rapid atrazine uptake saturating in <5 min and that the pyrene-based linkers offered sufficient sites for π-π interactions with atrazine as demonstrated by the near 100% uptake. Without the presence of a pyrene-based linker, NU-1008, a MOF similar to NU-1000 with respect to surface area and pore size, removed <20% of the exposed atrazine. These results suggest that the atrazine uptake capacity demonstrated by NU-1000 stems from the presence of a pyrene core in the MOF linker, affirming that π-π stacking is responsible for driving atrazine adsorption. Furthermore, NU-1000 displays an exceptional atrazine removal capacity through three cycles of adsorption-desorption. Powder X-ray diffraction and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis confirmed the retention of MOF crystallinity and porosity throughout the adsorption-desorption cycles.	1	pesticide
30708725	Resistance to Fluopyram, Fluxapyroxad, and Penthiopyrad in Botrytis cinerea from Strawberry.	Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) constitute a mainstay in management of gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea in strawberry and several other crops. In this study, we investigated the risks of resistance development to three newer SDHIs (i.e., fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad) and their cross-resistance with the previously registered boscalid. We investigated the mutations in the SdhB subunit and evaluated their impact on microbial fitness in field populations of B. cinerea. Amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to SDHIs were detected at three codons of the SdhB subunit (BH272R/Y/L, BP225F, and BN230I) in the succinate dehydrogenase gene of field isolates from Florida. The BH272R, BH272Y, BH272L, BP225F, and BN230I mutations were detected at frequencies of 51.5, 28.0, 0.5, 2.5, and 4%, respectively. Strong cross-resistance patterns were evident between boscalid and fluxapyroxad and penthiopyrad but not with fluopyram, except in BH272L, BP225F, and BN230I mutants. All five mutations conferred moderate to very high resistance to boscalid whereas the BH272Y conferred resistance to fluxapyroxad and penthiopyrad. The BH272L, BN230I, and BP225F mutations conferred high resistance to all four SDHIs tested. Resistance monitoring following the first use of penthiopyrad in strawberry fields in Florida in 2013 suggests potential for quick selection for highly resistant populations and warrants careful use of the newer SDHIs. No evidence of major fitness costs due to the mutations in the SdhB subunit was found, which indicates the potential ability of the mutants to survive and compete with wild-type isolates. Our study suggests high risks for rapid widespread occurrence of B. cinerea populations resistant to the novel SDHIs unless appropriate rotation strategies are implemented immediately upon registration.	1	pesticide
30708752	First Report of QoI-Resistant Downy Mildew (Plasmopara viticola) of Grape (Vitis vinifera cv. Vidal Blanc) in Kentucky.	Fungicides in the quinone outside inhibitor class (QoI, also referred to as strobilurins, FRAC group 11) are relied upon for management of a wide range of diseases, including anthracnose, black rot, downy mildew, and powdery mildew on grape. In June 2012, a grape grower from Anderson County in central Kentucky reported a planting of grapevines (Vitis vinifera cv. Vidal Blanc) with 90% downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) incidence that would not respond to applications of the QoI fungicide Abound 2.08F (22.9% azoxystrobin, Syngenta Crop) or the QoI-containing fungicide Pristine (12.8% pyraclostrobin + 25.2% boscalid, BASF Corporation). Symptoms included yellow irregular lesions or brownish red angular lesions with necrosis on upper sides of leaves. Undersides of leaves contained dense white sporulation. The grower confirmed usage of 4 to 5 applications each of Abound and Pristine fungicides between 2011 and 2012, which exceeded the maximum number of applications allowed per season, as expressed on individual labels. Samples were collected from throughout the 0.4-ha vineyard, and the pathogen was identified as Plasmopara viticola based on morphology of sporangia and sporangiophores (2). Fungicide sensitivity was determined using methods published by Wong and Wilcox (3). Leaves were selected from the 3rd to 6th leaf position from disease-free plants. Nine-millimeter leaf discs were surface disinfested and treated with fungicide concentrations ranging from one-half of the lowest labeled rate to twice the highest label rate (850, 170, 270, and 540 mg/l azoxystrobin and 40, 80, 120, and 240 mg/l pyraclostrobin). Leaf discs were inoculated by placing 10-μl droplets of sporangial suspensions (1 × 104 sporangia per ml) and then incubated at room temperature (22 to 24°C) under fluorescent lights with a 12-h photoperiod (1,3). Dense white fungal growth developed within 10 days; discs treated with water did not develop signs of disease. Fungicide sensitivity was evaluated by determination of the effective concentration (EC50) (3). Leaf discs were examined under a dissecting microscope after 14 days to determine presence of fungal growth; those with visible sporangia and/or sporangiophores were considered diseased. Resulting EC50 concentrations were 420 and 390 mg a.i./l for Abound (azoxystrobin) and Pristine (pyraclostrobin), respectively. This was higher than EC50 ranges of resistant isolates reported by Baudoin et al. (100 and 25 mg/l for azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, respectively) (1). Additionally, ranges were higher than EC50 values of isolates not exposed to QoI fungicides reported by Baudoin et al. (1) and higher (14× and 39×, respectively) than those previously determined from P. viticola from Kentucky that were not exposed to QoI fungicides (Ward, unpublished). These EC50 ranges were also much higher than recommended label application rates, which ranged from 170 to 270 mg a.i./l for Abound and from 80 to 120 mg a.i./l for Pristine. Results indicated that P. viticola from this vineyard became insensitive to the fungicides Abound and Pristine. This will lead to future fungicide failures and increased incidences of downy mildew in vineyards. Although QoI-resistant P. viticola has been reported in Europe and elsewhere in the United States, this is the first documented report of QoI-resistant P. viticola in Kentucky. A complete survey is necessary to determine whether this phenomenon is widespread within the state. References: (1) A. Baudoin et al. Plant Health Progress doi:10.1094/PHP-2008-0211-02-RS, 2008.

30709361	Effectiveness of a 10% imidacloprid/4.5% flumethrin polymer matrix collar in reducing the risk of Bartonella spp. infection in privately owned cats.	BACKGROUND: Bartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae and the rare Bartonella koehlerae are zoonotic pathogens, with cats being regarded as the main reservoir hosts. The spread of the infection among cats occurs mainly via fleas and specific preventive measures need to be implemented. The effectiveness of a 10% imidacloprid/4.5% flumethrin polymer matrix collar (Seresto®, Bayer Animal Health), registered to prevent flea and tick infestations, in reducing the risk of Bartonella spp. infection in privately owned cats, was assessed in a prospective longitudinal study. METHODS: In March-May 2015 [Day 0 (D0)], 204 privately-owned cats from the Aeolian Islands (Sicily) were collared (G1, n = 104) or left as controls (G2, n = 100). The bacteraemia of Bartonella spp. was assessed at enrolment (D0) and study closure (D360) by PCR and DNA sequencing both prior to and after an enrichment step, using Bartonella alpha proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM). RESULTS: A total of 152 cats completed the study with 3 in G1 and 10 in G2 being positive for Bartonella spp. Bartonella henselae genotype I ZF1 (1.35%) and genotype II Fizz/Cal-1 (6.76%) as well as B. clarridgeiae (5.41%) were detected in cats of G2. Bartonella clarridgeiae was the only species detected in G1. Based on the yearly crude incidence of Bartonella spp. infection (i.e. 3.85% in G1 and 13.51% in G2; P = 0.03) the Seresto® collar achieved a preventative efficacy of 71.54%. The incidence of Bartonella spp. infection was more frequent in flea-infested cats (6/33, 18.18%) than in uninfested ones (7/112, 5.88%) (P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Cats living in the Aeolian Islands are exposed to B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. The Seresto® collar provided significant risk reduction against Bartonella spp. infection in outdoor cats under field conditions. Such a preventative tool could be a key contribution for decreasing the risk of Bartonella spp. infection in cats and thus ultimately to humans.	1	pesticide
30713281	Inhibitory effect of grapefruit seed extract (GSE) on avian pathogens.	The inhibitory activities of grapefruit seed extract (GSE) on avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), Salmonella Infantis (SI) and Escherichia coli (EC) were evaluated. Original GSE contained 0.24% benzalkonium chloride (BZC), however, 0.0025% BZC solution could not inactivate bacteria. The activity of diluted GSE (×100, ×500 and ×1,000 with redistilled water) against selected viruses and bacteria was evaluated in this study. The GSE solutions were incubated with the pathogens over a period of time after which the remaining viruses were titrated and the bacterial colonies were counted. In the presence of organic material-5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), the test solutions were sprayed at 1 cm and 30 cm distances to test the efficacy of GSE in a spray form. Furthermore, the efficacy of GSE against bacteria on clothes was tested using non-woven cloth. GSE×100 reduced the viral titer of both AIV and NDV even in 5% FBS condition. IBDV showed high resistance to GSE. GSE×1,000 inactivated both SI and EC within 5 sec, even in the presence of 5% FBS. The disinfectant was able to maintain its efficacy in the spray form at 30 cm distance. GSE was also effective against SI and EC inoculated on fabric. GSE is a potential novel disinfectant against viruses and bacteria, effective even within a short contact time.	1	pesticide
30721827	Pre-diagnostic serum concentrations of organochlorines and risk of acute myeloid leukemia: A nested case-control study in the Norwegian Janus Serum Bank Cohort.	BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies suggest an increased risk of leukemia among individuals occupationally exposed to some organochlorine (OC) compounds. Associations between serum OC pesticide and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels and risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common subtype of acute leukemia in adult populations, have not been evaluated prospectively in the general population. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the risk of AML in relation to pre-diagnostic serum levels of OC pesticides and PCBs in a case-control study nested within the Janus Serum Bank Cohort. METHODS: Janus is a large population-based cohort containing biologic samples collected beginning in the early 1970s from ~318,000 individuals in Norway. Serum levels of 11 OC pesticides or their metabolites and 34 PCB congeners were measured in 56 AML cases and 288 controls. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to evaluate associations between lipid-adjusted serum OC levels and risk of AML. RESULTS: Higher serum levels of total chlordane/heptachlor metabolites were associated with AML risk (3rd vs. 1st tertile odds ratio (OR) = 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.91-5.63; ptrend = 0.11). Significant exposure-response associations were observed for levels of heptachlor epoxide (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.05-7.73; ptrend = 0.02) and dieldrin (3rd vs. 1st tertile OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.07-6.83; ptrend = 0.03). No significant exposure-response associations with AML risk were observed for total DDT or individual isomers and derivatives. Higher serum levels of p,p'-DDT showed a non-significant increase in risk, but the exposure-response became attenuated when co-adjusting for heptachlor epoxide or dieldrin levels. Serum PCB levels were not significantly associated with AML risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that higher serum levels of dieldrin and metabolites derived from chlordane/heptachlor are associated with risk of AML in the general Norwegian population, based on samples collected on average ~17 years before diagnosis. Further research in populations with historically high or recent exposure to DDT is warranted to assess the association with AML risk with body burden of specific DDT isomers and derivatives.	1	pesticide
30729706	Phenotypic and genotypic pyrethroid resistance of Aedes albopictus, with focus on the 2017 chikungunya outbreak in Italy.	BACKGROUND: The highly invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus has become a major health concern in temperate areas due to its role as vector of exotic arboviruses. Pyrethroid insecticides represent the main tools for limiting the circulation of such mosquito-borne viruses. The present work aim to extend previous reports on phenotypic pyrethroid-resistance in European Ae. albopictus, to identify its genetic basis and to monitor the geographical distribution of resistant genotypes, with a particular focus on sites experiencing the 2017 chikungunya outbreak in Italy. RESULTS: Bioassays, performed according to World Health Organization protocols, showed full susceptibility to deltamethrin (concentration = 0.05%) and varying levels of resistance to permethrin (0.75%) and/or α-cypermethrin (0.05%) across Italy, with highest levels in the core of the 2017 chikungunya outbreak. Partial genotyping of the VSSC gene revealed widespread distribution of V1016G mutation and confirmed its association with pyrethroid resistance. CONCLUSION: The results obtained show that the condition for the spread of pyrethroid resistance in Ae. albopictus in Europe exists under strong selective pressure due to intensive insecticide spraying to control exotic arbovirus outbreak or high levels of nuisance. The results draw attention to the need for an evidence-based implementation of mosquito nuisance control, taking insecticide resistance management into consideration. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.	1	pesticide
30743361	Performance of Two Bioherbicide Fungi for Waterhemp and Pigweed Control in Pumpkin and Soybean.	Common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis) and pigweeds (Amaranthus spp.) are troublesome weeds in many cropping systems and have evolved resistance to several herbicides. Field trials to further develop Microsphaeropsis amaranthi and Phomopsis amaranthicola as bioherbicides for control of waterhemp and pigweeds were conducted to test the effectiveness of these organisms in irrigated and nonirrigated pumpkin and soybean plots over 2 years at three locations in western Illinois. The bioherbicide was applied with lecithin and vegetable oil at 187 liters ha-1 in 2008 and 374 liters ha-1 in 2009. Treatments included spore suspensions of M. amaranthi and P. amaranthicola alone, a mixture of both organisms, and sequential treatments of the organisms with halosulfuron-methyl (Sandea Herbicide) in pumpkin or glyphosate (Roundup Original Max Herbicide) in soybean. Bioherbicide effectiveness was estimated at approximately 7 and 14 days after treatment, as disease incidence, disease severity, percent weed control, and weed biomass reduction. Significant reductions in weed biomass occurred in treatments with one or both of the fungal organisms, and potential exists to tank mix M. amaranthi with halosulfuron-methyl. Leaf surface moisture and air temperatures following application may account for inconsistencies in field results between year and locations. These fungal organisms show potential as bioherbicides for weeds in the genus Amaranthus.	1	pesticide
30743538	Optimum Timing of Preplant Applications of Glyphosate to Manage Rhizoctonia Root Rot in Barley.	Rhizoctonia root rot, caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG-8 and R. oryzae, is considered one of the main deterrents for farmers to adopt reduced-tillage systems in the Pacific Northwest. Because of the wide host range of Rhizoctonia spp., herbicide application before planting to control weeds and volunteer plants is the main management strategy for this disease. To determine the effect of timing of glyphosate applications on the severity of Rhizoctonia root rot of barley, field experiments were conducted in 2007, 2008, and 2009 in a field naturally infested with a high level of both R. solani and R. oryzae. Crop volunteer plants and weeds were allowed to grow over the winter and plots were sprayed with glyphosate at 42, 28, 14, 7, and 2 days prior to planting. As the herbicide application interval increased, there were significant increases in shoot length, length of the first true leaf, and number of healthy seminal roots and a decrease in disease severity. Yield and the number of seminal roots did not show a response to herbicide application interval in most years. The activity of R. solani, as measured by toothpick bioassay and real-time polymerase chain reaction, declined over time in all treatments after planting barley. The herbicide application interval required to meet 80 and 90% of the maximum response (asymptote) for all plant and disease measurements ranged from 11 to 27 days and 13 to 37 days, respectively. These times are the minimum herbicide application intervals required to reduce disease severity in the following crop.	1	pesticide
30744896	LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin stimulates reproduction on the moth Mythimna separata (Walker).	Lambda-cyhalothrin has long been recommended as an effective insecticide to control the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Walker), a notorious migratory pest of agricultural plants. Previous researches have suggested that survival, development, and reproduction of insects are influenced by sublethal concentrations of insecticides. However, the effects of sublethal concentrations of lambda-cyhalothrin on M. separata are less known. In this study, we determined the toxicity and effects of LC20 and LC50 concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin on development and reproduction of M. separata. Results indicate that LC20 of lambda-cyhalothrin tends to decrease the life traits of M. separate, with a shortening larvae period of offspring and oviposition period, whereas LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin stimulates daily maximal fecundity and forwards the oviposition peak, suggesting a stimulation of reproduction by LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin. The M. separata population was increased by an LC50 concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin, resulting in a net reproductive rate (R0) and intrinsic rate of increase (rm) significantly higher than that of the control. Transcripts of vitellogenin (MsVg) and vitellogenin receptor (MsVgR) genes were suppressed at day 1 after emergence of moth which developed from the larvae exposed to LC20 and LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin, but were significant induced when the moth begin to lay eggs (day 4), with a more remarkable induction by LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin than those of LC20 of lambda-cyhalothrin. Our results indicate that the observed stimulation of reproduction is therefore the results of up-regulation of MsVg and MsVgR by LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin.	1	pesticide

Target leaf spot caused by Corynespora cassiicola is an economically important foliar disease on cucumber. In recent years, this disease has caused a serious problem on greenhouse-cultivated cucumber in China. In this study, to explore the characteristics and possible causes of heavy occurrence of the disease, we monitored the resistance of C. cassiicola strains from different provinces of China to benzimidazole and quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides. The results from sequence comparison of target genes β-tubulin and Cytb of 619C. cassiicola strains indicate that resistance frequency to benzimidazoles and QoIs is up to 100%. Furtherly, molecular resistance mechanism of C. cassiicola to benzimidazoles and QoIs was analysed. One single mutation E198A and three double mutations E198A&M163I, E198A&F167Y and E198A&F200S were observed in target gene β-tubulin, which confers resistance to benzimidazoles. To our knowledge, this is the first report that double mutations of β-tubulin confer resistance to benzimidazoles in filamentous fungi. Compared with single mutation E198A, three double mutations significantly decreased sensitivity to benzimidazoles. Moreover, significant difference of sensitivity to benzimidazoles was observed among three double mutations. These mutation genotypes of β-tubulin have different geographical distribution and the mutation E198A&M163I is prevalent, occupying for 63.94%. In addition, strong cross resistance patterns between carbendazim, benomyl and thiabendazole were observed in C. cassiicola strains conferring different β-tubulin mutations. For QoI resistance, the only mutation G143A of Cytb was detected in tested 619C. cassiicola strains. Strong positive cross resistance was observed when comparing the EC50 values of sensitive and resistant strains of C. cassiicola for six intrinsically different QoIs such as azoxystrobin, fluoxastrobin, pyraclostrobin, fenaminstrobin, picoxystrobin and coumoxystrobin. Taken together, all the results not only provide novel insights into understanding resistance mechanism to benzimidazoles and QoIs in filamentous fungi, but also provide some important references for resistance management of target leaf spot on cucumber.	1	pesticide
30753426	Tracking Pesticide Residues to a Plant Genus Using Palynology in Pollen Trapped from Honey Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) at Ornamental Plant Nurseries.	Worldwide studies have used the technique of pollen trapping, collecting pollen loads from returning honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) foragers, to evaluate the exposure of honey bees to pesticides through pollen and as a biomonitoring tool. Typically, these surveys have found frequent contamination of pollen with multiple pesticides, with most of the estimated risk of acute oral toxicity to honey bees coming from insecticides. In our survey of pesticides in trapped pollen from three commercial ornamental plant nurseries in Connecticut, we found most samples within the range of acute toxicity in a previous state pollen survey, but a few samples at one nursery with unusually high acute oral toxicity. Using visual sorting by color of the pollen pellets collected in two samples from this nursery, followed by pesticide analysis of the sorted pollen and palynology to identify the plant sources of the pollen with the greatest acute toxicity of pesticide residues, we were able to associate pollen from the plant genus Spiraea L. (Rosales: Rosaceae) with extraordinarily high concentrations of thiamethoxam and clothianidin, and also with high concentrations of acephate and its metabolite methamidophos. This study is the first to trace highly toxic pollen collected by honey bees to a single plant genus. This method of tracking high toxicity pollen samples back to potential source plants could identify additional high-risk combinations of pesticide application methods and timing, movement into pollen, and attractiveness to bees that would be difficult to identify through modeling each of the contributing factors.	1	pesticide
30754289	First Report of Crown and Root Rot Caused by Binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-A on Thryptomene saxicola in Italy.	Thryptomene saxicola (Hook.) Schauer is an evergreen shrub native to Western Australia and a member of the Myrtaceae. In Italy, this species was recently introduced as an ornamental plant from abroad. From July of 2008 to September 2009, a new crown and root rot of T. saxicola was observed on several stocks of approximately 20,000 1- to 3-year-old potted plants. Diseased plants were obtained from a commercial nursery in eastern Sicily, Italy. They were propagated from cuttings and grown under drip irrigation. More than 30% of the plants showed disease symptoms. Infected plants were characterized by a lack of vigor. Roots and crowns were partially or completely destroyed, and as a consequence, infected plants were chlorotic and often wilted. Early in the disease development, roots and crowns showed brown lesions. Successively, mature crown lesions turned dark brown. Longitudinal sections of crown tissues revealed a discoloration of the basal stem. Diseased tissues were surface disinfested for 1 min in 1% NaOCl, rinsed in sterile water, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 100 mg/liter of streptomycin sulfate, and then incubated at 25°C. A binucleate Rhizoctonia (BNR) species was consistently isolated from affected tissues of plants. Phytophthora isolates were not recovered from symptomatic tissues plated on BNPRAH (benomyl, nystatin, pentachloronitrobenzene, rifampicin, ampicillin, and hymexazol) selective medium. Fungal colonies were white with floccose, aerial hyphae. Hyphal cells were determined to be binucleate when stained with 1% safranin O and 3% KOH solution (1) and examined at ×400. Anastomosis groups were determined by pairing isolates with five different tester isolates of BNR AG-A on 2% water agar in petri plates (3). Anastomosis was observed with all tester isolates. The rDNA-ITS of one isolate of BNR (DISTEF-TS1) was sequenced (GenBank Accession No. AB514570) (2). The sequence from this isolate exhibited 99% homology with BNR AG-A (GenBank Accession No. AY738628). Pathogenicity tests were conducted on potted, healthy, 1-year-old plants of T. saxicola. Forty plants were inoculated by placing 1/cm2 plugs of PDA from 5-day-old mycelial cultures near the base of the stem. The same number of plants was treated with 1/cm2 PDA plugs as controls. Plants were kept at 25°C and 95% relative humidity on a 12-h fluorescent light/dark regimen. Root and crown rots, identical to those observed in the nursery, appeared 45 days after inoculation, and 80% of the inoculated plants died within 4 months. Control plants remained healthy. Binucleate Rhizoctonia was reisolated from symptomatic tissues, completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the world of BNR causing disease on T. saxicola.

30756096	High malaria transmission sustained by Anopheles gambiae s.l. occurring both indoors and outdoors in the city of Yaoundé, Cameroon.	Background: Malaria remains a major public health problem in Cameroon; however, despite reports on the adaptation of anopheline species to urban habitats, there is still not enough information on malaria transmission pattern in urban settings. In the frame of a larval control trial in the city of Yaoundé, we conducted baseline surveys to assess malaria transmission dynamics in this city. Methods: Adult mosquitoes were collected indoors and outdoors using CDC light traps and human landing catches from March 2017 to March 2018 in 30 districts of Yaoundé, Cameroon. Mosquitoes were sorted by genus and identified to the species level using PCR. The TaqMan method and ELISA were used to determine mosquito infection status to Plasmodium. Bioassays were conducted to assess female Anopheles gambiae susceptibility to insecticides. Results: A total of 218,991 mosquitoes were collected. The main malaria vectors were An. gambiae s.l. (n=6154) and An. funestus s.l. (n=229). Of the 1476 An. gambiae s.l. processed by PCR, 92.19% were An. coluzzii and 7.81% An. gambiae. An. funestus s.l. was composed of 93.01% (173/186) An. funestus and 4.84% (13/186) An. leesoni. The average biting rate of anopheline was significantly high outdoor than indoor (P=0.013). Seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and biting rate was recorded. The infection rate by Plasmodium falciparum was 2.13% (104/4893 mosquitoes processed). The annual entomological inoculation rate was found to vary from 0 to 92 infective bites/man/year (ib/m/y). Malaria transmission risk was high outdoor (66.65 ib/m/y) compared to indoor (31.14 ib/m/y). An. gambiae s.l. was found highly resistant to DDT, permethrin and deltamethrin. High prevalence of the West Africa kdr allele 1014F was recorded and this was not found to influence An. gambiae s.l. infection status.   Conclusion: The study suggests high malaria transmission occurring in the city of Yaoundé and call for immediate actions to improve control strategies.	1	pesticide
30764445	Identification of Phytophthora cryptogea as the Cause of Rapid Decline of Petunia (Petunia × hybrida) in Chile.	Phytophthora cryptogea was consistently isolated from diseased tissue taken from the crown and necrotic roots of grandiflora type petunia (Petunia × hybrida) that were collected in gardens in five public parks in Santiago, Chile in 2004 and 2005. Symptoms included leaf wilting and foliar chlorosis, followed by partial necrosis, and extensive dark-brown to reddish cankers in the crown. Disease incidence was over 50% and infected plants died within 7 to 10 days after transplanting. This pathogen was identified on the basis of colony morphology, morphological characterization of the sexual and asexual reproductive structures, and temperature range. The identification of Phytophthora cryptogea was further corroborated by the internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis (GenBank accession number EF093534). Isolates of P. cryptogea were pathogenic on 10-week-old white grandiflora petunia plants that were inoculated on the roots or on the crown using mycelium fragments, or via soil inoculation using zoospores. A rapid decline was observed after soil inoculations with zoospores. Root fresh weight decreased significantly and the root rot index and severity of foliage symptoms increased significantly (P ≤ 0.05), relative to noninoculated plants after 14 days of incubation. Two isolates (Ph-1 and Ph-2) were pathogenic on bell pepper and one isolate (Ph-1) was pathogenic on tomato after root inoculation. Two isolates (Ph-2 and Ph-3) were pathogenic on the fruit of avocado, bell pepper, cherry tomato, cucumber, kiwifruit, lemon, pear, pepino, and potato tubers, demonstrating the pathogen's ability to cause postharvest infection of fruit of a wide range of host plants. The efficacy of mefenoxam at 0.1 mg/ml mixed with either chlorothalonil at 1.0 mg/ml or mancozeb at 1.6 mg/ml was demonstrated in this study, whereas chlorothalonil and mancozeb alone did not control disease development. No significant differences were obtained between foliage and soil drench applications. This study demonstrated that P. cryptogea is the cause of the rapid decline found on petunia in Santiago, Chile and, to our knowledge, this is the first report giving a detailed description of a disease caused by P. cryptogea on petunia.	1	pesticide
30765100	Organic diet intervention significantly reduces urinary pesticide levels in U.S. children and adults.	BACKGROUND: Previous diet intervention studies indicate that an organic diet can reduce urinary pesticide metabolite excretion; however, they have largely focused on organophosphate (OP) pesticides. Knowledge gaps exist regarding the impact of an organic diet on exposure to other pesticides, including pyrethroids and neonicotinoids, which are increasing in use in the United States and globally. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of an organic diet intervention on levels of insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides or their metabolites in urine collected from adults and children. METHODS: We collected urine samples from four racially and geographically diverse families in the United States before and after an organic diet intervention (n = 16 participants and a total of 158 urine samples). RESULTS: We observed significant reductions in urinary levels of thirteen pesticide metabolites and parent compounds representing OP, neonicotinoid, and pyrethroid insecticides and the herbicide 2,4-D following the introduction of an organic diet. The greatest reductions were observed for clothianidin (- 82.7%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: - 86.6%, - 77.6%; p < 0.01), malathion dicarboxylic acid (MDA), a metabolite of malathion (- 95.0%; 95% CI: - 97.0%, - 91.8%; p < 0.01), and 3,5,6-trichlor-2-pyridinol (TCPy), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos (- 60.7%; 95% CI: - 69.6%, - 49.2%; p < 0.01). Metabolites or parent compounds of the fungicides boscalid, iprodione, and thiabendazole and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid were not detected among participants in our study. CONCLUSION: An organic diet was associated with significant reductions in urinary excretion of several pesticide metabolites and parent compounds. This study adds to a growing body of literature indicating that an organic diet may reduce exposure to a range of pesticides in children and adults. Additional research is needed to evaluate dietary exposure to neonicotinoids, which are now the most widely used class of insecticides in the world.	1	pesticide
30779201	Insecticide susceptibility status and major detoxifying enzymes activity in Anopheles subpictus from Kasur, Pakistan.	Anopheles subpictus s.l. Grassi (Diptera: Culicidae) is a malaria vector in South Asia, where insecticides are the mainstay for vector control interventions. Information on any variation in metabolic enzyme levels in mosquitoes is helpful with respect to adapting alternative strategies for vector control. The scarce data on the biochemical basis of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors of Pakistan limit the available information for vector control interventions within the country. The insecticide susceptibility status and its biochemical basis against dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (4%), deltamethrin (0.05%) and permethrin (0.75%) in An. subpictus s.l. collected from all Tehsils of district Kasur were evaluated. For this purpose, a World Health Organization susceptibility bioassay was performed followed by the detection of altered metabolic enzyme activity using biochemical assays. Similarly, a significant difference in knock-down effect was observed among field collected and susceptible strain against all insecticides 24 h post exposure. The overall mean mortality rates of DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin were 27.86% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 29.65-26.06], 44.89% (95% CI = 46.23-43.54) and 78.82% (95% CI = 80.16-77.47), respectively. The biochemical assays revealed an elevated level of metabolic enzymes in the field population. The results provide evidence of resistance against organochlorine and pyrethroid groups in a field population of An. subpictus s.l. from district Kasur mediated by multiple metabolic mechanisms, including acetylcholinesterases, esterases, cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferases.	1	pesticide
30780513	Resistance to Boscalid Fungicide in Alternaria alternata Isolates from Pistachio in California.	Boscalid is a new carboxamide fungicide recently introduced in a mixture with pyraclostrobin in the product Pristine for the control of Alternaria late blight of pistachio. In all, 108 isolates of Alternaria alternata were collected from pistachio orchards with (59 isolates) and without (49 isolates) prior exposure to boscalid. The sensitivity to boscalid was determined in conidial germination assays. The majority of isolates from two orchards without a prior history of boscalid usage had effective fungicide concentration to inhibit 50% of spore germination (EC50) values ranging from 0.089 to 3.435 μg/ml, and the mean EC50 was 1.515 μg/ml. Out of 59 isolates collected from an orchard with a history of boscalid usage, 52 isolates had EC50 values ranging from 0.055 to 4.222 μg/ml, and the mean EC50 was 1.214 μg/ml. However, in vitro tests for conidial germination and mycelial growth also revealed that seven A. alternata isolates, originating from the orchard exposed to boscalid were highly resistant (EC50 > 100 μg/ml) to this fungicide. Furthermore, in vitro tests showed no significant differences between wild-type and boscalid-resistant mutants in some fitness parameters such as spore germination, hyphal growth, sporulation, or virulence on pistachio leaves. Experiments on the stability of the boscalid-resistant phenotype showed no reduction of the resistance after the mutants were grown on fungicide-free medium. Preventative applications of a commercial formulation of boscalid (Endura) at a concentration which is effective against naturally sensitive isolates failed to control disease caused by the boscalid-resistant isolates in laboratory tests. To our knowledge, this is first report of field isolates of fungi resistant to boscalid.	1	pesticide
30781180	Rain Fastness and Persistence of Fungicides for Control of Alternaria Brown Spot of Citrus.	Field persistence and simulated rain experiments were conducted to determine the residual activity and rain fastness of several fungicides used for the control of Alternaria brown spot of citrus. Fungicidal activity persisted well in simulated rain experiments, despite the high rainfall amounts tested (40 mm in 2004 and 90 mm in 2005). However, most of the fungicides showed a significant reduction of disease control on fruit of 'Fortune' mandarin in the orchard after natural rain in 2004. Fruit growth rate was low and did not appear to play an important role in decline of fungicide residues. Copper products showed longer residual activity on fruit and higher rain fastness than did mancozeb, difenoconazole, iprodione, famoxadone, and pyraclostrobin. Cuprous oxide and copper oxychloride SC provided satisfactory disease control on fruit through 28 days and withstood 71 mm of rainfall in the orchard. A 4-week schedule with copper compounds is proposed for disease control on Fortune fruit during periods of weather favorable for disease development. Respray to replace fungicide deposit seems to be necessary only after heavy or wind-driven rains. With this program, about half of the sprays applied per season for fruit protection could be saved compared with the current schedule in Spain.	1	pesticide
30786589	Cryopreservation of Synchytrium solstitiale In Planta.	The fungus Synchytrium solstitiale is a candidate for use as a biocontrol agent against Centaurea solstitialis. This obligate parasite can be propagated only in planta, which necessitates development of a method for preserving cultures for longer periods of time for routine biological studies and shipment to other laboratories. Normally, sporangia embedded within the plant tissue release zoospores when submersed in water at temperatures above freezing. To examine what chemicals might inhibit zoospore release, infected tissue was exposed to different suspensions of fungicides. Cycloheximide and benomyl completely inhibited zoospore release or immediately induced encystment from tissue stored in these two chemicals, respectively. A few zoospores were released in suspensions of iprodione and propionic acid but were not motile. However, when tissue stored in iprodione or propionic acid was transferred to fresh distilled water, abundant active zoospores were released. Freezing the infected tissue at different temperatures in different cryoprotectants also affected the release of motile zoospores. Infected C. solstitialis tissue was immersed in water, water plus iprodione, methanol, ethylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol, skim milk, trehalose, or sucrose and subjected to different temperatures for various periods of time. Some treatments protected the viability of the fungus for a shorter period of time whereas other treatments completely inhibited release. The best results were obtained when infected tissue was stored at -2°C in 0.5 M sucrose where active zoospores were released after 12 weeks of storage. Overall, results obtained from this study demonstrate a technique for long-term storage of S. solstitiale.	1	pesticide
30805725	Grapevine trunk diseases under thermal and water stresses.	MAIN CONCLUSION: Heat and water stresses, individually or combined, affect both the plant (development, physiology, and production) and the pathogens (growth, morphology, dissemination, distribution, and virulence). The grapevine response to combined abiotic and biotic stresses is complex and cannot be inferred from the response to each single stress. Several factors might impact the response and the recovery of the grapevine, such as the intensity, duration, and timing of the stresses. In the heat/water stress-GTDs-grapevine interaction, the nature of the pathogens, and the host, i.e., the nature of the rootstock, the cultivar and the clone, has a great importance. This review highlights the lack of studies investigating the response to combined stresses, in particular molecular studies, and the misreading of the relationship between rootstock and scion in the relationship GTDs/abiotic stresses. Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are one of the biggest threats to vineyard sustainability in the next 30 years. Although many treatments and practices are used to manage GTDs, there has been an increase in the prevalence of these diseases due to several factors such as vineyard intensification, aging vineyards, or nursery practices. The ban of efficient treatments, i.e., sodium arsenite, carbendazim, and benomyl, in the early 2000s may be partly responsible for the fast spread of these diseases. However, GTD-associated fungi can act as endophytes for several years on, or inside the vine until the appearance of the first symptoms. This prompted several researchers to hypothesise that abiotic conditions, especially thermal and water stresses, were involved in the initiation of GTD symptoms. Unfortunately, the frequency of these abiotic conditions occurring is likely to increase according to the recent consensus scenario of climate change, especially in wine-growing areas. In this article, following a review on the impact of combined thermal and water stresses on grapevine physiology, we will examine (1) how this combination of stresses might influence the lifestyle of GTD pathogens, (2) learnings from grapevine field experiments and modelling aiming at studying biotic and abiotic stresses, and (3) what mechanistic concepts can be used to explain how these stresses might affect the grapevine plant status.	1	pesticide
30812588	Effect of Timing of Fungicide Applications on Development of Rusts on Daylily, Geranium, and Sunflower.	Integrated disease management should provide the most effective means of controlling rusts on ornamental crops over time, and fungicides are an important component of an integrated rust management program. Proper timing of fungicide applications is critical for effective disease management; however, information about application timing is lacking for rusts on ornamental crops. The objective of this study was to determine how fungicides affected rust development on daylily, geranium, and sunflower plants when applied several days before or after inoculation. Five fungicides registered for use against rusts on ornamental crops were evaluated: the strobilurin azoxystrobin; three sterol biosynthesis inhibiting fungicides-myclobutanil, propiconazole, and triadimefon; and the broad spectrum protectant chlorothalonil. All five fungicides significantly reduced lesion development by rust pathogens on daylily, geranium, and sunflower plants when these compounds were applied preventatively up to 15 days before inoculation and infection with a few exceptions (e.g., propiconazole on geranium and triadimefon on sunflower). Curative activity, which resulted from fungicide application after inoculation, was observed for the three rusts with some products (azoxystrobin on all three plants and myclobutanil, propiconazole, and triadimefon on geranium) when applied up to 7 days postinoculation. In general, fungicide efficacy with several of the products decreased as the time from application to inoculation (preventative activity) or inoculation to application (curative activity) increased.	1	pesticide
30818706	Management of Late Leaf Spot of Peanut with Benomyl and Chlorothalonil: A Study in Preserving Fungicide Utility.	Recent registration of sterol biosynthesis inhibitor and strobilurin fungicides for control of early (Cercospora arachidicola) and late (Cercosporidium personatum) leaf spot diseases of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) has renewed interest in the potential for loss of disease control due to fungicide resistance. The objectives of this study were to use the systemic fungicide benomyl, the protectant fungicide chlorothalonil, and late leaf spot of peanut as a model system to compare fungicide application strategies for fungicide resistance management. Field experiments were conducted at Tifton and Plains, GA, in 1995 and 1996 to determine the effects of alternate applications, mixtures, and alternating block applications of chlorothalonil and benomyl compared with full-season applications of two rates of chlorothalonil and two rates of benomyl alone on late leaf spot of peanut and on the proportion of the pathogen population resistant to benomyl following the various regimes. Tank mix combinations of half rates of the two fungicides and alternations of the full rates of the two fungicides provided better (P ≤ 0.05) control of late leaf spot than full-season applications of either rate of benomyl alone, and were comparable to full rates of chlorothalonil alone. Neither tank mixes nor alternating sprays prevented an increase in the relative frequency of benomyl-resistant isolates compared with other treatments in which benomyl was used. Both mixtures and alternate applications of chlorothalonil and benomyl were effective for management of leaf spot in fields where benomyl alone did not provide season-long leaf spot control.	1	pesticide
30832077	Effect of Imidacloprid on Incidence of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus.	Confidor, an imidacloprid insecticide, was used in two applications at four rates (47.6, 71.4, 95.2, and 119 g a.i./ha) for indirectly controlling Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) in field plantings of tomato. This spray regimen was compared with standard applications of cypermethrins at 10- to 15-day intervals throughout the growing season. In three field trials, a combination of integrated pest management (IPM) practices and two applications of Confidor at the two highest rates immediately after planting and 6 weeks later, protected tomato plants against the disease until 12 weeks after sowing. All rates of Confidor reduced disease incidence compared with standard chemical control applied in an integrated strategy, and quantitative efficacy increased with increase of insecticide rate. In the three seasons, the mean incidence of TYLCV 12 weeks after sowing was 42.7% in plots not adopting IPM compared with 15.7% in those that did. Disease incidence was reduced by Confidor treatments to 2.2 to 17%. Confidor-treated plots consistently had higher yields than control plots, and the yields decreased with the decrease in the rate of Confidor application. Confidor offers several advantages over standard applications of cypermethrins to control TYLCV. When applied immediately after planting, its long-lasting systemic activity protected the crop against the disease during early stages of growth. In addition, it reduced the number of sprays and increased tomato yield.	1	pesticide
30832296	Exploring the Insecticidal Potential of Boldo (Peumus boldus) Essential Oil: Toxicity to Pests and Vectors and Non-target Impact on the Microcrustacean Daphnia magna.	Every year Chile exports about 2000 tons of boldo folium (Peumus boldus), which is used around the world as a traditional herbal medicinal product (THMP), mostly to relieve gastrointestinal disorders. This biomass may be a resource for the agrochemical industry to manufacture botanical insecticides. In this regard, the insecticidal potential of boldo has been poorly investigated. In the present work, hydrodistillation of a commercial boldo folium gave 1.5% (w/w) of a yellowish essential oil (boldo essential oil, BEO) containing 1,8-cineole (20.7%), p-cymene (18.5%), limonene (9.1%), ascaridole (9.1%) and β-phellandrene (6.4%) as the main constituents, as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). NMR analysis allowed us to determine that ascaridole was mainly represented by the cis-isomer. BEO was toxic to larvae of the filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus and adults of the housefly Musca domestica, showing LC50/LD50 values of 67.9 mg·L-1 and 98.5 µg·adult-1, respectively. On the other hand, lower insecticidal activity was observed against larvae of the moth pest Spodoptera littoralis (LD50 of 268.9 µg·larva-1). It is worth noting that, when tested at LC90 concentration, BEO was significantly less toxic to aquatic microcrustacean Daphnia magna than the conventional insecticide α-cypermethrin. Finally, in the attempt to explore the BEO mode of action, we tested it for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory properties using the Ellman method, obtaining negligible effects (IC50 = 0.45 mg·mL-1). Taken together, these results gave new insights into the potential of BEO as a future ingredient of botanical insecticides.	1	pesticide
30835785	Comparative Proteomics Analysis Between the Short-Term Stress and Long-Term Adaptation of the Blattella germanica (Blattodea: Blattellidae) in Response to Beta-Cypermethrin.	A proteomic method combining two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry was used to compare the hemolymph expression profiles of a beta-cypermethrin-resistant Blattella germanica L. strain (R) and a susceptible strain (S) after 24 h of beta-cypermethrin induction. The results showed that there were 42 differentially expressed proteins after induction of the R strain: 4 proteins were upregulated and 38 proteins were downregulated. One hundred one hemolymph proteins were differentially expressed after induction of the S strain: 53 proteins were upregulated and 48 proteins were downregulated. The identified proteins were mainly classified into the following categories: energy metabolism proteins such as arginine kinase and triose phosphate isomerase, detoxification-related proteins such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), signal molecule-regulated proteins such as nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and other proteins such as kinetic-related proteins and gene expression-related proteins. Several proteins show significant differences in response to short-term stress and long-term adaptation, and differential expression of these proteins reflects an overall change in cellular structure and metabolism associated with resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. In summary, our research has improved the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of beta-cypermethrin resistance in German cockroaches, which will facilitate the development of rational methods to improve the management of this pest.	1	pesticide
30838426	Actively detached Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm cell susceptibility to benzalkonium chloride and associated resistance mechanism.	The present work aimed at studying physiological properties of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells actively detached from biofilm formed on stainless steel and comparing them with their planktonic counterparts as a function of growth temperature (20 °C and 37 °C). The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa cells to benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was studied. Furthermore, the effect of BAC on the cell membrane integrity and the role of the cell membrane fluidity in the cell-scale-resistance mechanism were investigated. Our results showed that actively detached biofilm cells were more susceptible to BAC treatment than planktonic ones. A greater leakage of intracellular potassium after BAC addition was observed in actively detached biofilm cells, which reflects their membrane vulnerability. The rise of the growth temperature from 20 to 37 °C increased the membrane rigidity of planktonic cells comparatively to their actively detached biofilm ones. Under experimental conditions developed in this work, our data highlighted that actively biofilm-detached and planktonic P. aeruginosa cells have distinguishable phenotypes.	1	pesticide
30841169	Impact of Azoxystrobin, Dimethomorph, Fluazinam, Fosetyl-Al, and Metalaxyl on Growth, Sporulation, and Zoospore Cyst Germination of Three Phytophthora spp.	In vitro activity of azoxystrobin, dimethomorph, and fluazinam on growth, sporulation, and zoospore cyst germination of Phytophthora capsici, P. citrophthora, and P. parasitica was compared to that of fosetyl-Al and metalaxyl. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for)inhibition of mycelial growth of the three pathogens usually were lowest for dimethomorph and (metalaxyl, ranging from <0.1 to 0.38 μg/ml. However, the 90% effective concentration (EC90) levels for dimethomorph always were lower than the other four tested compounds, with values ranging from 0.32 to 1.6 μg/ml. Mycelial growth of P. capsici, P. citrophthora, and P. parasitica was least affected by azoxystrobin and fluazinam, with estimated (EC90) values >3,000 μg/ml. Reduction of sporangium formation by P. capsici, P. citrophthora, and P. parasitica in the presence of dimethomorph at 1 μg/ml was significantly greater than that recorded for the same concentration of azoxystrobin, fluazinam, and fosetyl-Al. For the three species of Phytophthora, zoospore motility was most sensitive to fluazinam (EC50 and EC90 values of <0.001 μg/ml) and (least sensitive to fosetyl-Al, with (EC50 and EC90 values ranging from 299 to 334 and 518 to 680 μg/ml, respectively). Germination of encysted zoospores of P. capsici, P. citrophthora, and P. parasitica was most sensitive to dimethomorph (EC50 and EC90 values ranging from 3.3 to 7.2 and 5.6 to 21 μg/ml, respectively), intermediate in sensitivity to fluazinam (EC50 and EC90 from 18 to 108 and 67 to >1,000 μg/ml, respectively) and metalaxyl (EC50 and EC90 from 32 to 280 and 49 to 529 μg/ml, respectively), and lowest in sensitivity to azoxystrobin and fosetyl-Al (EC50 and EC90 from 256 to >1,000 μg/ml). The activity of azoxystrobin, dimethomorph, and fluazinam on one or more stages of the life cycle of P. capsici, P. citrophthora, and P. parasitica suggests that these compounds potentially could provide Phytophthora spp. disease control comparable to that of the established fungicides fosetyl-Al and metalaxyl.	1	pesticide
30847031	The Effect of Temperature on the Development of Trilocha varians (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) and Control of the Ficus Plant Pest.	Ficus plants are commonly planted as ornamentals along roadsides in Malaysia. In 2010, Ficus plants in Kuala Terengganu were found to be attacked by a moth, identified as Trilocha varians. The larvae of this moth fed on Ficus leaves causing up to 100% defoliation. This study was conducted to determine the life cycle of T. varians under two different environmental temperatures and to control this pest using two different insecticides. Our findings showed that there were significant differences in the time taken for eggs to hatch and larval and pupation period between low and high environmental temperatures. Results also showed that fipronil had lower LT50 and LT95 than malathion. This study provides new information on the life history of T. varians under two different conditions and the efficiency in controlling T. varians larvae using insecticides. The results of this study are important for future management in controlling T. varians population especially in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia.	1	pesticide
30851698	Prenatal exposure to the herbicide 2,4-D is associated with deficits in auditory processing during infancy.	INTRODUCTION: Despite widespread use, many herbicides and fungicides are not well studied for neurological effects. Fetal and infant brains are rapidly developing, yet the effects of early-life exposure to these classes of pesticides on visual and auditory function are unknown. Here we examined the effects of prenatal herbicide and fungicide exposure on infant grating visual acuity (VA) and auditory brainstem response (ABR). METHODS: 9 herbicides and 13 fungicides were measured in umbilical cord blood plasma from a cohort of infants in Fuyang County, China (n = 232). Grating VA and ABR latencies for waves I, III, V were measured at 3 time points: 6 weeks, 9 months, and 18 months. Outcomes included VA score, ABR wave V latency and ABR central conduction time (CCT [wave V- wave I]). Pesticides were analyzed as 3-level ordinal (non-detect [ND]/medium/high), or dichotomous (ND/detect), depending on detection rates. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate relations between pesticides and VA and ABR outcomes. RESULTS: 2,4-dichloroacetic acid (2,4-D), prometryn, simazine, and tetrahydrophthalamide (THPI, a metabolite of captan) were detected in 27%, 81%, 17%, and 16% of samples, respectively. Infants prenatally exposed to 2,4-D had slower auditory response times at 6 weeks. Infants with cord levels of 2,4-D > 1.17 ng/mL had wave V latencies that were 0.12 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.22) ms slower (p = 0.01) and overall CCTs that were 0.15 (95% CI:0.05, 0.25) ms slower (p = 0.003) than infants with non-detectable 2,4-D in their cord blood. No other statistically significant findings were observed for the other herbicides and fungicides or for the grating VA outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to the herbicide 2,4-D was associated with slower auditory signal transmission in early infancy. ABR latencies reflect auditory pathway maturation and longer latencies may indicate delayed auditory development.	1	pesticide
30853007	Quantitation of neonicotinoid insecticides, plus qualitative screening for other xenobiotics, in small-mass avian tissue samples using UHPLC high-resolution mass spectrometry.	We developed and validated a liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analytical method for quantitatively measuring pesticide concentrations in small-body avian tissue samples using homogenized 1-2-d-old chicken carcasses as the test matrix. We quantified the following key insecticides: sulfoxaflor (sulfoximine class) and the neonicotinoids dinotefuran, nitenpyram, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, thiacloprid, clothianidin, and imidacloprid. We used fortified chick carcass samples to validate method accuracy (80-125% recoveries), precision (<20% relative standard deviation), and sensitivity (≤1.2 ppb) for these targeted analytes. This method also uses full-scan, high-resolution MS to screen for the presence of a wide variety of other xenobiotics in bird carcasses. The utility of our screening process was demonstrated by the detection of carbaryl in some samples. This sensitive LC-HRMS analytical method for insecticide detection in a matrix of homogenized carcass is ideal for evaluating small birds for insecticide exposure. This novel whole-carcass method may allow for research studies of small-bodied, free-ranging avian species, and could provide insight regarding their exposure to multiple classes of environmental contaminants.	1	pesticide
30861824	Infection Components of Wild-Type and Mutant Strains of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomene on Northern Jointvetch.	Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomene causes an anthracnose of northern jointvetch, Aeschynomene virginica. Infection components, including lesion number, latent period, lesion expansion rate, and sporulation, were measured in experiments conducted in controlled environments. Two wild-type strains (3-1-3 and CLA 5A), four benomyl-resistant strains (B13, B15, B18 and B21), and four nitrate nonutilizing mutant strains (Nit A, Nit R, Nit L, and Nit T) of the pathogen were tested. Nitrate nonutilizing strains caused significantly fewer lesions on northern jointvetch than did wild-type and benomyl-resistant strains. Latent periods were significantly shorter for the wild-type strain CLA 5A than for most other strains. Lesion expansion rates of all benomyl-resistant strains were significantly slower than those of the wild- type strains. Large variations in sporulation were observed for most strains, and no differences in sporulation were found between wild-type and mutant strains. The usefulness of infection component analysis for the identification of competitiveness of strains of fungal pathogens for biological control of weeds is discussed.	1	pesticide
30868049	Dechlorination of polychlorobiphenyl degradation metabolites by a recombinant glutathione S-transferase from Acidovorax sp. KKS102.	A glutathione S-transferase (GST) with a potential dehalogenation function against various organochlorine substrates was identified from a polychlorobiphenyl (PCB)-degrading organism, Acidovorax sp. KKS102. A homolog of the gene BphK (biphenyl upper pathway K), named BphK-KKS, was cloned, purified and biochemically characterized. Bioinformatic analysis indicated several conserved amino acids that participated in the catalytic activity of the enzyme, and site-directed mutagenesis of these conserved amino acids revealed their importance in the enzyme's catalytic activity. The wild-type and mutant (C10F, K107T and A180P) recombinant proteins displayed wider substrate specificity. The wild-type recombinant GST reacted towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), ethacrynic acid, hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide. The mutated recombinant proteins, however, showed significant variation in specific activities towards the substrates. A combination of a molecular docking study and a chloride ion detection assay showed potential interaction with and a dechlorination function against 2-, 3- and 4-chlorobenzoates (metabolites generated during PCB biodegradation) in addition to some organochlorine pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, endosulfan and permethrin). It was demonstrated that the behavior of the dechlorinating activities varied among the wild-type and mutant recombinant proteins. Kinetic studies (using CDNB and glutathione) showed that the kinetic parameters Km, Vmax, Kcat and Km/Kcat were all affected by the mutations. While C10F and A180P mutants displayed an increase in GST activity and the dechlorination function of the enzyme, the K107T mutant displayed variable results, suggesting a functional role of Lys107 in determining substrate specificity of the enzyme. These results demonstrated that the enzyme should be valuable in the bioremediation of metabolites generated during PCB biodegradation.	1	pesticide
30871639	Susceptibility of wild-caught Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae) sand flies to insecticide after an extended period of exposure in western São Paulo, Brazil.	BACKGROUND: In Brazil, members of the sand fly species complex Lutzomyia longipalpis transmit Leishmania infantum, a protist parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis. Male Lu. longipalpis produce a sex pheromone that is attractive to both females and males. During a cluster randomised trial, to determine the combined effect of synthetic sex-aggregation pheromone and insecticide on Le. infantum transmission Lu. longipalpis had been continuously exposed to insecticide for 30 months. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of continuous exposure to the insecticides used in the trial on the susceptibility of Lu. longipalpis population. METHODS: During the trial the sand flies had been exposed to either lambda-cyhalothrin [pheromone + residual insecticide spray (PI)], deltamethrin [dog collars (DC)] or no insecticide [control (C)], for 30 months (November 2012 to April 2015). The insecticide treatment regime was kept in place for an additional 12 months (May 2015-April 2016) during this susceptibility study. Sand flies collected from the field were exposed to WHO insecticide-impregnated papers cyhalothrin (0.05%), deltamethrin (0.5%) and control (silicone oil) in a modified WHO insecticide exposure trial to determine their susceptibility. RESULTS: We collected 788 Lu. longipalpis using CDC-light traps in 31 municipalities across the three trial arms. Probit analysis showed that the knockdown times (KDTs) of Lu. longipalpis collected from the lambda-cyhalothrin exposed PI-arm [KDT50: 31.1 min, confidence interval (CI): 29.6-32.6 and KDT90: 44.2 min, CI: 42.1-46.7] were longer than the KDTs from the non-insecticide-treated C-arm (KDT50: 26.3 min, CI: 25.1-27.6 and KDT90: 38.2, CI: 36.5-40.2) (no-overlapping 95% CIs). KDTs of Lu. longipalpis collected from the deltamethrin exposed DC-arm had similar values (KDT50: 13.7 min, CI: 10.1-16.2 and KDT90: 26.7 min, CI: 21.8-30.6) to those for the C-arm (KDT50: 13.5 min; CI: 12.2-14.8 and KDT90: 23.2 min, CI: 21.4-25.4) (overlapping CIs). The wild-caught unexposed Lu. longipalpis (C-arm), took approximately twice as long to knock down as laboratory-colonised specimens for both insecticides. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals slight changes in KDT, in sand flies after prolonged exposure to lambda-cyhalothrin in the presence of pheromone. These changes are not considered to have reached the reference levels indicative of resistance in sand flies suggesting that pheromone and insecticide treatment at the level indicated in this study do not constitute a significant risk of increased insecticide resistance. Prolonged exposure to deltamethrin in dog collars did not result in changes to KDT.	1	pesticide
30886154	A neonicotinoid pesticide impairs foraging, but not learning, in free-flying bumblebees.	Neonicotinoids are widely-used pesticides implicated in the decline of bees, known to have sub-lethal effects on bees' foraging and colony performance. One proposed mechanism for these negative effects is impairment to bees' ability to learn floral associations. However, the effects of neonicotinoids on learning performance have largely been addressed using a single protocol, where immobilized bees learn an association based on a single sensory modality. We thus have an incomplete understanding of how these pesticides affect bee learning in more naturalistic foraging scenarios. We carried out the first free-foraging study into the effects of acute exposure of a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bumblebees' (Bombus impatiens) ability to learn associations with visual stimuli. We uncovered dose-dependent detrimental effects on motivation to initiate foraging, amount of nectar collected, and initiation of subsequent foraging bouts. However, we did not find any impairment to bees' ability to learn visual associations. While not precluding the possibility that other forms of learning are impaired, our findings suggest that some of the major effects of acute neonicotinoid exposure on foraging performance may be due to motivational and/or sensory impairments. In light of these findings, we discuss more broadly how pesticide effects on pollinator cognition might be studied.	1	pesticide
30886368	The spread of resistance to imidacloprid is restricted by thermotolerance in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster.	Imidacloprid, the world's most used insecticide, has caused considerable controversy due to harmful effects on non-pest species and increasing evidence showing that insecticides have become the primary selective force in many insect species. The genetic response to insecticides is heterogeneous across populations and environments, leading to more complex patterns of genetic variation than previously thought. This motivated the investigation of imidacloprid resistance at different temperatures in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster originating from four climate extremes replicated across two continents. Population and quantitative genomic analysis, supported by functional tests, have revealed a mixed genetic architecture to resistance involving major genes (Paramyosin and Nicotinic-Acetylcholine Receptor Alpha 3) and polygenes with a major trade-off with thermotolerance. Reduced genetic differentiation at resistance-associated loci indicated enhanced gene flow at these loci. Resistance alleles showed stronger evidence of positive selection in temperate populations compared to tropical populations in which chromosomal inversions In(2 L)t, In(3 R)Mo and In(3 R)Payne harbour susceptibility alleles. Polygenic architecture and ecological factors should be considered when developing sustainable management strategies for both pest and beneficial insects.	1	pesticide
30898333	Occurrence and ecological risk of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and pesticides in typical surface watersheds, China.	To evaluate the occurrence and ecological risk of organic contaminants in aquatic environment in China, a method for simultaneously detecting 130 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and 35 pesticides has been established using solid phase extraction-ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UPLC-MS/MS) method. In the present survey, a total of 122 target compounds (103 PPCPs and 19 pesticides) were detected in seven major watersheds in China, with average concentrations ranged from 0.02 ng/L (sulfamerazine) to 332.75 ng/L (bisphenol A), revealing that PPCPs and pesticides were widely distributed in surface water of China. Antibiotics and organophosphorus were the most ubiquitously PPCPs and pesticides, respectively; quinolones were the predominant antibiotics, most of which were detected in more than 96% sampling sites, with average concentrations ranged from 2.14 to 309.67 ng/L; six pesticides including isoprocarb, fenobucarb, acetamiprid, imidacloprid, acetochlor and bentazone were detected in more than 80% sampling sites, with average concentrations ranged from 5.62 to 225.93 ng/L; more than half of the non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals were hormones; and diethyltoluamide (DEET) was predominant personal care products; The risk assessment showed that each watershed was at potential medium ecological risk based on their mean concentration (RQTotal > 1), and pesticides were the main compounds arising risks.	1	pesticide
30898542	Mutations in Rhipicephalus microplus GABA gated chloride channel gene associated with fipronil resistance.	The tropical cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, is one of the most damaging parasites that affects cattle in tropical and subtropical regions in the world. Tick resistance to acaricides is dispersed worldwide and a number of associated mutations in target site genes have been described. Phenylpyrazole (e.g. fipronil) and cyclodiene (e.g. lindane, dieldrin) insecticides both have the same mode of action blocking the GABA-gated chloride channel encoded by the GABA-Cl gene. A conserved mutation, rdl (resistance to dieldrin) is found across a number of arthropods resistant to cyclodienes and phenylpyrazoles. In ticks, the mutation T290 L, was identified in the second transmembrane (TM2) domain of the GABA-gated chloride channel of Australian cattle tick populations that are resistant to dieldrin. Recently, cross-resistance between fipronil and lindane was reported in R. microplus populations obtained from Uruguay and Brazil. The objective of the present study was to identify mutations in the GABA-Cl gene associated with fipronil resistance. Genomic DNA was obtained from engorged females from fipronil-susceptible and resistant populations sampled from Uruguay and Brazil (n = 166). Initially, it was searched the T290 L mutation described in Australia; however, this mutation was not detected in individuals from resistant populations from either country. The sequencing of a fragment of the GABA-Cl gene revealed nucleotide polymorphisms in fipronil- and lindane-resistant ticks in two populations from Uruguay and five from Brazil. Five amino acid substitutions were present in the resistant strains. Two different substitutions were found in an alanine residue (A286S and A286 L) that is homolog to rdl mutations in fipronil-resistant individuals of other arthropod species. Four other amino acid substitutions (S281 T, V317I, T328 A and A329S) were present in some resistant strains, always with the mutation A286S. This is the first documentation of mutations in the GABA-Cl gene associated with fipronil-resistant in R. microplus.	1	pesticide
30901782	Heterogeneous degradation of pesticides by OH radicals in the atmosphere: Influence of humidity and particle type on the kinetics.	Pesticides can be adsorbed on the surface of atmospheric aerosol, depending on their physicochemical properties. They can be degraded by atmospheric oxidants such as OH radicals but the influence of some environmental parameters on the degradation kinetics, especially relative humidity and particle surface type, is not well understood. Heterogeneous degradation by OH radicals of eight commonly used pesticides (i.e., difenoconazole, tetraconazole, cyprodinil, fipronil, oxadiazon, pendimethalin, deltamethrin, and permethrin) adsorbed on hydrophobic and hydrophilic silicas at a relative humidity ranging from 0% to 70% was studied. Under experimental conditions, only cyprodinil, deltamethrin, permethrin, and pendimethalin were degraded by OH radical in atmospheric relevant concentration. Second-order kinetic constants calculated for the pesticides degraded by OH radicals ranged from (1.93 ± 0.61) × 10-13 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 (permethrin, hydrophobic silica, 30% RH) to (4.08 ± 0.27) × 10-12 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 (pendimethalin, hydrophilic silica, 0% RH). Results obtained can contribute to improve the understanding of the atmospheric fate of pesticides and other semi-volatile organic compounds in the particulate phase and they highlight the importance of taking humidity and particle type into account for the determination of pesticides atmospheric half-lives.	1	pesticide
30904688	An ultra-sensitive aptasensor based on carbon nanohorns/gold nanoparticles composites for impedimetric detection of carbendazim at picogram levels.	We reported a carbon nanohorns/gold nanoparticles composites-based impedimetric aptasensor for carbendazim (CBZ) detection in lettuce and orange juice at picogram levels. The increased electron-transfer resistance, resulting from the formation of CBZ-aptamer complex, was recorded by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as the aptasensor response for CBZ. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed aptasensor displayed a linear response for CBZ ranging from 1 to 1000 pg mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.5 pg mL-1. Noteworthy, the as-developed aptasensor displayed the lowest detection limit for CBZ among the previously reported methods. Common pesticides (atrazine, thiamethoxam, etc.) with 100-fold concentration did not interfere the CBZ detection. For CBZ detection in lettuce and orange juice, satisfactory recoveries were obtained with standard addition method. Statistics demonstrated that no significant differences were found between the data provided by standard HPLC-MS reference method and developed aptasensing method in term of accuracy and precision. We believe that the proposed aptasensor possesses a potential application for CBZ monitoring in agricultural product and food.	1	pesticide
30921888	Efficacy of Germicidal Hand Wash Agents Against Transient Bacteria Inoculated onto Hands.	The efficacy of germicidal hand wash agents against transient bacteria ( Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens ) in ground beef rubbed onto hands was determined using a hand rinse sampling technique. The reduction in E. coli and P. fluorescens counts on selective growth media and the change in count on Baird-Parker medium were used to indicate action against transient and resident bacteria, respectively. Most of the agents tested, including 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, iodophor (0.75% available iodine), Irgasan DP 300, para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX) as well as the non-germicidal soap, gave marked reduction in counts of E. coli and P. fluorescens (>90% reduction), even after one 15-s wash. The hand dip treatments with iodophor (25 ppm available iodine), hypochlorite (50 ppm available chlorine) or QAC (930 ppm benzalkonium chloride) were generally less effective than hand wash treatments, especially against P. fluorescens . Iodophor (0.75% available iodine) and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate significantly reduced more E. coli on hands than the other agents.	1	pesticide
30927304	Water-soluble food dye of Allura Red as a tracer to determine the spray deposition of pesticide on target crops.	BACKGROUND: Quantification of spray deposition on a target crop is of vital importance to optimize pesticide application. In traditional determinations of spray deposition, a large amount of organic solvent is used to extract pesticides from the target crops. In this study, a water-soluble food dye of Allura Red was developed as a tracer to determine pesticide spray deposition on a rice target crop. RESULTS: The addition of Allura Red does not obviously alter the physicochemical properties of pesticides (viscosity, density and surface tension) and droplet spectra. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analytical method was developed and validated to determine the deposition amount of Allura Red on rice plants. Method accuracy and precision for Allura Red were found to be satisfactory with recoveries of 96.07% to 107.48%. To validate the method, comparative deposition analyses were carried out using representative systematic and non-systematic pesticides (nitenpyram and chlorothalonil) under the same spraying scenarios using a Potter spray tower. Allura Red and pesticides showed comparable deposition under the same application conditions with ratios from 0.98 to 1.21. A field trial using an unmanned aerial vehicle sprayer further indicated that the deposition rates for Allura Red and nitenpyram on rice seedling were 13.04% and 11.07%, with corresponding relative standard deviation values (n = 5) of 16.39% and 18.79%. CONCLUSION: A laboratory test and field trial confirmed that the developed method of using Allura Red as a tracer for spray deposition assessment is feasible and practicable. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.	1	pesticide
30929354	[Study on the effect of occupational exposure to glyphosate on blood routine].	Objective: To investigate the effect of glyphosate on blood routine of occupational exposure population. Methods: The workers who were occupationally exposed to glyphosate were selected as exposure group, and administrative staffs who were not exposed to glyphosate were selected as control group. Occupational health examination was conducted on all the subjects, and personal monitoring was applied to detect the concentration of glyphosate in the air of workplace. Time weighted average (TWA) concentration was calculated by the result of determination. Statistical methods were employed to compare the difference of blood routine results between the contact group and the control group, as well as between different posts. Results: 178 glyphosate workers were included in the contact group, and 203 non-contact persons were included in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in the equilibrium test between the two groups(P>0.05). The abnormal rate of blood routine in the exposure group and the control group were 70.8% and 69.0%, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, the red blood cell count and platelet distribution width difference (P<0.05) were significant difference. There was no significant difference between different positions (P>0.05). Conclusion: When TWA value is below 9.40 mg/m(3), glyphosate has effect on the results of platelet distribution width and red blood cell count, but has no effect on the abnormal rate of blood routine.	1	pesticide
30948040	Magnetic adsorbent based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles for magnetic solid phase extraction of pyrethroid pesticides in water samples.	Mesoporous KIT-6-magnetite composite (Fe3O4@SiO2@KIT-6) was successfully prepared and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scan electron microscopy, elemental mapping, energy dispersive X-ray spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, Brunauer Emmett Teller analysis and magnetic property analysis. It was then applied as adsorbent for magnetic solid phase extraction of fenpropathrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, S-fenvalerate and bifenthrin from water samples before analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detector. A few factors impacting extraction were studied. The optimal results were acquired by using acetonitrile to eluent the targets adsorbed on 40 mg of Fe3O4@SiO2@KIT-6 adsorbent in 100 mL water samples at a pH of 7 at 25 ℃ within 10 min. The experimental limit of detections of fenpropathrin, cyhalothrin, S-fenvalerate and bifenthrin are 0.01 × 10-3, 0.006 × 10-3, 0.01 × 10-3 and 0.005 × 10-3 mg∙L-1, respectively. Good relative recoveries (86.58-98.80%) and reproducibility values are also obtained. The kinetic experiment shows that the adsorption follows pseudo-second order, while the isotherm experiment follows Langmuir isotherm model. Trace pyrethroid pesticides in water samples can be detected by the developed magnetic solid phase extraction technique followed by high performance liquid chromatography, which is simple, easy, environmental friendly and efficient.	1	pesticide
30950203	Efficacy of reduced rates of chlorantraniliprole seed treatment on insect pests of irrigated drill-seeded rice.	BACKGROUND: For the past decade, insecticidal seed treatment has been the most widely used control tactic against insect pests of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the USA. Seed treatments are used primarily to control the most economically important early-season pest of rice, the rice water weevil (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel). This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of reduced rates of chlorantraniliprole seed treatment against the rice water weevil, fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda J.E. Smith), and sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis F.) under field and laboratory conditions. Concentrations of chlorantraniliprole in plant tissues were determined at vegetative and reproductive developmental stages of rice plants. RESULTS: Chlorantraniliprole seed treatment reduced the densities of rice water weevil larvae relative to non-treated controls even at rates 75% lower than the label rate. Increased mortality of fall armyworm larvae was observed at reduced seed treatment rates relative to a non-treated control. Chlorantraniliprole seed treatment increased the mortality of sugarcane borer larvae at all rates relative to controls and the mortality was consistently higher in larvae that were fed stems from treated plants at the vegetative developmental stage than larvae that were fed stems from plants at the reproductive stage. Concentrations of chlorantraniliprole in plant tissues increased with seed treatment rate and decreased with plant age. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that reduced chlorantraniliprole seed treatment rates can provide adequate control against the rice water weevil, fall armyworm, and sugarcane borer, particularly at early developmental stages of rice plants. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.	1	pesticide
30956433	Effects of glyphosate on soybean metabolism in strains bred for glyphosate-resistance.	To produce high quality, glyphosate-resistant soybeans, we crossed Jinda 73 and glyphosate-resistant RR1 (Roundup Ready First Generation) (RR1) resulting in 34 hybrid strains. To determine the effects of glyphosate on soybean metabolism, we grew the two parents upto the seedling stage, and measured chlorophyll, soluble sugar, malondialdehyde (MDA), relative conductivity and proline. Then, we treated the plants with glyphosate and measured the same factors again. Results showed that the chlorophyll content of Jinda 73 and RR1 decreased after spraying glyphosate. Glyphosate increased the level of soluble sugar, MDA, relative conductivity and proline in Jinda 73, but had no significant effect on RR1. We determined glyphosate resistance of the parents and the 34 hybrid, offspring strains by documenting the growth response in the field after treatment with glyphosate. Results showed that 29 hybrid, offspring strains have complete glyphosate resistance. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) shows that the strains which have complete resistance to glyphosate have imported the CP4 5-enolpyhruvylshikimate-3- phosphate synthase (CP4 EPSPS) gene successfully. We selected three high quality, glyphosate-resistant strains (F7-3, F7-16 and F7-21), which had higher protein and oil levels as compared with Jinda 73.	1	pesticide
30972909	Non-target effects of herbicides on Tetranychus urticae and its predator, Phytoseiulus persimilis: implications for biological control.	BACKGROUND: A key element of conservation biocontrol is identifying and limiting the use of pesticides that have substantial non-target effects on natural enemies to prevent biocontrol disruption. The Phytoseiidae (predatory mites) are one of the most studied natural enemy groups in the field of pesticide non-target effects. Although there is substantial research on the non-target effects of insecticides on arthropod natural enemies, research on herbicide impacts is limited. Natural enemies, including phytoseiids, associate with weeds due to the presence of alternative prey, shelter, or floral resources. Therefore, a whole-systems approach to integrated pest management should integrate weed management with biocontrol. We conducted a study to examine the non-target effects of vegetable herbicides on Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot, and the primary pest that it controls, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Two assays were used to assess the effects of direct application and walking on residues. RESULTS: In both assays, S-metolachlor was highly toxic to P. persimilis (80-90% mortality) and had minimal effect on T. urticae. Dicamba, oxyfluorfen, and napropamide also caused moderate levels of P. persimilis mortality (21-74%). Check mortality of P. persimilis was higher in the direct contact assay (19%) than the residue assay (3%). CONCLUSIONS: Halosulfuron-methyl, flumioxazin, and mesotrione were the most compatible herbicides with biocontrol by P. persimilis, whereas S-metolachlor and napropamide were the least compatible. We also determined that the residue assay may be more useful than direct contact slide-dips for future assessment of herbicide non-target effects. Future efforts should continue to examine the impacts of weed management on natural enemies to better integrate pest management practices. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.	1	pesticide
30981304	Acaricidal efficacy of deltamethrin-zinc oxide nanocomposite on Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus tick.	In the veterinary field, there is a great concern about the issue of acaricides resistance in cattle ticks. A comparative study was designed to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal efficacy of imidacloprid nano-emulsion, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), deltamethrin, deltamethrin-ZnO NPs, and deltamethrin-Ag NPs. In addition, the novel formulations of deltamethrin (deltamethrin-ZnO NPs and deltamethrin-Ag NPs) against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus were also evaluated by in vivo animal efficacy trials. Nanoparticles and their loaded forms, deltamethrin-Ag NPs and deltamethrin-ZnO NPs, were characterized by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrum (FTIR). The adulticidal activity of deltamethrin-ZnO NPs at different concentrations; 2 mL/L, 1 mL/L, 0.5 mL/L and 0.25 mL/L induced a significant (P ≤ 0.05) lethal effect on adult ticks compared to deltamethrin-Ag NPs at the same concentrations. The larvicidal efficacy of deltamethrin-ZnO NPs resulted in a complete larval mortality within 24 h of exposure, while deltamethrin and deltamethrin-Ag NPs exhibited 100% immobility of larvae 48 h post-exposure. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments showed a considerable reduction in the tick's survival after using deltamethrin-ZnO NPs. There was no significant effect of different treatments on liver or kidney function tests at pre- and post-treatment of animals. In conclusion, deltamethrin-ZnO nanocomposite was the most effective adulticide and larvicide against R. (B.) annulatus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for using deltamethrin-ZnO NPs as an acaricide.	1	pesticide
30981933	Widespread occurrence and spatial distribution of glyphosate, atrazine, and neonicotinoids pesticides in the St. Lawrence and tributary rivers.	The occurrence and spatial distribution of selected pesticides were investigated along a 200-km reach of the St. Lawrence River (SLR) and tributaries in Quebec, Canada. Surface water samples (n = 68) were collected in the summer 2017 and analyzed for glyphosate, atrazine (ATZ), 8 systemic insecticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, fipronil, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) and some metabolites. Overall, 99% of the surface water samples were positive to at least one of the targeted pesticides. The most recurrent compounds were glyphosate (detection frequency: 84%), ATZ (82%), thiamethoxam (59%), desethylatrazine (DEA: 47%), and clothianidin (46%). Glyphosate displayed variable levels (4-3,000 ng L-1), with higher concentrations in south tributaries (e.g., Nicolet and Yamaska). In positive samples, the sum of ATZ and DEA varied between 5 and 860 ng L-1, and the sum of 6 priority neonicotinoids between 1.5 and 115 ng L-1. From Repentigny to the Sorel Islands, the spatial distribution of pesticides within the St. Lawrence River was governed by the different upstream sources (i.e., Great Lakes vs. Ottawa River) due to the limited mixing of the different water masses. Cross-sectional patterns revealed higher concentrations of glyphosate and neonicotinoids in the north portions of transects, while the middle and south portions showed higher levels of atrazine. In Lake St. Pierre and further downstream, cross-sections revealed higher levels of the targeted pesticides near the southern portions of the SLR. This may be due to the higher contributions from south shore tributaries impacted by major agricultural areas, compared to north shore tributaries with forest land and less cropland use. Surface water samples were compliant with guidelines for the protection of aquatic life (chronic effects) for glyphosate and atrazine. However, 31% of the samples were found to surpass the guideline value of 8.3 ng L-1 for the sum of six priority neonicotinoids.	1	pesticide
30989013	Molecular Dynamics Insights for Screening the Ability of Polymers to Remove Pesticides from Water.	The use of pesticides in agriculture is known to have environmental impacts, namely it leads to underground and spring water contamination. Thus, it turns out that nowadays general-endeavor towards the sustainability of farmer production requires novel strategies to capture pesticides from water and soils. We propose a methodology based on molecular dynamics simulations to identify polymers that are potentially featured to be applied for pesticide remediation in water and soils. We have employed cymoxanil (CYM), glufosinate ammonium (GLF), imidacloprid (IMI) and mancozeb (MAN) as pesticides, and have tested polymers with different characteristics as removing agents. Specifically, we have investigated oligomers of polypropylene (PP), poly(acrylic acid) protonated (PAAH) and deprotonated (PAA), and chitosan protonated (CTH) and deprotonated (CT). It has been found that all oligomers show a certain degree of selectivity concerning the interaction with the tested pesticides.	1	pesticide
30992592	Pyrethroid toxicity in a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig.	A 7-month-old spayed female Vietnamese pot-bellied pig (VPBP) was presented for diffuse muscle fasciculations and seizure-like activity that had started 4 hours before presentation. The pig was stuporous and displayed diffuse involuntary gross motor movement and muscle fasciculations, as well as hypertonicity of all 4 limbs. Hematologic analysis revealed hemoconcentration, severe hyperlactatemia, moderate metabolic acidosis, increased creatine kinase and gamma-glutamyltransferase. The pig failed to respond to diazepam, propofol, methocarbamol, and supportive care, followed by general anesthesia, and was euthanized. Bifenthrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of stomach contents. Pyrethroid insecticide toxicity in VPBP may result in clinical signs similar to those seen in companion animals.	1	pesticide
30995420	Boscalid Resistance in Blumeriella jaapii: Distribution, Effect on Field Efficacy, and Molecular Characterization.	Cherry leaf spot (CLS), caused by the fungus Blumeriella jaapii, is a major disease of tart cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) trees, leading to early defoliation that results in uneven ripening and poor fruit quality in the current season, reduced fruit set in the following season, and increased potential for winter injury and tree death. Pristine (BASF Corporation, Research Triangle Park, NC), a commonly used fungicide for CLS management in Michigan, is a premix of boscalid, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, and pyraclostrobin, a quinone outside inhibitor. Reduced efficacy of Pristine for CLS control was observed in field trials and commercial orchards and highlights the importance of fungicide resistance monitoring. A total of 1,189 isolates from 31 commercial orchards in Michigan, 111 isolates from nontreated trees (four locations in Michigan and two locations in Ohio), and 133 isolates from a research orchard were collected during 2010, 2011, and 2012 and assayed on boscalid-amended media at concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 μg ml-1. Because of the very slow growth rate of B. jaapii in culture, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of boscalid as opposed to the effective concentration that inhibits mycelial growth to 50% of the control. Isolates from nontreated trees had MIC values ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 μg ml-1; the MIC of isolates from commercial orchards ranged from 0.1 to >25 μg ml-1, and isolates from the research orchard ranged from 2.5 to >25 μg ml-1. Isolates with MIC values ≥25 μg ml-1 were considered boscalid resistant and comprised 0% of the nontreated isolates, 30.4% of the commercial isolates, and 42.1% of the research orchard isolates. Sequencing of the sdhB gene of resistant isolates led to the detection of the amino acid mutation H260R, which is known to confer boscalid resistance in other phytopathogenic fungi. Our results indicate that the occurrence of the H260R mutation in Michigan populations of B. jaapii is correlated with the reduction in sensitivity to boscalid observed in commercial orchards.	1	pesticide
74508	Epidemic malathion poisoning in Pakistan malaria workers.	In 1976, epidemic organophosphate insecticide poisoning due to malathion occurred among 7500 field workers in the Pakistan malaria control programme. In July, the peak month of the epidemic, it is estimated that there were about 2800 cases. In field studies low red-cell cholinesterase activities were associated with the signs and symptoms of organophosphate insecticide intoxication. Toxicity was seen with 3 different formulations of the insecticide and was greatest with the products containing increased amounts of isomalathion, a toxic malathion degradation product. Poor work practices, which had developed when D.D.T. was the primary insecticide for malaria control, resulted in excessive skin contact with and percutaneous absorption of the pesticide. Airborne malathion concentrations were very low. Implementation of good work practices and proscription of use of the 2 pesticide formulations most contaminated with isomalathion halted the epidemic in September. An extensive training programme and surveillance system for pesticide toxicity preceded 1977 spraying operations.	1	pesticide
75747	Mass spectrometric analyses and characterization of Kepone in environmental and human samples.	A specific portion of our environment has been contaminated with Kepone, or chlordecone. Additionally, some specific human exposures to high concentrations of Kepone have been confirmed. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry involving chemical ionization and high resolution mass spectrometry were used to detect, identify and confirm the presence of Kepone, Kepone photoproducts and a reduction product of Kepone in environmental and human samples. Field desorption, field ionization and electron impact mass spectrometric methods, as well as infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were used to characterize and identify Kepone hydrate and hemiketal in benzene and methanol solutions, respectively.	1	pesticide
79156	Chlordecone intoxication in man. II. Ultrastructure of peripheral nerves and skeletal muscle.	"Tremors, mental changes, opsoclonus, muscle weakness, gait ataxia, incoordination, and slurred speech developed in several employees in a Virginia chemical plant during the summer of 1974. Epidemiologic and clinical studies suggested that the chlorinated insecticide chlordecone (Kepone) was responsible. Severity of symptoms seemed directly related to dose and duration of exposure. Five sural nerve and six muscle biopsy specimens were examined by light microscopy and electronmicroscopy. The sural nerves were also evaluated by computerized morphometry, which showed considerable decrease in the number of unmyelinated fibers and lesser abnormalities of myelinated fibers. Compared with the nerves of the control subjects, those of patients may have had an increase in Reich and Elzholz bodies, and a modest increase in endoneurial collagen. There were occasional ""collagen pockets,"" stacks of Schwann cell cytoplasmic membranes, redundant Schwann cell cytoplasmic folds, and fewer unmyelinated axons. The skeletal muscles contained increased amounts of lipofuscin and lipidlike droplets in subsarcolemmal areas and within intermyofibrillary spaces; the significance of this is unknown. Fiber size variability, type I predominance, and type grouping were present in three cases. All results strongly suggest that chlordecone is a neurotoxic agent predominantly affecting Schwann cells and unmyelinated fibers of peripheral nerves."	1	pesticide

The blood clearances of 14C-carbaryl and colloïdal carbon were studied in Rats with reticuloendothelial system (RES) inhibited or activated, and in control Rats. A correlation was established between the blood clearance kinetics of carbon particles and carbaryl; such data support the concept of the contribution of the RES in the disappearance of carbaryl from the circulation.	1	pesticide
114967	Polychlorinated biphenyls and other organic chemical residues in fish from major watersheds of the United States, 1976.	Composite samples of fish were collected from major United States watersheds in 1976 and analyzed for PCBs and related organic chemicals. PCBs were found in 93 percent of the fish samples; 53 percent of the samples contained more than 5 ppm PCBs, whole fish basis, which is the current tolerance level set by the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Only 14 percent of the samples contained less than the proposed action level of 2 ppm PCBs. PCB concentrations ranged from less than 0.3 ppm to 140 ppm in the composite samples. sigma DDT concentrations ranged from less than 0.05 ppm to 4.53 ppm. Hexachlorobenzene was identified in 19 percent of the samples, and chlordane components were identified in 36 percent of the samples. Chemicals identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry but not quantified include chlorinated benzenes, styrenes, anisoles, phenols, anilines, propanes, and butadienes, as well as mixtures of petroleum hydrocarbons.	1	pesticide
136041	3,4,3',4'-Tetrachloro azoxybenzene and azobenzene: potent inducers of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase.	Two unwanted contaminants, 3,4,3',4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene (TCAOB) and 3,4,3',4'-tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB), formed in the commercial synthesis of 3,4-dichloroaniline or of herbicides made from 3,4-dichloroaniline, were responsible for three outbreaks of acne among chemical workers. TCAOB and TCAB are approximately isosteric to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran, two well-known contaminants that cause acne. All four of these agents are potent inducers of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity and compete for stereospecific binding sites in the hepatic cytosol, which are thought to be the receptor sites for the induction of this enzyme. Among the chlorinated azoxy and azobenzenes, the potency of a congener to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity correlates with its binding affinity for the hepatic cytosol specific binding sites and its capacity to induce acne; this relation between structure and activity parallels that observed for the chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans.	1	pesticide
224645	Effect of toxogonin and P2S on the toxicity of carbamates and organophosphorus compounds.	Toxogonin (80 mg/kg intraperitoneally) given 15 min. prior to the administration of organophosphorus insecticides dimethoate, malathion, parathion and azinphos-methyl, organophosphorus warfare agents soman and tabun, or carbamates physostigmine, pyridostigmine and aldicarb, reduced the toxicity in mice of these agents by increasing their LD50 dose 1.5-3 fold. The toxicity of the carbamate insecticide carbaryl, however, was significantly increased by toxogonin. Similar results were obtained for P2S (150 mg/kg intraperitoneally) with respect to the toxicity of dimethoate, soman and pyridostigmine, whereas no effect could be detected on the toxicity of tabun. Only a slight reduction in the toxicity of physostigmine was observed. The acetylcholinesterase activity in erythrocytes, cerebrum and diaphragm of surviving mice 20 hours after organophosphate intoxication was similar both in toxogonin and P2S treated animals and untreated animals.	1	pesticide
276313	Personnel safety and foliage residue in an orchard spray program using azinphosmethyl and captan.	Residue levels of azinphosmethyl and captan were determined from blotter paper patches attached to the clothing of personnel participating in an orchard spray program. Average exposure of 1.74 mg/man/hr for azinphosmethyl and 1.94 mg/man/hr for captan were extrapolated from mean residue values obtained from analyzing the patches. Azinphosmethyl residue found on apple and peach foliage had been reached by 69% by the tenth day post-application, while captan residue had been reduced 50% for the same period. There was no evidence of a buildup of either azinphosmethyl or captan on treated foliage as the season progressed.	1	pesticide
406567	[Radiometric determination of 11 carbamate pesticides in the nanogram and subnanongram ranges by means of cholinesterase inhibition].	This method for determining carbamates is based on the inhibiting action of these substances on acetylcholinesterase activity. The use of radioactively labelled acetylcholine as a substrate, the ensuing extractive separation of the radioactive acetic acid (formed by hydrolysis) and its radiometric determination permit to detect very small amounts of carbamates. The limit of detection for aldicarb, baygon, benomyl, bux, carbaryl, CIPC, matacil, phenmedipham and promecarb lies in the picogram range; that for barban and methomyl, in the nanogram range. The lower, linear parts of the curves for the different carbamates fall within the range 0.001-10 ng. The sensitivity (expressed as delta% inhibition/delta lg ng carbamate) ranges from 1.0 to 9.7.	1	pesticide
407850	Residues of PCB's and DDT in the western Lake Superior ecosystem.	Fish from western Lake Superior (1972-73) contained DDT and PCB residues at concentrations greater than o.1 ppm. The most predominant PCB's were those containing 3 to 6 chlorine atoms per molecule, and GLC data indicated that the mixtures were most like the commercial product Aroclor 1254(2). Other chlorinated contiminants identified by GC/MS analyses and occurring at concentrations less than 0.1 ppm were hexachlorobenzene (C6Cl6), chlordane, nonaclor, and dieldrin. Lindane, which has been previously reported in Lake Superior, was below the detection limit of approximately 0.01 ppm. The relationship between the size of lake trout and the concentration of total DDT in the fish was compared to measurements reported in previous studies. The comparison suggests that DDT residues have declined since 1968. The concentration of PCBs was estimated to be 0.8 ng/L in Lake Superior water and 0.1 ppm in large zooplankton. The apparent bioconcentration factor for PCBs in Lake Superior fish ranged from 10(5) to 10(6). The concentration of total DDT and PCBs in the larger Lake Superior fish exceeded the 5 ppm tolerance level established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for these chemicals in fish tbe used for human consumption.	1	pesticide
410374	Degradation of carbaryl by soil microorganisms.	Four days after carbaryl-naphthyl-1-14C was mixed with soil from a field treated 6 months previously with 4 lb/A of the same insecticide, only 28% of the radiocarbon remained. Approximately 90% remained in soils with no history of pesticide applications. However, dissipation of the carbaryl-14C residues from the latter soils continued at a rather steady rate over a 120-day test period, whereas there was little dissipation after 4 days from the former. Consequently, the total 14C-residue levels were about the same, 15 to 20% of applied, when the last samples were taken. Carbaryl, per se, was the only apolar 14C-residue recovered from the soil and only small quantities, less than 2% of the amount applied, of extractable polar metabolites were encountered. Almost all of the terminal residues were unextractable from the soil with mixtures of acetone and water. Much of the loss of 14C-residues from the soil was attributed to the liberation of 14C-carbon dioxide as a result of microbial degradation of the naphthalene ring. Several fungal and bacterial isolates degraded carbaryl in the same manner as observed with soil incubations, but the rates of degradation were much slower.	1	pesticide
494856	Effect of some medicaments on the oxygen uptake of the spores of some soil fungi.	Nystatin, riboflavin, ascorbic acid, captan, indoleacetic acid, and colchicin were tested in two concentrations for their effect on the oxygen uptake of the spores of Mucor racemosus, Cladosporium tenuissimum, Cochliobolus spicifer, and Macrophomina phaseoli. Nystatin and captan inhibited the oxygen uptake of the spores of all fungi used, and this inhibitory effect increases with increasing concentration. On the other hand, riboflavin, ascorbic acid, indoleacetic acid, and colchicin were found to have a stimulating effect. Increasing the concentration of these medicaments to the double concentration causes a decrease in the oxygen uptake, except in the case of ascorbic acid where the reverse occurs.	1	pesticide

The 25/75 cis-trans mixture of permethrin (BW21Z), one of the new broad-spectrum pyrethroid insecticides, was labeled with 14C in the alcohol methylene carbon moiety and mist sprayed at two rates (3.77 or 11.94 mg/hen) on 28 hens. Peak permethrin equivalents in both treatment groups were found in the skins, .414 and l.69 ppm, respectively. Total permethrin equivalents peaked 3 days after treatment, but permethrin equivalents in eggs peaked 5 days after treatment.	1	pesticide
536444	Evaluation of Amberlite XAD-2 as the extractant for carbamate insecticides from natural water.	A rapid and sensitive analytical technique to quantify carbamate insecticides at nanogram levels is reported using resin column and sorption, and desorption followed by N-P gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis. The carbamates were extracted from natural water by percolation through a column of Amberlite XAD-2, followed by elution with ethyl acetate. The carbamate residues were directly analyzed by GLC with a Tracor Model 702 N-P detector. The recoveries for several carbamates including aminocarb, mexacarbate, carbaryl, propoxur, carbofuran, pirimicarb and methiocarb were from 86 to 108% at 1.0 and 0.01 ppm levels. Only 41 to 58% was recovered for methomyl. The extraction efficiency of Amberlite XAD-2 was pH-dependent as indicated in the extraction of aminocarb. More than 90% of the added aminocarb was recovered from phosphate buffer by the described method at pH 5.0 to 7.5 at 5.0 and 0.5 ppm levels.	1	pesticide
563442	Effect of general anesthetics on handling- and decapitation-induced increases in sympathoadrenal discharge.	The effect of five anesthetics--cyclopropane, pentobarbital, urethane, chloralose or ketamine hydrochloride--on handling- or decapitation-induced increases in adrenergic tone were studied in the intact rat. The anesthetic agents tested prevented or markedly reduced stress-induced increases in levels of plasma total catecholamines and norepinephrine. Similar changes in norepinephrine were seen in corticosterone- treated adrenalectomized rats in which this catecholamine seemed to be the only one present in plasma. During anesthesia with cyclopropane, blood pressure fell; there was no additional decrease in total plasma catecholamines when the concentration of the inhaled anesthetic agent was increased. With increased length of cyclopropane anesthesia, however, total catecholamine and norepinephrine concentrations increased. Thus, the different effects of anesthetics on the cardiovascular system cannot be solely explained by their effects on stress-induced increases in sympathetic neuronal activity as reflected by circulating catecholamine levels.	1	pesticide

749224	Toxicological studies of insecticides on Cullex quinquefasciatus Say and Aedes aegypti (L.).	Toxicity tests carried out on the larvae of A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus showed the former to be more tolerant of all insecticides tested, the order of toxicity being temephos greater than DDT greater than DDVP greater than malathion greater than lindane greater than carbaryl; also the second instar larvae of A. aegypti were more susceptible than fourth instar larvae. Enzyme kinetic studies on the total non-specific esterases and CarEs of adults and larvae of both species showed the Km values for total esterases of adult A. aegypti to be 0.333 mM vs 0.233 mM for C. quinquefasciatus; for adult CarEs it was 0.250 mM vs 0.220 mM. For total larval esterases of A. aegypti it was 0.112 mM vs 0.175 mM for C. quinquefasciatus: and for larval CarES it was 0.159 mM vs 0.213 mM respectively. Although some correlation between in vivo toxicity (LD50 values) and in vitro esterase inhibition (I50 values) between species could be discerned, overall correlation could not be established.	1	pesticide

"Groups of 30 Xenopus laevis embryos, at ""tail-bud"" stage (Nieukoop-Faber stages 22-24) were exposed to 0.1-2 ppm concentrations of various pesticides for 1 to 10 days. The pesticides used were chloranil and dichlone (both are fungicidal and herbicidal); diquat (herbicide); and nabam (fungicide). The parameters examined were mortality, gross morphology, histology, and behavior. Chloranil (1.25 to 1.75 ppm) treated embryos showed abnormalities of the otolith, optic cup, and general pigmentation. Their movement was sporadically convulsive and they were unable to maintain proper balance. Dichlone (0.1 to 0.15 ppm) disrupted the development of the cephalic end of the embryo. Many of these embryos developed a slightly retarded trunk and tail only. These headless embryos lived for a time and were relatively lethargic. Diquat (0.75 to 2.0 ppm) administration reduced body size and pigmentation, and altered body shape. When embryos were treated with both 1.0 ppm of diquat and 2.0 ppm of nabam the integrity of myomeres and myocommata of the musculature was disrupted. The histological bases of these morphological and behavioral changes are discussed."	1	pesticide
1158824	Gas-liquid chromatographic determination of technical chlordane residues in food crops: interpretation of analytical data.	An interlaboratory investigation of technical chlordane residues in food crops was carried out to determine the most practical and consistent method of reporting results. Using a technical chlordane reference standard, 8 gas chromatographic stationary phases were studied for their resolution capabilities. The best separations were obtained with SE-30 and its OV-1 equivalent. Using these columns and electron capture detection, potatoes and carrots from supervised field experiments were analyzed in duplicate and quantitated by using 4 methods of calculation. The data were statistically treated to determine the precision and bias for each method. Also, 1 sample was analyzed in duplicate on 2 different occasions by 6 laboratories to substantiate the initial conclusions. Based on the criterion of high precision it is suggested that a comparison of total area under the chromatogram of the sample with total area of standard technical chlordane be the method of quantitation. Only peaks which are common to both standard and sample have any significance in this type of calculation.	1	pesticide

1306993	[Laboratory study on the immediate and persistent insecticide activity of the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin on nymphs of IV instar Triatoma infestans].	Lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) is a new broad-spectrum synthetic pyrethroid insecticide with efficient immediate and persistent activity against a great variety of arthropods harmful both to human and animal health and to vegetal production. In many countries this insecticide has been successfully used in the control of infectious diseases vectors, such as mosquitoes, triatomine bugs (transmitters of Trypanosoma cruzi, agent of Chagas' disease) and other arthropods. In order to test the immediate and persistent activity of LCT under laboratory conditions (27 degrees C and 75-80% humidity) on laboratory reared Triatoma infestans--the most resistant instar of this insect to the commonest insecticides used--a series of six experiments was performed in 1-year period. Previous to experiments, the interior surface (400 cm2) of 36 specially manufactured cardboard boxes was uniformly sprayed with 2 ml of the following substrates: 12 with 0.6% LCT suspension, 12 with 1.0% LCT suspension and 12 with water (controls). Twenty four hours, 30 - 90 - 150 - 270 and 360 days later, in two pairs of each six boxes, lots of 10 T. infestans IV nymphs were deposited inside of them. In each of the six experiments, daily observations of the conditions of the insects (unaffected, affected in terms of various grades of progressive uncoordination, or dead) after exposure to the insecticide were performed to end with the register of these conditions 96 hours later. Moreover, after 7 and 10 days of exposure in the immediate and persistent effect of LCT respectively a 100% of mortality was verified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1	pesticide
1315139	Mechanisms of aldehyde-induced bronchial reactivity: role of airway epithelium.	To investigate the relative irritant potencies of inhaled aldehydes, guinea pigs were exposed to formaldehyde or acrolein and specific total pulmonary resistance and bronchial reactivity to intravenous acetylcholine were assessed. The mechanisms associated with these responses were investigated by analyzing morphologic and biochemical changes in airway epithelial cells after in vivo and in vitro exposures. Immediately after exposure to formaldehyde or acrolein, specific resistance increased transiently and returned to control values within 30 to 60 minutes. Bronchial hyperreactivity, assessed by the acetylcholine dose necessary to double resistance, increased and became maximal two to six hours after exposure to at least 9 parts per million2 (ppm) formaldehyde or at least 1 ppm acrolein for two hours. The effect of exposure to 3 ppm formaldehyde for two hours was less than the effect of exposure to 1 ppm formaldehyde for eight hours; thus, extended exposures produced a disproportionate heightening of bronchial reactivity. Bronchial hyperreactivity often persisted for longer than 24 hours. Increases in three bronchoconstrictive eicosanoids, prostaglandin F2 alpha, thromboxane B2, and leukotriene C4, occurred immediately after exposure, whereas an influx of neutrophils into lavage fluid occurred 24 hours later. Histological examination of the tracheal epithelium and lamina propria also demonstrated a lack of inflammatory cell infiltration. Treatment with leukotriene synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists inhibited acrolein-induced hyperreactivity, supporting a causal role for these compounds in this response. Acrolein also stimulated eicosanoid release from bovine epithelial cells in culture. However, the profile of metabolites formed differed from that found in lavage fluid after in vivo exposure. Similarly, human airway epithelial cells did not produce cysteinyl leukotriene or thromboxane B2. However, cysteinyl leukotrienes were mitogenic for human airway epithelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner and exhibited a structure-activity relationship; leukotriene C4 was more potent than its sequential metabolites D4 and E4. The potency of leukotriene C4 was striking, stimulating colony-forming efficiency in concentrations as low as 0.01 pM. Together, these findings suggest that environmentally relevant concentrations of aldehydes can induce bronchial hyperreactivity in guinea pigs through a mechanism involving injury to cells present in the airways during exposure (rather than from subsequently recruited migratory cells) and that this response is dependent on leukotriene biosynthesis.	1	pesticide
1354459	Aldrin and dieldrin residues in human fat, milk and blood serum collected from Delhi.	1. Aldrin and dieldrin residues were monitored in the fat, breast milk and blood serum from female residents of Delhi. 2. The average aldrin and dieldrin contents were 0.048 and 0.099 ppb in adipose tissue, 0.003 and 0.060 ppb in breast milk and 0.004 and 0.002 ppb in blood serum, respectively. 3. The older donors contained higher levels of aldrin and dieldrin in their adipose tissue. 4. Primagravidae contained more of these chemicals in their breast milk. 5. A positive correlation was observed between the aldrin concentration in adipose tissue and breast milk, and that in adipose tissue and blood serum. Similarly, a significant correlation was found between dieldrin in adipose tissue and blood serum. 6. The levels of aldrin and dieldrin were low in samples from residents of Delhi when compared to those in developed countries.	1	pesticide
1359483	Aluminum inhibits glutamate release from transverse rat hippocampal slices: role of G proteins, Ca channels and protein kinase C.	Aluminum (Al) has been shown to produce deficits in learning and memory. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that Al-induced inhibition of learning may be due to its effect on glutamate release secondary to changes in calcium channel function and/or intracellular events triggering glutamate release. Calcium-dependent potassium (K)-evoked [14C]-glutamate release from 400 microns transverse rat hippocampal slices was inhibited by Al in a concentration dependent manner (IC50 = 40 microM). Aluminum (30, 100 microM) noncompetitively inhibited Bay K 8644-evoked glutamate release. 4-Aminopyridine (30, 1000 microM) noncompetitively attenuated the Al inhibition of glutamate release, suggesting an Al-induced alteration of Ca channel function. Activation of the Gi protein by R(-)phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA; 1 microM) reduced K-evoked glutamate release 69%, whereas 300 microM Al produced an 84% reduction. These effects were prevented by the Gi protein inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; 100 microM), suggesting an effect of Al on the Gi protein to inhibit glutamate release. Phorbol myristate acetate (0.16 microM)-induced glutamate release was inhibited by 300 microM Al and 80 microM polymyxin B, suggesting an Al modulation of protein kinase C (PKC)-evoked glutamate release. These results demonstrate an Al inhibition of glutamate release that may be mediated by multiple, but interconnected mechanisms (e.g., via interactions with Ca systems), providing multiple targets for an Al-induced alteration of neuronal function.	1	pesticide
1369090	Metabolic response to treatment with cold, paraquat, or 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole in leaves of winter wheat.	We treated leaves of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with cold, paraquat, or 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and compared the responses. We assayed the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, catalase, dehydroascorbate reductase and ascorbate free radical reductase and levels of hydrogen peroxide, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, reduced and oxidized glutathione. With any of the three treatments, contents of cellular peroxides and hexose phosphates were raised. The content of ascorbate was lowered markedly by paraquat treatment, which produces active oxygen species, whereas such a decrease did not occur in other two treatments. When the plants were treated with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, which is a specific inhibitor of catalase, the content of oxidized glutathione increased severalfold. The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity increased with all three treatments, but it decreased after glyphosate treatment, which does not stimulate the formation of peroxides. The activities of catalase and dehydroascorbate reductase were increased by the treatment of cold and paraquat, while 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole did not affect the dehydroascorbate reductase activity. The activity of ascorbate free radical reductase increased after treatment by paraquat only.	1	pesticide
1375002	Postmarketing surveillance study of permethrin creme rinse.	BACKGROUND: An observational, epidemiological study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of permethrin 1% creme rinse (Nix) for treatment of head lice infestations. METHODS: Thirty-seven local public health departments enrolled a total of 38,160 patients for 47,578 treatments with permethrin or other pediculicides from September 1, 1986, through January 31, 1988. Follow-up safety information was collected between 7 and 14 days following treatment via return visit or telephone contact. RESULTS: One hundred three adverse events were reported among 41,955 evaluable treatments. The rates of reported adverse events were 2.2 per 1000 treatments among permethrin treatments, 3.4 per 1000 treatments among lindane treatments, and 1.5 per 1000 treatments among other over-the-counter treatments. No serious, unexpected adverse events were detected in the 18,950 patients treated with permethrin. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the safety profile of permethrin in conditions of general use, as seen in clinical trials. Postmarketing safety monitoring in public health departments of drugs used to treat public health conditions was shown to be feasible.	1	pesticide
1397399	Comparison of HPTLC and HPLC procedures for the determination of certain xenobiotic residues in apples and pears.	HPTLC was used to check for residues of benomyl, carbendazim, ethoxyquin and thiabendazole in apples and pears. The method used showed good precision with a percentage coefficient of variation of less than 5%; recoveries were always greater than 90%. The limits of determination using HPTLC were always at least four times lower than Italian statutory limits. Selectivity with respect to other matrix components was excellent for all fruit varieties tested. Comparison with HPLC confirmed the validity of the results.	1	pesticide
1401476	Genetic consequences of linkage between malathion resistance and an autosomal male-determining factor in house fly (Diptera: Muscidae).	The pattern of inheritance of genes conferring resistance to malathion and genetic consequences of linkage between an autosomal male-determining factor and resistance genes on the second chromosome were investigated in a strain of house fly, Musca domestica L., selected for malathion resistance. The second and fifth chromosomes contribute significantly to malathion resistance. The presence of a male-determining factor linked with the resistance genes on the second chromosome resulted in a strong sexual dimorphism in malathion resistance. We also observed that the male-determining factor changed its linkage relationship from the third linkage group to the second linkage group during the selection experiments.	1	pesticide
1416168	The inhibitory effect of halothane on mesenteric venoconstriction and related reflex responses during acute graded hypoxia in rabbits.	Systemic hypoxia is a common abnormality encountered frequently in the clinical setting that produces compensatory cardiopulmonary changes affecting heart rate, blood pressure, peripheral vascular resistance, and respiratory drive. These changes are known to be inhibited or reversed by inhaled anesthetics. More recently, chemoreflex-mediated constriction of capacitance veins has been identified as a mechanism that contributes significantly to the hemodynamic adjustments during hypoxia. However, the effects of anesthetics on this response have not been clarified. The current study was designed to quantify sympathetically mediated mesenteric venoconstriction as well as heart rate and blood pressure responses to acute graded hypoxia; to identify the inhibitory effects of inhaled halothane on these responses; and to estimate the contribution of the peripheral chemoreceptors in mediating these changes. Changes in mesenteric vein diameter were measured in alpha-chloralose anesthetized rabbits in situ with simultaneous changes in heart rate and blood pressure during 40-s periods of 10%, 5%, 2.5%, and 0% inspired O2 administered sequentially before, during, and after 1% or 1.25% inhaled halothane. Sympathetic efferent nerve activity also was measured, and, in a separate group of animals, measurements were preceded by carotid chemoreceptor denervation. Hypoxia-mediated venoconstriction, bradycardia, and hypertension were attenuated almost equally by both 1% and 1.25% inhaled halothane (the higher dose produced only slightly greater inhibition). These responses were inhibited significantly in chemoreceptor-denervated animals, and the subsequent 1% inhaled halothane added only minimal additional attenuation. Increases in chemoreflex-mediated sympathetic efferent nerve activity also were reduced significantly by (1.25%) inhaled halothane. These results indicate that halothane impairs capacitance vein responses and other hemodynamic adjustments during hypoxia. Inhibition of these compensatory changes appears to be mediated, at least in part, via attenuation of peripheral chemoreflex responses and suppression of the resultant reflex increases in sympathetic efferent nerve activity.	1	pesticide
1456780	Anodontites trapesialis: a biological monitor of organochlorine pesticides.	The mussel Anodontites trapesialis (Lam, 1819) was used as an indicator of organochlorine pollutants in the Pardo River, located in the municipality of Ribeirão Preto (21 degrees 07'S and 47 degrees 45'W), State of São Paulo, Brazil. Biological monitoring was performed for one year at the site of a sugar cane grove on the left bank of the river. Forty-three animals were placed in two aluminum enclosures on the river bottom at this site and 4 animals of each enclosure were sacrificed for pesticide analysis at 3-month intervals, each collection corresponding to one season of the year. The animals were found to have been exposed to DDT, lindane, heptachlor, aldrin and dieldrin. Endrin was not detected in any of the analyses.	1	pesticide
1464147	Exposure and health assessment during application of lambda-cyhalothrin for malaria vector control in Pakistan.	Icon 10 WP insecticide, a wettable powder formulation containing 10% lambda-cyhalothrin, was evaluated for possible adverse effects on the health of spraymen and villagers during treatment of dwellings for malaria vector control. Skin sensory effects and occasional coughing and sneezing in confined spaces were the only symptoms noted by the workers resulting from the handling and spraying of the insecticide. Absorption of lambda-cyhalothrin was estimated by determining its metabolites in urine and serum. The average amount of lambda-cyhalothrin absorbed by the workers per day (54 micrograms) represents less than 0.0001% (< 1 micrograms.kg-1.day-1) of the average daily amount of the substance handled. Only a small proportion of villagers showed detectable levels of lambda-cyhalothrin metabolites in their urine. Absorption of lambda-cyhalothrin from the formulation tested was therefore very low and, apart from the nuisance of skin sensory effects, there should be no risk to the health of workers or to the villagers whose dwellings are treated.	1	pesticide
1509669	The effect of malathion, an organophosphate, on the plasma FSH, 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone concentrations and acetylcholinesterase activity and conception in dairy cattle.	The effect of malathion on jugular plasma concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) on conception in dairy cattle during a cloprostenol (prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue, PG)-induced estrus was studied. Malathion (1 mg/kg, intraruminally) given at the onset of estrus (48 h after PG) did not alter the plasma FSH or E2 concentrations but significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibited plasma P4 concentration. The mean P4 concentration in the malathion-treated group on days 8 and 12 were 0.8 +/- 0.4 and 1.0 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, as compared to 2.6 +/- 0.0 and 2.4 +/- 0.3 ng/ml in the control group. There was a nonsignificant (P greater than 0.05) inhibition of plasma AchE activity in malathion-treated cattle. Conception was 16.6% in malathion-treated cows and 50% in controls. Inhibition of progesterone secretion and poor conception occurred after the single intraruminal dose of malathion at the onset of estrus.	1	pesticide

1539709	Is there a central nervous system component to acute baroreflex resetting in rats?	"This study was designed to evaluate a possible central nervous system (CNS) component to acute baroreflex resetting. In nine arterial baroreceptor-denervated, chloralose-urethan-anesthetized rats, a control (C) aortic nerve stimulation curve (3-5 V, 1 ms, 0-64 Hz) was obtained. Next, a constant ""baroreceptor"" input was delivered to the CNS (left aortic nerve stimulation, 10 min, 10.2 +/- 1.5 Hz). Within the first 13 s of aortic nerve stimulation, maximum inhibition of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity (LSNA) was 60 +/- 7.8% of baseline and at 1 min it increased to 68 +/- 5.6% of baseline. At the end of the 10-min aortic nerve stimulation, LSNA was not different from the response at 1 min (68 +/- 5.6% = 74 +/- 4.1%). Immediately after the constant stimulation (within 30 s), a test or reset (RS) curve was obtained (0-64 Hz). A recovery (RC) curve was obtained 10-20 min later. The slope of the linear portion of the curve and the stimulation frequency that produced 50% maximum inhibition (ES50) were compared among the three baroreflex curves (C, RS, RC,) and no significant differences were found. Thus, although a CNS component to baroreflex adaptation was evident during the first minute of aortic nerve stimulation, a longer term acute resetting of the baroreflex curve did not occur."	1	pesticide
1568215	Pesticides and other agricultural risk factors for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among men in Iowa and Minnesota.	Data from an in-person interview study of 622 white men with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 1245 population-based controls in Iowa and Minnesota were used to measure the risk associated with farming occupation and specific agricultural exposures. Men who ever farmed were at slightly elevated risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (odds ratio = 1.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.0-1.5) that was not linked to specific crops or particular animals. Elevated risks were found, with odds ratio generally 1.5-fold or greater, for personal handling, mixing, or application of several pesticide groups and for individual insecticides, including carbaryl, chlordane, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, diazinon, dichlorvos, lindane, malathion, nicotine, and toxaphene. Associations were generally stronger for first use prior to 1965 than more recently, and when protective clothing or equipment was not used. Small risks were associated with the use of the phenoxyacetic acid herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, but the risks did not increase with latency or failure to use protective equipment. Exposure to numerous pesticides poses problems of interpreting risk associated with a particular chemical, and multiple comparisons increase the chances of false-positive findings. In contrast, nondifferential exposure misclassification due to inaccurate recall can bias risk estimates toward the null and mask positive associations. In the face of these methodological and statistical issues, the consistency of several findings, both within this study and with observations of others, suggests an important role for several insecticides in the etiology of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among farmers.	1	pesticide
1644709	Pesticide concentrations in Arkansas breast milk.	During an episode of pesticide dairy product contamination in Arkansas in 1986, breast milk samples from 942 women were analyzed for concentrations of chlorinated pesticides. The pesticides found most frequently in quantifiable concentrations were p,p'-DDE (100%), oxychlordane (84%), trans-nonachlor (77%), heptachlor epoxide (74%) and beta-HCH, an isomer of lindane (27%). The pesticides present in highest mean concentrations of all samples analyzed (reported as ppm in milk fat) were p,p'-DDE (0.952 ppm), trans-nonachlor (0.062 ppm), oxychlordane (0.051 ppm), heptachlor epoxide (0.045 ppm), p,p'-DDT (0.039 ppm), and beta-HCH (0.032 ppm). These concentrations are lower than previous reports from similar regions of the US. However, continued persistence in human breast milk is of concern due to potential adverse health effects from these chemicals.	1	pesticide
1644881	Comparison of gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods for screening of chlorotriazine pesticides in soil.	The performance of a coupled technique resulting from the combination of gas chromatography with a selective mass spectrometric technique (tandem mass spectrometry) (GC-MS-MS) with collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) and multi-reaction monitoring (MRM) was compared with that of GC-low resolution MS (GC-LRMS) at a resolving power of 1000 and GC-high-resolution MS (GC-HRMS) at resolving powers of 5000 and 10,000 for the determination of atrazine, simazine, cyanazine, deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine in polluted soil samples. GC-MS-MS daughter ion spectra for the parent ions [M]+. and [M - CH3]+ were generated using collisionally activated dissociation and studied. Also, by optimizing the collision energy for maximum sensitivity a method for screening chlorotriazines by MRM was developed. Analyses of soil sample extracts showed that GC-MS-MS overcomes interferences from other chlorotriazines and interfering compounds that could not be removed by GC-HRMS or GC-LRMS at resolving powers of 10,000 and 1000, respectively. The limits of detection for GC-MS-MS and GC-HRMS at a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 ranged between 1 and 24 pg, with a mean relative standard deviation of 25-30%. Soil samples known to contain chlorotriazines and their degradation products were analysed by GC-MS-MS and the results obtained were compared with those given by GC-HRMS at resolving powers of 5000 and 10,000, with quantification differences of 25-30%.	1	pesticide
1663333	Interaction between amitraz and alpha 2-adrenoceptors inhibits epinephrine-induced canine platelet aggregation.	The effect of amitraz, a formamidine insecticide, on [3H]yohimbine binding and aggregation of canine platelets was studied. The time course study of [3H]yohimbine binding to alpha 2-adrenoceptors on canine platelet membranes showed a maximum binding after 45 min at 37 degrees C using 5.25 nM final concentration of radioligand. When maximum binding was reached, amitraz (10(-4) M) was added to inhibit [3H]yohimbine binding. The dose-dependent inhibition of radioligand binding by amitraz was compared with that of chlordimeform, another formamidine insecticide, and clonidine. The IC50 values for clonidine, amitraz and chlordimeform indicated that amitraz was about 5 times less potent than clonidine and 6 times more potent than chlordimeform. Epinephrine (10(-6) M) promoted both primary and secondary aggregation of canine platelets in the presence of 10(-6) M ADP. Both amitraz (3 x 10(-7)-10(-5) M) and clonidine (3 x 10(-7)-10(-6) M) inhibited epinephrine-induced canine platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that amitraz has a direct interaction with alpha 2-adrenoceptors of canine platelets to inhibit epinephrine-induced aggregation.	1	pesticide

1673175	Community control of scabies: a model based on use of permethrin cream.	For 18 years treatment with lindane or crotamiton products has failed to stem the epidemic of scabies among the Kuna Indians in the San Blas islands of the Republic of Panama. Permethrin 5% cream was introduced as the only treatment in a programme to control scabies on an island of 756 inhabitants and involving workers recruited locally. Prevalence fell from 33% to less than 1% after every person was treated. As long as continued surveillance and treatment of newly introduced cases was maintained, prevalence of scabies remained below 1.5% for over 3 years. When supply of medication was interrupted for 3 weeks, prevalence rose to 3.6%. When control was lost after the US invasion of Panama, prevalence rose to 12% within 3 months. Bacterial skin infections decreased dramatically when scabies was controlled. Permethrin is safe and effective even in areas where this disease has become resistant to lindane.	1	pesticide
1673728	The operational costs of spraying residual insecticides: a case-study from Nepal.	Little attention has been paid to the cost implications of different insecticides for malaria control, particularly to the local (non-insecticide) costs. This study in Nepal explored the significance of operational costs in relation to insecticide cost and examined the extent to which operational costs varied for DDT, malathion and Ficam. A detailed analysis was done of costs relating to spraying, transport and safety. The study found that the operational cost differences were relatively small in comparison with the costs of the chemicals themselves and the cost of transporting them to Nepal, though DDT and Ficam had significantly lower operational costs than malathion. Operational costs were paid mainly by the Nepalese government and insecticide and external freight costs by donors.	1	pesticide

1685337	Experimental hut trials of bednets impregnated with synthetic pyrethroid or organophosphate insecticide for mosquito control in The Gambia.	1. Nylon bednets impregnated with different insecticides were evaluated in 1988 against wild adult mosquito populations, mostly Mansonia africana (Theobald) and Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu lato, entering experimental verandah-trap huts in The Gambia. Each bednet had six 10 x 10 cm holes made in the walls to simulate torn conditions and permit female mosquitoes to enter and feed on sleepers. 2. Individual net treatments, determined by gas chromatography of net samples from before and after 12 weeks use of the bednets, were: permethrin 670 +/- 159 and 405 +/- 190 mg/m2 (40% loss), cypermethrin 37 +/- 8 and 16 +/- 9 mg/m2 (57% loss), deltamethrin 10 +/- 7 and 10 +/- 8 mg/m2 (no loss), lambda-cyhalothrin 2.6 +/- 0.9 and 1.6 +/- 0.5 mg/m2 (38% loss), pirimiphos-methyl 4017 +/- 117 and 1160 +/- 319 mg/m2 (71% loss). 3. Washing three times in the traditional manner with local cow-fat soap reduced the initial dosages by about 85% of cypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, 99.8% of pirimiphos-methyl and left no detectable residues of deltamethrin or permethrin. 4. The unwashed permethrin-treated bednet reduced the number of mosquitoes entering a hut by 60% of An.gambiae s.l. and 68% of Mansonia spp. This deterrency was less pronounced with the other insecticides and was lost by washing the bednets. 5. Each insecticide, especially lambda-cyhalothrin and pirimiphosmethyl, caused significant mortality rates of mosquitoes that entered huts with impregnated bednets, and prevented the majority of An. gambiae s.l. and Mansonia females from bloodfeeding. Washing completely removed the efficacy of deltamethrin and permethrin treated bednets, whereas nets treated with cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin or pirimiphos-methyl remained significantly insecticidal after washing. 6. Aerial toxicity from the pirimiphos-methyl treated bednet killed 80% of An.gambiae s.l. confined overnight in the hut at the end of the trial, whereas the pyrethroid-treated bednets gave negligible mortality rates of mosquitoes. 7. Sleepers using the bednets had no medical symptoms significantly associated with any of the treatments. On the contrary, from 216 interviews, 4/10 complaints were associated with the use of untreated nets (P approximately 0.05), perhaps because sleepers were kept awake by mosquitoes and became more aware of any ailments. 8. It is concluded that permethrin tends mainly to deter mosquitoes from house-entry, enhancing personal protection, whereas the other insecticides kill higher proportions of the endophilic mosquitoes, which would give better community protection against malaria transmission.	1	pesticide

1710460	Changes in synaptosomal pH and rates of oxygen radical formation induced by chlordecone.	The resting pH of 7.14 +/- 0.02 within rat cortical synaptosomes is elevated in vitro by the insecticide chlordecone, in a dose-dependent manner. Chlordecone also reduces the rate of oxygen radical formation within synaptosomes. Both of these changes can also be demonstrated following in vivo treatment of rats with chlordecone (75 mg/kg body wt). Although chlordecone increases the permeability of the plasma membrane, the increase in pH observed is unlikely to be caused by this, since in vivo administration of chlordecone does not appreciably alter membrane order as evaluated by both a lipophilic probe, and a probe with an ionic segment. Another xenobiotic agent, methyl mercuric chloride, and a free radical generating system, an ascorbic acid-ferrous sulfate mixture, did not modulate synaptosomal pH, although membrane permeability was increased. Other evidence of the ability of synaptosomes to maintain homeostasis was the failure of mitochondrial inhibitors to significantly reduce pH. The drop in synaptosomal pH effected by amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, and the transient rise in pH caused by ammonium chloride further suggested that synaptosomes may be a good model in the study of the regulation of intracellular pH. The elevation of cytosolic pH, and depression of oxygen radical formation by chlordecone, may result from both the attenuation of respiratory metabolism and an impaired capacity of the plasma membrane to maintain ionic gradients.	1	pesticide
1711578	Chronic administration of sublethal doses of carbaryl increases pineal N-acetyltransferase and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activities and serum melatonin levels.	The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of chronic administration of sublethal doses of carbaryl on pineal melatonin synthesis. N-methyl 1-naphthylcarbamate (carbaryl) (8.33 mg/kg B.W. daily) was administered orally to adult male albino rats for 6 successive days. Nocturnal (0100) N-acetyltransferase and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activities were increased (roughly 75% and 60%, respectively) by carbaryl administration; likewise, carbaryl augmented serum melatonin levels at 2300. Pineal tryptophan. 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, and 5-hydroxindole acetic acid levels were unaffected at all three time points. The results indicate that the carbamate pesticide, i.e., carbaryl, modifies pineal melatonin synthesis in vivo.	1	pesticide
1729768	Effect of the fungicide benomyl on xenobiotic metabolism in rats.	The effect of benomyl administered orally (p.o.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) on the activity of hepatic microsomal mixed-function oxidases (MFOs) was studied in rats. A dose of 100 mg/kg given i.p. reduced the activities of several hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes 24 h following the treatment. A similar reduction in the activities of the MFOs was also noted 24 h following oral benomyl administration at a dose of 500 mg/kg. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of drug metabolism by benomyl was demonstrated by increased pentobarbital sleeping-time 24 h after p.o. as well as i.p. dosing. No alterations were found in the serum sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) at 24 h after i.p. or oral benomyl indicating a lack of hepatotoxic effect. These results indicate that benomyl shows a route-independent effect on MFOs and is not toxic to the liver.	1	pesticide

Pyrethroids with the alpha-cyano moiety (fluvalinate, fenvalerate, cypermethrin, esfenvalerate, tralomethrin, cyfluthrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin) were more toxic than those without this functional group (d-phenothrin, resmethrin, and permethrin). At LC50, toxicity was negatively related to temperature. Temperature-toxicity responses of five of seven alpha-cyano pyrethroids were parallel, possibly indicating qualitatively identical but quantitatively different levels of detoxification enzymes.	1	pesticide
1754879	Levels of aldrin and dieldrin in environmental samples from Delhi, India.	Aldrin and dieldrin residues in soil, earthworms, water, fish and clams from different sites in Delhi were monitored. Concentrations of aldrin and dieldrin were found to be higher in earthworms than in soil. Concentrations of dieldrin were higher in fish than the ambient water, but the concentration of aldrin in the ambient water was the same as that in fish and clams.	1	pesticide
1785941	Purification and characterization of the N-methylcarbamate hydrolase from Pseudomonas strain CRL-OK.	A unique cytosolic enzyme that hydrolyzes the carbamate linkage of the insecticide carbaryl (1-naphthyl N-methylcarbamate) was purified from extracts of Pseudomonas sp. strain CRL-OK. Substrates of the hydrolase include the N-methylcarbamate pesticides carbofuran and aldicarb but not the phenylcarbamate isopropyl m-chlorocarbanilate, the thiocarbamate S-ethyl N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate, or the dimethylcarbamate o-nitrophenyldimethylcarbamate.	1	pesticide
1786744	Susceptibilities of northern fowl mite, Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Acarina: Macronyssidae), and chicken mite, Dermanyssus gallinae (Acarina: Dermanyssidae), to selected acaricides.	The relative toxicities of ten acaricides to northern fowl mite, Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Canestrini and Fanzago), and the chicken mite, Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer), were determined simultaneously by holding the mites inside disposable glass Pasteur pipettes previously immersed in acetone solutions of various concentrations (w/v) of technical grade acaricides. The LC90s (parts per million) of the acaricides after 24 h exposure for the northern fowl mite and the chicken mite, respectively, were: bendiocarb (13.1, 0.18), tetrachlorvinphos (14.5, 4.07), carbaryl (15.0, 0.83), pirimiphos methyl (18.3, 2.03), permethrin (23.1, 8.46), lambda cyhalothrin (80.7, 11.4), dichlorvos (252.8, 3.75), malathion (238.4, 6.59), amitraz (6741, 9430) and fenvalerate (greater than 10,000, 60.2). After 48 h exposure there were only slight increases in mortalities of both species except for increased mortalities for the northern fowl mite with lambda cyhalothrin, amitraz and fenvalerate, and for the chicken mite with amitraz.	1	pesticide
1823486	[Experimental studies of the control of mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles using selected insecticides].	In the research 4 compounds: Iodofenphos, Propetamphos, Dioxacarb and Permethrin and two commercial insecticides: Pibutoks Super (Permethrin) and Safrotin 10 WP (Propetamphos) were used to control anophelini females. The chemicals were tested in the laboratory on mosquitoes caught in the nature and the contact method was employed. Propetamphos and Permethrin at concentrations 0.05% and 0.1%, after 2 hours of 1 hour exposure reduced the mosquitoes in 96% and 99.9% respectively. Iodofenphos and Dioxacarb, even at concentration 0.1%, after 24 hours of 1 hour exposure caused barely 78.3% and 83.9% mortality of these insects. Both insecticides tested, in the 7 days period after the spraying, caused more than 97% reduction of the Anopheles population in the cow-sheds.	1	pesticide
1860170	Detection of acrolein and crotonaldehyde DNA adducts in cultured human cells and canine peripheral blood lymphocytes by 32P-postlabeling and nucleotide chromatography.	People are constantly being exposed to toxic and carcinogenic aldehydes. However, little is actually known about the mechanisms underlying the toxic and carcinogenic effects of these aldehydes on human cells. The DNA alkylating activities of two of the more toxic and environmentally prominent alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes, acrolein and crotonaldehyde, have been studied utilizing 32P-postlabeling and nucleotide chromatographic techniques. Several putative adducts were observed in DNAs isolated from acrolein- and crotonaldehyde-treated human fibroblasts. One of these acrolein-DNA adducts was tentatively identified as the cyclic 1,N2-hydroxypropanodeoxyguanosine product, 3-(2'-deoxyribosyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-8-hydroxypyrimido[1,2- a]purine-10-one, by co-chromatography with a chemical standard. The 1,N2-hydroxypropanodeoxyguanosine along with other possible adducts, was also found in DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from a dog 1 h after receiving a therapeutic dose of 6.6 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide. These results not only demonstrate the presence of acrolein and crotonaldehyde DNA adducts in treated human cells, but also suggest that these sensitive techniques may be useful to the study of the importance of acrolein to both the carcinogenic and antineoplastic activities of cyclophosphamide and other oxazaphosphorine mustards.	1	pesticide
1867643	Relationships between ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol during diquat-induced redox cycling in isolated rat hepatocytes.	The effects of diquat-induced redox cycling on the levels of cellular ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol were investigated in isolated rat hepatocytes. In untreated hepatocytes, the metabolism of 1 or 2 mM diquat resulted in the depletion of cellular ascorbic acid and glutathione, but not of alpha-tocopherol, in association with the induction of cell death during the experimental period. In 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) pretreated cells, 1 mM diquat induced cell death accompanied by glutathione was rapid (to 9% of controls by 15 min) and cell ascorbate was completely consumed by 2 hr of incubation. In contrast, cellular alpha-tocopherol levels were stable for the first 30 min, but were depleted in association with the onset of lipid peroxidation. Supplementation of 0.1 or 1.0 mM ascorbic acid in the incubation medium delayed the onset of diquat-induced alpha-tocopherol loss, lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity. When the concentration of exogenous cellular ascorbic acid was consumed to below that of endogenous ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol loss and lipid peroxidation were initiated. The results indicate that untreated hepatocytes have an effective multicomponent antioxidant system against diquat-induced oxidative stress. However, when glutathione is depleted from hepatocytes by treatment with BCNU and diquat, ascorbic acid plays a vital role in maintaining cellular alpha-tocopherol levels and survival of the cell.	1	pesticide
1893800	Pheromone/acaricide mixtures in the control of the tick Amblyomma hebraeum: effects of acaricides on attraction and attachment.	Unfed adults and nymphs of the bont tick Amblyomma hebraeum Koch are attracted to hosts on which fed males, emitting an aggregation-attachment pheromone (AAP), are attached. Pheromone/acaricide mixtures have the potential to selectively attract and kill these ticks. We have investigated the effects of three acaricides, amitraz (an amidine), flumethrin (a synthetic pyrethroid) and chlorfenvinphos (an organophosphate), combined with AAP, on the attraction and attachment of the unfed adults. Attraction, measured in field assays involving AAP and CO2, was not inhibited by any of the acaricides. Attachment was measured over 24 h on the ears of rabbits which had been treated with AAP and mixtures of AAP and the acaricides. None of the acaricides inhibited initial attachment. Flumethrin caused rapid and high mortality in attached and unattached ticks. Chlorfenvinphos caused little mortality in the first 24 h on the ears of the rabbits, but 75% of the exposed ticks died over the next 14 days while held in an incubator. Amitraz caused the ticks to detach after an initial period of attachment; there was little mortality in the detached ticks over the next two weeks and they could later be induced to re-attach to other rabbits. Flumethrin was considered to be the compound of choice for use in pheromone/acaricide mixtures.	1	pesticide

1898112	Organochlorine levels in North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) blubber.	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), total DDT (DDT + DDE + DDD), dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, chlordanes, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were found in blubber biopsies from endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the Bay of Fundy and on Browns-Baccaro Banks. Analyses included four sex and age class composite samples from 1988, and 21 individual samples from 1989. Generally, PCBs demonstrated the highest wet weight residue levels (up to 1.9 micrograms/g), followed by total DDT (DDT + DDE + DDD) (trace to 0.47 micrograms/g). Relatively low residue levels in adult females suggest that transmammary organochlorine (OC) residue transfer occurs during lactation. The actual blubber residue loads may have been underestimated, because the samples were taken when the whales were depositing fat reserves and the samples may not have been representative of the remainder of the blubber.	1	pesticide
1907140	Methylparathion, carbaryl and aldrin impact on nitrogen metabolism of prawn, Penaeus indicus.	Changes in hepatopancreas, muscle and gill tissue nitrogen metabolic profiles were studied in a penaeid prawn, Penaeus indicus, following its exposure to sublethal concentrations of methylparathion, carbaryl and aldrin. In all the insecticide exposed prawn tissues, Ammonia levels were significantly increased and a shift in the nitrogen metabolism towards the synthesis of urea and glutamine was observed. Inhibition of glutamate oxidation to ammonia and alpha-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase suggests a mechanism whereby hyperammonemia is reduced by minimizing the addition of further ammonia to the already existing elevated ammonia pool. Increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferases demonstrates the onset of gluconeogenesis. Mechanisms to detoxify the ammonia by enhancing the synthesis of urea and glutamine at the cellular level was observed in the selected tissues pave way for the survivability of prawns in insecticide polluted environs.	1	pesticide
1907908	Effects of pyrethroid insecticides on hepatic microsomal enzymes in rats.	The effects of pyrethroid insecticides on hepatic microsomal enzymes were studied in rats. Animals were treated orally with cypermethrin (80 mg/kg), deltamethrin (15 mg/kg), and permethrin (100 mg/kg), as a solution in soyabean oil, for 1 to 20 days. The content of cytochromes P-450 and b5, activity of NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase, glutathione S-transferase, aniline 4-hydroxylase, p-nitroanisole O-demethylase in microsomes, the activity of glutathione S-transferase, and the level of sulfhydryl groups in cytosol were determined. Also the relative liver weight was measured. Only few changes in the investigated parameters were ascertained. These changes have an irregular and transient character. On the whole, the action of pyrethroids on microsomal enzymes results in a slight induction.	1	pesticide
1958080	In vivo alterations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and LDH isoenzymes patterns by acute carbofuran intoxication.	"Intoxication with an acute dose of carbofuran (1.5 mg/kg, sc) in male Sprague-Dawley rats evoked severe toxic manifestations characteristic of hypercholinergic preponderance with profound muscle fasciculations and convulsions during 30-60 min, lasting for about 2 h. Lactate dehydrogenase, a ""biomarker"" cytoplasmic enzyme catalyzing the reversible reaction of lactate-pyruvate, was represented by five electrophoretically distinct isoenzymes in the serum and tissues. The amounts of each isoenzyme in different tissues were widely varied and consequently the patterns were tissue specific. A 24-h time-course following carbofuran administration indicated a two-fold increase in the activity of total LDH in serum and more than 30% in hemidiaphragm and liver. The patterns of LDH isoenzymes in serum revealed a significant (P less than 0.01) increase in all the isoenzymes except LDH-4 (64% decrease). Analysis of each tissue revealed characteristic changes in LDH isoenzyme patterns indicating organ-specific tissue damage. These alterations in LDH and its isoenzymes, in addition to acetylcholinesterase inhibition, may be directly or indirectly related to the mechanism(s) of the toxic action, and also provide insight into the site/organ(s) of toxic injury, thus providing an early prognostic indicator."	1	pesticide
2010292	[Pyrethrin and pyrethroid (permethrin) in the treatment of scabies and pediculosis].	"The history and development of pyrethrum, the natural pyrethrins and synthetic pyrethroids and their insecticidal properties, chemical structure and toxic and allergic side-effects are reported. Permethrin is stressed as a photostable insecticide that is very effective against a large variety of insects and mites with low mammalian toxicity and virtually no allergic side-effects. Only 10-20 min after application, permethrin (1% cream rinse or 0.5% in ethanol) proved to be safe, reliable and cosmetically acceptable in the treatment of infestations with head lice and the prevention of reinfestations, and also in failures with lindane owing to the development of tolerance in the lice. The same was true of 5% permethrin cream (2.5% in children below 5 years of age) used in the treatment of scabies. Permethrin is absorbed percutaneously in only small amounts, is metabolized rapidly in the skin and excreted in the urine. A single ""head to toe"" application is ideal for eradication programmes allowing lice to be targetted and the prevalence of secondary bacterial infections decreased at the same time. Benzyl benzoate has an irritant potential, and lindane has been reported to exert CNS toxicity in a few anecdotal cases, in particular in small children or after repeated applications in patients with scabies crustosa, and permethrin was distinctly superior to both of these. This is documented by the results obtained in the treatment of 48 children and 56 adults suffering from scabies. Permethrin is recommended in scabies therapy in premature infants, small children, patients with seizures and neurological complications, in treatment failures with lindane entailing the need to repeat the therapy, in scabies crustosa and in pregnant women and nursing mothers."	1	pesticide
2033303	Kinetic study on inhibition of earthworm acetylcholinesterase by carbamate insecticides.	The specific activity parameters of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in adult and immature stages of earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris) were determined. The results show that the tissues of immature and adult stages differ in their affinity rate (Ka) to substrate and maximum enzymic hydrolysis (Vmax). The AChE form of adult stage had higher Vmax value, while the most higher Ka value was shown in the AChE of the immature stage. The studies of inhibition power on the two sources of ACChE indicated that the highest bimolecular inhibition constant value (Ki) was obtained by carbofuran on the AChE of the adult tissues, while aldicarb was the most potent on the immature tissues. The inhibition progress of the AChE by aldicarb was relatively rapid more than the other two tested inhibitors: carbofuran and methomyl.	1	pesticide
2050081	Epizootiology and distribution of transmissible sarcoma in Maryland softshell clams, Mya arenaria, 1984-1988.	Seasonal and geographic studies of transmissible sarcoma in Maryland softshell clams, Mya arenaria, were carried out from 1984 to 1988. Three major epizootics occurred in our sampling location during this time, resulting in prevalences as high as 90%, with comparable mortalities in other high prevalence areas. The disease invaded populations of large adult clams first, later spreading to the small juvenile clam populations. An apparent 2-year cycle was noted with varying seasonal effects. Affected sites tended to be in the main stem of Chesapeake Bay north of Tangier Sound, primarily in the areas where the major harvesting occurs. Several sites, mostly in upstream locations, were consistently free of disease. The epizootiological study supports the interpretation that the disease is infectious exclusively to this species. Regression analysis between sarcoma prevalence and contaminant levels in clam tissues showed a significant correlation (p = 0.0001) between chlordane levels and this disease. No correlations were found with other contaminants that were analyzed.	1	pesticide
2127499	Changes in disposition kinetics of sulphadimidine in response to acute regional liver damage in sheep.	Disposition kinetics of sulphadimidine in sheep, before and after regional liver damage by allyl alcohol, was investigated following a single IV injection (100 mg/kg). Allyl alcohol (12 mg/kg) provoked periportal liver lesion in 60 per cent of the animals. In normal sheep the mean elimination half-life of sulphadimidine was 7.47 +/- 1.09 hours. Liver damage significantly increased this value to 11.68 +/- 1.09 hours. Liver damage by allyl alcohol significantly changed the total body clearance (C1B), the overall elimination rate constant (beta) and the micro-constants k12 and kCl. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) and the micro-constant k21 were not influenced by liver damage. The mean minimum steady-state concentration (Cp[min]) in normal sheep (38.43 micrograms/ml at 24 hours of interval) was found to be higher than previously reported. Liver intoxication significantly increased this value to 94.38 micrograms/ml. It is suggested that the regional liver damage has affected both the elimination and biotransformation of sulphadimidine.	1	pesticide
2132974	Use of an electrostatic sprayer for control of anopheline mosquitoes.	The Electrodyn sprayer was compared with a compression sprayer (Hudson X-pert) for residual application of cypermethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, to control the malaria vectors Anopheles arabiensis Patton and An. funestus Giles in experimental huts at Magugu in Tanzania. The time taken for hut spraying, 2-2.5 min per hut, was similar for both types of sprayer. Two or three huts were treated internally with cypermethrin at 40 or 80 mg a.i./m2 using Electrodyn formulation for comparison with 80 mg a.i./m2 using wettable powder formulation. Each of the twelve huts (including five untreated controls) was fitted with window exit traps and either louvre or verandah traps for mosquito sampling. The Electrodyn sprayer was fitted with a pair of elbowed deflectrodes to direct the positively charged spray droplets onto walls and ceiling. All treatments gave 94-100% mortality-rates of indoor-resting anophelines throughout the evaluation period of 11 weeks post-spray. Reductions of An.arabiensis and An.funestus females by 10-42% and 62-91%, respectively, in rooms and by 72% and 51% in exit traps indicated that cypermethrin deterred mosquitoes from entering the huts. Overall mortality-rates of mosquitoes were 66% of both species in huts treated with 40 mg/m2 Electrodyn, 43% An.funestus and 71% An.arabiensis due to 80 mg/m2 Electrodyn formulation and 49% An.funestus and 64% An.arabiensis due to 80 mg/m2 WP formulation (no significant differences). It is concluded that the Electrodyn sprayer with deflectrodes is a convenient and effective means of residual house-spraying with pyrethroid insecticide for malaria vector control.	1	pesticide
2156370	Toxicology of selected pesticides, drugs, and chemicals. Anticoagulant, cholecalciferol, and bromethalin-based rodenticides.	The control of rodent pests is a continuing goal of mankind. To this end, a multitude of rodenticides have been produced, each designed to kill rodents by exerting their toxic effects on various body systems. As examples, veterinarians have had to manage companion animal poisonings due to anticoagulant, sodium fluoroacetate (compound 1080), thallium, barium carbonate, and zinc phosphide-based rodenticides. Many of these rodenticides were introduced because of their anticipated safety in relation to nontarget species; unfortunately, this has not been the case. Veterinarians must attempt to identify the specific rodenticide involved in poisoning cases. Therapeutic success in these poisonings is often more dependent upon symptomatic and supportive care rather than the use of antidotal therapy.	1	pesticide
2280048	Toxicity of several insecticide formulations against adult German cockroaches (Dictyoptera: Blattellidae).	Toxicity of bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate, hydramethylnon, malathion, propetamphos, propoxur, and pyrethrins against the adult German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.), was investigated. At LD50, cyfluthrin was the most toxic insecticide to adult males (0.53 microgram/g), adult females (1.2 micrograms/g), and gravid females (0.85 microgram/g). Malathion was the least toxic insecticide to adult males (464.83 micrograms/g), adult females (335.83 micrograms/g), and gravid females (275.90 micrograms/g). Males and gravid females were generally more sensitive than nongravid females to the insecticides that we tested. In tests with malathion, however, males were more tolerant. The order of toxicity of the insecticide classes varied among the stages of adult German cockroaches. The order of toxicity for males and nongravid females was pyrethroids greater than pyrethrins = organophosphates (except malathion) greater than carbamates = amidinohydrazone. The order of toxicity for gravid females was pyrethroids greater than pyrethrins = organophosphates (except malathion) greater than carbamates greater than amidinohydrazone. These differences in toxicity suggest that sex differences should be considered when determining insecticide toxicity for German cockroaches.	1	pesticide
2334872	Involvement of fungi and bacteria in enhanced and nonenhanced biodegradation of carbendazim and other benzimidazole compounds in soil.	The relationship between chemical structure and the enhancement of microbial degradation of three benzimidazole compounds in soil was determined. Preapplication of methyl benzimidazole-2-ylcarbamate (carbendazim or MBC), 2-aminobenzimidazole (2AB), and benzimidazole enhanced their degradation upon repeated application (self-enhanced degradation). MBC and 2AB cross-enhanced the degradation of each of these two compounds, whereas benzimidazole did not enhance the degradation of MBC. Thiabendazole (TBZ) did not enhance its own degradation or cross-enhance the degradation of MBC. No increase in the number of MBC-degrading fungi or in the capacity of soilborne fungi to degrade MBC was detected in soil exhibiting enhanced MBC degradation (MBC-history). A sharp increase in esterolytic activity in the microsomal fraction of Alternaria alternata capable of degrading MBC in culture was induced by the presence of MBC in the growth medium. 2AB was the main metabolite of MBC that accumulated in A. alternata cultures and in cell-free preparations. MBC was degraded much faster by mixed bacterial cultures that originated from MBC-history soil than in cultures from MBC-nonhistory soil. Fluctuations in the MBC degrading capacity of mixed bacterial cultures occurred during repeated subculturing of the mixed culture. Inoculation of nonhistory soil with mixed bacterial cultures resulted in enhanced MBC degradation, whereas inoculation with A. alternata did not enhance MBC degradation. It is suggested that while fungi contribute to MBC dissipation in soil, bacteria have a greater role in enhanced biodegradation of MBC in soil.	1	pesticide
2341513	Development of an automated high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the on-line pre-concentration and determination of trace concentrations of pesticides in drinking water.	An automated reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method has been developed for the determination of trace concentrations of propoxur, carbofuran, carbaryl, propham, captan, chloropropham, barban and butylate in drinking water. A 100-ml of sample water is passed through a 3-cm precolumn, packed with 5-microns ODS sorbent, at a flow-rate of 5 ml/min. The HPLC system is then switched to an acetonitrile-water gradient elution program. The analytes, which are concentrated on the precolumn, are eluted and separated on a 25-cm C8 analytical column and determined by measuring the UV absorption at 220 nm. The resolution of analytes is excellent regardless of whether the elution from the precolumn is done unidirectionally or with backflushing. The precolumn can be used repeatedly for at least 30 samples without a significant decrease in efficiency. The total analytical time is 60 min. Tap, distilled, deionized, commercial spring and HPLC-grade waters were analyzed. The lowest detectable concentrations are in the range of 10.10(-12)-460.10(-12) g/ml for the eight pesticides with 100 ml of sample.	1	pesticide
2380482	Effects of in ovo injection of carbamates on chick embryo hatchability, esterase enzyme activity and locomotion of chicks.	Carbaryl and aldicarb, two carbamate pesticides used extensively throughout the United States, are known to act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. We have demonstrated previously that exposure to carbaryl and aldicarb in young chicks caused persistent locomotion alterations with no correlation to esterase inhibition. In this study, we investigated the effects of these carbamates when injected in ovo to chick embryos, at two time periods (days 5 and 15) during incubation. Carbaryl dosed at 45 mg kg-1 egg weight was extremely toxic to the embryos on day 5 of incubation. Hatchability was reduced to 0% as compared to 80% when carbaryl was injected on day 15 of incubation. Aldicarb at 1.5 mg kg-1 egg weight had no major effect on hatchability when injected either on day 5 or day 15 of incubation (hatchability = 90 and 100%, respectively). Plasma, liver and brain esterases were measured in the chick at different time points during incubation and after hatching. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and liver cholinesterase (ChE) were inhibited significantly during incubation in embryos dosed on day 15 with both carbaryl and aldicarb. Liver carboxylesterase was inhibited significantly during incubation with only the carbaryl treatment. All esterase enzyme activities returned to normal after hatching. Plasma ChE and carboxylesterase levels were not affected with either carbaryl or aldicarb treatment from 8 until 47 days after hatching. Neither carbamate had any effect on brain neuropathy target esterase (NTE) activity either during incubation or after hatching. The locomotion of chicks was affected in both treatment groups until 47 days after hatching. This study indicates that carbaryl and aldicarb may cause long-term delayed alterations in the chicks.	1	pesticide
2413407	Chlordecone toxicity: effect of withdrawal of treatment on ATPase inhibition.	Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated P.O with 10 mg/kg/day chlordecone for 10 days. Five rats from control group receiving corn oil and five rats from chlordecone group were sacrificed for tissue preparations. The remaining rats in chlordecone group were withdrawn from treatment and left in cages for 45 days. At 15, 30 and 45 days after withdrawal, 5 rats from each group with equal number of controls were sacrificed. Brain, liver and kidney were removed and subcellular fractions were prepared. Na+-K+, oligomycin-sensitive and oligomycin-insensitive Mg2+ ATPases were determined. Rats treated with chlordecone for 10 days showed a significant reduction of Na+-K+ ATPase activity in brain and kidney. The decreased enzyme activity in kidney but not in brain returned to normal within 15 days of treatment withdrawal. In brain the enzyme activity stayed at reduced level throughout the experimental period. Oligomycin-sensitive Mg2+ ATPase activity in all the tissues was decreased significantly in chlordecone treated rats. The enzyme activity returned to normal levels in all tissues gradually by 30 days of treatment withdrawal. Oligomycin-insensitive Mg2+ ATPase activity was not decreased in any tissue by chlordecone treatment. These results suggest that chlordecone effects on ATPase system are reversible except for Na+-K+ ATPase in brain.	1	pesticide
2426940	1% permethrin cream rinse vs 1% lindane shampoo in treating pediculosis capitis.	The therapeutic efficacy and tolerance of a single application of 1% permethrin cream rinse, applied for ten minutes, and a single application of 1% lindane shampoo applied, as recommended by the manufacturer, for four minutes, against the head louse Pediculus humanus var capitis were compared in a single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Of 573 patients enrolled at eight centers, 559 were assessable for tolerance and 508 for efficacy. Of the 257 patients treated with 1% permethrin cream rinse, 99% were lice free at 14 days; of the 251 patients treated with 1% lindane shampoo, 85% were lice free at 14 days. The difference is statistically significant. For both treatments, adverse experiences were infrequent, mild, and usually difficult to distinguish from the symptoms of head lice infestation. A single ten-minute application of 1% permethrin cream rinse was well tolerated, highly effective, and therapeutically superior to a single four-minute application of 1% lindane shampoo.	1	pesticide
2435068	Influence of chlordecone and mirex exposure on benzo[a]pyrene metabolism of rat-liver microsomes.	The metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) in hepatic microsomes isolated from rats exposed to chlordecone or mirex was compared to that of untreated rats and rats treated with 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) or phenobarbital (PB). Treatment with chlordecone resulted in a two- to three-fold increase in cytochrome P-450 content but the BP-hydroxylase activity per mg microsomal protein was unaffected. Addition of alpha-naphthoflavone (alpha-NF) or chlordecone caused changes in BP-hydroxylase activity indicating that chlordecone-induced cytochromes P-450 were similar to control. H.p.l.c. analyses of BP metabolites confirmed this similarity. Treatment with mirex caused a two-fold induction of cytochrome P-450, and BP-hydroxylase activity expressed per mg microsomal protein was increased 1.3-fold. Addition of chlordecone or alpha-NF caused changes in BP-hydroxylase activity, indicating differences between control and mirex-induced cytochromes P-450. H.p.l.c. analyses of BP metabolites confirmed this difference. Treatment with chlordecone or mirex increased microsomal epoxide hydrolase activity three-fold. Chlordecone accumulated in hepatic nuclei.	1	pesticide
2481745	Induction of cytochrome P-450 isozymes by mirex and chlordecone.	The effect of the insecticides, mirex and chordecone (Kepone), on the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system in C57BL/6N mouse liver microsomes was studied. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with low (6 mg/kg) and high (30 mg/kg) doses of mirex and chlordecone in corn oil for 2 days. For comparison, mice were also treated with either phenobarbital (PB) or 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC). All treatments significantly increased the hepatic microsomal P-450 content over that of controls. Benzphetamine N-demethylase, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase, and acetanilide hydroxylase activities were also determined. Mirex and chlordecone resembled phenobarbital with respect to the induction of monooxygenase activities. Immunoquantitation with antibodies to purified P-450 IIB1 (Pb-induced P-450) and P-450 IA1 (3-MC-induced P-450) indicated that mirex and chlordecone induced P-450 IIB1 in a dose-dependent manner. The high dose of mirex also induced a small amount of a protein cross reacting with the antibody to IA1. The induction of this isozyme did not, however, contribute significantly to the monooxygenase activities measured.	1	pesticide
2482212	Chlorpyrifos: a 13-week nose-only vapor inhalation study in Fischer 344 rats.	Fischer 344 rats were exposed by the nose-only inhalation route to chlorpyrifos vapors at concentrations of 0, 5.2, 10.3, or 20.6 ppb, 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks. The exposure concentrations were limited by the low vapor pressure of chlorpyrifos (theoretical maximum vapor concentration of 25 ppb at 25 degrees C). No treatment-related signs of toxicity or changes in body weights were detected during the course of the study. Urinalysis, hematology, clinical chemistry, organ weights, gross pathologic, and histopathologic evaluations were performed at the end of the study with no treatment-related effects observed. In addition, no differences from controls were noted in plasma, red blood cell, or brain cholinesterase activities. The results of this study indicate that the no-observed-effect level for chlorpyrifos vapor was the highest attainable concentration, 20.6 ppb, in male and female Fischer 344 rats.	1	pesticide
2488029	Preservative effects on the healing rate of rabbit corneal epithelium.	Benzalkonium chloride (BAK), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), chlorhexidine digluconate, thimerosal and polyaminopropyl biguanide were tested for their effects on the rate of corneal epithelial regrowth after mechanical lesions, and BAK and SLS after heptanol-generated lesions in rabbit corneas. Only 1.3% SLS reduced the rate of epithelial healing after three times a day drop application as determined using planar measures of epithelial regrowth. SLS, a common ingredient in soups and shampoos, should be used carefully where a lesion or wound is present in the corneal epithelium.	1	pesticide
2490550	Determination of benzalkonium chloride in contact lens solutions by positive-ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.	Under positive-ion fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometric conditions, benzalkonium chloride (BAK) afforded intense peaks at m/z 304 and 332, corresponding to the intact cations [M--Cl]+ of C12 and C14 homologues, respectively. The use of benzethonium chloride as an internal standard and thioglycerol as a FAB matrix allowed the direct and specific determination of the BAK content (0.004-0.020%) in commercial hard contact lens solutions through the individual assay of the two alkyl homologues. A linear relationship between the homologue concentration and the peak-area ratio was observed over the concentration range 3-180 micrograms ml-1.	1	pesticide
2494798	The effects of 24% paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridylium dichloride) on hemodynamics, blood gases, plasma lactate and plasma catecholamines in dogs.	The cause of death after ingestion of a large dose of paraquat is unclear. We investigated the cardiovascular effects of paraquat injection in 7 dogs that were anesthetized with urethane and alpha-chloralose and maintained on controlled ventilation. After control measurements, paraquat (20 mg/kg) was injected iv. Average concentrations of plasma paraquat were 128 micrograms/ml at 15 min (point 1) and 44 micrograms/ml at 4 hr. The average time of survival was 5.5 +/- 2.2 hr. Comparison was made of control values, 15 min (point 1), and 2.5 +/- 1.0 hr before death (point 2). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (+33%) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (+28%) increased, but no change occurred in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or cardiac output (CO) at 15 min. Mean arterial pressure (-50%) and cardiac output (-61%) decreased, while total vascular resistance (+56%) and PVR (+256%) were increased at point 2. Arterial pH decreased from 7.394 and 7.307 (point 1) to 7.143 (point 2). The concentration of plasma catecholamines and lactic acid increased significantly at both points 1 and 2. Renal, adrenal and myocardial tissues were studied by light and electron microscopy. The outstanding feature was early swelling of mitochondria and disruption of the contents in the presence of intact mitochondrial membrane.	1	pesticide
2519678	Effect of tick control on liveweight gain of cattle in central Zambia.	Field trials were carried out during 1982-86 in two different ecotypes in central Zambia to determine the impact of tick control on the liveweight gain (LWG) of cattle. During the first 2 years of the trial a diamidide acaricide (Amitraz) sprayed at weekly intervals caused periodic depression in LWG in young animals. Thereafter a pyrethroid acaricide (cypermethrin) was used. During the 1984-85 tick season infestations of 50-120 adult Amblyomma variegatum Fabricius in untreated animals caused significant reductions in LWG. From the differences in LWG between treated and untreated cattle, the induced loss in LWG was estimated at 46-61 g per engorged female A.variegatum.	1	pesticide
2559119	Susceptibility status of vectors of Japanese encephalitis to insecticides in south Arcot and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu.	Villages in South Arcot and Tirunelveli districts with high incidence of Japanese Encephalitis were selected for the study of insecticidal resistance to vectors. Culex vishnui and Anopheles hyrcanus group were found to be resistant to DDT (4 per cent for 60 min. exposure) and dieldrin (0.4 per cent for 60 min. exposure) but susceptible to Malathion (5 per cent for 60 min. exposure). So far, this is perhaps the first report of Anopheles hyrcanus group resistant to DDT and dieldrin to be reported from this area. The resistance may be due to extensive use of DDT and HCH for agricultural purposes.	1	pesticide

2588705	[Exposure to residues on plant surfaces following the use of plant pesticides in the greenhouse].	Organosphosphorus and carbamate insecticides are quite often used in greenhouses. They represent a group of active principles of toxicological relevance. Initial residues on the surface of cucumber, tomato and ornamental plants, and half-life periods for residue degradation are outlined for carbendazim, dimethoate, fenazox, malathion, methamidophos and pirimiphos-methyl. Residues on plants, concentration in the air, dermal exposition, and inhibition of serum choline esterase activity are shown for methamidophos and aldicarb, respective reentry times being discussed. On harvest and cultivation in greenhouses, dermal exposition as a rule is more relevant than inhalation.	1	pesticide
2607440	Responses of electroreceptors in the snout of the echidna.	1. This is a report of experiments which provide evidence in support of the existence of an electric sense in the echidna, or spiny anteater Tachyglossus aculeatus. It is the first known example of electroreception in a terrestrial animal. 2. In each of four animals anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose, afferent responses were recorded in dissected filaments of the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve which supplies skin of the upper jaw. Recordings were obtained from a total of forty-seven units identified as electroreceptors, by their responses to weak voltage pulses using focal stimulation of the moist skin surface. 3. In the absence of a stimulus, some receptors had an irregular resting discharge; others were silent. The receptive field for each receptor consisted of a discrete spot. Receptive fields were restricted to the tip of the snout. Cathodal stimulation over the receptive spot was excitatory for the duration of an applied voltage pulse. Reversal of stimulus polarity silenced any on-going activity and was followed by a post-anodal rebound excitation. 4. Receptor threshold was best measured not in air but with the snout immersed in tap water. An electric field was applied between a pair of large plate electrodes on either side of the snout. Threshold for thirty receptors lay in the range 1.8-73 mV cm-1. Measurements of response latency and of conduction path length gave estimates of axonal conduction velocities for the afferent fibres of 10-18 m Receptors responded to sinusoidally changing voltage gradients over the range 0.5-200 Hz with a maximum sensitivity at 20 Hz. 5. In one experiment a receptor site was marked with fine pins. Serial sections of the piece of underlying skin revealed a large mucus-secreting gland at the marked spot. Similar glands in skin of the platypus have previously been shown to be the sites of electroreceptors. 6. In a behavioural experiment an echidna was trained to choose between two identical tap water-filled troughs, one of which had a weak electric field across it. The animal learned to detect field strengths down to 1.8 mV cm-1 which corresponded to threshold for the most sensitive receptor measured in a subsequent electro-physiological experiment. It is concluded that the echidna, like the other Australian representative of the monotremes, the platypus, has an electric sense. It remains to be determined what kinds of sources of electric fields the animal encounters in its normal habitat.	1	pesticide
2654546	Influence of bacterial growth of the overnight culture on the captan- and folpet-induced reversion in the Ames test.	The influence of the stage of bacterial growth of the overnight culture on captan- and folpet-induced reversion in the Ames test was investigated. Tests were performed in order to determine both the number of viable bacteria at different intervals of bacterial growth--in the presence or absence of captan and folpet--and also the number of revertants. Captan or folpet were tested at 5 micrograms per plate, a concentration which had previously showed a mutagenic effect to the TA100 strain. The highest induced reversion was obtained when the bacterial culture used had entered the stationary-phase after 10-14 h, with a titre of at least 10(8) viable cells per ml.	1	pesticide
2663061	Binding of captan to DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli and the concomitant effect on 5'----3' exonuclease activity.	Captan (N-[(trichloromethyl)thio]-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboximide) was shown to bind to DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli. The ratio of [14C] captan bound to DNA pol I was 1:1 as measured by filter binding studies and sucrose gradient analysis. Preincubation of enzyme with polynucleotide prevented the binding of captan, but preincubation of enzyme with dGTP did not. Conversely, when the enzyme was preincubated with captan, neither polynucleotide nor dGTP binding was blocked. The modification of the enzyme by captan was described by an irreversible second-order rate process with a rate of 68 +/- 0.7 M-1 s-1. The interaction of captan with DNA pol I altered each of the three catalytic functions. The 3'----5' exonuclease and polymerase activities were inhibited, and the 5'----3' exonuclease activity was enhanced. In order to study the 5'----3' exonuclease activity more closely, [3H]hpBR322 (DNA-[3H]RNA hybrid) was prepared from pBR322 plasmid DNA and used as a specific substrate for 5'----3' exonuclease activity. When either DNA pol I or polynucleotide was preincubated with 100 microM captan, 5'----3' exonuclease activity exhibited a doubling of reaction rate as compared to the untreated sample. When 100 microM captan was added to the reaction in progress, 5'----3' exonuclease activity was enhanced to 150% of the control value. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that captan acts on DNA pol I by irreversibly binding in the template-primer binding site associated with polymerase and 3'----5' exonuclease activities. It is also shown that the chemical reaction between DNA pol I and a single captan molecule proceeds through a Michaelis complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1	pesticide
2694982	Sporozoite antibodies and malaria in children in a rural area of The Gambia.	Sporozoite antibody levels were measured in a group of children aged one to nine years resident in a rural area of The Gambia, using an ELISA to the repeat peptide (NANP)40. The prevalence and titre of antibodies varied with age but not with sex or ethnic group. Significant variations in prevalence were recorded within a group of adjacent villages. Children who were seropositive at the beginning of the dry season had higher spleen and parasite rates both at this time and at the end of the subsequent rainy season than did seronegative children, suggesting that they were exposed more frequently to infection. However, seropositive children had fewer episodes of fever accompanied by high levels of parasitaemia than did seronegative children, suggesting that they had a greater degree of clinical immunity. No differences were found in seroprevalence rates or in mean antibody titres between children who slept under conventional or Permethrin treated bed nets and those who did not, even though bed nets significantly reduced the number of bites by vector mosquitoes.	1	pesticide
2708990	Residual activity of permethrin on cattle as determined by mosquito bioassays.	The residual effectiveness against laboratory-reared female Anopheles quadrimaculatus mosquitoes of a synthetic pyrethroid (permethrin) applied to cattle was determined. Twenty-four-hour postexposure mortality and the degree of successful blood engorgement were determined by exposing mosquitoes for 10 min to cattle. Three replicated assays were conducted and mortality determined at 1, 2, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days after each treatment with an oil-based formulation of permethrin (DeLice) or with an emulsifiable concentrate (Atroban) applied at label rates. Mosquito mortality ranged from 79 to 85% (1 day postapplication) to 12-38% (21 days postapplication).	1	pesticide
2731661	Inhibition of human serum complement activity by diisopropylfluorophosphate and selected anticholinesterase insecticides.	Activation of the human complement (C') system, a major line of defense against infections, requires the participation of serine esterases. Since the widely used anticholinesterase insecticides inhibit serine esterases, the present study evaluated potencies of carbaryl, carbofuran, dichlorvos, and paraoxon to inhibit C' activities of a panel of normal human sera. C'-mediated lysis of sheep red cells was measured with a modified assay (1) incorporating suboptimal concentrations of sensitizing antibody and (2) exhibiting increased sensitivity to serine esterase inhibitors. Test chemicals were added to diluted sera 2 hr prior to incorporation into C' reaction mixtures. Potencies to inhibit C' and serum cholinesterase (CHE) were compared to potencies of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a potent serine esterase inhibitor and a standard probe for C' esterases. At 0.5 to 3.0 mM, carbaryl, carbofuran, dichlorvos, and DFP produced a dose-dependent inhibition of lysis, whereas paraoxon was not inhibitory. On a molar basis, carbaryl was three times more potent than DFP, and inhibited lysis 15-25 and 26-45% at 1.0 and 3.0 mM, respectively. Carbofuran, dichlorvos, and DFP were equipotent. Mean IC50's for inhibition of CHE (a marker for occupational exposure to organophosphates and carbamates) by DFP, paraoxon, dichlorvos, carbofuran, and carbaryl were 1.0 X 10(-8), 4.1 X 10(-8), 1.0 X 10(-7), 3.3 X 10(-6), and 1.8 X 10(-5) M, respectively. Potencies of the insecticides to inhibit CHE did not predict absolute or relative potencies to inhibit serum C' activity.	1	pesticide
2748709	Studies on concentration of halogen derivatives in herbal products from various regions of Poland.	The studies covered evaluation of levels of halogen derivative pesticides (p,p'-DDT and its metabolites p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE, as well as HCH, DMDT, aldrin and dieldrin) in herbal raw materials picked up in various regions of Poland in 1983. Qualitative analyses have been carried out with the TLC method whereas for quantitative analyses the GLC method has been applied. It has been found that the most frequently occurring are p,p'-DDT and its metabolites. The highest concentrations of these compounds have been observed in herbs from Lower Silesia and from the Bydgoszcz regions. Also in the region of Białystok concentrations of these compounds are generally higher than in other parts of Poland. Other pesticides have been found in a lesser number of herbal raw materials and in considerably lower concentrations.	1	pesticide
2756375	Pesticide residues in groundwater in The Netherlands: state of observations and future directions of research.	In the first stage of a programme of sampling and analysis for pesticide residues in groundwater in The Netherlands, the upper groundwater below four vulnerable soils was analysed for nearly 2,5 years in eight sampling rounds. Of 18 compounds analysed, including some metabolites, 1,3-dichloropropene, aldicarb, ethoprophos dinoseb, metamitron, atrazine, desethyl- and desisopropylatrazine, metolachlor and ethylenethioureum were repeatedly detected in the groundwater in concentrations above 0.1 micrograms.dm-3, the limit for pesticides in drinking water set by the EC. These observations were made below fields with potatoe-, maize- and bulb flower culture, all on low-humic to moderately humic sandy soils. No residues were found below a cracked light clay on a sandy subsoil. On the locations sampled evidence was found for complete in situ removal in the upper groundwater of 1,3-dichloropropene, high persistence of aldicarb residues and partial in situ degradation of dinoseb.	1	pesticide
2764708	In vitro covalent binding of the pyrethroids cismethrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin to rat liver homogenate and microsomes.	Phenobarbital-induced rat liver homogenate and microsomes were used to study covalent binding of 14C-labelled (at the alcohol moiety) cismethrin, 14C-labelled (at the alcohol and acid moieties) cypermethrin, and 14C-labelled (at the alcohol and acid moieties) deltamethrin. Covalent binding was dependent on pyrethroid concentration. With liver homogenate, inhibition of esterases by tetraethylpyrophosphate and of mitochondrial respiration by rotenone or potassium cyanide only slightly altered the covalent binding level. With microsomes, inhibition of cytochrome P-450 and mixed function oxidases by carbon monoxide and piperonyl butoxide reduced the covalent binding so far as to be nearly absent. Eighty percent inhibition of epoxide hydrolase decreased the covalent binding by 50%. The comparison of data between alcohol and acid labelling of the same pyrethroid suggested that, in vitro, the whole molecule is bound to proteins and that hydrolysis can occur afterwards. The experiments stress the role of cytochrome P-450-dependent monoxygenases in the covalent binding process.	1	pesticide
2790299	Recovery facilitation of malathion-intoxicated freshwater fish by exposure to hypertonic environment.	The possibility of recovery in a hypertonic environment (10-40% NaCl) was investigated in the freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus acutely intoxicated with the pesticide Malathion (40 mg/l). Survival was significantly higher in 15 g/l NaCl, with a shorter time required to recover posture and swimming, although 20% of recovered animals died on subsequent days. Exposure to a hypertonic environment plus pesticide did not protect the animals. Fish exposed to air until they became unresponsive recovered faster in freshwater than in a hypertonic environment. It is concluded that a hypertonic environment only facilitates recovery and that although osmotic mechanisms may explain the results, other possibilities remain to be investigated.	1	pesticide
2861033	Binding of insecticides to serum proteins in mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis).	Incubation of various organochlorine insecticides with mosquitofish serum leads to their association with, primarily, the vitellogenin/lipoprotein and albumin fractions. A significant variation in the quantity of each insecticide bound in the particular fractions was observed. Binding appeared to increase with compounds of increasing polarity, suggestive of protein binding. Preincubation of serum with endrin or aldrin significantly reduced the quantity of [3H]DDT subsequently bound while the reverse was not observed. Although the reason for the apparent quantitative decrease in binding is unknown, the reduction in binding of a particular xenobiotic, due to the presence of a second, has serious toxicological implications.	1	pesticide
2888582	Hepatic metabolism of cyclodiene insecticides by constitutive forms of cytochrome P-450 from lower vertebrates.	1. Multiple forms of cytochrome P-450 were separated from the hepatic microsomes of untreated male rats, pigeons (Columbia livia), razorbills (Alca torda), puffins (Fratercula arctica), and rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii), using anion exchange chromatography and DEAE-cellulose. 2. In some cases cytochrome P-450 forms were further purified on hydroxylapatite and carboxymethyl-sephadex columns. 3. Considerable differences in the distribution of forms between these five species were evident from elution profiles on DEAE cellulose, and on analysis of the cytochrome P-450 containing pools by SDS-PAGE. 4. The metabolism of two organochlorine compounds, aldrin and the dieldrin analogue HCE, were studied in (a) intact microsomes and (b) reconstituted systems containing cytochrome P-450, from each of the five species. 5. In spite of their close structural similarity, significant differences were found between the two substrates in the distribution of catalytic activity between the cytochrome P-450 isozymes of each species.	1	pesticide
2906685	The effects of selected rice and soybean pesticides on the eggs of Psorophora columbiae.	Twenty-five pesticides used in the production of rice and soybeans in Texas were tested in the laboratory to determine their toxicity to the eggs of Psorophora columbiae. A reduction in hatching rate occurred when eggs were treated with a herbicide formulation containing thiobencarb and with one containing a tank mixture of propanil and molinate. A carbaryl formulation induced hatching of eggs prior to their exposure to the hatching stimulus. Reduced survival to second instar of larvae hatching from treated eggs was observed with insecticide formulations of acephate, carbofuran, malathion, methyl parathion and toxaphene; a fungicide formulation of triphenyltin hydroxide and the tank mixture of the herbicides, propanil and molinate.	1	pesticide
2918686	Effects of a commercial malathion dip preparation on the cellular and humoral immune response of BALB/c mice.	Because of the widespread use of malathion as a treatment for ectoparasitism, a study was undertaken to determine the effects of a malathion dip preparation on the BALB/c mouse immune system. Mice were treated with either 2% (recommended dosage) or 8% solutions of malathion or a water control. The cellular immune response was evaluated by in vitro exposure of lymphocytes to mitogens, and the humoral immune response was assessed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify antibody production against sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Responses to the mitogens and to the SRBC were not significantly different between 2% and 8% malathion treated and water treated mice. Results indicated that malathion did not affect these two aspects of the mouse immune system when used as a 2% or 8% dipping solution.	1	pesticide
2925011	Investigations of amitraz neurotoxicity in rats. III. Effects on motor activity and inhibition of monoamine oxidase.	The formamidine pesticide amitraz (AMZ) produces many behavioral and physiological changes in rats. We examined the dose effect and time course of AMZ on motor activity, monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity to evaluate possible neurochemical mechanisms for the behavioral effects of AMZ. For motor activity studies, male Long-Evans hooded rats were tested in photocell activity measurement devices. AMZ produced dose-related decreases in motor activity of rats allowed free access to food and rats maintained at a stable body weight through food restriction. Lowest effective doses of AMZ tested were 1-3 mg/kg, administered 20 min before testing. AMZ appeared to be about three times more potent in food-restricted rats, indicating that amount of body fat may play a significant role in the pharmacokinetics of AMZ. Motor activity returned to control levels over 4-5 days after dosing with 100-200 mg/kg AMZ, whereas recovery was evident the day after administration of low doses (1-30 mg/kg). Inhibition of MAO was measured in whole brain of rats sacrificed at various times after dosing with AMZ. Only greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg AMZ inhibited MAO, which was measurable within 2 hr of dosing and lasted up to 7 days. AMZ appeared to be more selective for type B MAO when given in vivo, although MAO-A was also inhibited at doses greater than or equal to 300 mg/kg. However, no selectivity was indicated by the IC50 values determined in vitro (IC50 = 31 and 28 microM for MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively). AMZ produced only negligible inhibition of AChE at the highest doses administered in vivo or at 10 mM in vitro. These data indicate that while AMZ does inhibit MAO, the dose range over which it produces this action is much higher than that which suppressed motor activity. Thus MAO inhibition is probably not responsible for AMZ-induced alterations in motor activity.	1	pesticide
2980190	Observations on the susceptibility of Ctenocephalides felis (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) to malathion and permethrin in Tanzania.	Laboratory-reared Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche) adults were tested with 0.5% malathion and 0.5% permethrin, using the standard WHO methods. After 24 h exposure to malathion (3.6 mg/cm2), 92% of the fleas died. The LT50 for malathion was approximately 8 h. Permethrin (0.45 mg/cm2) produced 100% mortality of exposed insects after 24 h while with a higher dose (0.9 mg/cm2) all fleas died after 8 h exposure. LT50 for the two doses of permethrin were 7.7 and 1.05 h, respectively. The failure of the diagnostic dose of malathion to kill 100% of the population was attributed to resistance. Permethrin is a suitable pesticide for controlling fleas of domestic animals in Tanzania.	1	pesticide
3058170	Effect of chemical germicides on the integrity of hemodialyzer membranes.	Epidemiologic investigations of bacteremia in dialysis patients by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) identified an association with the use of dialyzers disinfected with a specific chemical germicide. A collaborative study by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was conducted to determine the effect of dialyzer disinfectants on five types of dialyzer membranes: three cellulosic (Cuprophan, cellulose acetate, cuprammonium rayon); and two synthetic (polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile). The disinfectants tested were: 4% formaldehyde; Renalin; Cidex Dialyzer; Sporicidin HO; Warexin; and RenNew-D. Water was the control. Dialyzers were reprocessed up to 15 times. Each reprocessing consisted of rinsing, air-leak testing, filling with fresh disinfectant, and storing for 2 to 4 days. After 15 reprocessings or air-leak failure, each dialyzer was microbiologically challenged for membrane integrity. Membranes exposed to Renalin, Cidex Dialyzer, and water passed all tests. Cellulosic membranes exposed to Warexin failed all tests after 2 to 9 reprocessings. Cellulose acetate membranes exposed to Sporicidin HD failed microbiologic testing. One polysulfone dialyzer exposed to RenNew-D and one exposed to 4% formaldehyde failed microbiologic testing. These results and those obtained from epidemiologic studies suggest that membrane integrity testing (e.g. an air-leak test) should be an integral part of dialyzer reprocessing.	1	pesticide
3075379	In vivo immunosuppression by synthetic pyrethroid (cypermethrin) pesticide in mice and goats.	Cypermethrin toxicity was produced in mice by intra-peritoneal injection of the pesticide at 50 mg/kg body weight per day for 26 days, and in goats by drenching with cypermethrin at 41.6 mg/kg body weight per day for 30 days. The status of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was assessed by the 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) skin sensitivity test. The results indicated significant depression of CMI in the cypermethrin-treated mice and goats. In addition, the humoral immune reaction of the goats intoxicated with cypermethrin was estimated by enumeration of the plaque-forming B-lymphocytes. The rate of plaque formation in the lymphocyte suspension of cypermethrin-treated goats was significantly reduced and the diameter of the plaques was also significantly lower than in that of control animals. The results indicated that cypermethrin suppressed both CMI and the antibody-forming ability of lymphocytes. This immunosuppressive action of cypermethrin is being reported for the first time.	1	pesticide
3083808	The biochemical genetics of permethrin resistance in the Learn-PyR strain of house fly.	"Permethrin resistance in the Learn-PyR strain of house fly was examined in four genetically derived substrains, each being homozygous for a different ""resistant"" autosome of the Learn-PyR strain. The resistance of these derivative strains was characterized toxicologically and biochemically. The relative levels of resistance to permethrin conferred by each autosome were 5 greater than 3 greater than 1 greater than 2. Three factors were associated with resistance: (1) increased mixed-function oxidase (MFO) activity associated with elevated levels of cytochrome P-450, cytochrome b5, and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (P-450 reductase) activity; (2) target-site insensitivity (kdr); and (3) decreased cuticular penetration. Permethrin resistance factors on chromosome 1 consisted of a piperonyl butoxide (PB)-suppressible mechanism correlated with increased levels of cytochromes P-450 and b5; on chromosome 2, a PB-suppressible mechanism associated with elevated amounts of cytochrome P-450; on chromosome 3, decreased cuticular penetration, kdr, and increased amounts of P-450 reductase activity; and on chromosome 5, a largely PB-suppressible mechanism correlated with elevated levels of cytochrome P-450 and P-450 reductase activity."	1	pesticide
3086564	Kinetics of carbaryl and malathion in combination in the rat.	The disposition and metabolism of pesticides used in combination, especially carbaryl and malathion, is of considerable toxicological importance. Radioactivity was rapidly absorbed from the rat gastrointestinal tract (GIT) following the administration of 0.25 ml of 10 mg/kg [14C]carbaryl (0.80 microCi), 10/10 mg/kg [14C]carbaryl/malathion (0.80 microCi), 10 mg/kg [14C]malathion (1.03 microCi), or 10/10 mg/kg [14C]malathion/carbaryl (0.86 microCi). The. administration of carbaryl or malathion, individually and in combination, followed a two-phase elimination model. The presence of malathion decreased the rate constants of absorption and beta-phase elimination of [14C]carbaryl. In the mean time, the length of the distribution phase and the area under the curve of [14C]carbaryl were decreased by malathion administration. Although [14C]malathion's absorption half-life was unchanged in the presence of carbaryl, increases were noted in the length of the distribution phase, beta-phase elimination half-life, and area under the curve for malathion when administered simultaneously with carbaryl. Both combinations caused an increase in 14C activity to be deposited in the fat as compared to the respectively labeled pesticide. However, only malathion increased the concentration of [14C]carbaryl remaining in the GIT tissues after the administration of the combined pesticides. The subcellular distribution of the liver indicated that the highest activity was present in the cytosol. These pesticides and their combinations were excreted primarily by the kidney, followed by the lung and the intestinal route. Although there was no alteration in the metabolic pathways due to the combinations, an increase in malaoxon and malathion diacid concentration in urine was observed after the administration of [14C]malathion/carbaryl as compared to [14C]malathion. The results from this study revealed that the combination of these pesticides altered fundamental pharmacokinetic parameters, which may explain some of the toxicities associated with exposure to these chemicals in combination.	1	pesticide

Nineteen workers conducting mixing and high-volume airblast applications of the organophosphorus pesticide malathion were monitored simultaneously by biological monitoring and fluorescent tracer evaluation of dermal exposure. Complete 72-hr urine samples were collected and analyzed for dimethylthiophosphate and dimethyldithiophosphate metabolites. Dermal exposure was measured through the addition of a fluorescent tracer to the tank mix, subsequent examination of the skin surface under long-wave ultraviolet light, and fluorescence quantification with a video imaging system. Dermal exposure to applicators was correlated highly with total metabolite excretion (r = 0.91). Mixer exposure was not correlated significantly (r = 0.73) because of wide scatter in the data and the small number of workers monitored. Applicator exposures were more than 3 times higher than mixer exposures, reflecting the high exposure potential inherent in airblast spraying. Exposure to regions protected by gloves or clothing was more than 75% of total exposure for both mixers and applicators. These results provide evidence that the fluorescent tracer technique is a valid methodology for measuring relative levels of dermal exposure during agricultural work activities. The technique also holds promise as a quantitative procedure for evaluating the effectiveness of engineering control strategies and protective clothing performance.	1	pesticide
3210218	Prevention of blowfly strike on sheep by cypermethrin.	Merino ewe lambs (n = 500) were used in a trial to assess the efficacy of cypermethrin in preventing blowfly strike on sheep. Three hundred of these lambs were treated with 300 mg cypermethrin each and run as a separate flock. One hundred lambs were used as untreated controls and a further 100 lambs were treated topically with a larval growth regulator as treated control animals. It was found that the synthetic pyrethroid afforded total protection for 3 weeks against strike by Lucilia cuprina. The blowfly challenge was heavy, and 26% of the untreated control animals were struck in the 4 week trial period.	1	pesticide
3396790	The effects of type I and II pyrethroids on motor activity and the acoustic startle response in the rat.	Recent data have demonstrated that the in vivo effects of low dosages of two pyrethroids, cismethrin and deltamethrin, can be differentiated. Two behavioral tests, locomotor activity and the acoustic startle response (ASR), were utilized to separate the behavioral actions of Type I and II pyrethroids using permethrin, RU11679, cypermethrin, RU26607, fenvalerate, cyfluthrin, flucythrinate, fluvalinate and p,p'-DDT. Dosage-effect functions for all compounds were determined for both figure-eight-maze activity and the ASR in the rat. All compounds were administered po in 1 ml/kg corn oil 1.5-3 hr prior to testing. All compounds produced dosage-dependent decreases in locomotor activity. The Type I compounds, permethrin and RU11679, along with p,p'-DDT, increased amplitude and had no effect on latency to onset of the ASR. In contrast, the Type II pyrethroids, cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, and flucythrinate, decreased amplitude and increased the latency to onset of the ASR. Fenvalerate increased the amplitude, had no effect on latency, but unlike the other compounds tested, increased ASR sensitization. Fluvalinate had no effect on any measure of the ASR. These data provide further evidence of the differences between the in vivo effects of low dosages of Type I and II pyrethroids, and extend the findings of our previous work to other representatives of the two classes of pyrethroids.	1	pesticide
3400277	Human dose-excretion studies with pyrethroid insecticides cypermethrin and alphacypermethrin: relevance for biological monitoring.	1. Dose-excretion studies with cypermethrin (as a 1:1 cis/trans mixture) and alphacypermethrin (one of the two disastereoisomer pairs which constitute cis cypermethrin) were carried out with, in each case, two volunteers per dose level. The studies included (a) single oral alphacypermethrin doses of 0.25 mg, 0.50 mg and 0.75 mg followed by repeated alphacypermethrin doses at the same levels, daily for five days, (b) repeated oral cypermethrin doses of 0.25 mg, 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg daily for five days, and (c) a single dermal application of 25 mg cypermethrin to the forearm. Urine was monitored for the free and conjugated 3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid before and after dosing. 2. Metabolism and rate of excretion of a single oral dose of alphacypermethrin was similar to that of cis cypermethrin, on average, 43% of the dose was excreted as the cyclopropanecarboxylic acid in the first 24 h urine. There was no increase in urinary metabolite excretion when alphacypermethrin was administered as a repeated oral dose. Subjects excreted, on average, 49% of the dose as the cyclopropanecarboxylic acid in the subsequent 24 h periods after dosing. 3. There was no increase in the urinary cyclopropanecarboxylic acid excretion when cypermethrin was administered as a repeated oral dose. Subjects excreted, on average, 72% of the trans isomer dose and 45% of the cis isomer dose respectively in the subsequent 24 h periods after dosing. 4. Approximately 0.1% of the applied dermal dose of 25 mg cypermethrin was excreted within 72 h as the urinary cyclopropanecarboxylic acid. No conclusions can be drawn from such urinary excretion data as to the concentration of cypermethrin and its metabolites in the skin or other organs, or the possibility of other routes of metabolism or excretion.	1	pesticide
3415221	Bacterial metabolism of carbofuran.	Fifteen bacteria capable of degrading carbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl methylcarbamate) were isolated from soil samples with a history of pesticide application. All isolates were gram negative and were oxidase- and catalase-positive rods; they occurred singly or as short chains. All of the identified isolates belonged to one of two genera, Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium. They were separated into three groups based on their mode of utilization of carbofuran. Six isolates were placed in group I; these isolates utilized carbofuran as a sole source of nitrogen. Seven isolates were placed in group II; these isolates utilized the pesticide as a sole source of carbon. Isolates of both groups I and II hydrolyzed carbofuran to carbofuran phenol. Two isolates, designated group III, also utilized carbofuran as a sole source of carbon. They degraded the pesticide more rapidly, however, so up to 40% of [14C]carbofuran was lost as 14CO2 in 1 h. The results suggest that these isolates degrade carbofuran by utilizing an oxidative pathway.	1	pesticide
3415898	Prolonged suxamethonium-induced neuromuscular blockade associated with organophosphate poisoning.	We report a patient, exposed to Malathion during agricultural work, who suffered a prolonged apnoea after the administration of suxamethonium. He had a normal phenotype (E1u E1u), but an extremely low plasma cholinesterase activity. The diagnosis was made by assaying cholinesterase activity and analysing the enzymic components by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel slabs. The results indicated that the apnoea was a result of the low activity of plasma cholinesterase induced by Malathion.	1	pesticide
3524461	Mapping of the triazine binding site to a highly conserved region of the QB-protein.	A number of herbicide classes, including the s-triazines and ureas (atrazine, diuron) inhibit photosynthetic electron transport via a direct interaction with the QB-protein. This protein, also known as the 32-kDa protein or herbicide binding protein, is believed to bind the plastoquinone QB, which functions as the second stable electron acceptor at the reducing side of Photosystem II. The site of covalent attachment of the photoaffinity herbicide analog azido-[14C]atrazine to the QB-protein of spinach chloroplast thylakoid membranes has been determined. Two amino acid residues are labeled; one residue is methionine-214, the other lies between histidine-215 and arginine-225. Both residues are within a region of the amino acid sequence which is highly conserved between the QB-protein and the L and M reaction center proteins of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata and R. sphaeroides. This region includes the site of a mutation which results in diuron resistance in Chlamydomonas reinhardi (valine-219). However, this region is well removed from point mutations at phenylalanine-255 (which gives rise to atrazine resistance in C. reinhardi) and at serine-264, (which results in extreme atrazine resistance in C. reinhardi and naturally occurring weed biotypes). The patterns of labeling and mutation imply that the quinone and herbicide binding site is formed by at least two protein domains.	1	pesticide
3541392	The metabolism of fungicides.	Of the three main groups of pesticides (insecticides, fungicides and herbicides), fungicides have probably the longest history, dating back to the accidental discovery in 1882 of Bordeaux mixture and the value of copper-based preparations for the control of vine downy mildew disease. In more recent times a wide range of fungicides have become available, including compounds with not only protectant but systemic activity, and total world-wide sales in 1983 were estimated at 2.8 billion dollars. This review attempts to summarize the current state of knowledge as it relates to the metabolism in animals and plants of examples of several of the major fungicide groups. Specifically the metabolism of maneb, mancozeb, zineb, captan, chlorothalonil, benomyl, triadimefon, triadimenol and cymoxanil are discussed.	1	pesticide
3555754	Inhibition of yeast respiration and fermentation by benomyl, carbendazim, isocyanates, and other fungicidal chemicals.	The inhibition of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevesiae) metabolism by fungicidal chemicals was investigated. Glucose- or ethanol-dependent yeast respiration was measured with an oxygen electrode, and manometric determination of carbon dioxide release was used to measure fermentation. Both respiration and fermentation were inhibited more by benomyl than by identical molar concentrations of its breakdown product, carbendazim. Butyl isocyanate, another benomyl breakdown product, inhibited respiration more but inhibited fermentation less than the parent compound. Of the isocyanates tested, hexyl isocyanate was the most inhibitory towards both activities. Captan was more active and iprodione less active than benomyl. Because benomyl rapidly broke down to carbendazim when it was prepared in 80% ethanol, only 59% of the dissolved benomyl was intact when it was added to yeast to determine its effect on respiration or fermentation.	1	pesticide

The association between exposure to low dose malathion, after its aerial application to 13,000 square miles in the San Francisco Bay area, and the occurrence of birth defects and low birthweight was examined using newborn hospital discharge data and vital records. No biologically plausible pattern of association was found. Limitations in the data and analysis are discussed.	1	pesticide
3628175	Malathion induced alterations in the lipid profile and the rate of lipid peroxidation in rat brain and spinal cord.	Malathion, known as a low toxic pesticide, is frequently used in the third world. Neurotoxic manifestations of malathion were evaluated on various lipids and lipid peroxidation in different brain areas following intraperitoneal injections (150 mg/kg body weight for 7 consecutive days) to albino rats. Clinical investigations show that malathion produced hypomotor activity and hyperthermia. Lipid components were differently affected by this pesticide, where total lipids and phospholipids were diminished in the spinal cord and brain stem, respectively. Increased contents of cholesterol were found in the cerebellum and spinal cord. Also, total lipids were increased in the cerebellum. The cholesterol/phospholipids ratio was increased in the cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord. Rate of lipid peroxidation was found to be increased in all parts of the brain following malathion intoxication.	1	pesticide
3655189	The effects of various soil factors and amendments on the degradation of pesticide mixtures.	Soil disposal is the most common method of handling dilute pesticide wastes. The effects of several soil factors on the degradation of a pesticide mixture were investigated. Atrazine, captan, carbaryl, 2,4-D, diazinon, fenitrothion, and trifluralin were studied under varying laboratory conditions of soil type, pH, moisture content, organic matter content, microbial activity, and pesticide concentration. Of the variables investigated, pesticide concentration was the single most important factor with degradation rates much slower at high (1000 ppm) levels of fortification than moderate (100 ppm) levels. Under most conditions, chemical degradation was at least as significant as microbial degradation. Effects of other factors varied considerably and were pesticide dependent.	1	pesticide
3657906	Compatibility of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae with chemical pesticides.	The effects of various insecticides on the mycelial growth, sporulation and conidial germination of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae isolate E9 were studied in the laboratory. Chlorpyrifos was the most toxic organophosphate to mycelial growth and sporulation at all concentrations. Temephos, malathion and leptophos were highly toxic to sporulation while malathion was the most inhibitory to germination. The carbamates, carbofuran, methomyl and oxamyl were moderately toxic to mycelial growth and sporulation while oxamyl had an adverse effect on germination. The pyrethroids (pyrethrin, permethrin and resmethrin) and the insect growth regulators (diflubenzuron and methoprene) were not inhibitory to the various developmental stages of isolate E9. The chlorinated hydrocarbons (chlordane, lindane and toxaphene) were more deleterious than all other insecticide groups tested. Among the fungicides, benomyl and maneb produced the greatest inhibition.	1	pesticide
3667923	Effect of decontamination procedures on recovery of Nocardia spp.	Exposure to 0.5% N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), 2% NaOH-NAC, or benzalkonium chloride in trisodium phosphate (Zephiran-TSP) was toxic for Nocardia isolates. The number of viable Nocardia cells in a standardized suspension was reduced by 10(2) to 10(6) after a 30-min exposure to 2% NaOH-NAC and by 10(4) or more after a 30-min treatment with Zephiran-TSP.	1	pesticide
3694709	Direct suppression of cultured spleen cell responses by chlordane and the basis for differential effects on in vivo and in vitro immunocompetence.	Immunosuppression by gamma-chlordane was examined by the direct addition of chlordane to cultured spleen cells from untreated B6C3F1 mice. Both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were markedly suppressed upon in vitro exposure. The mixed lymphocyte response and the proliferative response to both B- and T-cell mitogens were significantly suppressed at micromolar concentrations of chlordane. The antibody response to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) was suppressed 90% at 10 microM chlordane. The kinetics of the SRBC response were not altered by chlordane. Addition of chlordane to the antibody cultures on various days indicated an effect at the early stages of the response. Previous studies with chlordane failed to demonstrate immunosuppression following in vivo exposure. The possibility that chlordane was metabolized in vivo to a less immunosuppressive form was studied by examining the effect of the major metabolite, oxychlordane, on the in vitro antibody response and by incubating splenocytes with chlordane and a liver S9 preparation prior to culture with SRBC. Oxychlordane was immunosuppressive by itself, and the activity of chlordane was unaltered in the co-culture experiments. The association of chlordane with serum components was evaluated in vitro in cultures of mouse bone-marrow cells (BMC). The chlordane-induced suppression of [3H]thymidine incorporation by BMC was reversed by the addition of mouse or human serum. In summary, chlordane produces marked suppression of in vitro immune responses via an apparent antiproliferative action. The failure of chlordane to produce in vivo immunosuppression may be related to extensive association of chlordane with serum components.	1	pesticide
3783766	Organochlorine pesticides in human milk from different areas of Kenya 1983-1985.	Residue levels of the chlorinated hydrocarbons p,p'-DDT (2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane), p,p'-DDE (2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), aldrin, dieldrin, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in human milk of Kenyan mothers living in different areas of Kenya. The main organochlorine contaminants found in all the milk samples analyzed were p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE. Great regional differences were found, and mean levels of sum DDT and DDT/DDE ratio ranged from 1.1 to 18.7 mg/kg milk fat and from 0.7 to 5.7, respectively. In general, relatively low residue levels of HCB, alpha-HCH, beta-HCH, aldrin, and dieldrin were detected in 59, 37, 27, 37, and 19%, respectively, of all the milk samples analyzed. Quantifiable residue levels of PCBs and alpha-HCH were not found. The results were examined in relation to differences in living conditions with regard to agricultural activities, dietary habits, and reported use of pesticides in the various sampling areas.	1	pesticide
3798473	The effects of chlordane and rotenone on the alimentary tract of the field cricket.	Cricket nymphs (Acheta pennsylvanicus) were treated with the publicly available, commercial forms of 2 generically termed stomach poisons; chlordane and rotenone, and the resulting tissue changes were histologically compared against a control group. Examination utilized stained and unstained slides of the insect's fat body, alimentary tract, and malpighian tubules. The 2 dissimilar operating insecticides shared common effects such as the storage of dark bodies in the fat body, and the structural disruption of the caecal lining and the malpighian tubules. In addition, a unique effect of chlordane was shown that had not been conclusively recorded before. This insecticide demonstrated the striking ability to rapidly penetrate the internal digestive tract cuticle lining of the proventricular plates resulting in cellular damages. Concern is expressed about chronic exposures to the insecticides, especially chlordane, since it has widespread use and long persistence.	1	pesticide
3819333	Toxicity of some ricefield pesticides to the crayfish P. clarkii, under laboratory and field conditions in Lake Albufera (Spain).	Static toxicities in mature crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) were determined, for eight insecticides, two herbicides and one fungicide which were frequently used in rice cultivation at Lake Albufera in Valencia (Spain). Three concentrations of each product were used: a) The concentration that was recommended by the dealer (in mg/L of active ingredient): Carbofuran 0.40, Carbaryl 0.80, Malathion 0.80, Trichlorfon 0.40, Endosulfan 0.56, Lindane 0.56, Fenitrothion 0.40, Cyfloxylate 0.02, Molinate-Thiobencarb 1.50, Copper Sulfate 0.42, b) Half of the recommended concentration. c) Double of the recommended concentration. In all three of the concentrations tested, only Fenitrothion and Cyfloxylate caused a considerable mortality. The other ones do not actually produce any important effects on P. clarkii in our conditions. Nevertheless, insecticides are more toxic than herbicides or fungicides, as the latter show a rather low toxicity.	1	pesticide
3921591	The relationship between dermal pesticide exposure by fruit harvesters and dislodgeable foliar residues.	Dermal pesticide exposure rates, expressed in mg/hr, by strawberry and blueberry harvesters and dislodgeable foliar pesticide residues were determined in 7 separate field experiments during 1981-1983 in California and Oregon. The pesticides which were studied included captan, vinclozolin, carbaryl, and methiocarb. A positive correlation between these two parameters was found and compared with literature values involving different pesticides and tree crops. The ratio between dermal exposure rate and dislodgeable foliar residues, the units of which are area/time, may have a possible use as an empirical factor for a first approximation of dermal exposure rates by fruit harvesters without the involvement of human subjects.	1	pesticide
3927658	Induction of rat hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes by substituted urea herbicides.	Effects of eight structurally closely related substituted urea herbicides were investigated on the induction of cytochrome P-450 dependent monooxygenase enzyme complex, as well as on two conjugating enzymes after short-term treatment of rats. Liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 content was induced approximately by 50%. Cytochrome P-450 dependent monooxygenase activities showed a great variety depending on the substrate and on the herbicide. Two-18-fold induction was detected with 7-ethoxycoumarin, while up to 8-fold induction was measured with benzo(a)pyrene. Aldrin epoxidase activities were increased up to 3-fold, and aminopyrine N-demethylase activities were only slightly different from the control level. UDP-glucuronyltransferase and glutathione S-transferase activities were enhanced up to 2-fold. The results indicate that chemical structure of the related substituted urea compounds, the number of halogen substituents on their phenyl group exert a strong influence on the induction of monooxygenases.	1	pesticide
3935099	Effect of dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 on resistance of young chickens to organophosphate pesticide challenge.	White leghorn chickens were placed on a diet containing 0, 1000, or 3000 ppb aflatoxin B1 for 7 weeks. At the end of that time, the birds were challenged orally with the organophosphate pesticide malathion. A malathion dose of 215 mg/kg resulted in significant clinical signs of cholinergic poisoning in 4/10, 5/10, and 8/10 birds fed 0, 1000, and 3000 ppb aflatoxin B1, respectively, and the chickens required antidotal atropine 40 min later. Activity of brain cholinesterase was significantly lower than control levels in all birds given this dose of malathion, with activities being 28% +/- 6, 21% +/- 2, and 15% +/- 2 of control values (Mean +/- standard error, N = 5) if fed 0, 1000, and 3000 ppb aflatoxin B1, respectively. Plasma cholinesterase values paralleled those of brain, with significantly more inhibition in samples from birds given 1000 and 3000 ppb aflatoxins with malathion. Brain and plasma cholinesterase activities in birds fed aflatoxins and given a dose of malathion below the threshold for cholinergic signs (125 mg/kg) were also lower than activities in birds given malathion alone. Although aflatoxin alone had no direct effect on the activities of these enzymes, it appears that this mycotoxin may contribute to the esterase inhibition that is a manifestation of the acute toxic effects of malathion in chickens.	1	pesticide
3937849	Organochlorine residues in finfish from Maryland waters 1976-1980.	Organochlorine pesticide and herbicide levels were monitored in samples of a variety of edible finfish harvested from the Maryland section of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries over a five-year period (1976-80). Qualitative and quantitative information was obtained for the various polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), heptachlor, alpha-BHC, chlordane, DDD, DDE, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlorepoxide, lindane, mirex, methoxychlor, aldrin, toxaphene, hexachlorobenzene, kepone and dacthal. In addition to analyses of the flesh of the animals, organochlorine residue levels were determined in roe or gonad tissue of several samples. Striped bass, white perch and yellow perch samples showed significantly higher concentrations of certain of these substances in roe or gonad tissue, especially PCB's, chlordane, DDD and dieldrin. Significantly higher levels of six organochlorine residues were found in the gonad tissue of striped bass; however, similar studies on gonad tissue of American Shad, harvested from the same region, show no such enhancement. Rather, the reverse is true; levels of certain organochlorine residues are higher in flesh tissue. All mean values, and virtually all individual values of organochlorine concentrations in the edible portion of the fish were within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guideline, where such guidelines have been established.	1	pesticide
3964078	Induction of chromosomal aberrations in the Syrian hamster by insecticides tested in vivo.	The insecticides demeton, dimetoat, dichlorovos, endosulfan, trichlorofon, carbaryl, lindane, methoxychlor, propoxur and malathion were examined for their ability to induce chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow cells of the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) treated in vivo. Mutagenicity of commercial preparations was examined at four doses: LD50; 1/2, 1/5 and 1/10 LD50. The positive control was an IP injection of cyclophosphamide to hamsters at a dose of 40 mg/kg body wt. Demeton, dichlorovos and endosulfan gave positive results. Malathion, dimethoate and the mixture of methoxychlor and propoxur were weakly clastogenic; at some doses these compounds induced statistically significant increases in the number of aberrations. Trichlorfon and the mixture of carbaryl and lindane were negative in this test.	1	pesticide
3987597	A comparison of physiological changes in carp, Cyprinus carpio, induced by several pollutants at sublethal concentrations. I. The dependency on exposure time.	Carp were exposed to 10 different pollutants at sublethal concentrations for 6, 24, or 72 hr. Blood, liver, and white muscle samples were taken after the exposure time together with samples of control handled fish. Serum concentrations of glucose, cortisol protein, and cholesterol were determined. Similarly, the liver and muscle glycogen contents were measured. The effects of the following pollutants were examined: aldrin (100 micrograms/liter), atrazine (100 micrograms/liter), DDT (50 micrograms/liter), dieldrin (20 micrograms/liter), endrin (2 micrograms/liter), hexachlorbenzene (100 micrograms/liter), lindane (100 micrograms/liter), methanol (1 ml/liter), 4-N-phenol (100 micrograms/liter), toluene (100 microliters/liter). The rises in serum glucose and cortisol were the most frequent changes occurring after exposure to the pollutants. A decline in plasma protein and cholesterol content was also often observed. Liver glycogen concentration increased first in most cases and was reduced after longer exposure. Muscle glycogen was affected differently, sometimes reduced by exposure to the pollutants. The experimental design allows for the gradual increase in toxicity of the pollutants used regarding the applied concentrations. Furthermore, the aim of the paper is to evaluate the tests for proof of toxicity of those chemicals. The determination of serum glucose and cortisol levels can be proposed as mostly useful. The clearest changes in all parameters were found after treatment with 100 micrograms/liter atrazine and 50 micrograms/liter DDT. When serum glucose and cortisol concentrations were quickly elevated, signs for exhaustion could be seen after 72 hr of exposure.	1	pesticide
4008864	Dermal absorption of pesticides calculated by deconvolution.	Using published human data on skin-to-urine and blood-to-urine transfer of 12 pesticides and herbicides, the skin-to-blood transfer rates for each compound were estimated by two numerical deconvolution techniques. Regular constrained deconvolution produced an estimated upper limit on cumulative dermal absorption of the radiolabel, while minimized deconvolution produced an upper bound on cumulative dermal absorption of parent compound. Dermal absorption rate was largest within 8 h of dosing for all pesticides examined. Only carbaryl showed a lag (3.5 h) in penetration. This may indicate a prolonged transit time through skin or a chemical transformation in skin has occurred. After onset, absorption occurred rapidly with 45% of the 120 h cumulative absorption occurring in 8 h. For parathion and dieldrin, over 50% of the 120 h total absorption occurred in the first 4 h. The deconvolution technique described here permits the calculation of the temporal aspect of dermal absorption for linear systems.	1	pesticide

4049416	Differential cholinesterase inhibition and muscarinic receptor changes in CD-1 mice made tolerant to malathion.	The lethality of organophosphate (OP) cholinesterase (CHE) inhibitors is thought to result from depression of the respiratory center in the brain stem, constriction of and increased secretion by the airways, and paralysis of the respiratory musculature. While tolerance to the cholinergic toxicity of OPs has been well documented, such studies have not included investigations of the brain stem and extrapulmonary airways. In this report tolerance to the insecticide malathion is demonstrated. At 24 hr after 14 daily doses of malathion (400 mg/kg, ip), CHE activities were 27, 26, and 28% of control in striatum (ST), hippocampus (HI), and cortex (CX), respectively, while brain stem CHE activity was 41% of control. In addition, the numbers of muscarinic receptors (Bmax) decreased 30, 20, and 22% in ST, HI, and CX, respectively. In contrast, there was no change in brain stem Bmax. The lack of parallelism between CHE inhibition and Bmax effects in brain stem as compared to all other tissues tested raises questions as to the mechanism(s) by which the respiratory system adapts during repeated OP exposure.	1	pesticide

4998348	Resistance of Pseudomonas to quaternary ammonium compounds. II. Cross-resistance characteristics of a mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Tube dilution experiments showed that benzalkonium chloride (BC)-resistant mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown in the presence of 1,000 mug of BC per ml were at least 20 times more sensitive to polymyxin B and colistin sulfate than the BC-sensitive (BCS) parent strain. BCS cells selected for resistance to 500 mug of polymyxin B per ml remained sensitive to BC. There was little difference in the amount of carbenicillin, gentamicin sulfate, or rifampin needed to prevent growth of either the BCS or BC-resistant (BCR) strains. Growth of BCR cells was inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate at a concentration of 400 mug/ml or less, whereas the BCS strain grew at ethylenediaminetetraacetate levels of 10,000 mug/ml. Phenylmercuric acetate and thimerosal inhibited growth of BCR and BCS cells at concentrations of 10 mug/ml or less. BCR cells were cross-resistant to >1,000 mug/ml concentrations of five other quaternary ammonium compounds, including three with C(16) alkyls and two with alkyl groups of shorter length. The BCS strain was also resistant to >1,000 mug/ml concentrations of the three quaternary ammonium compounds with C(16) alkyl groups but, in addition to BC, was inhibited by 200 mug/ml levels or less of the two quaternary ammonium compounds containing alkyl groups of less than 16 carbon atoms.	1	pesticide
5316852	Insecticide resistance resulting from sequential selection of houseflies in the field by organophosphorus compounds.	"Although cross-resistance in houseflies to the organophosphates has eliminated numerous potentially useful compounds from field use, the ""subgroup"" specificity of this phenomenon has permitted housefly control to be carried out for nearly a quarter of a century by changing from one toxicant to another within this class of insecticides. A question of considerable importance in insect control is whether the development of resistance to one subgroup of organophosphates will be at the expense of resistance to a subgroup applied previously. The development over several years of resistance in a field population selected sequentially by a number of organophosphates was studied. It was observed that the resistance spectrum expanded progressively to include, finally, organophosphates originally thought to belong to more than one subgroup-namely, malathion (resistance greater than 100 times), fenchlorphos (114 times), diazinon (163 times), coumaphos (greater than 100 times), Ciodrin (greater than 100 times), fenthion (18 times) and naled (9.3 times). Resistance to each compound continued to rise to levels considerably higher than those achieved at the time when the field use of the compound ended. The possible coexistence of subgroup cross-resistance in a population is discussed in the light of these results."	1	pesticide

The influence of cellular thiol concentrations on the extent of methylation and the 6-oxygen atom of guanine as a site of methylation.	1. In neutral aqueous solution N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) yields salts of nitrocyanamide as u.v.-absorbing products. With cysteine, as found independently by Schulz & McCalla (1969), the principal product is 2-nitràminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid. Both these reactions liberate the methylating species; thiols enhance the rate markedly at neutral pH values. An alternative reaction with thiols gives cystine, presumably via the unstable S-nitrosocysteine. 2. Thiols (glutathione or N-acetylcysteine) in vitro at about the concentration found in mammalian cells enhance the rate of methylation of DNA markedly over that in neutral solution. 3. Treatment of cultured mammalian cells with MNNG results in rapid methylation of nucleic acids, the extent being greater the higher the thiol content of the cells. Rodent embryo cells are more extensively methylated than mouse L-cells of the same thiol content. Cellular thiol concentrations are decreased by MNNG. Proteins are less methylated by MNNG than are nucleic acids. 4. Methylation of cells by dimethyl sulphate does not depend on cellular thiol content and protein is not less methylated than nucleic acids. Methylation by MNNG may therefore be thiol-stimulated in cells. 5. Both in vitro and in cells about 7% of the methylation of DNA by MNNG occurs at the 6-oxygen atom of guanine. The major products 7-methylguanine and 3-methyladenine are given by both MNNG and dimethyl sulphate, but dimethyl sulphate does not yield O(6)-methylguanine. Possible reaction mechanisms to account for this difference between these methylating agents and its possible significance as a determinant of their biological effects are discussed.	1	pesticide
6136149	The inhibitory effect of some chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides on the ATP-dependent Ca2+ binding of the particulate fraction of the eggshell gland mucosa cells.	The pesticide p-p'-DDT and its persistent metabolite p-p'-DDE cause thinning of the eggshells in several species of birds. In earlier investigations on ducks this thinning was found to be associated with a reduction of the ATP-dependent Ca2+ binding to a homogenate of the shell gland mucosal cells by DDE. The activity of a Ca2+-Mg2+-activated ATPase in the homogenate was also decreased on administration of DDE in vivo. We have therefore investigated the in vitro effects of some other chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides of ecotoxicological interest on the ATP-dependent Ca2+ binding and the Ca2+-Mg2+-activated ATPase activity in a homogenate of the eggshell gland mucosa of the hen and determined the molar concentrations that produced 50% inhibition (=IC50). Several of the investigated compounds, namely toxaphene, chlordane, p-p'-DDD, o-p'-DDE, p-p'-DDT, methoxychlor and PCB (Arochlor 1242), had a similar IC50 to inhibit the Ca2+ binding as p-p'-DDE. Lindane, p-p'-DDA and biphenyl had an IC50 3.3-4 times higher and that of 2.4 D was 13.5 times higher than that of p-p'-DDE. When the IC50 of some of the compounds (p-p'-DDE, PCB, toxaphene, Lindane) was determined that decreased the Ca2+-Mg2+-activated ATPase of the homogenate it was found to be only 18 to 29 per cent of that needed to inhibit the Ca2+ binding by the homogenate. It is therefore probable that some other effect than inhibition of this enzyme is also involved in the Ca2+-binding process and affected by the compounds.	1	pesticide
6153667	Persistence of chlorpyrifos in a mineral and an organic soil.	Chlorpyrifos (Lorsban emulsifiable concentrate) was applied at 3.4 kg AI/ha and incorporated into sand and muck soil contained in small field plots. Soil samples were taken at intervals over 2 yr. Radishes and carrots, seeded yearly, served as indicator crops for absorption of insecticide residues. Samples were extracted and analyzed, by gas-liquid chromatography, for chlorpyrifos, oxychlorpyrifos, and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol. Chlorpyrifos residues declined rapidly, with 50% of the initial application remaining after 2 and 8 wk in sand and muck, respectively, and 4 and 9% after 1 yr. Pyridinol residues increased to 13 and 39% of the initial chlorpyrifos application in sand and muck after 1 and 8 wk, respectively, and declined thereafter. Oxychlorpyrifos was detected in the 2 soils at very low levels only in immediate posttreatment samples. In the first year of the study low levels (less than 0.1 ppm) of chlorpyrifos and the pyridinol were detected in radishes and carrots.	1	pesticide
6161768	Demonstration of major metabolic pathways for chlordecone (kepone) in humans.	The hypothesis that liver is the site of the previously demonstrated chlordecone alcohol formation in man was tested. Human bile obtained from chlordecone-poisoned factory workers contained substantial amounts of free chlordecone, but little free chlordecone alcohol. However, when the same bile specimens were pretreated with beta-glucuronidase before analysis by gas-liquid chromatography, large amounts of chlordecone alcohol appeared, accounting for 75% of total organochlorine compounds. Confirmation of the identity of chlordecone and chlordecone alcohol was made by using gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Whereas biliary chlordecone alcohol was present predominantly as its glucuronide conjugate (93%), chlordecone was excreted primarily as the unaltered compound (72%) with only a small portion conjugated with glucuronic acid (9%). The remaining fraction of the total chlordecone measured in bile appeared to be a stable polar metabolite resistant to beta-glucuronidase. This unidentified metabolite could be converted to free chlordecone only by acid hydrolysis under harsh conditions. In contrast to human bile, rat bile contained only trace amounts of chlordecone alcohol (less than 0.5% of total chlordecone), thus indicating that hepatic metabolism of chlordecone is species-specific. We conclude that in man, the major metabolic route for chlordecone is its reduction in the liver followed by glucuronidation.	1	pesticide
6201755	Neonatal chlordecone exposure impairs early learning and retention of active avoidance in the rat.	"The effect of neonatal exposure of rats to chlordecone on the acquisition and retention of active avoidance was investigated. Pups were trained and tested on one-way (preweaning) and/or two-way (post-weaning) active avoidance tasks. Offspring of Fischer-344 rats were administered 1 mg/pup of chlordecone (SC) dissolved in DMSO on postnatal day 4. Body weights were slightly, but significantly, depressed for chlordecone-exposed males (10-11%) and females (7-8%) during preweaning development. Post-weaning body weights were also slightly depressed by the chlordecone treatment (8% for the males, 7% for the females). For pups trained (day 18) on one-way (small to large compartment) active avoidance (OWA), chlordecone treatment increased the number of trials needed to attain the acquisition criterion; the effect was most pronounced in the males. A 72-hr retention test revealed a sex-dependent effect of chlordecone on response latency during the initial test trials. Acquisition of two-way avoidance (TWA) (days 28-30) was superior in female pups relative to males; chlordecone treatment significantly reduced this sex difference in pups which had prior or no prior OWA training. Perhaps most importantly, however, following prior OWA training, vehicle control pups demonstrated a directional bias to make an avoidance response from a small to a large compartment, whereas chlordecone-treated pups executed their avoidance responses in both directions at comparable rates. Similar evidence indicative of a selective retention deficit also characterized TWA performance when a ""reversal"" procedure was used. A final retention (extinction) session indicated that the chlordecone-treated pups made fewer responses than vehicle-treated controls during the test trials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"	1	pesticide

6334113	Laboratory trials of five rodenticides for the control of Mesocricetus auratus Waterhouse.	The efficacy of five rodenticides for use in bait against the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus Waterhouse) was investigated in the laboratory. The species proved to be resistant to warfarin (up to 0.5%) and difenacoum (0.005%), but brodifacoum (0.005%) gave complete mortality after three days' feeding. Calciferol (0.1%), though toxic, was significantly unpalatable. Zinc phosphide (5.0%) presented in a choice test for two days against unpoisoned feed gave 100% mortality, and appears to be the most suitable of these compounds for the control of M. auratus in the field.	1	pesticide
6364457	Sublethal toxicity of malathion on the proteases and free amino acid composition in the liver of the teleost, Tilapia mossambica (Peters).	Exposure of fish to a sublethal concentration of malathion showed a significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. The levels of protease were markedly elevated with a consequent increase in most of the free amino acids. However, the levels of glutamic acid and valine, phenylalanine and methionine complex remained unchanged, while aspartic acid showed a marked drop. These changes are discussed in relation to the sublethal stress induced by malathion.	1	pesticide
6418539	Pesticide-induced complete and partial chromosome loss in screens with repair-defective females of Drosophila melanogaster.	Commercial preparation of fungicides (captan and maneb), herbicides (bromacil, paraquat, picloram, and 2,4-D), and insecticides (carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, DDT, diazinon, carbofuran, and permethrin) were tested for their ability to induce complete and partial chromosome losses in Drosophila melanogaster males. In an attempt to identify the mutagenic activity of pesticides that are toxic in low concentrations in Drosophila, these males were mated with mus-302 repair-defective females. The rationale for this mating scheme is based on the repair of genetic damage in Drosophila sperm by maternal enzymes in the zygote, and on the reports that there may be increases in the frequency of recovery of chemically induced chromosome losses in crosses of treated males with mus-302 females. Verification of the sensitivity of this screen in this study came from significant increases in the frequency of chromosome loss induced by low concentrations of the positive controls, N-nitrosodimethylamine and methyl methanesulfonate. Of the 13 pesticides, the insecticide chlorpyrifos induced a significant amount of ring-X chromosome loss. No pesticide induced a significant increase in partial chromosome loss. These results are discussed in relation to the usefulness of repair-defective mutants in screens for genetic damage in Drosophila and other higher eukaryotes by chemicals that are toxic or cause sterility at low concentrations.	1	pesticide
6422586	Evaluation of acute toxicity of carbaryl and malathion to freshwater teleosts, Channa punctatus (Bloch) and Heteropneustes fossilis (Bloch).	Bioassay tests evaluated the acute toxicity of carbaryl (a carbamate) (50% wettable powder, W.P.), and malathion (50% E.C.) (an organophosphate) (50% emulsifiable concentrate; E.C.) by determining their LC50 and the acute toxic ranges for 24, 48 and 72, and 96-h exposure to Channa punctatus (Bl.) and Heteropneustes fossilis (Bl.). Regression equations and slope functions were determined for different time periods. The relative susceptibility of the fish, the relative toxicity, and the safe concentrations of these biocides were calculated on the basis of LC50 for 96 h. C. punctatus was found to be relatively more susceptible to both the compounds, while malathion was the more toxic of the two biocides.	1	pesticide
6449525	Human health effects of selected pesticides, chloroaniline derivatives.	The health effects of two pesticides, chlordimeform and propanil, are discussed. Chlordimeform and 2-methyl-4-chloroaniline, a major metabolite of chlordimeform, cause severe hemorrhagic cystitis in humans. In cats, however, only a mild effect on the bladder was noted. The herbicide propanil has produced chloracne in humans, and along with 3,4-dichloroaniline, hyperkeratosis in rabbits. The contaminants 3,4,3',4'-tetrachloroazobenzene and 3,4,3',4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene are responsible for the chloracnegenic characteristics of propanil, 3,4-dichloroaniline, and methazole.	1	pesticide
6508289	Morphological and genetic effects of benomyl on polyploid brewing yeasts: isolation of auxotrophic mutants.	An enrichment procedure after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and exposure to the fungicide benomyl yielded mutants auxotrophic for several amino acids from two polyploid Saccharomyces spp. Benomyl treatment was found to have a marked morphological effect on polyploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae, causing cells to adopt a characteristic doublet cell morphology in which buds are nearly as large as the parent cells. Experiments in which nuclear division was monitored in benomyl-induced doublet cells by Giemsa nuclear staining demonstrated an unusual sequence of cytological events which culminated in the formation of binucleate parental and mononucleate bud components. The frequency of formation of doublet and binucleate parent cells was found to depend on the strain employed and the benomyl concentration administered.	1	pesticide

Two plague transmitting malagasy fleas S. fonquerniei and X. cheopis, caugh in the cities of Tananarive, Antsirabe-Betafo and Ampefy were tested in conformity with WHO standards. These two fleas were resistant to DDT, dieldrin and malathion, Moreover, X. cheopis from the cities of Tananarive and Antsirabe-Betafo were resistant fenitrothion and propoxur. It seems to be first description of simultaneous resistance to organochlorinated, organophosphorylated and carbamylated products. The authors discuss the causes of this exceptional phenomenon, and make some suggestions in order to obtain a better knowledge and understanding of this phenomenon.	1	pesticide
6527399	Acute diquat intoxication. Interest of its repeated determination in urine and the evaluation of renal proximal tubule integrity.	A 33-year old farmer ingested approximately 300 ml of a 20% solution of diquat along with about 80 mg flunitrazepam. The patient presented neurological (coma grade I), digestive (oro-pharyngeal erosions, ileus), hepatic (cytolysis), hematological (thrombopenia) and renal (tubular dysfunction) signs. Plasma creatinine did not exceed 1.22 mg/dl (upper normal value), but retinol binding protein level in urine (a marker of renal tubular dysfunction) reached a value of 337 mg/d (normal values less than 300 micrograms/d). Its level returned to normal value 18 days after the ingestion. Four hours after the poisoning, diquat level in blood amounted to 10.4 mg/l, but its level was below the detection limit (0.2 mg/l) 6 hours later. In urine, however, diquat was detected until day 13. The following therapy was applied: ventilation (FiO2:0.21), gastro-intestinal lavage, hemoperfusion, anti-oxidants and prolonged forced diuresis. The patient made an uneventful recovery. intestinal washout must be applied with caution since an ileus is a classical complication of diquat poisoning. Hemoperfusion was found to be of little value. The interest of prolonged application of forced diuresis is suggested by the detection of diquat in urine for about 2 weeks along with the presence of biological signs of renal tubular dysfunction.	1	pesticide
6624478	Effects of phenoxyherbicides and glyphosate on the hepatic and intestinal biotransformation activities in the rat.	The effects of phenoxyacid herbicides 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and MCPA (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid), clofibrate, and glyphosate on hepatic and intestinal drug metabolizing enzyme activities were studied in rats intragastrically exposed for 2 weeks. The hepatic ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity increased about 2-fold with MCPA. Both 2,4-D and MCPA increased the hepatic epoxide hydrolase activity and decreased the hepatic glutathione S-transferase activity. MCPA also increased the intestinal activities of ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase and epoxide hydrolase. Glyphosate decreased the hepatic level of cytochrome P-450 and monooxygenase activities and the intestinal activity of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase. Clofibrate decreased the hepatic activities of UDPglucuronosyltransferase with p-nitrophenol or methylumbelliferone as the substrate. Also 2,4-D decreased the hepatic activity of UDPglucuronosyltransferase with p-nitrophenol as the substrate. MCPA decreased the intestinal activities of UDPglucuronosyltransferase with either p-nitrophenol or methylumbelliferone as the substrate. The results indicate that phenoxyacetic acids, especially MCPA, may have potent effects on the metabolism of xenobiotics. Glyphosate, not chemically related to phenoxyacids, seems to inhibit monooxygenases. Whether these changes are related to the toxicity of these xenobiotics remains to be clarified in further experiments.	1	pesticide
6626247	Hypolipidemia and peroxisome proliferation induced by phenoxyacetic acid herbicides in rats.	Male Wistar rats were treated daily by gavage with two phenoxy herbicides, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)(100-200 mg/kg body wt) and 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) (100-200 mg/kg body wt), and with the chemically different glyphosate N-phosphonomethyl glycine (300 mg/kg body wt) 5 days per week for 2 weeks. A hypolipidemic drug, clofibrate [ethyl-2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionate], which is structurally related to phenoxy acids, was used as a positive control (200 mg/kg body wt). 2,4-D and MCPA had several effects similar to those of clofibrate: all three compounds induced proliferation of hepatic peroxisomes, decreased serum lipid levels, and increased hepatic carnitine acetyltransferase and catalase activities. 2,4-D and MCPA, but not clofibrate, decreased lipoprotein lipase activity in the adipose tissue to about a third of the control value but did not change the lipoprotein lipase activity in the heart muscle. The data suggest that these compounds cause hypolipidemia not by enhancing the storage of peripheral lipids in adipose tissue but by preferentially increasing lipid utilization in the liver. Glyphosate caused no peroxisome proliferation or hypolipidemia, suggesting that these effects are associated with the structural similarity between phenoxy acid herbicides and clofibrate.	1	pesticide
6642106	Unidirectional cross-tolerance between the carbamate insecticide propoxur and the organophosphate disulfoton in mice.	Previous studies have shown that subchronic treatment of mice with the organophosphate insecticide, disulfoton, or the carbamate insecticide, propoxur, leads to the development of tolerance to their toxicity. Tolerance to disulfoton was due to a decrease in the number of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, while tolerance to propoxur appeared to be due to an induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. In the present study we investigated if cross-tolerance between disulfoton and propoxur would occur. Cross-tolerance was evaluated by measuring acute toxicities, cholinesterase and carboxylesterase inhibition and hypothermic and antinociceptive effects. Mice tolerant to propoxur were cross-tolerant to the hypothermic and anticholinesterase effects of disulfoton. Similarly, when mice were pretreated with the microsomal enzyme inducer, phenobarbital, the toxicity of disulfoton was decreased. Mice made tolerant to disulfoton were cross-tolerant to the organophosphate chlorpyrifos, but were more sensitive than controls to the toxicity of propoxur. The acute toxicity of the organophosphate malathion was also increased in disulfoton-tolerant mice. Propoxur is metabolized by mixed function oxidases and possibly by a carboxylesterase. While hepatic microsomal enzymes appeared to be unchanged in disulfoton-tolerant mice, brain and liver carboxylesterase activities were significantly inhibited. Pretreatment of mice with the specific carboxylesterase inhibitor triorthotolylphosphate is known to greatly potentiate the toxicity of malathion and also potentiated, to a lesser extent, the toxicity of propoxur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1	pesticide
6658817	Toxicity of deltamethrin and cypermethrin to the larvae of the diamond-back moth, Plutella xylostella L.	Two photostable pyrethroids, deltamethrin and cypermethrin, were tested against fourth instar larvae of a susceptible (S) strain and a resistant (R) strain of Plutella xylostella L. by topical application. Both compounds were very effective against the S strain larvae (LD50 for deltamethrin = 0.0014 micrograms/larva, LD50 for cypermethrin = 0.0046 micrograms/larva, at 48 h). However, the R strain collected from the field was greater than 1600-fold resistant to deltamethrin and greater than 30 000-fold resistant to cypermethrin. Deltamethrin was poorly synergised with piperonyl butoxide in the S strain, but much stronger synergism was obtained in the R strain. The possible reasons for such high levels of resistance and the potential use of synergised pyrethroids in Plutella control programmes are discussed.	1	pesticide
6668611	Oxychlordane, HCS-3260, and nonachlor in birds: lethal residues and loss rates.	Oxychlordane reached lethal levels in birds given dietary dosages of HCS-3260 (70.75% cis-chlordane and 23.51% trans-chlordane) at 6 levels from 50 to 500 ppm. Oxychlordane ranged from 9.4 to 22.1 ppm in brains of cowbirds (Molothrus ater), grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), and red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) that died on dosage and from 1.3 to 4.8 ppm in sacrificed birds, providing a clear diagnostic separation. Among starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), however, oxychlordane ranged from 5.0 to 19.1 ppm in brains of birds that died, significantly lower than in the other species, and from 1.4 to 10.5 ppm in sacrificed birds, overlapping the levels in those that died. Lethal levels, therefore, begin near 5.0 ppm, as in a previous study in which oxychlordane itself was fed, but the data from starlings emphasizes the need for confirmatory necropsy findings in diagnosis of poisoning. Nonachlor had a very low order of toxicity, killing only 1 of 12 birds dosed at 100 ppm for 35 d; 3 others died and 1 was incapacitated during a short period of food deprivation. Lethal levels of oxychlordane were present in the brains of birds that died. Oxychlordane accumulated in the bodies of birds on dietary dosage of HCS-3260 in proportion to dosage and time, but did not approach equilibrium at the levels (10, 50, and 100 ppm) that were fed. Loss rates of oxychlordane from HCS-3260, oxychlordane, or technical chlordane dosages (the last in a previous study) did not differ significantly from each other; respective half-lives were 57, 63, and 74 d. Residues of cis-chlordane in birds fed HCS-3260 were consistently lower than oxychlordane during the accumulation period and declined abruptly when dosage ceased; individual variation was high.	1	pesticide

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the nervous tissue (brain) of the fish Brachydanio rerio was significantly inhibited by exposure to the organophosphorus (OP) pesticide, malathion. The inhibition was dose- as well as time-dependent. The fish survived even when the activity of the enzyme was inhibited by 90%. There was a significant recovery in the activity of AChE when malathion stress was lifted.	1	pesticide
6780991	Comparative evaluation of four registered acaricides for field control of northern fowl mites on caged laying hens.	Carbaryl and tetrachlorvinphos provided longer lasting control of northern fowl mites, Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Canestrini and Fanzago), than did coumaphos or malathion when the materials were applied to caged laying hens as aqueous sprays. The average duration of residual control was ca. 5 weeks for carbaryl, 4.3 weeks for tetrachlorvinphos, 3.5 weeks for coumaphos, and 2 weeks for malathion. No presumptive evidence of northern fowl mite resistance to carbaryl or tetrachlorvinphos was encountered. In contrast, malathion often failed to produce satisfactory control, and difficulty with adequate dispersion of coumaphos wettable powder was noted.	1	pesticide
6829031	An impurity of malathion alters the morphology of rat lung bronchiolar epithelium.	Oral administration of O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate (OOS), an impurity in technical malathion, caused morphological changes in the bronchiolar epithelium of rat lungs. OOS-treated rat lungs had fewer but larger Clara (non-ciliated) cells than lungs from control rats given either corn oil or purified malathion. Moreover, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in bronchopulmonary lavage fluid was significantly higher in OOS than in control rats. We interpret these data to mean that OOS, and/or its metabolite(s) causes a lesion in the lung. Because of the widespread agricultural use of technical malathion, future work should address the significance of our findings and the possible toxic effect of OOS on lung tissue.	1	pesticide

Three groups of sheep, gimmers, ewes with lambs and rams, were sprayed at fortnightly intervals from June to September 1980 with a 0.1 per cent emulsion of permethrin in an attempt to control damage caused by Hydrotaea irritans. Complete prevention of damage was not achieved but the number of sheep affected and the severity of lesions present in affected sheep was significantly reduced in comparison with untreated control groups. Permethrin treatment was also judged to be valuable in the management of rams with head wounds. Variation in susceptibility with age was noted, gimmers being the most severely affected and a breed variation was apparent in the rams which was related to the character of horn present.	1	pesticide
7175098	Observations on the influence of water and soil pH on the persistence of insecticides.	The pH-disappearance rate profiles were determined at ca. 25 degrees C for 24 insecticides at 4 or 5 pH values over the range 4.5 to 8.0 in sterile phosphate buffers prepared in water-ethanol (99:1 v/v). Half-lives measured at pH 8 were generally smaller than at lower pH values. Changes in half lives between pH 8.0 and 4.5 were largest (greater than 1000x) for the aryl carbamates, carbofuran and carbaryl, the oxime carbamate, oxamyl, and the organophosphorus insecticide, trichlorfon. In contrast, half lives of phorate, terbufos, heptachlor, fensulfothion and aldicarb were affected only slightly by pH changes. Under the experimental conditions described half lives at pH8 varied from 1-2 days for trichlorfon and oxamyl to greater than 1 year for fensulfothion and cypermethrin. Insecticide persistence on alumina (acid, neutral and basic), mineral soils amended with aluminum sulfate or calcium hydroxide to different pH values and four natural soils of different pH was examined. No correlation was observed between the measured pH of these solids and the rate of disappearance of selected insecticides applied to them. These observations demonstrate the difficulty of extrapolating the pH dependent disappearance behaviour observed in homogeneous solution to partially solid heterogeneous systems such as soil.	1	pesticide
7232257	Influence of glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) on performance and selected parameters in broilers.	Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl)glycine), Roundup, the herbicide formulation of the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate, was fed to male and female broiler chickens at 0, 60.8, 608, and 6080 ppm from 1 day to 21 days of age. Parameters measured were body weights, bone weights and lengths, bone ash, inorganic phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and calcium to phosphorus ratios of tibiotarsus bones. There were no consistent significant differences among the control, 60.8, or 608 ppm groups in any of the parameters measured. The addition of glyphosate to feed at the highest dose level (6080 ppm) reduced body weight approximately 50% in both sexes as early as 7 days of age, and this reduction continued for the rest of the experiment. The highest dose level increased the calcium and magnesium content of the tibiotarsus bones.	1	pesticide
7330625	Mortality study of workers employed at organochlorine pesticide manufacturing plants.	"A retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the mortality of workers employed in the manufacture of the chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides, chlordane, heptachlor, dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane (DDT) and aldrin/dieldrin/endrin. Four manufacturing plants were selected for study, and each cohort included all workers employed for at least six months prior to January 1964. The entire study group totaled approximately 2,100 individuals. Vital status ascertainment for these cohorts ranged from 90 to 97% complete; the cut-off date for follow-up was 31 December 1976. In general there were too few deaths in this study on which to draw any meaningful conclusions. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes in each cohort was below the expected level (100) and ranged from 66 to 82, probably a reflection of the ""healthy worker effect."" For ""all malignant neoplasms"" the SMRs ranged from 68 to 91 and for respiratory cancer from 55 to 132. In the aldrin/dieldrin/endrin cohort observed deaths due to pneumonia and ""other respiratory diseases"" were significantly above the expected number of deaths. For several other specific cancer sites (stomach in plant 1, esophagus, rectum, liver and lymphatic/hematopoietic system in plant 3), the observed deaths were more than the expected number and should be examined in more detail. It is recommended that these cohorts be followed for several more years and the mortality patterns be reexamined."	1	pesticide
7342942	A survey for resistance in cattle ticks to acaricides.	A survey was made from late 1976 to late 1977 to determine the extent of resistance to acaricides in the cattle tick Boophilus microplus in Queensland. Questionnaires and requests for samples of ticks were forwarded to more than 900 randomly selected stock owners in the tick infested area which had been divided into 4 regions. Far North, Coastal North, Coastal Cental and South East. The response measured by the number of tick samples tested was 43%. The prevalence of resistance to organophosphorus (OP) compounds was highest in South East where 96% of the farms had OP-resistant ticks and 95% had the Biarra strain and lowest in Far North where 12% of the farms had OP-resistant ticks and 10% had the Biarra strain which was the predominant one in all regions. The highest percentages of the Ridgelands strain (35%) and the Tully strain (30%) occurred in Coastal North. The South East had the highest percentage of Mt Alford (30%). Although chlorinated hydrocarbons were banned for use in control of ticks in 1962, 49% of the farms in South East had some ticks resistant to dieldrin but in Far North it was only 2%. DDT-resistant ticks, which because of cross resistance to synthetic pyrethroids will affect the future use of this group, were present on 8% of the farms in both Coastal North and Coastal Central and 3% in South East and Far North. No resistance to the amidines, chlordimeform, chloromethiuron or amitraz was found.	1	pesticide

The poisons (warfarin, coumatetralyl, difenacoum, brodifacoum, bromadiolone, calciferol and zinc phosphide) were all toxic at the concentrations normally used against Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus and all were palatable. Trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy of these poisons in the field, but it seems likely that, if used in suitable bait formulations, they would all be useful for the practical control of S. hispidus.	1	pesticide
7494817	A new method for estimating dermal absorption from chemical exposure. 3. Compared with steady-state methods for prediction and data analysis.	PURPOSE: This paper compares unsteady-state and steady-state methods for estimating dermal absorption or analyzing dermal absorption data. The unsteady-state method accounts for the larger absorption rates during short exposure times as well as the hydrophilic barrier which the viable epidermis presents to lipophilic chemicals. METHODS: Example calculations for dermal absorption from aqueous solutions are presented for five environmentally relevant chemicals with molecular weights between 50 and 410 and log10Kow between 0.91 and 6.8: chloromethane, chloroform, chlordane, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, and dibenz(a,h)anthracene. Also, the new method is used to evaluate experimental procedures and data analyses of in vivo and in vitro permeation measurements. RESULTS: In the five example cases, we show that the steady-state approach significantly underestimated the dermal absorption. Also, calculating permeability values from cumulative absorption data measured for exposure periods less than 18 times the stratum corneum lag time will overestimate the actual permeability. CONCLUSIONS: In general, steady-state predictions of dermal absorption will underestimate dermal absorption predictions which consider unsteady-state conditions. Permeability values calculated from data sets which include unsteady-state data will be incorrect. Strategies for analyzing in vitro diffusion cell experiments and confirming steady state are described.	1	pesticide
7501664	Environmental pollutants alter taste responses in the gerbil.	Taste and smell are chemical senses that play a crucial role in food selection. Damage to taste and smell receptors can impair food intake, nutritional status, and survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 11 environmental pollutants (nine insecticides and two herbicides) on electrophysiological taste responses in the gerbil. Integrated chorda tympani (CT) recordings were obtained from gerbils to a range of tastants before and after a 4-min application of 1 of 11 environmental pollutants. The taste stimuli were: sodium chloride (100 mM), calcium chloride (300 mM), magnesium chloride (100 mM), HCl (10 mM), potassium chloride (500 mM), monosodium glutamate (MSG) (50 mM), sucrose (100 mM), fructose (300 mM), sodium saccharin (10 mM), quinine HCl (30 mM), and urea (2 M). The nine insecticides included organophosphorous, carbamate, and pyrethroid insecticides. The seven organophosphorous insecticides tested were: acephate, carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos oxon, demeton, malathion, and methamidophos. The carbamate insecticide carbaryl and the pyrethroid insecticide fenvalerate were also tested. Two herbicides, paraquat and glyphosate, were tested, and dose-response curves for each of these two herbicides were also determined. All of the 11 insecticides and herbicides had an effect on some of the taste stimuli tested. Application of 10 mM methamidophos exhibited the greatest amount of suppression on the 11 taste solutions. Each taste stimulus was significantly suppressed with the exception of 2 M urea. Herbicides paraquat and glyphosate also reduced responses to several tastants. These data indicate that environmental pollutants can modify taste responses in the gerbil.	1	pesticide
7525225	Atrazine toxicity on hydromineral balance of fish, Tilapia mossambicus.	The chronic effects of atrazine on total body weight, hydration level, and serum inorganic electrolytes in the tissues of freshwater fish, Tilapia mossambicus, were studied. Significant changes were observed in the tissues indicating the disturbances in the hydromineral balance of the fish as a consequence of atrazine.	1	pesticide
7529165	Influence of different factors on the adsorption of carbofuran (2, 3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl-N-methyl carbamate) on soils.	The effects of exchangeable cations (H+ and Na+), autoclaving, organic matter, cationic and anionic surfactants, and temperature on the adsorption of carbofuran on two different types of soils were studied. The adsorption isotherms for all effects/treatments were in close agreement with the Freundlich equation and yielded S-shaped isotherms. The amount of carbofuran adsorbed in all cases was higher in Jhansi red loam soil than in Pilibhit sandy loam soil and was related to organic matter content, clay content, CaCO3 content, surface area, and cation-exchange capacity of the soils. The adsorption on soils from both sites follows the order H soil-->Na soil-->natural soil at 25 degrees C-->autoclaved soil-->soil from which organic matter had been removed-->cationic surfactant-->anionic surfactant-->natural soil at 50 degrees C and was in accordance with Freundlich constant K values and distribution coefficient Kd values. The adsorptive capacity of carbofuran for organic matter and clay content for both the Jhansi and the Pilibhit soils was also evaluated by calculating Kom and Kc values, and it was found that the carbofuran adsorption was better correlated with clay content than with organic matter content of soils. On the basis of adsorption isotherms, various thermodynamic parameters such as the thermodynamic equilibrium constant Ko, standard free energy (delta G zero) changes standard ethalpy (delta H zero) changes, and standard entropy (delta S zero) changes have been calculated in order to predict the nature of isotherms.	1	pesticide
7540311	A method evaluating population risks from chemical exposure: a case study concerning prohibition of chlordane use in Japan.	The proposed method evaluating population risks from chemical exposure is based on estimation of the individual variabilities in the internal concentration of the chemical of concern and estimation of the magnitude of toxic effect caused at a given internal concentration. We assume a log-normal distribution for individual variability and propose loss of life expectancy (LLE) as a measure of the magnitude of toxic effects. We applied it to the evaluation of the governmental action of prohibiting the use of chlordane as a termiticide in Japan. Because the method is applicable to both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic chemicals, the cancer risk due to chlordane and the noncancer risk due to chlorpyrifos, a major substitute, were evaluated and compared. The estimated values of risk represented in terms of LLE are 0.10 days for residents of untreated houses, 1.9 days for residents of treated houses, and 4.4 days for termite control workers when chlordane is used, and 0, 2.8, and 31 days when chlorpyrifos is used, respectively. From the result of the case study, we can see that the prohibition of chlordane is not necessarily effective in reducing risk.	1	pesticide
7540533	The effects of a chronic application of chlorpyrifos on the macroinvertebrate fauna in an outdoor artificial stream system: species responses.	An outdoor artificial stream system was used to examine the effects of a chronic application of the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos on the invertebrate fauna of the system. Two replicate streams received chlorpyrifos for 21 days at the high dose (5 micrograms.liter-1) or low dose (0.1 microgram.liter-1) or only the carrier solution with which chlorpyrifos is mixed for commercial sale (1,1,1-trichloroethane and xylene). Streams behaved as replicates with respect to five water quality parameters. Seventy-four nonchironomid and 24 chironomid taxa were recorded during the study. The number of taxa and total invertebrate abundance were significantly reduced by both high and low doses of the pesticide. Shannon-Weaver diversity was also reduced by both high and low doses of the pesticide whereas evenness increased in high dose streams. The individual abundances of 9/36 nonchironomid and 13/19 chironomid taxa were significantly reduced by pesticide application; the abundance of one taxon, the gastropod Physastra, increased. The biomass of periphyton in the streams was affected by changes in the abundance of chironomid grazers and Physastra, and the slow recovery of grazers from mortality due to chlorpyrifos appeared to result in a higher biomass of periphyton in the high dose streams than in controls and low dose streams 21 days after dosing ceased. Inverse relationships between the amounts of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) and the sum of the numbers of all taxa of collector-gatherers (as well as numbers of four individual taxa) were interpreted as disruption of the processing of FPOM by members of this trophic group following toxic effects of chlorpyrifos. The implications of the study for biological monitoring of the direct and indirect effects of chronic doses of chlorpyrifos on streams are discussed, and the use of chironomid larvae and periphyton in biomonitoring to detect pesticide impacts is particularly recommended.	1	pesticide
7548951	Anopheles arabiensis and An. gambiae chromosomal inversion polymorphism, feeding and resting behaviour in relation to insecticide house-spraying in Tanzania.	Differential responses of the mosquitoes Anopheles arabiensis and An. gambiae sensu stricto to house-spraying with DDT or lambda-cyhalothrin were evaluated in relation to chromosomal inversion polymorphism, feeding and resting behaviour of these malaria vectors in Tanzania. Blood-fed mosquitoes from pit traps outdoors, exit traps on windows and indoor-resting catches were identified cytogenetically and the chromosomal inversion frequencies compared between samples and species. Their outdoor-resting behaviour was assessed by a mark-release-recapture experiment and by determining the proportion of freshly blood-fed individuals in exit traps. The source of bloodmeals was analysed by an ELISA method. Endophagic females of An. arabiensis were more likely than those of An.gambiae to exit from a house on the night of blood-feeding. Only in one out of three villages was there evidence that chromosomally distinct individuals within a species had different preferences for resting sites. There were indications, but not conclusive evidence, that mosquitoes caught indoors or outdoors had a tendency to return to the same type of resting site. In villages sprayed with either insecticide, the mean age of the vector populations was greatly reduced, compared with those in the unsprayed villages. An.arabiensis females exited from DDT sprayed houses after blood-feeding, whereas with lambda-cyhalothrin those exiting were mostly unfed and there was a decline in the human blood index. The excitorepellency of DDT was perceived as a disadvantage, whereas lambda-cyhalothrin apparently had more impact on malaria transmission by An.arabiensis.	1	pesticide
7565891	Herbicide-induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes evaluated by the single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay.	The genotoxicity of the herbicides, alachlor, atrazine, maleic hydrazide, paraquat and trifluralin has been evaluated in the single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay by using human peripheral blood lymphocytes. All treatments were conducted with and without the presence of an external bioactivation source (S9 mix). The results indicate that all the herbicides tested are able to give positive results by increasing the comet tail length, which would confirm both the genotoxicity of the herbicides and the sensitivity of the assay in front of these chemicals. Alachlor and atrazine give similar results in treatments with and without S9, while when the S9 mix was not used paraquat and trifluralin genotoxicity was higher. On the other hand, although maleic hydrazide genotoxicity was higher when S9 mix was used at normal pH (7.4), our data show that its genotoxicity depends largely on the pH solution, increasing as the pH decreased.	1	pesticide
7567143	Paraquat and diquat interference in the analysis of creatinine by the Jaffé reaction.	Paraquat and diquat were shown to interfere significantly in the measurement of plasma creatinine by the alkaline picrate (Jaffé) reaction in a young man who ingested a massive dose of a mixture of the 2 herbicides. It is likely that these bipyridylium compounds react in a manner similar but at different rates compared with creatinine in the Jaffé reaction.	1	pesticide
7601496	Susceptibility status of two species of Japanese encephalitis vectors to insecticides in the Thar desert, district Bikaner (Rajasthan).	Susceptibility tests were conducted on the adults of two species of Japanese encephalitis vectors viz., Culex pseudovishnui and C. tritaeniorhynchus against diagnostic doses of DDT, dieldrin, malathion, fenitrothion, propoxur and permethrin at different exposure duration. C. pseudovishnui was found susceptible to permethrin and resistant to dieldrin and propoxur while C. tritaeniorhynchus was found susceptible to permethrin and resistant to DDT, dieldrin, fenitrothion and propoxur. A verification, however, was required with other insecticides for both the species.	1	pesticide
7616191	Field evaluation of alphacypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin against Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in Malaysia.	Alphacypermethrin (Fendona) and lambda-cyhalothrin (Icon) were evaluated against sentinel bloodfed adults and 4th-instar larvae of Aedes aegypti in a housing estate in Malaysia. The impact of both pyrethroids on field populations of Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus were monitored weekly using oviposition trap samples. Both alphacypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin showed adulticidal and larvicidal effects.	1	pesticide
7631489	Effects of endosulfan and amitraz on feedlot performance, carcass yield and meat quality characteristics of Nubian goats.	The pesticides endosulfan and amitraz were fed to 2 groups of Nubian goats (3 goats/group) at 5 mg/kg/d for 36 d to assess their effects on feedlot performance, carcass yield and meat quality. Growth rates, weight gains and feed conversion efficiencies were depressed insignificantly. The endosulfan-dosed group had significantly lower dressing-out percentage and both groups had significant depletions of omental and mesenteric fats. Significant reductions were also seen on body and cavity fats, the latter being severely reduced suggesting more mobilization of cavity fat than body fat. The fat-free body was homogenous with variations in the muscle/bone ratio reflected on carcass cuts. Meat quality was unaffected. Fat was the only chemical component of endosulfan-dosed total lean significantly reduced. In all parameters the effects of endosulfan were more pronounced than those of amitraz.	1	pesticide
7688273	Chlorpyrifos metabolites in serum and urine of poisoned persons.	Concentrations of parent pesticide and corresponding diethylphosphorus metabolites in blood serum and urine were investigated in persons who had ingested a concentrated solution of organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos. The organophosphate poisoning was indicated by a significant depression of blood cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7 and EC 3.1.1.8) activities. Blood and spot urine samples were collected daily after admission of the persons to hospital. Chlorpyrifos was detected only in serum samples in a period up to 15 days after poisoning. In the same samples chlorpyrifos oxygen analogue, chlorpyrifos oxon, was not detected. The presence of diethylphosphorothioate in all serum and urine samples confirmed that part of chlorpyrifos was hydrolysed before its oxidation. The maximum concentrations of chlorpyrifos in serum and of metabolites in serum and urine were measured on the day of admission. The decrease in concentrations followed the first-order kinetics with the initial rate constant faster and the later one slower. In the faster elimination phase chlorpyrifos was eliminated from serum twice as fast (t1/2 = 1.1-3.3 h) as the total diethylphosphorus metabolites (t1/2 = 2.2-5.5 h). The total urinary diethylphosphorus metabolites in six chlorpyrifos poisoned persons were excreted with an average elimination half-time of 6.10 +/- 2.25 h (mean +/- S.D.) in the faster and of 80.35 +/- 25.8 h in the slower elimination phase.	1	pesticide
