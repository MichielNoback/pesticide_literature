9100	39365782	Bio-efficacy of field aged novel class of long-lasting insecticidal nets, against pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors in Tanzania: A series of experimental hut trials.	New classes of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), have been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to control malaria vectors resistant to pyrethroid insecticides. This study was nested in a large-scale cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted (cRCT) in Tanzania. A series of experimental hut trials (EHTs) aimed to evaluate the bio-efficacy of trial LLINs on mosquito indicators most pertinent to malaria transmission over 3 years of use in the community in order to better understand the outcomes of the cRCT. The following field-collected LLINs were assessed: 1) Olyset Plus (combining piperonyl butoxide synergist and permethrin), 2) Interceptor G2 (chlorfenapyr and alpha-cypermethrin), 3) Royal Guard (pyriproxyfen and alpha-cypermethrin), 4) Interceptor (alpha-cypermethrin only) conducted in parallel with 5) a new Interceptor, and 6) an untreated net. Thirty nets of each type were withdrawn from the community at 12, 24, and 36 months after distribution and used for the EHTs. Pre-specified outcomes were 72-hour mortality for Interceptor G2, 24-hour mortality for Olyset Plus, and fertility based on egg development stage for Royal Guard. Overall, Interceptor G2 LLINs induced higher 72-hour mortality compared to standard LLINs of the same age up to12 months (44% vs 21%, OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.9-6.6, p-value < 0.001), and 24-hour mortality was only significantly higher in Olyset Plus when new (OR: 13.6, 95%CI: 4.4-41.3, p-value < 0.001) compared to standard LLINs but not at 12 months (17% vs 13%; OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0-4.3; p-value = 0.112). A small, non-significant effect of pyriproxyfen on Anopheles fertility was observed for Royal Guard up to 12 months (75% vs 98%, OR: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.0-24.9, p-value = 0.951). There was no evidence of a difference in the main outcomes for any of the new classes of LLINs at 24 and 36 months compared to standard LLINs. Interceptor G2 LLINs showed superior bio-efficacy compared to standard LLINs only up to 12 months, and the effect of Olyset Plus was observed when new for all species and 12 months for An. gambiae s.l. only. The pyriproxyfen component of Royal Guard had a short and limited effect on fertility. The decrease in effectiveness of Olyset Plus and Royal Guard LLINs in the EHTs aligns with findings from the cRCT, whereas efficacy of Interceptor G2 lasted for a longer period in the cRCT compared to the EHT. Further investigations are needed to understand the complete scope of chlorfenapyr mode of action. Additional EHT in various contexts will help confirm the residual efficacy of the dual active ingredient LLINs and support the development of longer-lasting nets.	pesticide	new classes of long-lasting insecticidal nets (llins), have been recommended by the world health organization (who) to control malaria vectors resistant to pyrethroid insecticides. this study was nested in a large-scale cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted (crct) in tanzania. a series of experimental hut trials (ehts) aimed to evaluate the bio-efficacy of trial llins on mosquito indicators most pertinent to malaria transmission over 3 years of use in the community in order to better understand the outcomes of the crct. the following field-collected llins were assessed: 1) olyset plus (combining piperonyl butoxide synergist and permethrin), 2) interceptor g2 (chlorfenapyr and alpha-cypermethrin), 3) royal guard (pyriproxyfen and alpha-cypermethrin), 4) interceptor (alpha-cypermethrin only) conducted in parallel with 5) a new interceptor, and 6) an untreated net. thirty nets of each type were withdrawn from the community at 12, 24, and 36 months after distribution and used for the ehts. pre-specified outcomes were 72-hour mortality for interceptor g2, 24-hour mortality for olyset plus, and fertility based on egg development stage for royal guard. overall, interceptor g2 llins induced higher 72-hour mortality compared to standard llins of the same age up to12 months (44% vs 21%, or: 3.5, 95% ci: 1.9-6.6, p-value < 0.001), and 24-hour mortality was only significantly higher in olyset plus when new (or: 13.6, 95%ci: 4.4-41.3, p-value < 0.001) compared to standard llins but not at 12 months (17% vs 13%; or: 2.1, 95% ci: 1.0-4.3; p-value = 0.112). a small, non-significant effect of pyriproxyfen on anopheles fertility was observed for royal guard up to 12 months (75% vs 98%, or: 1.1, 95% ci: 0.0-24.9, p-value = 0.951). there was no evidence of a difference in the main outcomes for any of the new classes of llins at 24 and 36 months compared to standard llins. interceptor g2 llins showed superior bio-efficacy compared to standard llins only up to 12 months, and the effect of olyset plus was observed when new for all species and 12 months for an. gambiae s.l. only. the pyriproxyfen component of royal guard had a short and limited effect on fertility. the decrease in effectiveness of olyset plus and royal guard llins in the ehts aligns with findings from the crct, whereas efficacy of interceptor g2 lasted for a longer period in the crct compared to the eht. further investigations are needed to understand the complete scope of chlorfenapyr mode of action. additional eht in various contexts will help confirm the residual efficacy of the dual active ingredient llins and support the development of longer-lasting nets.	llins, plus, net, pyriproxyfen, alpha-cypermethrin, fertility, standard, mortality, chlorfenapyr, compared
9101	39367967	Comparative transcriptional analysis between susceptible and resistant populations of Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) after malathion exposure.	Aedes aegypti is an important vector of arboviruses, including dengue, chikungunya and Zika. The application of synthetic insecticides is a frequently used strategy to control this insect. Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide that was widely used in Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s to control the adult form of A. aegypti. In situations where resistance to currently used insecticides is detected, the use of malathion may be resumed as a control measure. Many studies have confirmed resistance to malathion, however, comparative studies of differential gene expression of the entire transcriptome of resistant and susceptible insects are scarce. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of resistance to this insecticide in this species is extremely important. In this paper, we present the first transcriptomic description of susceptible and resistant strains of A. aegypti challenged with malathion. Guided transcriptome assembly resulted in 39,904 transcripts, where 2133 differentially expressed transcripts were detected, and three were validated by RT-qPCR. Enrichment analysis for these identified transcripts resulted in 13 significant pathways (padj < 0.05), 8 associated with down-regulated and 5 with up-regulated transcripts in treated resistant insects. It was possible to divide the transcripts according to the mechanism of action into three main groups: (i) genes involved in detoxification metabolic pathways; (ii) genes of proteins located in the membrane/extracellular region; and (iii) genes related to DNA integration/function. These results are important in advancing knowledge of genes related to resistance mechanisms in this insect, enabling the development of effective technologies and strategies for managing insecticide resistance.	pesticide	aedes aegypti is an important vector of arboviruses, including dengue, chikungunya and zika. the application of synthetic insecticides is a frequently used strategy to control this insect. malathion is an organophosphate insecticide that was widely used in brazil in the 1980s and 1990s to control the adult form of a. aegypti. in situations where resistance to currently used insecticides is detected, the use of malathion may be resumed as a control measure. many studies have confirmed resistance to malathion, however, comparative studies of differential gene expression of the entire transcriptome of resistant and susceptible insects are scarce. therefore, understanding the molecular basis of resistance to this insecticide in this species is extremely important. in this paper, we present the first transcriptomic description of susceptible and resistant strains of a. aegypti challenged with malathion. guided transcriptome assembly resulted in 39,904 transcripts, where 2133 differentially expressed transcripts were detected, and three were validated by rt-qpcr. enrichment analysis for these identified transcripts resulted in 13 significant pathways (padj < 0.05), 8 associated with down-regulated and 5 with up-regulated transcripts in treated resistant insects. it was possible to divide the transcripts according to the mechanism of action into three main groups: (i) genes involved in detoxification metabolic pathways; (ii) genes of proteins located in the membrane/extracellular region; and (iii) genes related to dna integration/function. these results are important in advancing knowledge of genes related to resistance mechanisms in this insect, enabling the development of effective technologies and strategies for managing insecticide resistance.	transcript, insect, aegypti, malathion, resistance, insecticide, gene, resistant, important, susceptible
9102	39370610	Mps1-Targeted Molecular Design of Melatonin for Broad-Spectrum Antifungal Agent Discovery.	Melatonin, a multifunctional class of natural products, has demonstrated antifungal activity, making it a promising candidate for developing antifungal agents. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mps1) within fungal pathogens has a target inhibitory effect of melatonin in fungi. We use a virtual screening strategy to design melatonin derivatives based on the melatonin-Mps1 targeting model. Of these, a multiflorane-substitution compound M-12 emerges as a potent antifungal agent, exhibiting broad-spectrum efficacy against eight phytopathogenic fungal species, and effectively reduces the severity of tomato gray mold, Fusarium head blight in wheat, Sclerotinia stem rot in rape, and peach brown rot. M-12 half-maximal effective concentration values (5.50 μM against Botrytis cinerea, 5.21 μM against Fusarium graminearum, 10.6 μM against Rhizoctonia solani, and 9.02 μM against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) are better than those of commercial broad-spectrum fungicide azoxystrobin (55.0, 23.2, 46.5, and 17.7 μM, respectively). Antifungal activity of enantiomer (S)-M-12 (5.02 μM) is significantly greater than its (R)-enantiomer (23.6 μM) against B. cinerea. Molecular docking and transcriptome analysis reveal that M-12 achieves its antifungal effects by inhibiting Mps1 kinase, thereby suppressing fungal growth and virulence.	pesticide	melatonin, a multifunctional class of natural products, has demonstrated antifungal activity, making it a promising candidate for developing antifungal agents. the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mps1) within fungal pathogens has a target inhibitory effect of melatonin in fungi. we use a virtual screening strategy to design melatonin derivatives based on the melatonin-mps1 targeting model. of these, a multiflorane-substitution compound m-12 emerges as a potent antifungal agent, exhibiting broad-spectrum efficacy against eight phytopathogenic fungal species, and effectively reduces the severity of tomato gray mold, fusarium head blight in wheat, sclerotinia stem rot in rape, and peach brown rot. m-12 half-maximal effective concentration values (5.50 μm against botrytis cinerea, 5.21 μm against fusarium graminearum, 10.6 μm against rhizoctonia solani, and 9.02 μm against sclerotinia sclerotiorum) are better than those of commercial broad-spectrum fungicide azoxystrobin (55.0, 23.2, 46.5, and 17.7 μm, respectively). antifungal activity of enantiomer (s)-m-12 (5.02 μm) is significantly greater than its (r)-enantiomer (23.6 μm) against b. cinerea. molecular docking and transcriptome analysis reveal that m-12 achieves its antifungal effects by inhibiting mps1 kinase, thereby suppressing fungal growth and virulence.	antifungal, fungal, cinerea, fusarium, rot, broad-spectrum, kinase, agent, rape, sclerotiorum
9103	39381929	Metabolomic profiling of in vitro and in situ grown Nilgiris tea reveals unique signatures for breeding decaffeinated varieties.	This study was begun by establishing an in vitro culture in UPASI 9, a Nilgiris tea clone (Camellia sinensis) by optimising various factors. Anatomical studies demonstrated that use of lower carbendazim concentration for sterilisation (0.2%) produced viable and healthy explants for callus initiation. To confirm the genetic consistency of the regenerated plants, gene-specific SSR markers were developed and utilised. GC-MS was employed to analyse volatile metabolites extracted from callus, stem, micro shoots, and leaves of the UPASI 9 tea genotype. The results revealed distinct compositions of metabolites in each sample. More interestingly, caffeine was exclusively detected in leaf samples but absent in all other investigated tissues, despite the presence of Tea Caffeine Synthase (TCS) gene-specific SSRs. Thus, this study provided unique information on the absence of caffeine in in vitro grown Nilgiris tea clone, UPASI 9, as decaffeinated tea has a unique niche in the global market.	pesticide	this study was begun by establishing an in vitro culture in upasi 9, a nilgiris tea clone (camellia sinensis) by optimising various factors. anatomical studies demonstrated that use of lower carbendazim concentration for sterilisation (0.2%) produced viable and healthy explants for callus initiation. to confirm the genetic consistency of the regenerated plants, gene-specific ssr markers were developed and utilised. gc-ms was employed to analyse volatile metabolites extracted from callus, stem, micro shoots, and leaves of the upasi 9 tea genotype. the results revealed distinct compositions of metabolites in each sample. more interestingly, caffeine was exclusively detected in leaf samples but absent in all other investigated tissues, despite the presence of tea caffeine synthase (tcs) gene-specific ssrs. thus, this study provided unique information on the absence of caffeine in in vitro grown nilgiris tea clone, upasi 9, as decaffeinated tea has a unique niche in the global market.	tea, caffeine, clone, leaf, unique, metabolite, vitro, analyse, anatomical, volatile
9104	39393466	Pharmacology and molecular modeling studies of sulfoxaflor, flupyradifurone and neonicotinoids on the human neuronal α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.	We conducted electrophysiological and molecular docking studies using a heterologous expression system (Xenopus oocytes) to compare the effects of four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam), one sulfoximine, (sulfoxaflor), and one butenolide (flupyradifurone), on human α7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). All neonicotinoids (except thiamethoxam), as well as the recently introduced nAChR competitive modulators, flupyradifurone and sulfoxaflor, appear to be weaker agonists than acetylcholine. Two mutations in loop C (E211N and E211P) and one mutation in loop D (Q79K), known to be involved in the binding properties of neonicotinoids were introduced to the α7 wild type. Interestingly, the acetylcholine and nicotine-evoked activation was not modified in human α7 mutated receptors, but the net charge was enhanced for clothianidin and imidacloprid, respectively. Flupyradifurone responses strongly increased under the Q79K mutation. The molecular docking investigations demonstrated that the orientations and interactions of the ligands considered were in accordance with those observed experimentally. Specifically, the charged fragments of acetylcholine and nicotine, used as reference ligands, and their neonicotinoid homologs were found to be surrounded by aromatic residues, with key interactions with Trp171 and Y210. Furthermore, the molecular docking investigations predicted the water-mediated interaction between the carbonyl oxygen of acetylcholine and the Nsp2 nitrogen of the pyridine ring for nicotine (as well as for the majority of the corresponding neonicotinoid fragments) and main chain NH of L141. The docking scores, extending over a significant range of 6 kcal/mol, showed that most neonicotinoids were poorly stabilized in the α7 nAChR compared to acetylcholine, except sulfoxaflor.	pesticide	we conducted electrophysiological and molecular docking studies using a heterologous expression system (xenopus oocytes) to compare the effects of four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam), one sulfoximine, (sulfoxaflor), and one butenolide (flupyradifurone), on human α7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs). all neonicotinoids (except thiamethoxam), as well as the recently introduced nachr competitive modulators, flupyradifurone and sulfoxaflor, appear to be weaker agonists than acetylcholine. two mutations in loop c (e211n and e211p) and one mutation in loop d (q79k), known to be involved in the binding properties of neonicotinoids were introduced to the α7 wild type. interestingly, the acetylcholine and nicotine-evoked activation was not modified in human α7 mutated receptors, but the net charge was enhanced for clothianidin and imidacloprid, respectively. flupyradifurone responses strongly increased under the q79k mutation. the molecular docking investigations demonstrated that the orientations and interactions of the ligands considered were in accordance with those observed experimentally. specifically, the charged fragments of acetylcholine and nicotine, used as reference ligands, and their neonicotinoid homologs were found to be surrounded by aromatic residues, with key interactions with trp171 and y210. furthermore, the molecular docking investigations predicted the water-mediated interaction between the carbonyl oxygen of acetylcholine and the nsp2 nitrogen of the pyridine ring for nicotine (as well as for the majority of the corresponding neonicotinoid fragments) and main chain nh of l141. the docking scores, extending over a significant range of 6 kcal/mol, showed that most neonicotinoids were poorly stabilized in the α7 nachr compared to acetylcholine, except sulfoxaflor.	acetylcholine, docking, sulfoxaflor, neonicotinoids, nachr, mutation, loop, nicotine, interaction, molecular
9105	39399211	Cytotoxicity induced by three commercial neonicotinoid insecticide formulations in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.	Background: Neonicotinoid insecticides are used worldwide for crop protection. They act as agonists at postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), disrupting normal neurotransmission in target insects. Human exposure is high due to the widespread use of neonicotinoids and their residues in food. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro neurotoxicity of three neonicotinoid commercial formulations Much 600 FS® (imidacloprid 600 g L-1), Evidence 700 WG® (imidacloprid 700 g kg-1), and Actara 250 WG® (thiamethoxam 250 g kg-1) in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Methods: Cells were incubated with the pesticides for 96 h, and the cytotoxicity was evaluated through the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium·bromide (MTT) reduction and neutral red (NR) uptake assays. Toxicological pathways such as reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell death mode, and the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were also evaluated. Results: EC50 values of 266.4, 4,175, and 653.2 mg L-1 were found for Much®, Evidence® and Actara®, respectively. Significant increases in ROS and RNS generation were observed for all pesticides, while mitochondrial membrane potential and Bax protein expression showed no significant changes. Analysis of cell death mode revealed an increase in early apoptotic cells. Conclusion: Therefore, neonicotinoid insecticides are potentially neurotoxic, reinforcing concerns about human exposure to these commercial formulations.	pesticide	background: neonicotinoid insecticides are used worldwide for crop protection. they act as agonists at postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs), disrupting normal neurotransmission in target insects. human exposure is high due to the widespread use of neonicotinoids and their residues in food. this study aimed to evaluate the in vitro neurotoxicity of three neonicotinoid commercial formulations much 600 fs® (imidacloprid 600 g l-1), evidence 700 wg® (imidacloprid 700 g kg-1), and actara 250 wg® (thiamethoxam 250 g kg-1) in differentiated human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cell line. methods: cells were incubated with the pesticides for 96 h, and the cytotoxicity was evaluated through the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium·bromide (mtt) reduction and neutral red (nr) uptake assays. toxicological pathways such as reactive oxygen (ros) and nitrogen species (rns) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell death mode, and the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein bax were also evaluated. results: ec50 values of 266.4, 4,175, and 653.2 mg l-1 were found for much®, evidence® and actara®, respectively. significant increases in ros and rns generation were observed for all pesticides, while mitochondrial membrane potential and bax protein expression showed no significant changes. analysis of cell death mode revealed an increase in early apoptotic cells. conclusion: therefore, neonicotinoid insecticides are potentially neurotoxic, reinforcing concerns about human exposure to these commercial formulations.	neonicotinoid, cell, bax, ro, mitochondrial, formulation, mode, commercial, human, imidacloprid
9106	39406000	Mutations in target gene confers resistance to acetolactate synthase inhibitors in Echinochloa phyllopogon.	Echinochloa phyllopogon is a noxious weed that can harm rice over prolonged periods. Recently, a penoxsulam-resistant variant of E. phyllopogon with a mutation in the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene was collected in Northeastern China. In the present study, the molecular mechanism underlying herbicide resistance in mutant populations was evaluated. The GR50 and IC50 values of the herbicide-resistant mutant 1-11 were 27.0- and 21.4-fold higher than those of the susceptible population 2-31, respectively. In addition, pre-application of malathion reduced the GR50 value of the resistant population. Additionally, mutant populations developed cross-resistance to other ALS inhibitors. E. phyllopogon ALS sequencing showed a Trp-574-Leu mutation in ALS2 variant 1-11. Molecular docking showed that the Trp-574-Leu substitution reduced the number of hydrogen bonds and altered the interaction between penoxsulam and ALS2. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring the ALS2 mutant gene also showed resistance to penoxsulam and other ALS inhibitors. Overall, our study demonstrated that the Trp-574-Leu mutation and P450-mediated metabolic resistance lead to the cross-resistance of E. phyllopogon to ALS inhibitors.	pesticide	echinochloa phyllopogon is a noxious weed that can harm rice over prolonged periods. recently, a penoxsulam-resistant variant of e. phyllopogon with a mutation in the acetolactate synthase (als) gene was collected in northeastern china. in the present study, the molecular mechanism underlying herbicide resistance in mutant populations was evaluated. the gr50 and ic50 values of the herbicide-resistant mutant 1-11 were 27.0- and 21.4-fold higher than those of the susceptible population 2-31, respectively. in addition, pre-application of malathion reduced the gr50 value of the resistant population. additionally, mutant populations developed cross-resistance to other als inhibitors. e. phyllopogon als sequencing showed a trp-574-leu mutation in als2 variant 1-11. molecular docking showed that the trp-574-leu substitution reduced the number of hydrogen bonds and altered the interaction between penoxsulam and als2. transgenic arabidopsis plants harboring the als2 mutant gene also showed resistance to penoxsulam and other als inhibitors. overall, our study demonstrated that the trp-574-leu mutation and p450-mediated metabolic resistance lead to the cross-resistance of e. phyllopogon to als inhibitors.	al, mutant, mutation, population, cross-resistance, inhibitor, variant, resistance, showed, molecular
9107	39411656	Genome-wide association study reveals the genetic basis of rice resistance to three herbicides.	Crop resistance to herbicides is crucial for agricultural productivity and sustainability amidst escalating challenges of weed resistance. Uncovering herbicide resistant genes is particularly important for rice production. In this study, we tested the resistance to three commonly used herbicides: glufosinate, glyphosate and mesotrione of 421 diverse rice cultivars and employed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to unravel the genetic underpinnings of resistance to these three herbicides in rice. We discovered that cultivated rice exhibited rich variation in resistance to the three herbicides, and the differences among subpopulations were significant. Six identified associations harboring candidate genes for resistance to these herbicides were significant. Among them, RGlu6 and RGly8 were the major QTL for resistance to glufosinate and glyphosate, respectively. The favorable alleles of RGlu6 and RGly8 were primarily present in japonica cultivars that originated from Europe, highlighting the geographic and genetic diversity of herbicide resistance and emphasizing the localized selection pressures in European rice varieties. Moreover, our findings might suggest that traditional target genes may not contain tolerant alleles in nature, and alternative mechanisms with novel loci associated with resistance may work. By mapping the genes for herbicide resistance, our results may help develop new strategies to combat the dual challenges on effective weed management and herbicide sustainability.	pesticide	crop resistance to herbicides is crucial for agricultural productivity and sustainability amidst escalating challenges of weed resistance. uncovering herbicide resistant genes is particularly important for rice production. in this study, we tested the resistance to three commonly used herbicides: glufosinate, glyphosate and mesotrione of 421 diverse rice cultivars and employed genome-wide association studies (gwas) to unravel the genetic underpinnings of resistance to these three herbicides in rice. we discovered that cultivated rice exhibited rich variation in resistance to the three herbicides, and the differences among subpopulations were significant. six identified associations harboring candidate genes for resistance to these herbicides were significant. among them, rglu6 and rgly8 were the major qtl for resistance to glufosinate and glyphosate, respectively. the favorable alleles of rglu6 and rgly8 were primarily present in japonica cultivars that originated from europe, highlighting the geographic and genetic diversity of herbicide resistance and emphasizing the localized selection pressures in european rice varieties. moreover, our findings might suggest that traditional target genes may not contain tolerant alleles in nature, and alternative mechanisms with novel loci associated with resistance may work. by mapping the genes for herbicide resistance, our results may help develop new strategies to combat the dual challenges on effective weed management and herbicide sustainability.	herbicide, resistance, rice, cultivar, glufosinate, gene, weed, allele, challenge, glyphosate
9108	39411737	Serum 25 hydroxycholecalciferol in periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - A socioeconomic and clinicobiochemical study in Chhattisgarh.	Background: Very few studies have examined the impact of the concurrent presence of periodontitis (PD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on serum Vitamin D levels, particularly in developing nations like India, and needs further investigation. Aim: This study aims to assess the relationship between serum Vitamin D values and PD in T2DM patients and to study the correlation between socioeconomic and demographic variables that influence the serum Vitamin D levels and the extent of PD in patients with T2DM. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based research. Medical, dental, and diet histories were obtained from the participants, and their socioeconomic status (SES) was determined. Clinical parameters - plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), sites with gingival bleeding, probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were compared among three groups -patients with generalized Stage III Grade B PD with T2DM (n=35), patients with generalized stage III Grade B PD (n=35) and healthy controls (n=35) and the clinical parameters - plaque index(PI), gingival index(GI), sites with gingival bleeding, probing pocket depth(PPD), and clinical attachment level(CAL) were measured. Biochemical tests included the evaluation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH] D) and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels. Statistical Analysis: Periodontal and biochemical parameters were compared using a one-way analysis of variance across the three groups. The association between clinical parameters, SES, and 25(OH)D was examined using Pearson's correlation coefficient test and linear regression analysis. Results: The serum 25(OH)D levels were lowest in the subjects with generalized Stage III Grade B PD with T2DM (13.54 ± 3.31 ng/mL). Furthermore, there was a significant (P < 0.01) negative correlation between serum 25(OH)D and periodontal parameters, PI (-0.442), PPD (-0.474), CAL (-0.459), sites with gingival bleeding (-0.354), and GI (-0.346) among the groups. The regression analyses showed that an increase in periodontal parameters (PI, GI, PPD, and CAL) and a higher HbA1c was linked to a lower 25(OH)D. However, the periodontal parameters and 25(OH)D levels showed no correlation with socioeconomic and demographic parameters in the study. Conclusion: Serum Vitamin D values are negatively influenced by the synergistic effect of PD and T2DM or by the presence of PD alone. However, the association of SES on serum Vitamin D values in individuals with PD and T2DM or PD alone could not be demonstrated.	pesticide	background: very few studies have examined the impact of the concurrent presence of periodontitis (pd) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) on serum vitamin d levels, particularly in developing nations like india, and needs further investigation. aim: this study aims to assess the relationship between serum vitamin d values and pd in t2dm patients and to study the correlation between socioeconomic and demographic variables that influence the serum vitamin d levels and the extent of pd in patients with t2dm. materials and methods: this was a cross-sectional, hospital-based research. medical, dental, and diet histories were obtained from the participants, and their socioeconomic status (ses) was determined. clinical parameters - plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), sites with gingival bleeding, probing pocket depth (ppd), and clinical attachment level (cal) were compared among three groups -patients with generalized stage iii grade b pd with t2dm (n=35), patients with generalized stage iii grade b pd (n=35) and healthy controls (n=35) and the clinical parameters - plaque index(pi), gingival index(gi), sites with gingival bleeding, probing pocket depth(ppd), and clinical attachment level(cal) were measured. biochemical tests included the evaluation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25[oh] d) and hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) levels. statistical analysis: periodontal and biochemical parameters were compared using a one-way analysis of variance across the three groups. the association between clinical parameters, ses, and 25(oh)d was examined using pearson's correlation coefficient test and linear regression analysis. results: the serum 25(oh)d levels were lowest in the subjects with generalized stage iii grade b pd with t2dm (13.54 ± 3.31 ng/ml). furthermore, there was a significant (p < 0.01) negative correlation between serum 25(oh)d and periodontal parameters, pi (-0.442), ppd (-0.474), cal (-0.459), sites with gingival bleeding (-0.354), and gi (-0.346) among the groups. the regression analyses showed that an increase in periodontal parameters (pi, gi, ppd, and cal) and a higher hba1c was linked to a lower 25(oh)d. however, the periodontal parameters and 25(oh)d levels showed no correlation with socioeconomic and demographic parameters in the study. conclusion: serum vitamin d values are negatively influenced by the synergistic effect of pd and t2dm or by the presence of pd alone. however, the association of ses on serum vitamin d values in individuals with pd and t2dm or pd alone could not be demonstrated.	parameter, serum, vitamin, socioeconomic, generalized, bleeding, level, correlation, index, grade
9109	39427538	Soybean isoflavones protect dopaminergic neurons from atrazine damage by inhibiting VPS13A to increase autophagy.	Atrazine (ATR) is a broad-spectrum herbicide with dopaminergic (DAergic) neurotoxicity that can cause Parkinson's disease (PD)-like syndrome. However, research on preventing ATR neurotoxicity is unclear. Soybean isoflavones (SI) are natural plant compounds with neuroprotective effects. In this study, we found that pre-administration of SI prevented ATR-induced motor dysfunction and substantia nigra pathological damage. RNA-seq datasets revealed that the neuroprotective effect of SI was related to autophagy. Further experiments showed that ATR inhibited autophagy, and SI pre-administration before ATR exposure increased autophagy. In addition, single-cell data analysis combined with experimental verification showed that the gene VPS13A was a key target by which SI protected DAergic neurons from ATR damage, and inhibiting VPS13A-induced autophagy was a key mechanism enabling SI prevention of neuron damage. Together, these findings provide new insights for the development of preventive measures and intervention targets protecting against functional neuronal damage caused by ATR and other herbicides.	pesticide	atrazine (atr) is a broad-spectrum herbicide with dopaminergic (daergic) neurotoxicity that can cause parkinson's disease (pd)-like syndrome. however, research on preventing atr neurotoxicity is unclear. soybean isoflavones (si) are natural plant compounds with neuroprotective effects. in this study, we found that pre-administration of si prevented atr-induced motor dysfunction and substantia nigra pathological damage. rna-seq datasets revealed that the neuroprotective effect of si was related to autophagy. further experiments showed that atr inhibited autophagy, and si pre-administration before atr exposure increased autophagy. in addition, single-cell data analysis combined with experimental verification showed that the gene vps13a was a key target by which si protected daergic neurons from atr damage, and inhibiting vps13a-induced autophagy was a key mechanism enabling si prevention of neuron damage. together, these findings provide new insights for the development of preventive measures and intervention targets protecting against functional neuronal damage caused by atr and other herbicides.	atr, autophagy, damage, neuroprotective, neurotoxicity, neuron, key, herbicide, target, single-cell
