39022139	Genetically modified foods and food allergy.	Genetic modification of foods is one of the many ways of processing that can enhance foods to increase desirable qualities, such as herbicide tolerance, bacteria and insect resistance, improved nutritional value, and delayed ripening. However, a theoretical potential to increase the allergenicity of food proteins has been the subject of concern from critics. To prevent adverse effects from genetically modified (GM) crops, national and international organizations tightly regulate their production and recommend rigorous safety testing. Some safety tests were developed to assess potential allergenicity by studying the product's similarity to known allergenic proteins, its resistance to pepsin digestion, and its binding to immunoglobulin E (IgE) from sera of patients with known relevant allergies. To date, these safety assessments have only identified rare GM foods with the potential to lead to immunologic reactions. These foods were stopped from being marketed commercially, and the products on the market now have passed required safety assessments. The rise in the prevalence of food allergy preceded the commercialization of GM foods and has also occurred in countries with limited access to GM crops, which highlights a lack of causative association between the two. Several studies provided further reassurance with no evidence of higher potency in specific IgE binding to GM foods. There are no studies that demonstrate adverse reactions due to GM food consumption, and GM foods may have the beneficial potential to silence major allergenic proteins. Therefore, physicians and other health-care professionals should counsel patients that the scientific data do not support an increased risk of allergic responses to GM foods.

Its functional benefits also include improving liver function, regulating blood pressure, stress, and providing antioxidant activity. Usually, various agrochemicals are used in cultivating ginseng preventing from many diseases.
37746209	Discovery of a gene cluster for the biosynthesis of novel cyclic peptide compound, KK-1, in <i>Curvularia clavata</i>.	KK-1, a cyclic depsipeptide with 10 residues produced by a filamentous fungus <i>Curvularia clavata</i> BAUA-2787, is a promising pesticide active compound with high activity against many plant pathogens, especially <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. As a first step toward the future mass production of KK-1 through synthetic biological approaches, we aimed to identify the genes responsible for the KK-1 biosynthesis. To achieve this, we conducted whole genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis of <i>C. clavata</i> BAUA-2787 to predict the KK-1 biosynthetic gene cluster. We then generated the overexpression and deletion mutants for each cluster gene using our originally developed transformation system for this fungus, and analyzed the KK-1 production and the cluster gene expression levels to confirm their involvement in KK-1 biosynthesis. As a result of these, a region of approximately 71 kb was found, containing 10 open reading frames, which were co-induced during KK-1 production, as a biosynthetic gene cluster. These include <i>kk1B</i>, which encodes nonribosomal peptide synthetase with a domain structure that is consistent with the structural features of KK-1, and <i>kk1F</i>, which encodes a transcription factor. The overexpression of <i>kk1F</i> increased the expression of the entire cluster genes and, consequently, improved KK-1 production, whereas its deletion decreased the expression of the entire cluster genes and almost eliminated KK-1 production, demonstrating that the protein encoded by <i>kk1F</i> regulates the expressions of the other nine cluster genes cooperatively as the pathway-specific transcription factor. Furthermore, the deletion of each cluster gene caused a reduction in KK-1 productivity, indicating that each gene is involved in KK-1 production. The genes <i>kk1A</i>, <i>kk1D</i>, <i>kk1H</i>, and <i>kk1I</i>, which showed a significant decrease in KK-1 productivity due to deletion, were presumed to be directly involved in KK-1 structure formation, including the biosynthesis of the constituent residues. <i>kk1C</i>, <i>kk1E</i>, <i>kk1G</i>, and <i>kk1J</i>, which maintained a certain level of KK-1 productivity despite deletion, were possibly involved in promoting or assisting KK-1 production, such as extracellular transportation and the removal of aberrant units incorporated into the peptide chain.
37746201	How to improve the production of peptidyl compounds in filamentous fungi.	Peptidyl compounds produced by filamentous fungi, which are nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), are rich sources of bioactive compounds with a wide variety of structures. Some of these peptidyl compounds are useful as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. However, for industrial use, their low production often becomes an obstacle, and various approaches have been challenged to overcome this weakness. In this article, we summarize the successful attempts to increase the production of NRPs and RiPPs in filamentous fungi and present our perspectives on how to improve it further.
37746197	Chitosan and nematophagous fungi for sustainable management of nematode pests.	Plants are exposed to large number of threats caused by herbivores and pathogens which cause important losses on crops. Plant pathogens such as nematodes can cause severe damage and losses in food security crops worldwide. Chemical pesticides were extendedly used for nematode management. However, due to their adverse effects on human health and the environment, they are now facing strong limitations by regulatory organisations such as EFSA (European Food Safety Authority). Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative and efficient control measures, such as biological control agents or bio-based plant protection compounds. In this scenario, chitosan, a non-toxic polymer obtained from seafood waste mainly, is becoming increasingly important. Chitosan is the N-deacetylated form of chitin. Chitosan is effective in the control of plant pests and diseases. It also induces plants defence mechanisms. Chitosan is also compatible with some biocontrol microorganisms mainly entomopathogenic and nematophagous fungi. Some of them are antagonists of nematode pests of plants and animals. The nematophagous biocontrol fungus <i>Pochonia chlamydosporia</i> has been widely studied for sustainable management of nematodes affecting economically important crops and for its capability to grow with chitosan as only nutrient source. This fungus infects nematode eggs using hyphal tips and appressoria. <i>Pochonia chlamydosporia</i> also colonizes plant roots endophytically, stimulating plant defences by induction of salicylic and jasmonic acid biosynthesis and favours plant growth and development. Therefore, the combined use of chitosan and nematophagous fungi could be a novel strategy for the biological control of nematodes and other root pathogens of food security crops.
37674673	Fetal blockade of nicotinic acetylcholine transmission causes autism-like impairment of biological motion preference in the neonatal chick.	Several environmental chemicals are suspected risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including valproic acid (VPA) and pesticides acting on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), if administered during pregnancy. However, their target processes in fetal neuro-development are unknown. We report that the injection of VPA into the fetus impaired imprinting to an artificial object in neonatal chicks, while a predisposed preference for biological motion (BM) remained intact. Blockade of nAChRs acted oppositely, sparing imprinting and impairing BM preference. Beside ketamine and tubocurarine, significant effects of imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) appeared at a dose ≤1 ppm. In accord with the behavioral dissociations, VPA enhanced histone acetylation in the primary cell culture of fetal telencephalon, whereas ketamine did not. VPA reduced the brain weight and the ratio of NeuN-positive cells (matured neurons) in the telencephalon of hatchlings, whereas ketamine/tubocurarine did not. Despite the distinct underlying mechanisms, both VPA and nAChR blockade similarly impaired imprinting to biological image composed of point-light animations. Furthermore, both impairments were abolished by postnatal bumetanide treatment, suggesting a common pathology underlying the social attachment malformation. Neurotransmission via nAChR is thus critical for the early social bond formation, which is hindered by ambient neonicotinoids through impaired visual predispositions for animate objects.
37546169	Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the <i>doublesex</i> ( <i>dsx</i>) gene splice sites and relevance for its alternative splicing in the malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>.	<b>Background:</b> Malaria burden continues to be significant in tropical regions, and conventional vector control methods are faced with challenges such as insecticide resistance. To overcome these challenges, additional vector control interventions are vital and include modern genetic approaches as well as classical methods like the sterile insect technique (SIT). In the major human malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, a candidate gene favourable for sterility induction is the <i>doublesex</i> ( <i>dsx</i>) gene, involved in mosquitos' somatic sexually dimorphic traits determination. However, the pathways that trigger the signal of <i>dsx</i> gene exon skipping alternative splicing mechanism in anopheline mosquitoes are not well characterized. This study aims to screen the <i>An. gambiae dsx</i> gene splice site sequences for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could be critical to its alternative splicing. <b>Methods:</b> Variant annotation data from Ag1000G project phase 2 was analysed, in order to identify splice-relevant SNPs within acceptor and donor splice sites of the <i>An. gambiae dsx</i> gene ( <i>Agdsx</i>). <b>Results:</b> SNPs were found in both donor and acceptor sites of the <i>Agdsx</i>. No splice-relevant SNPs were identified in the female-specific intron 4 acceptor site and the corresponding region in males. Two SNPs (rs48712947, rs48712962) were found in the female-specific donor site of exon 5. They were not specific to either males or females as the rs48712947 was found in female mosquitoes from Cameroon, and in both males and females from Burkina Faso. In the other splice sites, the intron 3 acceptor site carried the greatest abundance of SNPs.   <b>Conclusions:</b> There were no gender association between the identified SNPs and the random distribution of these SNPs in mosquito populations. The SNPs in <i>Agdsx</i> splice sites are not critical for the alternative splicing. Other molecular mechanisms should be considered and investigated.
37529737	Photocatalytic degradation of aquatic organic pollutants with Zn- and Zr-based metal-organic frameworks: ZIF-8 and UiO-66.	Water treatment has been an essential issue with the increasing population over 40 years. Researchers center on the major organic pollutants, such as dyes, pesticides, and pharmaceutical products. Photocatalytic degradation is one of the promising methods for aquatic organic pollutant treatment. Over the years, scientists have been working on developments for photocatalysts to enhance their pollutant degradation performances. From the reviewed studies, it is seen that properties like surface area, chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability, and uniform distribution of active sites are crucial, and an increase in these properties provides better degradation efficiency. In this sense, metal-organic frameworks as photocatalysts can be considered more advantageous. This study focuses on the organic aquatic pollutant degradation studies by using well-known MOFs like ZIF-8 and UiO-66 photocatalysts. Mainly the organic dye (RhB, MB, MO, etc.) degradation efficiencies of ZIF-8 and UiO-66 have been achieved to 100%. Recently, the degradation capacities of various pharmaceuticals such as diazinon, acetaminophen, levofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole have also been investigated. According to the reviewed studies, ZIF-8 and UiO-66 can be considered remarkable photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants.
37224323	Situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in the upper northeast regions of Thailand.	<b>Background:</b> Agriculturists exposed to health hazards are affected by increased occupational disease. This retrospective study aimed to investigate situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in upper northeast Thailand. <b>Methods:</b> The secondary data of international classification of diseases 10 <sup>th</sup> revision (ICD-10) case reports of occupational disease among farmers, from the database of the Health Data Center (HDC), were used. The registered farmers data was collected as a dataset from the provincial agricultural office and the data of ICD-10 code utilised from the hospital information system (HIS) of healthcare services in Udon Thani and Roi-Et provinces, which was extracted for cases of work-related diseases and injuries of registered agriculturists. The annual morbidity rate of occupational diseases was analysed and presented at a rate per 100,000 farmers. <b>Results:</b> Among farmers in the HDC database, lung disease, which was not reported as occupational disease of the HDC database, was the highest ranking of all diseases, followed by work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, respectively, while the injury rate was as high as that of WMSDs. Those morbidity rates of Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces were representative of the morbidity ranking of diseases of the nation and had increasing trends from 2014 to 2016. The number of farmers in the HDC database did not consistently reflect the number of registered farmers in the agricultural database. <b>Conclusions:</b> Situations of work-related diseases and injuries discovered among registered farmers reflect the health problems of Thai agriculturists, and the underestimation in the reported disease rate in the health database is explained by big data analysis, which showed that work-related cases with an identifying code of Y96 had rarely been reported among agriculturists. Therefore, Thai agriculturists should be supported in registration with occupational diseases and injuries surveillance as holistic healthcare.
